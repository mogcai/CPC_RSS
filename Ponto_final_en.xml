In conversation with the final point, the author and former Journalist Catarina Mesquita, founder of the publisher Mandarina Books, explain that this is not a typical children's book: it was specifically designed to be read in family and raise a reflection on the parents about the importance of affection, love and mutual respect in the relationship they maintain with their children.
 
Once upon a time there was a happy boy who lived with his loving parents. Like any child of his age, he occasionally made traquinices and lied or refused to share. But parents did not punish him with spanking or verbal violence - instead they preferred to solve problems with communication, love and affection.
This is the proposal of the book “Seeds of Love”, by pediatrician Joana Morgado Bento: planting small seeds of respect and empathy - but a lot of love - in the hearts of parents around the world. The story is told in a verse in Portuguese and English, a decision that the founder of the publisher Mandarina Books, Catarina Mesquita, justifies with the intention of “reaching as much as possible”. The author corroborates: "This message is for everyone, not just for one culture or another."
Fernando Chan's illustrations are colorful and childish, referring directly to a children's audience. On the back cover, however, an unusual message arises: this “is a book of children for parents”, with a message that can be appreciated by the younger ones, but, above all, by those who take care of them. “It's a story for children, but there is also tips for parents. We want to give the message that, even with the difficulties of everyday life, we should focus on solutions, not so much in the rules, and practice a parenting we call positive,” explains Joana.
Positive parenting has gained more and more adherents in recent years, assuming itself as an alternative to physical punishment or punishment. Instead of reacting to the tantrums of children with shouts or spanks - options that, as the author recognizes, they can sometimes seem the most immediate and effective on tiring days - parents are invited to take a deep breath and try to understand children's perspective, value their thoughts and show affection. This does not mean, however, that positive education is synonymous with unlimited permissiveness: parents must fulfill their role as children and point to children's mistakes, but maintaining empathy and respect essential to any human interaction.
"When children have certain behaviors that parents consider untied, the first answer should not be punishment, punishment, consequence," he argues. "The answer must be, on the one hand, to try to realize why that behavior has happened. Often, it is not the child's direct fault, but the environment where it is inserted. On the other hand, so that the child learns not to repeat behavior, it is more useful to explain how it can improve with affection and love, instead of making her feel bad."
 
More than a book: a friend
 
International Children's Book Day is celebrated annually today, April 2, regarding the anniversary of Hans Christian Andersen. In a world where physical books are being replaced by screens and the "whys" by a less and lesser attention, literature for younger public is a weapon of "essential" knowledge in combating the harms of technology. The founder of Mandarina Books explains that the direction of the publisher is precisely to transmute the idea of ​​the book as an object that handles schools to "a friend, a companion, a tool that can clarify everyday questions"-finally, something "absolutely fundamental to the development of a child."
The correlation between a growing technology childhood and the inability to interpret basic texts in adolescence and adulthood has been the subject of numerous studies that outline a pessimistic portrait of coming generations. Joana is a “neuroconscious” pediatrician, as described in her social networks, and experience in the area allows her to state that children's exposure to literature is “essential” for the acquisition of a broad and rich vocabulary. “When parents often read their children, there is a huge positive difference in the acquisition of language domain, which later correlates with academic results,” he says.
The role of parents is especially relevant until “around eight years”, when children begin to autonomize and read alone, on their own initiative. Until then, “they have to be parents to foster this in children and to devote more time so they can acquire these capabilities and develop a taste for reading,” although the authors recognize that a daily reading session between parents and children is not always feasible. Among working hours and household responsibilities, reading habits end up being neglected and indefinitely postponed - because reading a book is not passive, but an activity that requires attention and interpretation on the part that holds it between hands.
“Currently, it seems to have things immediately in front of us, explicit and simplified. It can't be so. We have to be calm and observe. Is it asking the children: 'What's what is in front of you? How is this debate very important,” says Catarina, giving as an example the book itself now edited by mandarin Books. "Our book wants to raise a debate, because all children and parents can identify with the situations portrayed there."
Joana stresses that her expectation is precisely that the work is used by parents and children as a tool for union, dialogue and perhaps personal development. "As we know, children have fixations: every night they ask their parents to read them the same book, at least for a certain period. I would like each time their father or mother read this book to their children, their subconscious would be more alert to one or another modification they can make in their behavior for the benefit of the child." The author warns that her intention was not to write a "rigid" guide or an instruction book, but to share general suggestions with any father or mother who is willing to receive them. "This is not necessarily how one has to act, and each father will surely know how to deal with their children in the best way. This is just an idea - and there is a seed."

In a statement, the government of the former British colony accused Washington of trying to “intimidate leaders in charge of protecting China's national security”.
The sanctions, imposed on Monday, under an American law that defends democracy in the Special Chinese administrative region, aim at police commissioner Raymond Siu Chak-YEE, and Hong Kong Secretary Paul Lam Ting-Kwok. "This clearly exposed US barbarism under its hegemony, which is exactly the same as its recent intimidation and coercion tactics from various countries and regions," the Chinese government said.
Hong Kong Chief Executive, John Lee Ka-Chiu, was already subject to US sanctions, but the city's authorities ensured that "they are not intimidated by this negligible behavior."
The sanctions "demonstrate the commitment of the Trump administration in holding those who deprive Hong Kong residents of protected rights and freedoms or who commit acts of transnational repression on American soil or against American people," US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement.
The US State Department also showed the role of some of these employees in the efforts to “intimidate, silence and harass 19 pro-democracy activists” who fled abroad, including a US citizen and four residents in the US.
The Hong Kong government has described the people mentioned by the United States as fugitives with capture warrants, but "not because they have exercised their freedom of expression." They “continue to be blatantly involved in activities that endanger national security, including inciting secession and requesting foreign countries to impose 'sanctions' or blockages and get involved in other hostile activities” against China and Hong Kong, the statement said. "The US defamed and deliberately spread irresponsible comments on the measures and actions taken by the Government (…), in an attempt to deceive the public," Hong Kong authorities lamented.
US sanctions have the effect of freezing the goods of all these individuals in the United States and the prohibition of any financial transactions with the targets. "The US has ignored the principle of non -interference under international law, interfering with internal affairs in other countries, enticing agents, instigating" colorful revolutions, "said the Hong Kong government.
Beijing imposed the National Security Act in the Hong Kong region in 2020, a year after massive and sometimes violent old manifestations.

In a lecture to the industrial and commercial sector held yesterday, the ruler said he is aware of the reduction of per capita expenses of visitors, and ensured more efforts to promote the community economy.
 
This year's government's financial revenues may fall short of expectations, the secretary admitted to the economy and finance. Tai Kin IP pointed out that game revenues, by March, failed to reach the expected monthly average established by the authorities of 20 billion Patacas.
Tai Kin IP recalled that gross game revenues from the first three months of the year reached 57.66 billion patacas, "remaining virtually unchanged in annual terms," ​​he said yesterday in a lecture to the industrial and commercial sector.
"The financial revenues of this year may not be as optimistic as expected," he warned. The secretary highlighted, in this case, the need to “seriously study the future economic situation” and “persist in the management of financial resources with prudence” based on the principle of maintenance of expenses within the limits of revenue.
Tai Kin IP, in his speech during the lecture, stressed that unilateralism and protectionism in the international context are growing. Global economic development is “facing many volatilities and uncertainties,” said Tai Kin IP, referring to being aware of his impact on Macao while a “highly open and highly open microeconomics”.
Although the number of Macao visitors has increased due to the new central government visa policies, there was a major change in visitors' standards and concepts. According to the secretary, the total expense of visitors reached 75.36 billion patacas by 2024, representing an annual increase of 5.8%, but the per capita expense of visitors fell 14.6% in annual terms to 2,157 patacas. That is, tourists are spending less, which has placed new challenges for local companies.
It is recalled that the Chief Executive had already mentioned the issue about the financial revenues of this year, and has also advanced in a meeting with an association that may not increase salary this year for civil servants. At the same time, the government leader said earlier that he will consider adjusting the form of attribution of the pecuniary reimbursement plan.
In the lecture, the secretary for the economy and finance also reiterated the determination to improve the business environment and provide support in the operation and development of companies. ensuring that the government will continue to raise the management capacity of small and medium enterprises through financial support, promotion of visitors, consumption and transformation of companies.
The executive said he had made several community activities with the installation of large devices, as well as consumer stimulation initiatives with distribution of benefits and draw coupons to boost the community economy.
The amplification of international connections is also one of the priorities of the present government. Tai Kin Kip led an official delegation that visited Spain, Portugal, Belgium and Monaco last month to explore opportunities for cooperation. "We will continue to reinforce cooperation margins with Portuguese and Spanish languages, as well as with other countries, strengthening exchange and international cooperation," he noted.
This lecture was organized by the Macao Commercial Association, where representatives of eight sectors also spoke, with 41 associations delivered written opinions.</description><pubDate>2025-04-02 01:02:35</pubDate></item><item><title>DSEDJ creates advisory group for young people who are patriots</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/04/02/dsedj-cria-grupo-consultivo-para-jovens-que-sao-patriotas/</link><description>Authorities are looking for young patriots to join the Young Advisory Group, a new body created to suggest to educational, professional and life -related educational policies. According to the Directorate of Youth Education and Development Services, members must “recognize the nuclear value of love for the homeland and Macau”, as well as other requirements such as having experience in social services.
 
The Directorate of Youth Education and Development Services (DSEDJ) is forming a youth advisory group and is in a member recruit process, namely young patriots from Macao.
The creation of the group Visa, according to DSEDJ, providing a platform that allows young people to “present their points of view and suggestions” on studies, employment, entrepreneurship, housing acquisition and individual development, as well as government policies and measures related to youth. Another focus of the group is to encourage young people to “participate in the development of the large bay and international affairs”.
Adherence to patriotism is one of the requirements that DSEDJ has established for the candidacy for members of the Advisory Group for Youth. According to information released, members must be young people from Macao aged 18 to 30 who "recognize the nuclear value of love for the country and Macao."
To be elements of the group, they must also “have experience in social services, especially in the field of youth”, “to be familiar with the government's juvenile policies and affairs” and “have good communication, understanding and analysis”.
Members may be recommended by juvenile associations and university students, or self-nominated by young people. One term is two years, renewable for once.
Registration has already started and ends on April 11. According to DSEDJ, young candidates will have to deliver necessary documents for analysis, and those who have passed in the preliminary selection will be able to participate in a simulated group meeting to be held at the end of this month to select members of the first young man's advisory group.
Authorities also point out that, under the group, members will participate in meetings, specific topics and exchange activities. "The government has always been working on a good job in the field of youth," DSEDJ reiterated in a statement, stressing to be creating the group to "hear the voices of young people more" and "increase channels of positive interaction between young people and the executive." He added that the creation of the group is articulated with Macao's youth political orientation to “reinforce social participation and integration into the nation's development” of young people.
DSEDJ said it believed that the group will help “create consensus between the MSAR government and young people, improving communication, interaction, and mutual trust between the two parts, and to better cultivate young qualified frames for the MSAR government”.
 
More than 170 students receive the formation of lifting the flag
 
A training on procedures of the National Flag Idar joined more than 170 students from seven higher education institutions and 35 secondary schools. The initiative was organized by the Directorate of Youth Education and Development Services (DSEDJ) and Macao garrison of the Chinese people's liberation army at the Taipa barracks last Saturday. In a press release, the DSEDJ highlights the promotion of patriotic education at different levels and hopes that, through the formation in raising the flag, students "learn about the symbols and meanings of the national flag and reinforced their sense of identity, belonging and pride in the country." During the activity, the participants attended the flag raising ceremony held by the Macao garrison, followed by the flag raising training, as well as a visit to the Military Museum and a knowledge session on the national flag, anthem and emblem.</description><pubDate>2025-04-02 01:03:13</pubDate></item><item><title>Number of complaints from civil servants fired last year</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/04/02/numero-de-queixas-dos-funcionarios-publicos-disparou-no-ano-passado/</link><description>Last year, 18 civil service workers filed a complaint about situations that they considered unfair in the exercise of their duties, revealed to the end of the complaint management committee presented by public services workers. In 2023, the commission had received only four complaints. Most cases registered last year had to do with “interpersonal communication problems and internal management”. Pereira Coutinho devalues ​​the work of this committee.
 
The Commission for the Management of Complaints presented by public services workers indicated to the final point that last year received 18 complaints from civil servants relating to situations that they considered unfair in the performance of their duties. In 2023, only four complaints had been filed and in 2022 were ten.
The body explains that most complaints received in 2024 focus on “interpersonal communication problems and internal management”, for example, “interpersonal conflicts, lack of clarity in working norms and instructions, as well as the environment and work equipment”. "The complaints filed reflect that contradictions accumulate due to a lack of communication or deficient communication," the commission warns.
In response to the end point, the body also points out that, “in addition to following the complaints raised by workers, the commission regularly receives their requests for clarification, helping them to analyze the contradictions and situations arising from work and relieve their emotions”. "Alongside this, the Commission provides training to the personnel responsible for treating public services complaints to help them better deal with contradictions and, consequently, reduce conflicts," says the body.
 
Coutinho says commission is “unaffected”
 
José Pereira Coutinho, deputy to the Legislative Assembly and president of the Macao Public Function Association (ATFPM), considers that the Commission for the Treatment of Complaints presented by public services workers is “unafable”, since cases dealt with by this organism “do not constitute the reality of the problems that occur within the civil service”. Despite the significant increase in complaints last year, Coutinho says that the cases received by the commission are "from Lana Caprina".
The associative leader notes that when public services workers find problems at work, or go to the ATFPM or resort to the courts by their own means. According to Pereira Coutinho, ATFPM receives “hundreds of cases” per year.
Coutinho also states that “it is not justified to pay quite high wages” to the members of this committee, since, according to the deputy, they do not usually meet. The ATFPM leader defends the application of a attendance system for each meeting of that committee that has three members: Leong IOK WA, President Kuong Iok Kao and Chan Hong. According to the order of the appointment of the members of this Commission, published in August 2023 in an official bulletin, the president currently receives 36,190 Patacas monthly, while the other members receive 31,960.</description><pubDate>2025-04-02 01:05:35</pubDate></item><item><title>CERN leader warns that Europe can be overcome by China in science</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/04/02/lider-de-cern-adverte-que-europa-pode-ser-ultrapassada-pela-china-na-ciencia/</link><description>The leader of the largest European physics laboratory said yesterday that the project of the largest particle collier is "on the good way," but warned that Europe can be exceeded by China if the financing is not approved.
If the Future Particle Color (FCC) project does not materialize, “there is a real risk that Europe loses its leadership in science, particularly in high energy particles and associated technologies, which would be a pity,” said Fabiola Gianotti, leader of the European Organization for Nuclear Investigation (CERN).
The project is well referred ”and“ so far no technical obstacle has been found, ”said CERN Director-General, who groups 23 European and Israel countries at the publication of the FCC feasibility report.
Hundred different scenarios were developed and analyzed before the excavation site was chosen: a 90.7 kilometers in a circle ring, at an average depth of 200 meters, with eight surface locations, of which seven in France and one in Switzerland, indicated CERN, in a statement.
The cost of building the Electrão -PoSitron collier -the first phase of the project, which includes the tunnel and all infrastructures -is estimated at over 15 billion euros.
The FCC should go into operation in the 2040s. “To make great progress in understanding the origin of the universe and the role played by the Higgs Boson in the first moments, the world scientific community needs a machine as powerful and rich in possibilities like FCC,” said Catherine Biscarat at the University of Toulouse.
Jean-Paul Burnet, responsible for FCC's technical infrastructure, said the project was “improved to reduce environmental impact”, namely by reducing the number of surface sites from 12 to eight.
The decision of the member countries-usually made by consensus-should be taken approximately by 2028.
Germany, the biggest taxpayer for the CERN budget, expressed reservations regarding the project funding last year.
The Environmental Association Noé21 denounced the project, in a report, “because it is disproportionate”, criticizing “high electricity consumption”, environmental impact and cost, as well as the size of the place and waste. "We have nothing against CERN. They have extraordinary machines, but we can't afford to do everything," said Jean-Bernard Billeter, engineer and author of the report.
The CO-CO-CO-Swiss collective, whose members include the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) and Greenpeace, has released a petition against “this gigantic project” to denounce the effects on the environment, budgets and local zones.</description><pubDate>2025-04-02 01:03:28</pubDate></item><item><title>Casinos' recipes grow, but fall short of government objectives</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/04/02/receitas-dos-casinos-crescem-mas-estao-aquem-dos-objectivos-do-governo/</link><description>In the first quarter, the casinos operating in Macao obtained gross revenues of 57.6 billion patacas, which corresponds to an increase of 0.6% compared to the same period last year. Still, this amount falls short of the Government's goal, which for this year expected 60 billion patacas per quarter.
 
The casinos operating in Macao fitted, in March, 19.6 billion of patacas, less 0.5% compared to February, but more 0.8% compared to March last year. The data were released yesterday by the Directorate of Inspection and Game Coordination (DICJ).
Cumulatively in the first three months of the year, the Macao game industry reached revenues of 57.6 billion patacas, which reveals a slight rise of 0.6% compared to the first quarter of last year.
The amount achieved in the first quarter of this year falls short of the government expected. The authorities put the goal for all this year in the 240 billion Patacas, which would imply that, every quarter, casinos fit 60 billion patacas. The objective set by the authorities means that, per month, casinos should make an average of 20 billion patacas, but so far no month has reached this value. February has been, so far, the best month of this year, with 19.7 billion Patacas.
The Macao Economic Association had already released a report that said that game revenues in the first quarter would not reach 60 billion patacas, also warning of “many uncertainties” in the economic conjuncture of the MSAR.
It is recalled that tax revenues from the game industry represent more than 80% of all of the MSAR tax revenues. The review of the Game Law, which came into force in 2022, stipulates that the concessionaires of the sector have to pay a direct tax of 35% of their revenues, plus an annual amount of 2% for a public fund and 3% more for urban development, tourism promotion and social security of MSc.
In 2024, gross game revenues ascended to 226.7 billion patacas, according to DICJ data. This figure exceeded government projections, which pointed to 216 billion, also meaning an increase of about 24% compared to the 183 billion of 2023.
The 2024 revenues were the highest of the last four years. In pandemic restrictions, 2020, 2021 and 2022, the gross revenues of the casino industry were 60.4 billion, 86.8 billion and 42.2 billion patacas, respectively. Before the pandemic, in 2019, the game sector had revenues of 292.4 billion patacas and in 2018 of 302.8 billion, for example. The annual gross game revenue record was beaten in 2013, when operators received more than 360 billion patacas.</description><pubDate>2025-04-02 01:04:56</pubDate></item><item><title>84 Provisional Licenses of Veterinarians and Commercial Animal Activities</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/04/02/emitidas-84-licencas-provisorias-de-veterinarios-e-actividades-comerciais-de-animais/</link><description>The Veterinary Clinical Care Law and Commercial Animal Activity came into force a year ago and provided for a transitional regime until March 31 this year. After this period, all veterinary clinical care establishments, reproduction, sale and accommodation of animals began to be required to obtain licenses before starting the exploitation of the activity. So far, according to the Institute for Municipal Affairs (IAM), 84 establishments have obtained provisional licenses.
There were 25 provisional licenses of veterinary clinical care establishment and 59 provisional licenses for the establishment of commercial animal activity, with a period of validity of two years. However, two commercial animal activity establishments were unable to obtain a license for lack of delivery of all legal documents and non -compliance with the requirements of the transient provisions, respectively.
These establishments must request license and affix it in a visible place. Holders of these establishments also have to comply with the activity instructions issued by AMI, "aimed at protecting animals, safeguarding health and public safety, as well as fulfilling their legal duties."
In a statement, AMI ensures that "it will continue to boost the functioning of the sector under the law and the ordered and healthy development, through daily supervision, promotion and awareness."

The Selangor State Fire Department (West) reported in a statement "an escape in a pipeline that extends for approximately 500 meters, with flames reaching a considerable height."
Seven residents, including two seniors, had to be rescued after several houses were burned and many other dwellings were evacuated.
The Selangor catastrophe management unit said in a statement that the fire spread to several houses in a nearby village, and efforts are being made to rescue the arrested residents.
The unit added that several people suffered burns and were taken for treatment, but the total extent of damages is being evaluated, and said the gas supply to the installation was cut.
Three fuel supply posts near the fire site were not affected, but were temporarily closed as a precautionary measure, Petronas said, adding that investigations are still underway.
Residents who celebrated EID, a Muslim holiday that marks the end of the sacred period of Ramadão and is observed as a public holiday in Malaysia, where Islam is the majority religion, were forced to flee the area. "Suddenly we heard a big crash and then total chaos," said one person who lived 200 meters from the fire, quoted by The Star.

Cooperation with Moscow will be “certainly renewed with a new vitality and will enter a new phase,” said Wang, according to France-Presse (AFP) news agency. Lavrov has set out for relations between the two countries reached "a new level" and said they will continue to develop "on all fronts." "We also see the responsibility of Moscow and Beijing to maintain close coordination in the international arena," said Lavrov, quoted by the Spanish agency Efe. "The countries of the world majority are certainly the most important factor of stabilization in these difficult times in the development of world politics," he added. Lavrov said he would discuss with Wang the preparations for the meeting between Russian presidents Vladimir Putin, and Chinese, Xi Jinping in Moscow on the 80th anniversary of the Red Army's victory over Nazi Germany on May 9. "The meetings between Putin and Xi always give an important impetus to the development of bilateral relations," said Lavrov. The Chinese minister said Beijing is willing to work with Moscow "to contribute to a multipolar world and to the democratization of international relations."
Wang Yi visit Moscow this week for conversations not only with Lavrov, but also with Putin. Diplomatic and economic cooperation between Beijing and Moscow has intensified in recent years, especially after the Russian attack on Ukraine in February 2022 and sanctions against Russia. China presents itself as a neutral part in the conflict and states that it does not provide lethal weapons to either party, unlike the United States and several European countries. Beijing remains a political and economic ally of Moscow, to the point that the countries of NATO have described China as a "decisive facilitator" of the Russian attack. Chinese authorities have never condemned Russia for invading Ukraine. "We will work together to contribute even more to the cause of peace and human development," Wang said during the meeting with Lavrov.</description><pubDate>2025-04-02 01:03:25</pubDate></item><item><title>Expected greater cooperation between Macau and Sichuan</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/04/02/esperada-maior-cooperacao-entre-macau-e-sichuan/</link><description>Tian Xiangli, president of the Chinese people's Political Advisory Conference (CCPPC) of Sichuan province, was received in Macau by Sam Hou Fai.

Myanmar's “alternative” government-composed of pro-democracy politicians, activists and ethnic minority leaders-said, on the Facebook social network account, that 8,562,555 people were affected by the magnitude 7,7 earthquake. Nug indicated that more than 2,400 people died and "thousands were injured."
The military junta that has had power since the 2021 coup said on Monday that 2,056 people were killed and more than 3,900 were injured.
The opposition has called for the UN and the Association of Southeast Asia (Asean) states to ensure that humanitarian aid be delivered directly to the victims who urgently need without interference, accusing the Board of using it for its benefit in the context of armed conflict. "This tragedy is also aggravated by the continuous air attacks of the board, even in the aftermath of the catastrophe, which make urgent humanitarian efforts difficult. The people of Myanmar desperately need immediate support and the solidarity of the international community are more crucial than ever," said Nug.
The group said on Monday that international relief teams came only to a few affected areas of the capital, Naypyidaw, and Mandalay (the second largest city and one of the hardest), but that other destroyed zones still need help.
The opposition has gone away with the help provided so far, with donations by sending teams to the ground of Australia, Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, India, Japan, Ireland, Malaysia, Norway, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, United Kingdom, United States, Vietnam, UN and EU.
The UN estimated that about 20 million people, one third of the population, were directly or indirectly affected by the earthquake and, on Monday, said the size of the catastrophe was still uncertain.</description><pubDate>2025-04-02 01:05:57</pubDate></item><item><title>Constitutional Court decides on Friday about dismissal of the South Korean President</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/04/02/tribunal-constitucional-decide-na-sexta-feira-sobre-destituicao-do-presidente-sul-coreano/</link><description>South Korea will issue the decision on the dismissal of South Korean President Yoon Suk-Youol, due to the declaration of the Martial Law in December.
 
The South Korea Constitutional Court announced yesterday that it will issue the decision on the dismissal of South Korean President Yoon Suk-Youol on Friday, due to the statement of martial law in December. The decision will be announced at 11:00 local at the Court's headquarters in Seoul.
The event will be broadcast live on television, with the presence of the public, on a day that will be able to mark a new turbulent turbulent point of recent political history in the country.
The polarization around the case has been intense. Thousands of people have participated in demonstrations in favor and against the suspended president since their dismissal.
Police will activate the maximum emergency level and mobilize all operational ones on the day of the Constitutional Court's decision, the authorities announced.
There is concerns about a possible repetition of the incident similar to that of January 19, when Yoon supporters invaded Seoul's Western District Court to protest the decision to prolong the detention of the politician.
Two scenarios are possible: either judges decide to ratify the motion and permanently remove the title to the president-which requires six votes from the eight judges-or restore it in power.
If the Constitutional Court confirms Yoon's dismissal, South Korea will have to call early presidential elections within 60 days.
An election in which the favorite clear would be opposition leader Lee Jae-Myung, acquitted last Wednesday, in appeal, in a case that could have cost his political eligibility.
On March 24, the Constitutional Court rejected a request for dismissal of the Prime Minister Han Duck-Soo, making him interim president again until Yoon's sentence is known. "Han's dismissal process was rejected by five votes against one by the eight judges of the Court," said South Korean news agency Yonhap. Han had been suspended by the deputies in December after a short initial transition period.
The decision on Han is the first time the court has commented on a case related to Yoon's short -term martial law decree.
The National Assembly approved the resignation of Yoon on December 14, 11 days after the statement of martial law, in response, according to the president, to an alleged internal threat linked to the opposition. The measure, widely rejected even by party members who supported Yoon, led to an unprecedented invasion of Parliament by the army. Since then, Yoon has been suspended from office, although it is formally as president.
Yoon was arrested in January as a separate criminal investigation on accusations of insurrection-the only crime for which a South Korean president has no immunity-but was released in March after courts decided that the detention exceeded the legally allowed period.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said at a press conference that military exercises "constitute a serious warning and a powerful deterrent to separatist forces."
"Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chinese territory" and island -related issues "are a purely internal issue of China that does not admit any external interference," he said. "Progressive Democratic Party authorities (DPP) stubbornly insist on their pro-independence," the spokesman added, warning that "they are condemned to failure." Guo stated that "the historical tendency of China's" reunification "is unstoppable."
China yesterday announced the beginning of new military exercises around Taiwan with army units, navy, air force and rocket force to "approach the island from various directions" and "issue a serious warning to separate forces seeking independence."
Taiwan leader William Lai ordered yesterday to security and defense departments to respond to “rigorously” to China's new military maneuvers around the island, official sources said.
In a statement, Taiwanese government spokeswoman Karen Kuo stressed that all agencies involved maintain “total control” about these exercises, which were launched yesterday by the Chinese army as a serious warning to Taiwan's “separatist forces”.
Kuo denounced Beijing's recent “unilateral actions” in the Taiwan Strait and the Indo-Pacific for “mineting regional security and stability”, increasing tensions and challenging the international order “blatantly”.
"The government vehemently condemns this behavior, which has led the international community to widely recognize China as a cause of problems," Kuo said, adding that regional peace and stability are a "shared responsibility" between the two sides of Taiwan's Strait. "Taiwan's determination to safeguard peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait remains unchanged," the spokesman said, installing China "to return to a rules-based international order and to contribute to the region's safety, stability and prosperous development."
The command of the Chinese Armed Forces Operations Theater announced yesterday that it is conducting new maneuvers around Taiwan, involving units of the army, navy, aviation and force of rockets to “approach the island from various directions” and “issue a serious warning to the separatist forces seeking independence” of the territory. "These exercises focus mainly on patrols of sea combat readiness, attacks on sea and land targets and blockages in key areas and sea routes, to test the joint operations capacity of our troops," the command of the Chinese Wechat social network.
The exercises are held two and a half weeks after William Lai gave one of his hardest speeches against China, announcing 17 measures, including the restoration of military courts and a rigorous analysis of the visits of Chinese citizens to Taiwan, to counteract the one he described as a campaign of Beijing's “infiltration” in Taiwanese territory.
For the first time, the ruler classified China as "hostile external force," which was interpreted by some analysts as a change in policies defended by his predecessor, Tsai Ing-wen (2016-2024), and as an attempt to change Taiwan status.
China has warned that efforts to promote Taiwan's independence will result in “war” after launching large -scale exercises that simulate an island blockade. "Taiwan's independence means war and the promotion of Taiwan's independence means pushing the people of Taiwan to a dangerous situation of armed conflict," said Zhu Fenglian, the Taiwan Cabinet spokesman-responsible for Chinese Communist Party policies in relation to Taiwan-in a statement.

Ishiba told reporters that he is willing to fly to the US to negotiate directly with US President Donald Trump. "I don't mind going to Washington if necessary," he said. "Japan explained to the US that it is the country's leading investor and asked to be excluded from taxes," the prime minister reiterated at a press conference.
The US will start charging 25% tariffs on car imports on Thursday. Tariffs should be widened to car parts in the coming weeks.
Japan was unable to obtain any exemption despite the status of the largest US ally in Asia.
Tariffs are a concern for Japan and large car manufacturers like Toyota Motor Corp. and the Honda Motor CO, whose exports to the United States are a major driver of the Japanese economy.
A quarterly poll from Banco do Japan, released yesterday, showed that the business feeling among the major manufacturers got worse in the last quarter, for the first time in a year.
Ishiba said the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Finance, are working on "day and night" to negotiate with US counterparts to solve the problem. "When the overview comes and judges that it is appropriate to go, I will do so without hesitation," said the prime minister, in reference to a possible trip to Washington.
If tariffs are imposed, Ishiba said the government will do whatever it is necessary to minimize the impact on Japanese industries and jobs.
As short -term measures, the government plans to create a thousand consultation sites across the country to respond to the concerns of small and medium -sized car parts and other manufacturers that would be affected by the increase in US tariffs.
In case of damage to real companies, the government will do their best to support entrepreneurs with financial difficulties, said Ishiba.
The prime minister admitted to imposing fees on retaliation, but stressed that he first would have to discuss “details of corrective measures” with the government coalition.
On Sunday, Japan, South Korea and China announced that they intend to reinforce cooperation and provide a “predictable environment” to companies and accelerate negotiations on a free trade agreement that responds to the uncertainties caused by the US.
Discussions about this agreement began in 2013 and continued until 2019, when they stagnated, and was relaunched in 2024.
The tripartite meeting appears a few days before the imposition, from April 2, of customs of customs of 25% on imported cars for the United States.

This event marks the beginning of the series “Ephemera - Women Narratives in Contemporary Images”, promoted by Macau Art for All Society (AFA), and will be open to the public until June 28. The works will board visitors in a visual journey that explores the nuances of identity, urban space and solitude in a rapid transformation world.
 
Macao Art for All Society (AFA), under the guidance of curator Alice Kok, will present the series “Dreamscape Macao” by Alice Im. A carefully elaborated collection over five years and which is made up of 45 works that address the complexity of female experience in the city. With the opening ceremony scheduled for April 11, the exhibition will open to the general public from the next day, in line with the neighboring gallery that will exhibit photographic works of the Halftone Association, under the theme “Spirit of China”.
In a more abstract and minimal direction, the two alices worked together to present an intimate and relevant project to the theme of female narratives in contemporary imagery. Previously, Alice Im's works were shown at international festivals, such as the Pingyao International Photography Festival and Dali International Photography Festival, receiving great compliment from expert critics. The new exhibition represents a significant return to its homeland, being the first local exhibition of his work, especially notable for his location at Shopppes at Parisian.
Alice im is not limited to documenting the city; His work is a projection of his inner world, a reflection on the vulnerability of life in the face of natural forces, as well as the relationship between survival and death. According to the artist's description, the strength of “Dreamscape Macao” lies in the boldness of herself to insert themselves into the compositions, wrapped in hotel robes and towels, which act as symbols of ephemerality and anonymity. This presence, although ethereal, evokes a tension between the individual and the collective, the place and the tourist, revealing the complexity of being a woman in an environment full of paradoxes.
The figure immersed in the whiteness of the robe appears in contrasting spaces, from abandoned buildings to shining casinos and quiet beaches. As Curator Alice Kok mentions, "in this border space between existence and absence, belonging and alienation," Dreamscape Macao "emerges as a deep visual meditation on identity and place." The artist becomes an observer that captures the city with a sober look, while seeking a sense of protection against the anxiety of its interactions in urban life.
Through the systematic exploitation of contradictory places, Alice im builds a psychological panorama of Macao that is hardly perceived by tourists. Its hidden figure symbolizes not only service workers, often invisible in the tourist city, but also the identity dynamics that affect locations amid growing marketing. According to the curator's text, the images question what it means to live in a space where each corner and each street carry memories and stories of a constantly changing society.
“Dreamscape Macao” is also inserted in the theory of “psychogeography”, which suggests that cities are more than physical environments; They are domains for an emotional and psychological projection. By reinterpreting Macau as a space not only geographical, but also mental, Alice im invites the audience to see the city as a map of emotions - a concept that challenges the limitations of daily life. Its exploration of urban spaces, as the curator highlights, transits between the real and the illusory, allowing the public to glimpse "our own shadows within urban spaces."
The use of counterpoint and symmetry in their compositions convey a sense of stagnation and loneliness, while the distance to which their images emphasize the small dimension of the human being in relation to vast urban structures. Many of these photographs were taken at night, at a time when “the quality of light seems to turn through several states”, giving a dream quality that further deepens the experience. Alice im crossing through the city, dressed in a robe, challenges the viewer to reexamine not only Macau, but also the very relationship with the space they inhabit.
Ultimately, “Dreamscape Macao” is not just an art exhibition, but an invitation to introspection and dialogue about our own experiences and perceptions. By reflecting on the alienation and confusion of identity that many feel, Alice implies a rediscovery path of the relationships we maintain with the cities we inhabit. Through a critical and sensitive look, the artist turns the familiar into something extraordinary, challenging us to observe the world around us from a new form. As Guy Debord said, "When freedom is practiced in a closed circle, it fades into a dream, it becomes a mere image of itself." The “Dreamscape Macao” exhibition will be evident until June 28 and the entrance is free.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Chief Executive challenges Zhongshan companies to take advantage of Macau</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/04/02/chefe-do-executivo-desafia-empresas-de-zhongshan-a-aproveitarem-vantagens-de-macau/</link><description>Sam Hou Fai received, on Monday afternoon, Guo Wenhai, secretary of the Zhongshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and president of the Permanent Committee of the Zhongshan Municipal Popular Assembly.
