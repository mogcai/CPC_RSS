The case was registered with a 41 -year -old woman, a non -resident worker, who in the meantime has improved due to medical treatment.
On May 21, the woman checked swelling and pain in the left armpit and, that night, presented high fever and dizziness. Three days later, he resorted to a private clinic for medical treatment, however, the symptoms did not improve. On the 28th, resorted to treatment at Kiang Wu Hospital. During the medical examination, a painless scaram was detected, about the size of a green mungo beans, and swollen and painful lymphatic glands in the left armpit.
Health services pointed out that their clinical status showed improvements after medical treatment. According to vital symptoms and signs, the patient's clinical diagnosis is tsutsugamushi disease. Currently, the patient no longer has a fever and the situation of the disease has improved.
Sanitary authorities explain that tsutsugamushi disease is an acute infectious disease caused by the bite of larvae with orientia tsutsugamushi. The rodents (rats) that exist in the jungles with high temperature and moisture, covered with herbs constitute the natural habitat and multiplication of orientia tsutsugamushi. Its larvae can be infected when parasitizing rats, and if people are chopped by the larvae with orientia tsutsugamushi that exist in the jungles may become sick.
Symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, rash and has a special feature: the larva bite site forms a painless one with a hole in the center. If it is not treated immediately, a small number of patients can develop serious complications, including pneumonia, encephalitis and myocarditis, resulting in respiratory failure, shock and even death, with a mortality rate up to 60% of affected patients. To date, there is no vaccine to prevent it and antibiotic administration is the most effective treatment.</description><pubDate>2025-06-03 06:10:14</pubDate></item><item><title>Chinese government urges automotive companies to cease price war</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/06/03/governo-chines-insta-empresas-automoveis-a-cessarem-guerra-de-precos/</link><description>The Chinese government urged auto companies to stop price wars that, according to authorities, threaten the health and sustainable development of industry in the world's largest car market.
The Ministry of Industry and Information Technologies (MIIT) warned that these “disordered” competition strategies severely affected the normal operation of the sector and its profitability, especially in the segment of electric vehicles. "There are no winners in a price war, let alone in the future," said a ministry spokesman, according to the official news agency Xinhua.
The warning follows a new round of discounts launched on May 23 by a major manufacturer - officially unidentified - and followed by industry giants such as BYD, Geely and Chery.
Discounts included, in the case of BYD, incentives that reduce the price of its Seagull model to 55,800 yuan.
The Chinese Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) has also launched an appeal on Saturday to end price wars, stating that they run their investment in research and development, impair product quality and can even compromise vehicle safety.
In a statement, CAAM warned that this “involving 'type competition” - a term used in China to describe self -destructive dynamics in high competition pressure sectors - generated panic in the market.
Authorities have announced measures to reinforce market supervision, combat unfair competition practices and promote a “fair and ordained” business environment.
Predicted actions include random quality inspections, low cost sales restrictions and greater cooperation between regulatory agencies.
MIIT also encouraged companies to improve their innovation capacity, increase the quality of their products and services, and to fulfill their social responsibilities.</description><pubDate>2025-06-03 06:10:51</pubDate></item><item><title>Fatal point 2025.06.03</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/06/03/ponto-fatal-2025-06-03/</link><description>The Chinese government urged auto companies to stop price wars that, according to authorities, threaten the health and sustainable development of industry in the world's largest car market.

The director of tourism services, Helena de Senna Fernandes, said that the body she leads has been working with several companies to correspond to this increase in Korean tourists.
 
South Korean tourism in Macao fired in 2025, even rising to first place in terms of international visitors for exchange with the Philippines. The number of flights, however, is still a little short of expectations, but the direction of tourism services (STD) has ensured that it is working to correspond to this climb.
"Before the pandemic there were 65 direct flights from South Korea to Macao, and nowadays we are talking about 35. There is still a big margin to work, and I think with more work, and with more people wanting to visit Macau, there is a possibility to add more flights. We are working with all companies that fly directly to Macao da Korea," said Helena de Senna Fernandes.
On the sidelines of a street promotion organized by STD held in Seoul, Senna Fernandes said that this increase of South Korea visitors by 2025 “was very positive”, and that until April had already been registered an increase “in the order of 25%”. "Today we can say that Korea is number one in the international market for Macao," said the STD official.
Senna Fernandes also recalled that South Korea now has visa exemption for China, which could also have a positive effect for Macao. "We are trying to see the possibility of more products to combine Macau and Hengqin to use the range of hotels in Hengqin, because Macau already has an average occupancy rate of 90%. On the other hand, there are other types of attractions there [Hengqin] that may also be a complement to Macau," said the director of tourism services.
“Feeling Macao” street promotion started on Friday in a Seoul shopping center, where a flash mob's store was called “Macao Secret Doors”. The four-day event aimed to attract visitors to South Korea, “especially young people from millennium and generation Z”, to visit and consume in Macao during summer holidays and the second half of the year, read in a STD statement.
Asked by the end point on similar events for other markets, Helena de Senna Fernandes said that Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia are also on the plans for 2025. “There are several roadshows that were planned for this year. We did one in Japan in Tokyo, in April, we are now in South Korea and for the week there will be a roadshow in Thailand. Two more, one in Malaysia, in Kuala Lumpur, and another in Jakarta, Indonesia, ”said the director of the STD.</description><pubDate>2025-06-03 06:09:57</pubDate></item><item><title>Philippines and European Union announce the creation of the Security and Defense Forum</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/06/03/filipinas-e-uniao-europeia-anunciam-criacao-de-forum-sobre-seguranca-e-defesa/</link><description>The Philippines and the European Union (EU) announced the formation of a dialogue on security and defense, with the aim of deepening bilateral cooperation. "We announce today the creation of a new EU-Filipine dialogue in security and defense, a specialized platform through which we can deepen our cooperation and exchange specialized knowledge," said EU diplomacy chief Kaja Kallas at a press conference in Manila, cited by EFE agency.
The European Union (EU) high representative for Foreign Affairs and Security, which is in the Filipine capital after participating over the weekend at the Shangri-La Annual Defense Forum in Singapore, met with Filipino Minister of Foreign Affairs, Enrique Manalo, with the declared objective of “bilateral) to the next level”.
Manalo said the now created forum will allow the parties to discuss defense issues “in depth and on a regular basis”, a dialogue that will join other existing but lower level initiatives, such as the Subcomité de Maritime Cooperation (SCM).
During the last meeting of this bilateral body last October, the Philippine and EU officials denounced “illegal, coercive, aggressive and dangerous actions in the Southern Sea of ​​China” without identifying their authors.
Manila and Beijing are involved in a territorial dispute over the sovereignty of various islands in the waters adjacent to the island of Huangyan, claimed by both countries, in the Southern Sea of ​​China, a strategic region, with potential oil and gas reserves and where about 30% of world trade passes.
China, which has the largest sea fleet in the world, claims almost all of these waters for historical reasons, a claim that contradicts the positions of other countries in the region, such as Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam, Brunei and Taiwan.
Manila and Beijing have a long history of maritime incidents, which have gotten worse in recent years. Chinese coastal guard ships used water cannons against Philippine boats on several occasions in disputed waters, where there were also records of ships, resulting in several injured Philippine soldiers.</description><pubDate>2025-06-03 06:11:42</pubDate></item><item><title>Favorite to South Korean presidential promises “pragmatic” foreign policy</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/06/03/favorito-as-presidenciais-sul-coreanas-promete-politica-externa-pragmatica/</link><description>Lee Jae-Myung, a favorite in the South Korean presidential elections and a center-left candidate, pledged to follow a “pragmatic” foreign policy, avoiding “unnecessary” hostilities with Beijing and Moscow, while maintaining the Military Alliance with Washington.
 
South Korea holds early presidential elections in a complex geopolitical environment: the growing competition between Beijing and Washington forces Seoul to look for a balance between its largest commercial partner, China, and its most important ally in security, the United States.
Lee Jae-Myung, the Democratic Party candidate in the June 3 elections, has approached the political center in his positions in foreign policy, abandoning some of his most critical rhetoric compared to Washington and Japan.
In the last days of the campaign, he argued that, if elected, he will continue a “pragmatic diplomacy” based on the Military Alliance with the US, and seek to establish stable ties with other regional powers such as China and Russia. "The alliance with the United States is the basis of South Korean diplomacy," Lee said during a television debate with his rivals last Tuesday. "We need to build cooperation between South Korea, the US and Japan based on it," he said.
Lee, who in the 2022 presidential, has narrowly lost to his former leader, now accused, Yoon Suk Yeol, appeared in a probes published last Wednesday as a favorite to victory in Tuesday's elections, with a 49% support rate, against 36% of Kim Moon-Solo, the candidate of the party People Power, and 9% of Lee Jun-Seok of the Reformist party.
To confirm the advantage in the polls in the polls, Lee will succeed three years from a conservative government, whose policy was based on solidification of ties with the US and Japan.
Although the opposition leader's latest comments have suggested that he does not intend to go back in this progress, Lee also says South Korean foreign policy cannot be limited to relations with the US. "We should not neglect ties with China or Russia. We have to manage them properly and there is no need to adopt a unnecessarily hostile approach as now," he said in the television debate.
The elections arise following the dismissal of former President Yoon Suk Yeol, removed from office after a failed attempt to impose martial law in December 2024.
The stance regarding Kim Moon-Soo's foreign policy, a successor in the conservative party and candidate for these presidential, prioritizes the South Korean alliance with the US, above all other diplomatic ties.
Kim stated in the same debate that he will seek to meet immediately with Donald Trump, if he wins the election, to resolve commercial friction and deepen economic cooperation.
It also defended the reintroduction of US nuclear weapons in the United States in South Korea to determine the North Korean aggression. The US removed its nuclear weapons from South Korea in 1991, in part as a measure to press Pyongyang to end its nuclear weapons program.
Lee characterized not only as "unrealistic" the return of nuclear weapons to South Korea, as well as the pressing issue of US tariffs, indicated that he does not see the need to hurry in negotiations with the Trump administration.
Still, it highlighted potential points according to the United States to overcome the voltage over the rates. "There are many areas of cooperation with the US, including shipbuilding, defense and advanced industries," he said.
On the other hand, like previous leaders of his party, Lee has insisted on dialogue with Pyongyang, a challenge that reinforcing Kim Jong-un's covenant with Russia has made it harder. Lee wants to reestablish communication channels, including a Military Direct line with Pyongyang, but there is no evidence that North Korea is receptive to the idea.

In a statement, the Macau Commerce and Investment Institute said that the new edition of the index is part of the 16th International Forum and Infrastructure Investment and Construction (IIICF) program.
In 2024, Brazil and Angola were Portuguese -speaking countries with the highest quotation in the index, which evaluates the environment, demand, receptivity and costs for infrastructure development.
The higher the score, the better the perspective of a country's infrastructure industry and the greater the degree of attractiveness for companies to strive for investment, construction and operations in this area in those territories.
Portugal and Equatorial Guinea were in 2024, among the Lusophone countries, from the perspective of the Chinese report, those with the best score in the cost, operational and financing cost -related development.
The document highlighted “the series of reforms implemented by the Portuguese government to improve the business environment” and the approval, in December 2023, of the National Investment Program by 2030 as factors that gave “a new impetus” to infrastructure.
Brazil was the one that stood out in the demands of demand, which brings together factors such as demand and potential market, and local receptivity and short -term enthusiasm in infrastructure investment, calculated, for example, based on the value of new contracts.
Mozambique led among Lusophone in the environment associated with the environment, which adds political, economic, sovereignty, impact factors in the market, as well as business and industrial scenarios.
The 2024 report pointed out “a moderate climb” in construction costs in Portuguese -speaking markets and warned of the “considerable obstacles” that countries face in “sustainable development of high quality infrastructure”.
The latest edition of the IIICF ended with the signature of 38 agreements, the largest of which involved projects in Angola and Brazil.
The Minister of Public Works, Urbanism and Housing of Angola, Carlos dos Santos, told Lusa at the time that he agreed with Chinese state company China Road and Bridge Corporation to build the country's first highway, with the estimated works of $ 2.5 billion.
Also at the IIICF of 2024, the Brazilian Group on Infrastructure, Transport and Services CCR has signed an agreement with a Chinese company for the extension line of a railway line in São Paulo, in southeastern Brazil, valued at five billion Yuan.

Chinese authorities yesterday rejected United States accusations that they violated a deal reached last month to reduce customs rights among the two largest economies in the world.
Beijing has not only rejected Washington's accusations this weekend, as the United States accused, in recent weeks, to "constantly provoke new economic and commercial friction, aggravating the uncertainty and instability of bilateral economic and commercial relations," according to a statement released yesterday by the Chinese trade ministry.
The United States and China reached an agreement in May to temporarily suspend a commercial escalation that had increased by US products to 125% and Chinese products to 145%.
After two days of meetings in Geneva, Washington and Beijing agreed to lower their customs rights for 90 days to 30% and 10%, respectively, and pledged to pursue discussions with a view to reaching a trade agreement.
The US Secretary of Commerce, Howard Lutnick, accused Beijing of "delaying the application of the agreement," in statements to Fox News this Sunday.
The United States also accused China of not respecting the terms of the negotiated decanration agreement two weeks ago between the two countries in the Swiss city. "Unsurprisingly, China totally violated its agreement with us," said President Donald Trump, without specifying the actions carried out by Beijing.
Washington "made spurious accusations and unjustifiably accused China of violating consensus, which is totally contrary to facts," the ministry reacted, adding that "Beijing firmly rejects these unjustified accusations."
The Chinese Ministry of Commerce said it was "firm in protecting their rights and interests and sincere in the application of consensus."
Washington has been successively introduced a series of discriminatory restrictive measures against China, ”the statement added, citing the control of artificial intelligence chips exports and the revocation of visas for Chinese students in the United States. "We urged the United States to find a common basis with China, immediately correct their rebuke actions and jointly respect the consensus achieved in Geneva's commercial talks," said the Chinese trade ministry. Otherwise, "China will continue to resolutely take strong measures to defend its legitimate rights and interests," he added.
