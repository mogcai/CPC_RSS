The document warns of the economic challenges that the sinhhood is going through, stressing that the territory should take advantage of the opportunities. The Chief Executive announced that this year the government will maintain the pecuniary reimbursement plan, will debut a childhood assistance allowance, will increase the disability allowance and pension for the elderly, but will also make salaries unchanged in the civil service.
 
Sam Hou Fai was yesterday to the Legislative Assembly (AL) to present, for the first time, the report of the Governing Action Lines (LAG). The document, which presents the governance beams for this year, aims to reinforce the social protection of the most vulnerable layers, also warning that the region has to prepare for various economic challenges.
 
Support and subsidies
 
One of the focus of these first lag of Sam Hou Fai has to do with the “mitigation of population concerns and attenuation of their difficulties in favor of well-being”. "This government will persist in putting the interests of the population first and, given the issues related to their daily lives, will endeavor to solve the most pressing real problems that concern them, with a view to responding to their aspirations for a quality life," said the chief executive.
It is then foreseen to maintain the pecuniary reimbursement plan in economic development for this year, with permanent residents receiving 10,000 patacas and non -permanent to receive six thousand. Still, Sam Hou Fai has foreseeing scrambled in the future, such as the eventual introduction of the rule of permanence for 183 days in the masket to attribute the check, and this requires the consensus of society, stressed at the press conference after the presentation in al.
The boss also announced news for the elderly. The amount of the pension to the elderly and other social security benefits will be increased, passing the monthly amount of the pension to elderly from 3,740 patacas to 3,900 patacas and the annual amount of the elderly subsidy rises to 10,000 patacas. The disability allowance will also grow to 10,000 patacas, and special disability subsidy rises to 20,000.
To face the problem of the low birth rate, the government will also begin to grant a childhood assistance allowance, giving each baby or permanent resident of Macau with less than three years of age a monthly amount of 1,500 patacas, making a total of 18,000 patacas per year, and the amount of birth to 6,500 patacas is also updated. The government also decided to increase the marriage subsidy to 2,220 patacas. The health valleys, which so far were 600 patacas for each permanent resident, become 700 patacas.
This year there are no increases for civil service workers. The LAG report makes no reference to increases in the salary index of civil servants.
 
Worldwide unpredictability
 
The chief executive estimates that this year be marked by the “coexistence of opportunities and challenges”. "Worldwide, we are living times of turbulence and transformation," said Sam Hou Fai, adding: "We have witnessed, in recent years, the aggravation of unilateralism and protectionism, the insufficiency of dynamics prone to world economic growth, as well as the increase of unforeseen events and uncertainties."
In the presentation of the lag, Sam Hou Fai also stated that, since Macao's economy is strongly facing abroad, the region cannot be immune to the resulting impacts. "We should not underestimate any threats and challenges, before, we must always be aware of the risks and a sense of warning, so that we are prepared to act against all potential threats," Sam said in Al.
Still, the leader of the Government of MSAR said, at the press conference after the presentation of the LAG, that the region will not be direct impacts of the tariff war between the United States and China. According to Sam, the impact may have to do with the eventual loss of purchasing power of visitors from the interior of China. The boss also said that the government will probably have to make a budget reinforcement because tax revenues from the game industry may fall short of expectations.
 
Revitalization of the community economy
 
One of the problems with which the government has been encountered has to do with the alteration of residents' consumption habits, which easily cross the border and make their purchases across the siege gates. To help the community economy, the executive will launch a bank credit interest bonus plan for small and medium -sized local businesses.
This plan, according to Sam Hou Fai, offers each commercial entrepreneur who fulfills the requirements, a maximum amount of bonus credit of 5 million patacas, with a 4% interest bonus for a period of three years. The maximum limit of the total amount of bank credits is fixed at 10 billion patacas.
Support plans will be launched to “stores with their own characteristics” and “stores with specialized and delicate characteristics”. On the other hand, tourist activities and community projects will also be developed to attract visitors to enter and consume in the neighborhoods.
 
Public Administration Reform
 
For this year, one of the priorities has to do with the “in -depth reform of public administration”. “We will fully take advantage of the leadership and coordination mechanism for the reform of public administration, in order to simplify the government's organic structure and raise the efficiency of its operation.
The executive promises to “simplify the organic structure of the government and raise the efficiency of its operation”, beginning with the restructuring of the Directorate of Administration and Public Function Services and the Institute for Municipal Affairs. In addition, the personnel management regime will be renovated to constitute a team of public services workers with love for the homeland and Macau, which is diligent, committed, efficient and full. ” The chief executive also asked civil servants to put themselves "in the context of society," reflect on problems and reinforce "awareness of being a public servant."
 
National Security and Patriotism
 
Two aspects that are still present in this year's lag are national security and the concept of patriotism. In this context, Sam said that the legislative work related to the prevention, investigation and repression of terrorism crimes and the construction of cybersecurity will be promoted. On the other hand, "police work will be improved using technology."
The basic governance system will also be improved and the “development and growth of love associations and Macau support” and “reinforced management and communication with associations to better play their dynamic role and consolidate the basis of Macao's social governance”.
The government also wants to consolidate the base of governance according to the principle "Macao governed by patriots". This year, it is recalled, elections are held for the AL and the executive wants to ensure that the process stems "in a fair, impartial, open and whole environment."
 
JOB
 
"With the employment and entrepreneurship of young people closely related to long -term development of Macao, the Government of MSAR will take steps to create more opportunities and conditions for the employment and entrepreneurship of young people," said the chief executive yesterday.
Young people will also be made available to more internship opportunities, increasing the number of internship vacancies in companies indicated in the interior of China and raising to 520 the vacancies in the internship program in China for Macao Higher Education Students, attributing to the internship, a allowance worth 5,000 patacas. On the other hand, the guarantee of the priority access of employment residents remains one of the government's priorities for this year.
 
HOUSING
 
The government has also promised to review housing policies, "adjusting the plans to offer different types of housing, in order to better respond to the housing needs of residents with different levels of performance," Sam Hou Fai explained, adding that the goal is to rationally balance the relationship between supply and demand in the real estate market, in order to promote its stable and healthy development. "
The zone social housing zones should be ready between 2026 and 2027 and economic dwellings in that landfill may be completed between this year and the next. "We will, according to the actual situation, rationally plan the progress of construction, optimize the distribution of resources, as well as to evaluate the viability of the economic housing exchange regime," said the boss.
 
Great Bay and Hengqin
 
The government continues to bet on Macao's participation in the construction of the Great Guangdong-Hong Bay Kong-Macau. Thus, this year is intended to reinforce technological innovation cooperation in the Great Bay. “Given the development needs of the Great Guangdong-Hong Bay Kong-Macau and Macau's own needs, we will seek to obtain state support in the construction and technology transformation center of Higher Education Institutions of the Great Guangdong-Hong Bay Kong-Macau for the creation of a 'One-Stop' platform and 'full chain' of public conversion, open and open conversion, and open conversion and chain Party, gradually transforming it into a double center for the transfer of technological achievements from higher education institutions and the cultivation of innovative and entrepreneurs qualified frames, ”said Sam.
Regarding the Hengqin project, which aims to help solve the issue of diversification of the region's economy, Sam Hou Fai wants a “greater commitment to promoting the innovation of the legal system” of that zone, as well as the investment of more resources and efforts in the “coordination of policies, the defining capital investment, joint business capture and the construction of projects”. The “functions and distribution of tasks by the various work structures of the Executive Committee will be“ adjusted and optimized ”, with the aim of raising the quality and efficiency of the work”.

Another novelty is the construction of an integrated tourist and cultural neighborhood, “an area where high quality cultural complexes are concentrated at the international level,” said Sam Hou Fai. This infrastructure will include “iconic cultural complexes”, as well as “cultural, tourist and commercial elements”, noting, the Macao National Culture Museum, the Macao International Center for Performance Arts and the International Museum of Contemporary Art.
 
Portugal and the Portuguese
 
At the press conference that followed the lag presentation at AL, Sam Hou Fai confirmed his trip to Portugal, indicating that this will only happen after the Portuguese legislative elections, which take place on May 18. Paulo Rangel, Portuguese Minister of Foreign Affairs, had already mentioned this when his recent visit to the MSAR. This will be Sam Hou Fai's first trip abroad as chief executive.
Asked about the difficulties in setting residence by Portuguese nationals, Sam Hou Fai replied that, through the qualified frames capture programs, Portuguese citizens continue to work for Macau. It is recalled that the authorities have failed to accept new requests for residence for Portuguese for the “exercise of specialized technical functions”, allowing only justification of family reunion or previous connection to the territory, contrary to what happened since 1999.</description><pubDate>2025-04-15 01:04:46</pubDate></item><item><title>China asks the United States fair dialogue and based on respect</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/04/15/china-pede-aos-estados-unidos-dialogo-justo-e-baseado-no-respeito/</link><description>China said yesterday that the "reciprocal tariffs" of US President Donald Trump impair the international economic and commercial order and appealed to Washington to "solve problems through a fair dialogue based on mutual respect."
 
"We urge the United States to immediately correct their wrong approach and to resolve business differences through dialogue," Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian told a press conference.
Lin stated that "the US puts its interests ahead of the common good of the international community, which is a typical example of tariff intimidation." The spokesman reiterated that "in a trade war no one wins" and that "protectionism offers no way out."
The trade war triggered by Trump intensified on April 2, with the announcement of "reciprocal tariffs" against the rest of the world, a measure rectified one week later, in the face of the fall of markets and the increase in US debt financing cost. But while softening his offensive with most countries, applying a widespread 10%tariff, he decided to increase rates on China, which are now set by 145%.
However, this weekend, Washington has decided to exempt many Chinese technological products. Trump said on Sunday that semiconductor rates will be implemented “in the near future” and will announce the rates later this week as part of his trade war.
On Sunday, China ranked the exemption of tariffs on certain Chinese electronic products such as “a small step” for the United States to “correct their wrong practice” and urged Washington to “completely cancel” rates.
For Beijing, US tariffs "not only violate economic and basic market laws, but also ignore complementary cooperation and the offer relationship-search among countries."
The scholarships of mainland China and Hong Kong yesterday registered gains at the opening after the news that the United States temporarily excluded mobile phones, computers, screens and all kinds of Chinese tariff technological components. The reference rates of Shanghai and Shenzhen scholarships rose 0.42% and 1.23%, respectively, a few minutes after the negotiations began.
These scholarships fell 7.34% and 9.66%, respectively, last Monday, following the rates imposed by the United States on Chinese products and the counterfeit announced by Beijing.
In the following days, the two rates have partially recovered from the fall, due to support for markets announced by Chinese state investment institutions and stock repurchase plans launched by large Chinese companies, despite the new reciprocal tariff increases announced by the world's two largest economies in recent days.
The main index of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, the Hang SENG, rose about 2.15%at the opening of yesterday's negotiations, exceeding 21,000 points.
The Hong Kong index fell 13.2 %due to fears of a worldwide recession caused by commercial tensions between Beijing and Washington, although it recorded some gains during last week.
After shaking the markets in the last ten days, first announcing the widespread application of a large volume of rates to the rest of the world and then retreating to its Beijing offensive as the cost of US debt financing continued to increase, Washington decided to exempt many Chinese technological products.
When asked about the decision of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to exclude mobile phones, computers, screens and all kinds of Chinese technological components from the list of goods that would be subject to 145%tariffs, US President Donald Trump merely said that he would provide more information on Monday.
The spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Trade said on Sunday, in a statement, that Beijing is “currently evaluating the impact” of the memorandum that exempts some Chinese technological products of “reciprocal tariffs”.

London's homemade triumph in the first leg of the quarterfinals, by statements 3-0, just does not undo any doubt as to the eliminatory winner because on the other hand is the trophy record holder (15) and holder of the 'Orelhuda', which has an almost fraternal relationship with the main European test of clubs.
Except for any unforeseen events, FC Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain will confirm favoritism and qualification in second-hand matches today, after home wins on Borussia Dortmund (4-0) and Aston Villa (3-1), respectively, and the only day still in the next day, the only true duel, against the tangential advantage of the tangential advantage. (2-1).
The outbreaks will be pointed to the Santiago Bernabéu stadium in Madrid, where Carlo Ancelotti's formation will have a Herculean task to avoid being out of the semi-finals for the last five years, having to reverse a disadvantage built in London by two Declan Rice and a goal of Mikel Merino.
If Arsenal is close to reaching the socks only for the third time in its history -it was a finalist in 2005/06 and semifinalist in 2008/09 -the "meringues" qualified for that phase of competition in 12 of the previous 14 times, during which they erected the 'ear' on six occasions.
However, the history is not favorable to Real Madrid, as the four times he left for the second leg of a shot with a disadvantage of three or more goals, only in 1975/76 managed to go around the English Derby County, then on the second round of the European Champion Clubs Cup (4-1 defeat in England and 5-1 triumph in Madrid).
The same did not succeed Benfica (1964/65), Bayern Munich (1986/87) and, more recently, already in the Champions League, with Borussia Dortmund (2012/13), from which he lost 4-1 in Germany and was eliminated in the semi-finals even winning his second hand 2-0.
Arsenal or Real Madrid will find in the next phase Paris Saint-Germain or Aston Villa, but the formation of Nuno Mendes, João Neves, Vitinha and Gonçalo Ramos is in front of the round, in the face of 3-1 triumph in Paris. Birmingham's team, clearly the biggest surprise of this edition, still advanced, by Rogers, only Doué, Kvaratskhelia and the Luso left back secured the Gaulesa advantage.
Still without achieving one of the great designs of millionaire Nasser al-Khelaifi (the conquest of the Champions), the PSG looks for its second consecutive semi-final, before an English emblem that, unlike Parisians, has a European title in its Palmés (1981/82).
FC Barcelona, ​​who eliminated Benfica in the eighth, can practically prepare the 'bags' for the trip to Munich or Milan in the next round, taking a 'Hecatombe' for Borussia Dortmund, even playing at home, being able to turn around Lewandowski (twice), Raphinha and Yamal in Catalonia.
The Catalans, five times European champions, the last in 2015, are close to returning to a half-final six years later and leaves the 1997 winner and finalist overdue from the previous edition, who, although eliminated Sporting in the Play-Off, is out of the Bundesliga Top-5 and has been defeated by the 'Blaugrana' at home in the Liga (2-3) phase.
Well positioned to regain the Germanic title that first escaped him in 12 years, Bayern Munich could go to Italy with the eliminatory with the inter -tied, were not Davide Frattesi to have given the 'Nerazzurri' victory at Allianz Arena (where the final will be played), after Thomas Müller had 'annulled' Lautaro goal ' Martinez.
The set in which they align Raphaël Guerreiro and João Palhinha aims at the second consecutive semi-final, where he can even face the coach who gave him the last European title (2019/20), Hansi Flick, currently in charge of FC Barcelona.
The reissue of the 2009/10 Champions Final, won by the transalpinos led by José Mourinho, will be a kind of two-handed knockouts: in the 1988/89 UEFA Cup, the Bavarians lost 2-0 at home, but qualified to the third round with a 3-1 triumph in Milan, while in the 18/11 league eighths', Milanese were defeated 1-0 at home and, in the second hand, were 3-2 in Germany.
The 2024/25 Champions League final is scheduled for May 31 at the Allianz Arena in Munich.

The trade war between China and the United States does not seem to have affected the game volumes in Macao, with 60% of market quotas to be dominated by the three Wynn, Sands and MGM US game dealers.
 
Premium gamblers from the mass segment contributed with Hong Kong's $ 11.1 million for game industry revenues in April, obtaining a stable result in the same year's same period.
The data were released on Sunday in the monthly report prepared by Corretora Citigroup, which concludes that recent reasons for concern for the sector - such as the trade war between China and the United States and the dismantling of an illegal exchange network last month - seem not to have negatively impacted raw game revenues for April.
Although the average bet per player fell 6.8% over the same month of 2024, for about 18,000 dollars of Hong Kong, the number of premium players in the mass segment - an intermediate sector between the mass game and the game of great VIP gamblers - rose 8% over the same period last year for 611 players. At the same time, the 19 “whales” observed in April in Macao casinos, referring to players with a unique bet of at least 100,000 dollars from Hong Kong, moved a total of $ 4.1 million from Hong Kong in the period in question, marking a growth of 2% compared to the same period.
In the current month of April, "the second biggest bet we saw came from a Horizon Room whale of the Galaxy Macao, with a $ 500,000 bet from Hong Kong," analysts George Choi and Timothy Chau advance in the citigroup note and quoted by Ggrasia. Although Galaxy Entertainment Group secured first place in relation to premium bets by collecting 25% of the market share, US game concessionaires were able to accumulate a total of 60%, including 23% for MGM.
Based on this data, Citigroup analysts conclude that “the current trade war between China and the United States does not affect players' preference” as to the casinos where they bet. "Players seem to choose to stay where they feel auspiciously comfortable," even if these casinos belong to US game operators such as Wynn, Las Vegas Sands and MGM Resorts.
It is recalled that the “tariff war” between the two economic powers began in early April, when US President Donald Trump imposed an additional 34% rate on China products that added to two rounds of 10% already declared in February and March. Currently, Washington's tariffs have already risen to a minimum of 145%, to Beijing. retaliated by applying 125%rates.
In addition to the commercial dispute between the two countries and the uncertainty about the impact on US casinos in Macao, another factor of concern for the volumes of play in the territory was related to the dismantling of an illegal money exchange network at the end of March. According to the Judicial Police (PJ), a group composed of 33 individuals (22 of Macao and 11 from the interior of China) had opened, since 2019, eight, eight, Kinths in the vicinity of various casinos, with the aim of approaching potential players.
In the interpretation of Citigroup's analysts, the results of April "suggest that concerns about the recent intensification of Macao police repression against pledge houses that can act as exchange houses can be exaggerated, as players continue to move money for gaming tables."

"To describe an event that lasted just a few hours, which was not violent, and immediately agree to describe the request for dissolution of the National Assembly as an insurrection (…) it seems legally unfounded," he said before the central court of Seoul, which after two preliminary hearings began to judge the case, which could result in a Yoon Suk Yeol conviction or even the death penalty.
Untited by the Constitutional Court on April 4, after being suspended from office in mid -December, Yoon now faces criminal accusations.
Despite the heavy penalties to which he was subject, he is free, and his pre-trial detention was annulled by procedural reasons on March 8.

According to lawyer Min Kyoung-website, the court may apply Yoon to jurisprudence of the Judgment of Chun and Roh, as its actions "also involved the coercive use of the Armed Forces." Lusa</description><pubDate>2025-04-15 01:03:23</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
