Chinese authorities announced a press conference for Monday to announce the measures. The expectation led the CSI 300 reference index, which brings together the 300 main companies in the country, to rise 2.4%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose 2.2%.
Since the beginning of the year, the CSI 300 and Hang SENG have risen 1.8%and 19.4%, respectively, while the S&amp;P 500, the index that brings together the 500 largest companies per United States scholarship capitalization fell 6.1%.
The gains focused on actions with exposure to China's huge consumer base. Beverage company shares Kweichow Moutai rose 5.9%, while the BYD electric vehicle manufacturer shares rose 6.1%. CATL, the largest manufacturer of electric vehicle batteries in the world, rose 3.5%.
The postpandey recovery of the Chinese economy fell short of the expected. The country faces a prolonged real estate crisis and deflationary risks. Many economists have urged Beijing to do more to support consumers in the country.
Monday's press conference will include Central Bank officials, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Commerce and the National Development and Reform Commission, the China Economic Planning Agency.
Actions related to children's care also registered Friday, after the government of Hohhot, the capital of the inner Mongolia, in northern China, said it would grant cash subsidies to new parents. The benefits would increase as families were growing, ranging from 10,000 yuan (1,290 euros) to the first child and 10,000 yuan per year for 10 years for the third child.
The announcement was made following the plenary session of China's maximum legislative agency, during which politicians stressed the need to increase the birth rate and defined as a goal an economic growth of “about 5%” to 2025. China's population has been decreasing in the last three years.
According to the British newspaper Financial Times, the shares of Fehe, a Hong Kong-listed baby-formula formula company, 15.7%, while the Beingmate and Aiyingshi counterparts, quoted on the Chinese continent and selling babies and mothers, risen 10%. Yili, a Hohhot -based dairy company, rose 8.6%.
 
Beijing criticizes “unfounded” pressure on Chinese companies after case Huawei
 
The Chinese government has asked not to politic issues or to resort to “unfounded” measures to suppress Chinese Chinese companies, referring to the recent investigation into the alleged corruption linked to Huawei in the European Parliament.
"China has always demanded that its companies strictly comply with the laws and regulations of the countries where they operate," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told a press conference. "We hope the relevant parties will respect international economic and commercial rules and provide a fair, transparent and non -discriminatory business environment for Chinese companies in Europe," he added.
Mao stressed that “commercial issues should not be politicized and companies should not be repressed through unfounded means” in a response to Brussels inquiry against Huawei, whose lobbyists are being investigated for alleged bribe, falsification and bleaching of capital in the European parliament, in a case involving a company based in Portugal.
The Chinese technological giant said he has "zero tolerance" for corruption. "Huawei takes these allegations seriously and will urgently communicate with investigators to better understand the situation," a company spokesman said in a statement.
The case, which led to the closing of parliamentary assistants' offices in the European Parliament, rekindled the debate about the presence of Chinese companies in strategic sectors in Europe.
The European Commission recommends the restriction or exclusion of Huawei from the 5G Member States networks from 2023, a measure supported by the United States in its policy of containing Chinese technology.
Beijing has repeatedly rejected the accusations against their technological companies, saying they are attempts to block their access to Western markets under false safety pretexts.

The results of the inquiry also indicate that almost half of respondents intend to pass the renovation inside China.
 
The Association of Social Services Sheng Kung Hui de Macao has carried out an inquiry into the lives of the elderly of the region, whose results reveal that about 30% of the region's seniors feel a “high degree” of solitude. On the other hand, 31% of future reformed think that their after reform is more boring.
This inquiry was carried out to 1,500 people, and the answers were added opinions of five experts, consultants and service providers to the elderly, for example.
According to the Association, in terms of social participation, respect and social inclusion, respondents and experts consider that "society has become more attentive and friendly with the elderly" and that "the integration of the elderly and young people has been increasingly valued." According to the investigation, 70% of respondents agree that there are special counters for the elderly in general services and 82% agree that there are places for the elderly in public transport.
In addition, the inquiry also concludes that the prevalence of smartphones between the elderly population increased, with the proportion of respondents using smartphones to increase from about 50% by 2020 to 91%. The Sheng Kung Hui Association suggests that we should continue to intensify the promotion of technology use and simplify the process of digital tools.
Asked about reform planning, almost half indicated that they prefer to go to the interior of China. About 26% of the renovated potential said Zhuhai considering the favorite place to pass the renovation, while about 22% are considering other cities in the interior of China.
This survey says that the average preparation rate for the renovation of people who are not yet reformed is currently 5.45 at 10 points, which is slightly lower than the index of residents of the interior of China, which is 5.53. Still, Macao's potential renovated are aware of the importance and responsibility of financial planning for reform, whose index is at 7.05 points. However, they are not yet sufficiently aware of the practical measures they should take to prepare their reform, and this index is at 5.45 points.
The inquiry also found that 32% of future reformed did not exercise, 66% of respondents said they were unable to perform heavy household chores independently after reform and 70% of respondents believed that health care or insurance would be one of the main expenses in the future.
Sheng Kung Hui suggests that support and consultation services are reinforced for future reformed and that companies, financial institutions and social organizations are encouraged to provide reform planning support and consultation services, “in order to increase the sensitization of residents for the importance of planning their future life and preparing for reform, especially for young workers”.</description><pubDate>2025-03-17 01:55:18</pubDate></item><item><title>Fatal point 2025.02.17</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/03/17/ponto-fatal-2025-02-17-2/</link><description>An inquiry carried out by the Sheng Kung Hui Social Services Association indicates that about 30% of the elderly respondents feel a “high degree” of loneliness and annoyance.

The association highlights several factors of uncertainty for the economy of the territory, stressing the decrease in the purchasing power of visitors. Still, Macao's economic prosperity rate is expected to remain stable.
 
For this year, the government foresees that gross game revenues reach 240 billion patacas, which implies that, every quarter, casinos fit 60 million patacas. In the first quarter of the year, this will not happen, provides for the Macao Economic Association. The association says, in its latest study on the region's economic perspectives, that "economic performance in the first quarter may be slightly weaker than expected."
In January, the casinos invoiced 18.2 billion of patacas and in February 19.7 billion. In March, the daily average is about 640 million patacas. If this pace remains, this month will end with gross play revenues in the order of 19.8 billion patacas, making the figure reached by casinos in the first three months of the year is 57.7 billion.
In the report released last Friday, the Association, whose president is the former deputy to Legislative Assembly Joey Lao, says that the economic conjuncture of Macao will face “many uncertainties”, namely with the customs imposed by the United States, by slowing China's economic growth and the fall of Renminbi. On the other hand, the consumption pattern of visitors on the continent has also changed, having their purchasing power, especially in search of luxury goods and top marks. Already the local retailer sector “faces unprecedented challenges” and many traders have lamented the difficulty in doing business, “so they may have to be prudent in their evaluation of future economic perspectives,” says the report.
In the report, the Macao Economic Association also says that due to a series of “complex internal and external factors”, such as the fall of the loan/deposits of local banks, the rise of the Malpated credit and the poor confidence of investors and consumers.
However, the report also says that the Macao economic prosperity index for January and February is 6.6 and 6.5, respectively, "which is basically according to the expected performance." From March to May this year, this rate of economic prosperity is expected to remain between 6.4 and 6.6, “with global economic perspectives to remain stable,” says the Macao Economic Association.</description><pubDate>2025-03-17 01:52:24</pubDate></item><item><title>Symposium on pollution culminated in an appeal to a “green revolution” in Macau</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/03/17/simposio-sobre-poluicao-culminou-num-apelo-a-uma-revolucao-verde-em-macau/</link><description>Macao Polytechnic University (UPM) held on Friday a symposium centered on “global carbon neutral trends and ex-compliance in the international game industry”. Promoted by the Pedagogical and Scientific Center in the areas of Game and Tourism (CJT-UPM), the event aimed to discuss the reduction of carbon emissions in the tourism sector, aligning itself with the United Nations Sustainable Development Objectives (SDGs).
The global emission of carbon dioxide (CO2) has reached about 36.4 billion tons, according to the latest statistics of 2023, being the tourism sector responsible for approximately 8% of this total. With the continuous growth of tourism worldwide, it is expected that if emissions are not controlled, the sector's contribution to total emissions may increase significantly. On the other hand, effective emission reduction actions in this sector may allow a decrease of up to 50% by 2030, according to data from the World Tourism Organization. This scenario underlines the urgency of discussing and implementing sustainable practices.
During the Symposium, experts such as Vice President Shi Yun and guest researcher Hu Jiyuan debated the relationship between the reduction of carbon emissions and the tourism and leisure industries. Both emphasized the need for a “green revolution” in Macao, where tourism can play a crucial role in the search for carbon neutrality. Participants also explored the history of carbon neutrality, national policies aimed at reaching the peak of carbon emissions and, later, neutrality until 2060, as well as the implications of these policies for companies in the region.
Wang Changbin, coordinator of CJT-UPM, highlighted the importance of the symposium as a space to strengthen the dialogue between the academy and the private sector. Replacing that the adoption of emission reduction strategies will not only create a more sustainable environment for Macao, but will also raise the region's competitiveness in the international landscape.
With the goal of reducing its carbon emissions, Macau should consider technological improvements, energy efficiency and sustainable tourism practices. The CJT-UPM is an active promoter of research and exchange between sectors, committed to training professionals capable of facing the challenges of sustainable development.</description><pubDate>2025-03-17 01:53:15</pubDate></item><item><title>Hundreds of people speak in Manila in support of former President Duterte</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/03/17/centenas-de-pessoas-manifestam-se-em-manila-em-apoio-ao-ex-presidente-duterte/</link><description>Hundreds of people manifested themselves in Manila to demonstrate support for Rodrigo Duterte. The former president of the Philippines, it is recalled, was accused of crimes against humanity due to the anti-drug campaign he led.
 
Hundreds of people manifested Saturday in the capital of the Philippines, Manila, to demonstrate support to former President Rodrigo Duterte, accused of crimes against humanity for the violent anti-drug campaign they led.
Shaking Philippine Flags with posters appealing to the support for Duterte, the former president's supporters demanded Saturday that the politician returns to the country.
Duterte was arrested on Tuesday in the Philippines by the local authorities and, hours later, was sent to The Hague in the Netherlands, where he attended Friday before the Judges of the International Criminal Court. “Bring him back” and “We supported President Rodrigo Duterte” were some of the most repeated phrases during the demonstration, which began with a prayer for the health of the former 79-year-old president.
Some protesters also accused the current president, Ferdinand Marcos Jr., of betrayal for delivering Duterte to International Justice.
North of the Asian capital, in Nueva Ecija, manifestations were also held, albeit less numerous than in Manila.
During the presidency of Duterte, between 2016 and 2022, about 6,000 people were murdered in anti -drug operations and extrajudicial executions, police data.
However, the estimates are contested by local non-governmental organizations that claim operations culminated in the deaths of more than 30,000 people. The former president was arrested following a warrant captured from the International Criminal Court.
The court considers Duterte responsible for humanity crimes and says there are “reasonable reasons” to believe that he led a death squad and used his power to carry out extrajudicial executions.
The Court's investigation into extrajudicial executions began in 2018 and, by 2021, the authorities and security forces were associated with the crimes committed, although Duterte removed the country from the organization in 2019 in an attempt not to be implied.
In the warrant of capture, the Court points out that it is competent to examine the alleged crimes that occurred when the country was still a member of the organization, namely, between November 1, 2011 and 16 March 2019.
Before arriving at the presidency of the Philippines, Duterte was Mayor of Davao, the second most populous city in the country and where the politician launched a violent anti -drug campaign.
Friday's hearing in The Hague aimed only to confirm Duterte's identity and the first session of the trial is expected to take place on 23 September, the court announced.

Sanitary authority is now planning to add a registration function to organ donation to the Macao Single Account, to facilitate resident adherence.
 
The number of people registered to donate organs in Macao was about 6,380 in 2024, corresponding to an increase of 6.6% compared to 2023. The data were released by the director of health services, Alvis Lo, in response to a written interpellation of the deputy to the Legislative Assembly (AL) Ron Lam over the topic.
Among the 6,380 people registered, more than 4,420 concluded the formalities in person, which represents a 2.8% increase in the same period of 2023. The Health Authority attributes these results to the reinforcement of the “Organ Donation Promotion Works” that has been performing - for example, through the promotion of a total of 42 activities and lectures last year. Also the number of associations participating in the Organ Donation Advertising Partnership Charter increased to 30 at the end of 2024.
In the same answer, health services ensure continuing to promote the acceptance of organ donation and transplantation by Macao residents. Among the plans projected for the near future, there are dissemination and promotion activities with health professionals and the addition of a registration function for organ donation in the Macao Single Account Application, “in order to further increase the will and convenience of registration of residents”. It also states that the electronic page dedicated to the themes of organ donation and transplantation has been optimized “in order to increase more issues and information that deserve the attention of the population” and “raising the knowledge and participation of residents”.
The dissemination of information and the work of clarifying doubts is of particular importance in countries and regions where the majority of the population is Chinese nationality, as the organ donation rate is “relatively low” in these locations in relation to the standards of neighboring regions. The director of health services emphasizes that it is equally “crucial” to encourage the acceptance by the household aggregate of potential donors, recalling ten cases in which organ gift was impossible for the refusal of family members.
Deputy Ron Lam's questioning also mentioned the excessive costs of hemodialysis treatment: a minimum of eight thousand patacas at the Conde de São Januário hospital center, the establishment where expenses are lower. In response, health services state that while dialysis medical treatments are not free, applicants may be exempt from paying expenses after considering various factors, such as the assets assessment of the household.
In 2023, according to data referenced by the health authority, about 95% of patients enjoyed free health care or were exempt from paying dialysis expenses, while the rest did not meet the requirements “thanks to the high level of assets and income”.

"The international agreement on the Iranian nuclear issue was an important achievement achieved through dialogue and negotiation," said Wang Yi, quoted by the official newspaper China Daily, adding that the "situation has once again reached a critical moment."
Wang presented the five-point position of China to resolve the Iranian nuclear question during talks with Russian Foreign Deputy Minister Ryabkov Sergey Alexeevich, and Iranian Foreign Minister Kazem Gharibabadi, who are in Beijing, for a tripartite meeting.
"All parties should defend the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, actively create conditions for the react of dialogue and negotiations and avoid actions that cause a climb of tensions," he said.
Chinese diplomacy chief stated that Iran should continue to join their commitment not to develop nuclear weapons, while all parties must fully respect the right to Iran, as a signatory to the non -proliferation of nuclear weapons, to the peaceful use of nuclear power.
Iran signed a nuclear agreement, formally known as the Global Joint Action Plan (PACG) in July 2015, with six countries -Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States -accepting restrictions on its nuclear program in exchange for a relief from sanctions.
The US withdrew from the agreement in May 2018 and restored the sanctions.
During the meeting, Wang called for a new consensus based on the PACG framework and expressed the hope that all parties will advance in the same direction and resume dialogue and negotiations as soon as possible.
The US must demonstrate political sincerity and return to conversations as soon as possible, he argued.
Washington imposed new sanctions on Thursday against Iranian oil minister Mohsen Paknejad, entities that sold Iranian Crude to China and ships involved in transfers of offshore (offshore ').
At the trilateral meeting, the deputy ministers also stressed the importance of respecting the UN Security Council Resolution 2231, which enshrined the 2015 nuclear agreement with Teerão, as well as its "calendar."
China and Russia greeted "reaffirmation by the peaceful nature of their nuclear program and the fact that it refrains from developing nuclear weapons," according to Xinhua.
They also praised “Iran's commitment to fully fulfill the obligations of the treaty” and expressed their support for Iran's “Cooperation Policy with the International Atomic Energy Agency (AIEA)”.
Trilateral dialogue occurs in a period of growing tensions with Washington, which reactivated its “maximum pressure” policy over Iran, with new sanctions designed to reduce oil sales.
US President Donald Trump said last week that he sent a letter to Tehran asking for the restart of negotiations, although Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei rejected any dialogue with "arrogant countries."
Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi has reaffirmed that they will “not negotiate under pressure or intimidation” and will only consider an agreement “based on mutual respect”.
Iran has maintained conversations in Geneva with Germany, France and the United Kingdom, but without significant progress.
China and Russia are trying to consolidate themselves as mediators in a process where the West has hardened their pressure. Beijing reinforced his cooperation with Tehran at commercial and energetic level, while Moscow is a fundamental ally of the Persian country at the international scene.
The AIEA confirmed, however, that Tehran has already accumulated 274 pounds of 60%enriched uranium, approaching the threshold for military use. Tehran will have significantly accelerated its nuclear program in recent months, quadrupling its uranium enrichment rate to 60% and reducing cooperation with agency inspectors.

South Korea's joint staff said that an unspecified number of Russian military aircraft entered the ID zone over the waters of the Japan Sea around 9:20 am before leaving the east and northeast areas of the area.
Russian aircraft did not invade South Korean airspace, added to the South Korean army, which detected the aircraft before entering the identification zone and sent several fighters to respond to the situation.
Entry into the South Korea defense area occurred during maneuvers and Russian pilots had no intention of violating the Asian country's airspace, the military from Seoul added.
An air defense identification zone is not part of a country's territorial airspace, but an additional perimeter within which air traffic is monitored by the armed forces to provide extra reaction time for a hostile maneuver or to avoid accidental collisions.
In November, Russia warned South Korea that the use of weapons provided by Seoul to Ukraine to “kill Russian citizens will definitely destroy” relations between the two countries. "Seoul must be aware that the possible use of South Korean weapons to kill Russian citizens will definitely destroy the relations between our countries," warned Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Rudenko, in statements to Russian news agency, TASS, quoted by EFE.
Rudenko appealed to North Korea that not to take “reckless measures” and to look at his long -term national interests and not for short -term situations “dictated abroad”. “As for Seoul to associate its eventual supply of weapons with Kiev with the development of cooperation between Moscow and Pyongyang, such an attitude could have very negative consequences. It is obvious that the Ukrainian conflict has nothing to do with the Korean peninsula, ”said the Russian diplomat.
According to Rudenko, if South Korea provides weapons to Kiev, Russia will “naturally respond with all the means they consider necessary”, which “will hardly reinforce the safety of the Republic of Korea itself”.
The deputy minister also accused the South Korean authorities of artificially instigated the controversy over the presence of North Korean soldiers in the zone of "Special Military Operation" in Ukraine, in order to "increase military pressure on Pyongyang."</description><pubDate>2025-03-17 01:54:37</pubDate></item><item><title>Chinese giant Baidu launches free models to compete with DeepSeek</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/03/17/gigante-chines-baidu-lanca-modelos-gratuitos-para-competir-com-deepseek/</link><description>Chinese Internet giant Baidu has launched two new free models of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) at a time of fierce competition in the sector.
The announcement comes two months after the Chinese 'Chinese startup' has shaken the technology world with the powerful low -cost -developed conversation robot and to work with fewer resources.
In a Wechat social network publication, Baidu has announced that it launched the latest X1 reasoning model - that the company claims to offer DeepSek's performance, but at a lower cost - as well as a new base model, Ernie 4.5.
These tools, which are free and were released two weeks ahead of expected, are available through Baidu's conversation robot, Ernie Bot.
So far, users had to pay a monthly subscription fee to access the latest AI models of the company.
Baidu was one of the first Chinese companies to implement a general AI platform in 2023, but the conversation robots of rival companies, such as Bytedance, owner of Tiktok, and Moonshot AI, quickly saturated the market. Deepseek, on the other hand, came to change the panorama, with a model as effective as Americans, such as chatgPT, but at a much lower development cost.
Chinese government companies and agencies were quick to integrate Deepseek software in the tools themselves, making it available to the public. Baidu, for example, integrated DeepSek's R1 reasoning model with the traditional search engine.
In February, Tencent, owner of Wechat, also launched a new AI model that claims to respond to queries faster than DeepSeek, while using rival technology for the messaging platform.
In the same month, Alibaba announced an investment of $ 52 billion over the next three years to develop AI.</description><pubDate>2025-03-17 01:54:22</pubDate></item><item><title>Jockey Club wanted to send 100 cats to the continent, but was "thanks" to retreat in the decision</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/03/17/jockey-club-quis-enviar-100-gatos-para-o-continente-mas-foi-obrigado-a-recuar-na-decisao/</link><description>Macau Jockey Club retreated to the decision to send to the interior of China about 100 cats that were in their space, after numerous criticism in society. Jockey Club claimed that cats would have permanent accommodation and care in Zhuhai, but could not provide details about the destination. The company ended up organizing yesterday an adoption session of 22 cats, in collaboration with anima, and another 60 cats will be received by local animal protecting groups.
 
About a hundred cats living in the Macau Jockey Club space were ready to be sent to the interior of China but the decision was, after all, fought due to a rain of criticism by residents. After censorship of the community and intervention of animal protection associations and activists, the company announced on Friday that it reached an agreement with Anima, the animal protective society, to open the adoption of cats to the public.
The Macau Jockey Club space closed its doors at the end of March last year and the government will recover the ground in question at the beginning of next month. The Jockey Club Plan to send cats was reported on social networks on Thursday afternoon for a cat care volunteer at Jockey Club, and immediately provoked a controversy similar to what happened to the canhydrome's Galidas eight years ago.
According to the publication of the animal protection volunteer and also former nickname Cheang nickname Jockey Club, the company was planning to take cats to Zhuhai, but the company has never been able to advance animal details of animals on the continent. "Even the Institute for Municipal Affairs (AMI), which helped in the exit procedures of cats, did not receive information about the detailed address of the shelter," the resident said, showing that cats would be taken to restaurants in the interior of China.
Cheang indicated that he helped take care of cats at Jockey Club, however, he was prevented from entering the space since last week. Cats have lived in the room for years, having been taken to the Hippodrome to catch mice as it could not be used poison for rodents in the installation taking into account the safety of the horses. The Jockey Club organized a cat adoption session last month, however, according to Cheang, few people were able to mark the entrance and only four cats were adopted.
In addition to the appeals on social networks to prevent sending, several residents asked the deputies for help and complained about the situation on Radio Macau in Chinese language and even in the Hong Kong press. Volunteers and animal protection associations have contacted the Jockey Club and AMI to interfere with the incident.
Mary Jean Reimer, a lawyer and former actress of Hong Kong, criticized Jockey Club's behavior and even contacted Anima, the animal's protective society, with the promise of welcoming all cats. Speaking to the All About Macau portal on Thursday, the anima said it could not talk to those responsible Dmacau Jockey Club, including Ben To, Space Manager, and Angela Leong, the company's executive director, to get response to the neighboring city's jurist proposal.
 
Government reactions
 
AMI reacted to the controversy the next day and eventually issued a press release on Friday morning to ensure that it had followed the work of the transfer and accommodation of animals in the Jockey Club field since April last year. The statement stressed that the Macao Horse Race Company presented to the government the plan to send sterilized cats with microchips to Zhuhai, "in order to provide them with permanent accommodation and care."
The body said it was satisfied with the plan and helped in the health inspection of these cats, including the introduction of microchips, anti-rabies vaccination and clinical examination. In this case, the executive assumed that he issued the necessary sanitary documents for the border passage of the “exported cats” in strict compliance with national provisions, providing support in the border passage.
In addition, AMI indicated that Macau Jockey Club “resorted to several channels for some cats to be adopted,” while the company insisted, also in a statement, “fulfilled social responsibility” in this regard.

On Friday afternoon, the Jockey Club reported that it had retreated in its decision, and announced the organization of a cat adoption session, in collaboration with Anima, held on Sunday.
"Macau Jockey Club reaffirms that the welfare of animals is always its main concern and that it actively fulfills its social responsibility to ensure that cats are properly treated and resolved," he said. The company said it had submitted monthly reports on animals in the room to AMI to ensure the transparency of information.

On this occasion, LAM began to say that "the Government of MSAR and WHO have maintained, over the years, a narrow cooperation relationship, actively responding to the WHO initiative and implementing a series of important public health policies." The Government of MSAR has prepared the “Action Plan for Healthy Macao”, which aims to integrate health elements in all public policies.

The “lack of administrative and government transparency”, defends the deputy, has resulted in a “growing concern” of the society of Macao in the face of possible conflicts of interest and cases of corruption.
Responding to an interpellation previously presented by Coutinho, in 2023, the then director of administration and civil service services (SAFP) stressed that the obligation to disclose curricula and declaration of assets only covered the heads of public administration services, excluding civil servants. In this new interpellation of 2025, Coutinho opposes that it was clarified “the issue of control by society about members from the private sector who perform functions in public commissions and funds”, raising serious doubts about possible “conflicts between the functions performed and the personal or professional interests of the designated” and “compromising the public interest and the integrity of the treasury”.
Without the disclosure of the data of these workers - including academic qualifications, academic experience, private positions and participation in stock market companies and companies - it is not possible to ensure “a credible, reliable and transparent system that allows society to oversee these conflicts”. Instead, each worker becomes self-assessment only for his own “individual ethical criteria”.
In this regard, José Pereira Coutinho argues: “Ethical standards are subjective and variable, which urgently makes the need to implement a collective conduct code applicable to all. (…) It is essential to create a legal framework that not only regulates and sanction conflicts of interest, but also ensure transparency and public monitoring of economic, commercial and professional interests of position holders ”.
 
Thus, the deputy requests the government to explain the criteria he will use to appoint “members of funds, advisory councils and other entities in the service of the public interest”, as well as the electronic platforms in which they will be made available. It also questions that efforts will be undertaken to create a “legal framework that not only regulates and sanction conflicts of interest, but also ensure the transparency and public monitoring of economic, commercial and professional interests.

One of the highlights of the event was the launch of the “Map of Certified Hengqin and Macau stores”, which will facilitate consumer access to trusting establishments.
 
On World Consumer Rights Day, celebrated on March 15, the Consumer Council (CC) has taken a significant initiative to foster confidence and safety in consumption between Macau and Zhuhai. During an event that brought together several authorities and representatives of both regions, the CC signed a cooperation agreement aimed at establishing a more reliable environment for consumers, while promoting the “Certified Store” brand.
The agreement was signed between the CC and several Zhuhai entities, including the Zhuhai City Development and Reform Administration and the Market Regulation Administration. The main objective of this agreement is to create a cooperation mechanism that approximates the certification requirements of “certified stores” between the two jurisdictions, promoting recognition and mutual promotion of the brand. The signature ceremony took place in Zhuhai and was attended by the vice president of the Municipal Popular Government of Zhuhai, Huang Zhenqiu, as well as the secretary general of the Guangdong Province Consumer Council, Yang Shuona.
Honesty was highlighted as a central element for the construction of a safe consumption environment. With the signing of this agreement, it is expected to facilitate not only the interconnection between consumer protection rules, but also stimulate integrated economic development in the large Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Bay. The CC believes that the joint creation of the “Certified Store” brand will help increase the confidence of residents and tourists, encouraging them to consume more safely in the regions involved.
One of the main innovations presented during the event was the “Certified Hengqin and Macao stores map”. This tool will be available through the “Macao Certified Store” mini -program and will include information about certified stores in both regions. This measure intends, according to the CC, to facilitate access to residents and tourists to consumer information, improving the purchase experience and promoting security in commercial transactions.
In addition to the launch of the map, the event was promoted by several collaborative projects between the two regions. Among them, it stands out a comparative test of baby diapers and diapers, which will be developed in partnership with the consumer association of the deepened cooperation zone between Guangdong and Macau. A coloring contest was also announced for primary students, entitled “Macau and Hengqin linked by honesty”, which aims to educate and foster awareness of consumer rights since childhood.
The authorities also highlighted the importance of awareness and promotion of the “Certified Store” brand. The CC participated in an event in Zhongshan, where it set up a specific zone designed to publicize the quality symbol of Macao's “certified store”. The presence of the CC at this event was a strategy to increase consumer visibility and confidence regarding consumption in Macao, encouraging residents of other cities in the Great Bay to visit and consume in Macao. With these initiatives, CC Aspira creates a safer and more reliable consumer environment, as well as contributing to the economic development of the large bay, benefiting both local and tourist consumers.</description><pubDate>2025-03-17 01:54:24</pubDate></item><item><title>Rui Cunha Foundation explores Gongbi technique with painting exhibition “Burning like a lotus”</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/03/17/fundacao-rui-cunha-explora-a-tecnica-gongbi-com-exposicao-de-pintura-burning-like-a-lotus/</link><description>The painter Zou Li will present a collection of 30 pieces of art of its own between Tuesday and April 5.

The demonstrations occur at a time when the South Korean Constitutional Court will decide next week about the formal dismissal of Yoon's position due to the imposition of martial law in December 2024.
Turning tracks and posters that demand the dismissal of the conservative president, large multitudes of anti-Yoon protesters filled the streets near the court, where police had recently reinforced security in anticipation of the expected decision next week.
Yoon's supporters gathered on nearby streets, shaking South Korean and American flags, and appealing to the return of their hero, whose mischievous power took memories of the military dictatorships in the 1980s.
Police sent thousands of agents to maintain security and there were no immediate reports of large clashes or injured.
The organizers of the anti-Yoon protests estimated the influx of 1.1 million people, while police estimated that the number of participants was in tens of thousands.
Marching towards the streets near the court, the protesters sang and chanted slogans demanding Yoon's dismissal and his arrest because of the imposition of the short time, which lasted a short time on December 3.
Yoon's powers were suspended after the opposition -controlled National Assembly, dismissed it 11 days later, on the 14th. "We can't wait for a single day," said one of the protest leaders on stage. "This is the order of our citizens - the Constitutional Court must immediately remove Yoon Suk Yeol, the leader of the rebellion!"
For Yoon to be formally removed from office, at least six of the eight judges in the Constitutional Court have to approve the motion of dismissal approved by the deputies. If they do not, Yoon's presidential powers will be immediately restored.
Chung Sung-Il, a 72-year-old anti-Yonon, said he expected the court to depart Yoon, "100 percent."  "If he is reinstated, many dangerous things can happen," he warned.
Pró-Yoon demonstrations were attended by members of the conservative popular power party, including Yoon Sang-Hyun, deputy in the last five terms, who defended the imposition of martial law by the president as an attempt to lock the “legislative dictatorship” of the liberals, which obstructed their agenda with the majority in the assembly.
The crowd repeatedly sang the name of Yoon Suk Yeol and grasped posters where they read the National Assembly. ” "President Yoon has declared the martial law to protect South Free and Democratic Korea," said Jin Woo-chan, a 20-year-old Yoon supporter.
Yoon argued that the martial decree was necessary to overcome the “anti-state” liberal opposition, which, he said, improperly used the legislative majority to block his agenda.
Despite the blocks of hundreds of strongly armed military, the deputies gathered a quorum and unanimously voted for the survey of martial law, hours after Yoon declared it. The Constitution limits the exercise of such powers to times of war or comparable national emergencies.
Yoon's legal saga, which also includes a criminal accusation separated by rebellion, stirred state matters, diplomacy and the economy and became a test of resistance to the country's democracy.
Their lawyers and the power party openly put into question the credibility of the courts and institutions responsible for the application of the law and Yoon continued to express contempt for their liberal rivals, supporting unfounded conspiracy theories about electoral fraud to justify the failed authoritarian invested. If the Constitutional Court rejects Yoon, this will trigger an early presidential election within two months. Lusa</description><pubDate>2025-03-17 01:54:38</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
