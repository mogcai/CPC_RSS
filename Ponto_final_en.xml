The Macao International Airport Society (CAM) anticipates that passenger movements have reached 1.85 million by March, and flights will increase 1.5% over last year, corresponding to 14,000 flights.
CAM said it was “satisfied” with the addition and expects the volume of passengers and flights to maintain gradual growth in the coming months.

Bangkok Governor Chadchart Sittipunt visited the affected area to observe the search and rescue efforts of 78 construction workers who are still missing, according to the latest official data. Sittipunt said that three or four “vital signs”, which described as weak, were detected through sensors, and stressed that the collapse occurred during the evacuation of the shipyard, so experts believe that many of the missing may be on the emergency stairs. "This is considered a potentially positive signal, since the stairs structure is reinforced, almost like a protective enclosure. The ladder contains stacked floors and internal cavities, which can provide adequate spaces for survival," he noted. The governor of the capital emphasized the importance of the 72 -hour period as crucial to finding living people under the huge lot of cement, iron and glass left by the collapse of this 30 -story building located in the north of the capital, near the Chatuchak tourist market.
Rescue teams are using dogs, drones, a thermographic camera to detect body heat and digitizations to three dimensions of the structure to locate people. A team of US soldiers are already on site, while more international rescue teams should arrive to help in the complex mission. To date, the emergency teams have recovered 11 bodies in this place. Due to the shaking, at least 18 people died, another 33 were injured and 78 are missing in Bangcoque, the capital of Thailand, according to the latest balance of local authorities, released on Sunday. The magnitude 7.7 earthquake on the Richter scale was recorded at 6:20 am on Friday and caused more than 1,700 dead at Myanmar, the country's military junta said yesterday. Government spokesman controlled by the board, Major General Zaw Min Tun, told Burmese state broadcaster MRTV that another 3,400 people were injured and more than 300 are still missing.</description><pubDate>2025-04-01 02:27:15</pubDate></item><item><title>Government will assign subsidies for research and development of AI technologies</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/04/01/governo-vai-atribuir-subsidios-para-investigacao-e-desenvolvimento-de-tecnologias-de-ia/</link><description>In response to a written interpellation of a deputy from AL, the director of regional policy and development study services acknowledged that the area of ​​artificial intelligence is “priority” to the government of Macao, being an “irreplaceable” reality in the industrial modernization of large cities. Among the plans projected for the near future are the assignment of subsidies and support mechanisms to companies and universities, in order to boost the transfer of AI scientific research results in commercialized products.
 
The Government of MSAR considers artificial intelligence “fundamental” for the social, scientific and technological development of the region, by contributing to the efficiency and “productivity” of public services and promoting industrial modernization. The executive also commites to reinforce the mechanisms of support for universities and technological companies that are dedicated to the study and production of new cutting-edge technologies-translated above all in the assignment of subsidies or patents.
The statements were made by Cheong Chok Man, director of Policy Study Services and Regional Development (DSEPDR), in response to a written interpellation of Deputy Si Ka Lon on the development of artificial intelligence in the territory. In his intervention, the deputy stressed that the integration of AI in government systems or public services is already a reality in the “large cities of the world”, installing the Macao government to follow the progress of this “priority area of ​​cutting -edge technology”. Thus, the deputy raised two questions: the first concerning the definition of a strategic plan to implement technology, and the second questioning about the efforts that will be made to convert the results of scientific investigations into commercialized products.
In the response document, the DSEPDR director begins by stressing that “the government of MSAR values ​​the development of artificial intelligence, as much as its importance in increasing productivity”, considering it a “fundamental” area in the efficiency of public services and “irreplaceable” in the promotion of industrial modernization. In this framework, Cheong Chok Man recalled the “Adequate Diversification Plan of the Economy of the Special Administrative Region of Macau (2024-2028)”, designed in 2023, which defines AI as “the following priority development” in Macao, in order to “inject a new dynamism to the region's development”.
Under the parameters already defined in this plan, the person responsible continues, “the Government of Mand will strive to develop new quality productive forces, the improvement of the tax benefits mechanism, the attribution of research and development subsidies, as well as in the capture of qualified framework and in legal regimes, among other political guarantees”. Alongside these initiatives, a “highly efficient” scientific and technological cooperation platform will be built.
As for the second question posed by Deputy Si Ka Lon, he recalled that the Fund for the Development of Science and Technology (FDCT) has since 2021 launched “a series of measures” for the development of projects focused on practical applications. Projects supported by the financing program includes “those who were developed by local companies or higher education institutions and who are related to the application of artificial intelligence, covering areas such as the smart city, intelligent health and the internet of things”. The concrete results of this application are visible in various parameters, from health (through, for example, the automatic diagnosis of disease) to cybersecurity (such as safety patrolling robots in university hotels and campuses).
The response to interpellation says that, in addition to the measures already implemented and the results obtained, the FDCT will “strive” in the promotion of new actions, with the aim of “boosting further the transfer of research results to the market”. Among the plans contemplated, the acceleration of “entry of existing technologies in concept certification phases”; the reinforcement of “support for collaborative projects between industry and gym that have private funding”; the “continuous survey of the technological needs of Macao companies and the in -depth cooperation zone”; the creation of a “patent assignment system for collaborative projects between companies and universities”; the availability of “platforms for exposure and interaction” for technological companies and local research projects; or support mechanisms for the creation of start-ups.

After the Port of Callao, in the center of Peru, Macau was the choice of the University of Portsmouth in the United Kingdom to investigate as maritime communities from the so -called global south crossed one of the milestones of the Industrial Revolution, the transition from sail to steam.
Relief commercial warehouse, Macao has a very rich story linked to the sea, a factor that weighed on the center's decision and maritime cultures (PCMC, British acronym) at the British University. "It is probably one of the first European enclaves in East Asia and has a long history of international travel by the sea from 1500," Melanie Bassett researcher Lusa told Lusa.
The creation of a doctoral research scholarship will bring to the territory an academic, whose mission is still to understand how these communities can adapt to a sustainable future. "We then want to look at new energy transitions, to decarbonization, how Macau is making this transition and if people are aware of the changes," added Bassett, who leads the project "From Vapor Sailing, from Carbon to Green: Training Port Communities in the Global South [Sail to Steam, Carbon to Green: Empowering Port Communitiesin The Global South]" Portsmouth.
The project, which extends for a period of six and a half years, started in February, with the investigation to focus on the Peruvian Port of Callao, but should later expand to two other regions “somewhere in the Indian subcontinent and West Africa”.
Only the investigation will bring tangible results, but Bassett points out that, with the primacy of the steam vessel, the travel of communities and industries were generally away from the sea waterfront. Changes have also occurred in several businesses linked to the sector, from the fishing industry to naval construction.
“We anticipate this kind of changes, but also with the advent of European colonization, we see changes in cultures and architecture and how it affects the population, and then how, over time, these cultures merge and hybridize to create new cultures and new understandings of the world,” he said. “It's part of Lloyds Register Foundation's financing to learn from the past,” Bassett added, referring to the project's funder who, in the case of Macau, will have the collaboration of the University of Macao and the local Maritime Museum.
It is also expected to have communities active in research. Therefore, the recruitment of the academic that will lead the investigation requires language skills to ensure communication with the population. Recruitment for this research that is divided between Portsmouth and Macau is expected to be completed in April, and the project starts in October.

Together, they acted as moderators in a conversation that brought together teachers, students from the University of Hong Kong and visitors of Art Basel, all interested in the nuances of Chinese landscape painting.
Thus, it was reflected on the meaning of contemplation of nature and landscape aesthetics, themes that reverberate in contemporary art. Tsang Tseng Tseng's talk not only highlighted the relevance of landscape painting, but also created a dialogue space on its impact on the artistic communities of Macau and Hong Kong.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>China's industrial activity reaches the highest value in 12 months</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/04/01/actividade-industrial-da-china-atinge-em-marco-valor-mais-elevado-em-12-meses/</link><description>China's transforming industry activity has grown in March to the fastest pace of the last 12 months, according to data released by the National Statistics Office (NBS).
 
The Purchasing Managers Index (PMI), the industry's reference indicator in March 50.5 points, 0.3 points above the previous month (50.2), thus complying with analysts' predictions.
In this indicator, a value above the 50 -point threshold represents a growth in sector activity compared to the previous month, while a value below represents a contraction.
Among the five subsidies that make up the PMI of the transforming industry, those of production, new orders-fundamental to measure demand-and the deadlines of delivery were above the brand, while those of raw materials and employment remained in the contraction zone.
The NBS statistician Zhao Qinghe attributed the recovery of the sector in March to the definitive dissipation of the impact of the Lunar New Year, the main vacation season in China, which weighed on the transforming industry in January after three consecutive months of growth.
Julian Evans-Pritchard, an analyst at British consultant Capital Economics, noted in a report that the upset of new orders in March may be due to the fact that US importers have anticipated their purchases of Chinese goods before new customs rates enter into force. "Export orders have risen to their highest level since last April," noted the analyst.
NBS also reported yesterday that the PMI for services and construction sectors recovered from 50.4 points in February to 50.8 points in the month that ended yesterday.
This result exceeded the expectations of analysts, who expected this indicator to be located at 50.5 points, at the same level as the PMI of the transforming industry.
In any case, it is the construction sector, which rose from 52.7 to 53.4 points, which is pulling the pace: the service sector, which had been stable in February, rose 0.3 points to 50.3 points. "Officers suggest that infrastructure expenses are recovering ... The construction PMI has risen to a maximum of 10 months, probably driven by fiscal support," Evans-Pritchard explained.
The compound PMI, which combines the evolution of transformative and non -transformative industries, rose from 51.1 in February to 51.4 points in March.
The capital Economics stressed that this leaves the average of the first quarter of 2025 below the last quarter of 2024, pointing to "a quarterly contraction in GDP growth that will be seen even more in the annual data due to a low flattering comparative effect." “We doubt the rest of the year is much better. Budgets allow for greater budget support in the coming months, but US rates, which will increase this week, will start to weigh on exports sooner or later,” noted Evans-Pritchard.
