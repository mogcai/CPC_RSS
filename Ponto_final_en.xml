Takahiro Shiraishi was sentenced to death in 2020 for murdering, quartering and storing the bodies of nine victims in his 2017 apartment.
 
A Japanese convicted of homicide and quartering of nine people was made Friday, said the Japan Ministry of Justice, in a decision that was convicted by the International AMNYNISTY ORGANIZATION (AI).
Takahiro Shiraishi, 34, was sentenced to death in 2020 for murdering, quartering and storing the bodies of the nine victims in his apartment in the locality of Zama, in Kanagawa, near Tokyo in 2017.
The Japanese-who became known as the “Twitter killer”, as he contacted the victims through this social network-declared himself guilty for the murders during the trial.
Amnesty International condemned the execution of Takahiro Shiraishi, the first in almost three years in Japan, as a huge setback for human rights in the country.
As has done on countless occasions, AI denounced the appeal to the death penalty as an inhuman and useless punishment, before insisting on its immediate abolition around the world. "The execution of Takahiro Shiraishi, the first in Japan in almost three years, is the latest cruel attack on the right to life in Japan and a major setback for the country's human rights history," said International Human Rights Advisor Chiara Sangiogio, in a statement.
Chiara Sangorgio recalled the acquittal last year of Iwao Hakamada, a man who spent more than 50 years in the corridor of death for a crime he did not commit and ended up having serious mental health problems due to the lone confinement in which he was.
AI indicated that this was "a case that exposed the injustice of the Japanese Criminal Judicial System." "Now, instead of advancing for a reform and ensuring full protection of human rights, the government has chosen to resume executions, in a huge setback for the efforts to eradicate the death penalty in Japan," added AI advisor, reporting that 113 countries around the world have completely abolished the death penalty in their legislation and more than 144 abandoned it in legislation or practice. Chiara Sangiorgio also lamented the "secretism" surrounding the executions in Japan, "which makes the use of this punishment even more cruel."
Japan now has 105 people in the death corridor, including 49 seeking to have new judgments.

The League was founded in 2006 and is considered by Beijing as a “radical faction” of the Hong Kong Pro-Democracy Movement.
 
The Social Democratic League, one of the last opposition parties in Hong Kong, announced that the movement will be dissolved after five years of political repression by Beijing. The League was founded in 2006 and is considered by the Popular Republic of China as a “radical faction” of the Pro-Democracy Movement in the Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong.
Political formation was known for street campaigns, often led by activist Leung Kwok-Hung, who is arrested. "Next year will mark the 20th anniversary of the Social Democratic League. However, we will not survive until that day and we will announce our dissolution," the party said in a message to journalists.
The movement has always campaigned for the defense of democracy in Hong Kong, also criticizing the social and economic inequality present in the Special Chinese administrative region. “When the system cannot correctly represent the demands of the people and become an instrument of the ruling class, we have to support a mass movement outside the system to exercise pressure on those in power,” says the political movement through the official portal.
The Social Democratic League even held three places on the Hong Kong Legislative Council, the local parliament.
The decline began when the Central Government of Beijing imposed the National Security Law on the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in 2020, following the major pro-democracy protests of the previous year.
The Popular Republic of China and the local Hong Kong government claimed that the law was necessary to repress political agitation, but many critics consider that the legislation stifled the dissent and restricted rights.
The National Security Act contradicts the diplomatic treaties signed with the London government and defended the rights, freedoms and guarantees to citizens of the former British colony until 2047.
A member of the Hong Kong Legislative Council from 2004 to 2017, Leung Kwok-Hung, leader of the Social Democrats League, was first arrested in 2021.They with 44 other pro-democracy activists, was sentenced last year to six years and nine months in prison in the largest trial ever in Hong Kong for “undermining” national security, triggering a wave of international protests.
The party has organized small demonstrations in recent years, under strong police surveillance. Four members of the movement, including the current leader Chan Po-Ying, were fined this month for collecting “unauthorized” money in street campaigns.

Chen Dong and Chen Zhongruui went abroad from the central module of the station, where they remained about six and a half hours, while the third member of the Wang Jie crew collaborated from the interior.
The operation was supported by Tiangong's robotic arm and the terrestrial control team, indicated the same source.
During the space walk, astronauts installed a new space debris protection device, performed inspection and maintenance work on external equipment and set up adapters that should reduce the duration of future extra vehicle outputs by about 40 minutes.
The Shenzhou-20 Mission was launched in April from the Jiuquan base in northwestern China and the crew will remain in orbit for approximately six months.
During this period, the three astronauts will conduct scientific experiments, technical tests and new extra vehicle activities.
Tiangong space station orbits about 400 kilometers from Earth and was designed to operate for at least a decade.
With the expected end of the International Space Station, led by the United States and from which China was excluded, Tiangong could be briefly in the only space station in operation.
China has invested heavily in the space program in recent years, having already managed to land the Chang'e 4 probe on the hidden side of the moon-a world debut-and send a mission to Mars, becoming the third country, after the United States and the former Soviet Union, being able to land on the red planet.
The Asian country also plans to build, in collaboration with Russia and other partners, a scientific basis at the southern pole of the moon.</description><pubDate>2025-07-02 05:16:56</pubDate></item><item><title>Large -scale emergency simulacrum conducted at the new prison establishment</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/07/02/realizado-simulacro-de-emergencia-de-grande-escala-no-novo-estabelecimento-prisional-2/</link><description>The new prison established a large -scale emerging incident simulacrum performed by the Unit Police Services (SPU). Scenarios such as prison riot, hostage, attempting to escape, explosive treatment and pursuit of suspects were simulated. "The achievement was successful and achieved the planned results," the SPU say in a statement.
The exercise, which lasted about an hour and ten minutes, was attended by 419 people, including various safety and health services services.
This exercise was the first joint interdepartal emergency exercise of large -scale interdepartal emergency since the change of Coloane Prison (EPC) to the new installation in Ká Ho, “with the aim of evaluating the coordination mechanism between security services and other government services in response to large -scale emergencies in the prison establishment”.
In the completion discourse, Wong Sio Chak stated that this exercise "demonstrated the high efficiency of interdepartal joint operation and practical and professional competences of services, as well as manifesting the scientific and effective qualities of the emergency response plan in force."
According to the Secretary for Security, all services should review this exercise carefully, so that the review is fulfilled in a detail in the emergency response plan and that the use of tactics can be improved, making the plan broader and powerful. However, "services must remain alert, strictly implement the security and management mechanisms in order to build the security barrier of the new prison."</description><pubDate>2025-07-02 05:16:53</pubDate></item><item><title>Announced Mental Health Support Platform 24 hours a day for the fourth quarter</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/07/02/anunciada-plataforma-de-apoio-a-saude-mental-24-horas-por-dia-para-o-quarto-trimestre-2/</link><description>Health services have announced the creation of a 24-hour mental health support platform, a work that is expected to start in the fourth quarter of this year. Authorities will also add to the application for “single account” mobile phone the self-assessment of the psychological state, which covers mental health, depression, anxiety and sleep health tests. The Institute of Social Action, in turn, will introduce in day care the project of generalization of education on the cognition and management of emotions.
 
The government plans to provide online psychological counseling service that operates 24 hours a day without interruption. Health services reveal that they will create a mental health support platform during this period, whose work will start in the fourth quarter of this year.

The official also indicated that he will raise the diagnosis and psychological treatment of health centers.
Alvis Lo recalled that the government has created the “Electronic Mental Health Information Page” to sensitize residents and provide adequate means of support to the needy people. The electronic page provides a self-assessment of the psychological state, which covers mental health tests, depression, anxiety and sleep health. These tests will be integrated later this year in the “My Health” of the application for Macao's “Single Account” mobile phone, the authorities said. "Health services will reinforce the dissemination and promotion, so that more residents can know the channels of access to mental health services in Macau," they said.
According to the results of monitoring suicide deaths in Macao by health services, in the first quarter of the year 18 cases of death by suicide were recorded. The Institute of Social Action (IAS) received, during the same period, communications corresponding to a total of 84 cases of suicide for follow -up. Official data show that last year 91 people died from suicide and 249 tried to commit suicide.
"Work in mental health continues to face challenges. The government must adopt active measures […], with a view to raising the mental health of residents and, at the same time, reinforcing their support system, encouraging more people who need to seek help from their own initiative, in order to reduce the occurrence of tragedies," said Nick Law.
Alvis Lo stated that there are 108 mental health professionals in Macau who, "in collaboration with stakeholders, can meet the needs of residents in the context of mental health services." Nevertheless, he has admitted that he will continue to train more medical psychiatry specialists and reinforce the construction of the mental health team. The 108 professionals include 16 psychiatry specialists and 25 superior psychology technicians in health services, six psychologists in other public services, three psychiatry specialists and 58 private sector psychologists.
Health services also mentioned that IAS will introduce in day care the project of generalization of education on cognition and emotion management. According to IAS, the project will soon be presented to the sector and will then advance with the preliminary formation with which day care workers will be able to master the respective knowledge and techniques applied.
IAS will be responsible for the professional institutions in the fourth quarter to provide advanced formations, as well as to develop a manual for education in the activities of activities for the development of children's emotions and assistance guidelines, whose work should be completed by 2026.</description><pubDate>2025-07-02 05:13:56</pubDate></item><item><title>André Cheong reiterates the importance of the “nuclear values” of love to the homeland and Macau</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/07/02/andre-cheong-reitera-importancia-dos-valores-nucleares-do-amor-a-patria-e-a-macau-2/</link><description>Yesterday the reopening ceremony of the commemorative gallery of the Macao Basic Law was held.

The event of the Directorate of Tourism Services (STD) aimed to emphasize the cultural and tourist attractions of Macau - from gastronomy to sports events - and encourage greater tourist flow from the neighboring region at the time.
The opening ceremony took place on Saturday at the first floor atrium of the East Point City shopping center. In her speech, STD director Maria Helena de Senna Fernandes recalled the importance of the Hong Kong tourist market - the second largest in Macao, only outdated in the interior of China - and underlined the close geographical relationship between both regions, integrated into the “one -hour circle”.
The opening ceremony was led by the actress and radio announcer Kitty Yuen and was attended by several known guys from Hong Kong's popular culture, which highlighted Macao's various attraction points. Jeremy Lee and Stanley Yau, members of the Mirror music group, “shared suggestions to explore Macau highlighting unmissable photogenic points and gastronomic recommendations,” according to a statement later released by STD.
There was also room for musical shows and sports competitions: while singer Windy Zhan drew attention to the artistic and cultural side of Macao with a musical action, athletes NG Wing Nam and Lee Ho Ching played a table tennis match to promote “world -class sporting events” that take place in the territory. Among the activities made throughout the two-day event, the musical performance of Macau Vivian Chan and a dance show starred by young artists, accompanied by the Mak Mak Mak mascot.
The space was divided into two thematic zones-one centered on history and culture and another in the possibilities of entertainment and leisure offered in the region. The “Historic Center of Macau” contemplated the diverse culture of Macau and the Portuguese elements much present in the region, recreating the institute building for municipal affairs (AMI) and allowing visitors to experience typically Portuguese costumes. On the other hand, the “Explore Macau” area had interactive games and “aquatic, terrestrial and aerial activities”, as well as a space for the promotion of hengqin tourist resources.
In a statement, STD ensures that “it intends to continue to carry out promotional actions in the Hong Kong market through different means”, with the aim of “further consolidating the visitors market”.</description><pubDate>2025-07-02 05:16:58</pubDate></item><item><title>Pandas twins from Macau were nine years old and were entitled to cake and visits</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/07/02/pandas-gemeos-de-macau-fizeram-nove-anos-e-tiveram-direito-a-bolo-e-visitas-2/</link><description>The twin pandas of Macau, Jian Jian and Kang Kang celebrated the ninth birthday last Thursday. The Institute for Municipal Affairs (AMI) organized a birthday party and invited local teachers and students to participate in the celebration and send their votes to the Pandas brothers. Jian Jian and Kang Kang, whose names told together mean “health”, were born in Macao and are children of the giant panda couple offered by the central government to the masters. According to the AI, during the party at the Panda Gigante de Macao, Seac Pai Van park, the keepers prepare cold birthday cakes with fresh fruits and vegetables, and the guests sang congratulations to the pandes and took pictures with them.
In Macau are living four pandas from the same family, including the 17 -year -old father “Kai Kai”, the 18 -year -old mother “Xin Xin”, whose names together mean “happiness”, as well as the twins “Jian Jian” and “Kang Kang”. AMI stresses that, in everyday care of care, the team, in addition to giving food and cleaning the pandes, also performs medical examinations in order to understand their health. The team of keepers conducts behavioral training for giant pandas to teach them how to cooperate and adapt to exams. "Currently, the family of giant pandas can be subjected to blood harvesting, measurement of arterial tension, heart rate measurement and palpation under non -anesthetic conditions," he said. As for food, the team selects Guangdong or Sichuan bamboo, according to the station, and bamboo shoots are also included in meals and complemented with apples, pears and fiber -rich cookies.
Panda is an animal with special symbolism for China, also playing a role in the country's diplomacy level, which has the tradition of sending these animals to foreign zoos. The International Union for Nature Conservation (UICN) removed, in 2016, the giant panda from the list of the most endangered species, whose classification descended from “endangered” to “vulnerable”. China data indicate that the population of Pandas in freedom has grown to 1,900, compared to 1,100 from the 80s. According to AMI, the reasons that led to the low number of the species are the worsening of climate change, the impact of human activities, the poor reproduction capacity and the only panda feeding source.</description><pubDate>2025-07-02 05:16:54</pubDate></item><item><title>34 creative cities will participate in the International Gastronomy Festival in July</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/07/02/34-cidades-criativas-vao-participar-na-festa-internacional-da-gastronomia-em-julho-2/</link><description>Macao becomes the world capital of flavors with the “International Festival of Cities of Gastronomy”. Under the theme “Spices and Aromatic Herbs”, the event will offer a gastronomic trip for over 100 international newsstands, renowned chefs and a forum on spice culture. Between dishes that tell stories and aromas that cross borders, the event consolidates its role as a platform where cultures are at the table.
 
From July 11 to 20, Macau will host the “International Festival of Cities of Gastronomy”, one of the largest calendar events in the region. Organized by the Directorate of Tourism Services (STD), this initiative will bring together representatives of 34 UNESCO Creative Cities of Gastronomy from 21 countries from the six continents, transforming Macao into a platform for cultural and tourist exchange.
The event, which will have as its central theme “Spices and Aromatic Herbs”, will occupy the Praça do Coliseu Romano and the Legend Boulevard of the fishermen's dock in the Nape area. In addition to creative cities in gastronomy, seven creative cities will participate in other artistic areas, two Chinese candidates to the UNESCO network and two “East Asia Cultural Cities 2025”.
The programming is divided into three main components. The International Gastronomy Avenue will feature more than 100 newsstands distributed by various origins: 25 stalls will represent cities in the interior of China such as Chengdu, Shunde, Yangzhou, Huai'an and Chaozhou; Nine newsstands will come from other Asian cities including Phuket, Thailand, Hatay, Turkey, Buraidah, Saudi Arabia, and Iloilo, in the Philippines; 52 stalls will present local macao gastronomy; and 11 new newsstands will represent Portuguese -speaking countries, especially Brazilian cities such as Florianópolis, Belém, Paraty and Belo Horizonte.

"After negotiations in London, the Chinese and American teams maintained a close communication. Recently, with the approval, both parties confirmed the details of the agreement," said a spokesman on the official portal of the Chinese Ministry of Commerce.
“We signed with China yesterday [Thursday], right? We just signed with China,” said US President Donald Trump earlier, during an event at the White House, not providing further details about the deal.
According to the document released by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce, “China will analyze and approve the export requests of controlled goods that comply with the conditions provided for by law”, in an apparent reference to the rare lands, essential minerals for sectors such as defense and the automobile, whose production is controlled by China, which imposed restrictions on its sale abroad in early April.
In return, the US Trade Department said “the United States will cancel a series of restrictive measures adopted against China” without providing details. "The United States and China are expected to find a commitment and meet the important consensus and the demands achieved by the heads of state on June 5," the statement stressed, referring to telephone conversation between the US and China presidents, Donald Trump and Xi Jinping, who has unlocked the situation and allowed commercial representatives of both powers to meet in London.
China thus confirms Trump's statements, which revealed that the United States had signed the deal with China the day before.
In mid-June, after two days of negotiations in the British capital, the Republican leader indicated that the deal included a 55% US fare on Chinese products and a 10% rate on US products to China.
The London Agreement provided for the establishment of a structure to implement the "consensus" reached by Xi and Trump in that telephone conversation, although it was still pending the final approval of both leaders for their signature.
This round of negotiations sought to relieve tensions between the two powers, after having accused themselves to violate an agreement signed in Geneva, Switzerland in May. This agreement had started a 90-day commercial truce, according to which China would reduce its rates on US products from 125% to 10%, while the US would reduce rates on Chinese products from 145% to 30%.
China claimed, at the time, that the US violated the truce by restricting the export of artificial intelligence chips (AI), suspending sales of software to semiconductor design and threatening to revoke the visas of Chinese students. Washington believed that Beijing was not honoring the pact due to the restrictions previously referred to for rare land exports.
After his return to the White House, Trump intensified the trade war he had already started in 2018, launching a tariff climbing against China that resulted in practice in a kind of commercial embargo among the two largest economic powers in the world. The US even imposed tariffs up to 145% on China, which accounted for 125% tariffs on US products.
The US president also said that the United States are "receiving great offers" from other governments and suggested that the next country with which one can reach an agreement is India. "We have one on the way, perhaps with India, a very big deal," said Trump.

Ji Xianzheng attributes criticism to the Forum for Economic and Commercial Cooperation between China and Portuguese -speaking countries, created in October 2003, to an wrong interpretation of the body's mission. "The forum is a mechanism of cooperation between the central governments," he said. "A lot of people think it is to the secretariat that it is up to the policies, but we have a limited number of people," added Ji. "The secretariat has no investment projects, is a mechanism for preparing the ministerial conference, connecting with governments, is not a promotion agency. It has not been thought, connects with the promotion agencies. We are four people sent by China and one delegate for each country," said the secretary general.
At the last ministerial conference, in April 2024, then Portuguese Economy Minister Pedro Reis argued that the Portuguese Language China-Parais Cooperation and Development Fund should bet more on small and medium enterprises (SMEs).
The Cooperation Fund was created in 2013 by the China Development Bank and the Macao Industrial and Commercial Development Fund, with a thousand million dollars, of which about 60% have already been invested, according to the secretary general.
Ji Xianzheng has admitted that SMEs are "a difficult theme for any government" and that "international cooperation for the promotion of development and cooperation of small and medium enterprises is even more difficult. It is a topic that is being debated daily worldwide." But admitted, "here, little." "But it is stipulated in the action plan [2024-2026]. It is up to central governments and commerce chambers, promotion agents, to work together. The secretariat assumes responsibility as authorized by the central governments, specifically, in the activity program," he said.
Politicians from various countries, including Portugal, Angola and Mozambique, have appealed to a change in the rules of the fund's candidacy.
The current rules require, for example, that candidate projects have a minimum investment of $ five million, and the fund only covers 20% of the total investment, referring the rest to governments or companies.
Ji Xianzheng said the fund's new direction "is committed to promoting a broader investment, with better coverage for all forum countries, [relatively] to projects that have a strategic or significant impact on the socioeconomic development of participating countries."
According to the secretary general, "the terms of application [of the rules of access to the background] will be more flexible and the forms of application will also be more diverse." “Instead of just being direct investment, they are also studying ways to apply the fund, in cooperation with other funds or with other financial institutions,” he gave as an example.
"This fund has an operation according to market rules. It is not a humanitarian aid fund. Therefore, it has to guarantee the minimum return of benefit. But on that, they are very open to study, if by case the conditions of each project," added Ji Xianzheng, but to give examples of "flexibility of rules."
 
Macao Forum “never discussed” widening to Hispanic countries
 
The Secretary-General of the Macao Forum stated that the institution “never discussed” to create an entity to widen to Hispanic countries to promote economic cooperation similar to those who provide the China-Parais connection of Portuguese. “Within the Macao Forum, we have never discussed this theme,” he said in an interview with Lusa, the Secretary-General of the Forum for Economic and Commercial Cooperation between China and Portuguese-speaking countries Ji Xianzheng.
The official acknowledged that, "in society, there were some conversations to discuss or address the possibility of promoting more contact and cooperation with Spanish -language countries, but at the Forum level we have never addressed this theme."
The Macao executive announced in mid -April the intention of creating a center to promote economic services between China and the Portuguese and Spanish languages ​​in the neighboring Special Economic Zone of Hengqin.
The idea is to provide companies in Hispanic countries services in the “linguistic, legal, fiscal, verification of the observance of norms, formation, arbitration and mediation”, according to the secretary for Macao Administration and Justice, André Cheong.
Days earlier, the leader of the Macao government, Sam Hou Fai, had also announced the intention of “promoting exchange and cooperation” through Macau, between China and the universe of Spanish -speaking countries.
Although Macau wants to widen focus to Castilian -speaking countries, “the forum will remain the forum for China and Lusophony countries,” said Ji Xianzheng.
The secretary general clarified that the institution that directs "can contribute contributions to the greater opening of Macao in international cooperation", as is the intention announced by the new government of MSAR.
Personally, he said he had “all the pleasure of working with all parties”, but stressed that this is a “decision that is up to central governments to make” and that the forum has never been contacted in this regard. "Yes, I worked in Latin America, Spain, nine years in Madrid and Caracas. But this is not a decision of personal interest, it is up to politicians to make the decision," he said, explaining that the idea will be to promote the relationship between Macao and Brazil and then to other Latin American countries, as well as extending the relationship with Portugal to Spain. "There is no limit. The Macao Forum is complementary. It does not restrict any promotion of the cooperation of the other parts," he said.
According to the Macao Government Communication Office, Sam Hou Fai admitted last Saturday that he postponed a trip to Portugal, scheduled for July, and should also pass through Spain and the European Union headquarters in Brussels.

The subdirector of the Directorate of Tourism Services (STD) participated in the outreach event in Beijing, where she presented the current situation of tourism in the territory and reinforced her intention to make Macau a destination characterized by the “hospitality” of tour operators and residents.
 
Macau reached, for the first time, the first place in the 2024 ranking of the “10 most satisfactory destinations for Chinese tourists on foreign travel”, released last Thursday by the China Tourism Academy, subordinate to the Ministry of Culture and Tourism. Positioned in third place in 2023, the city has now risen to the top of the classification based on satisfaction surveys directed at travelers from the interior of China, who particularly praised the "entertainment and leisure offers" of the territory and the "attitude" of residents.
The results of the list are included in the “Chinese Tourist Satisfaction Report on Foreign Travel 2024”, prepared by the China Tourism Academy. The report of publicity of the report took place on Thursday, the 26th, in Beijing, and was the scene of “activities such as the dissemination of research results, thematic lectures and dialogues in the round table”, according to a statement from the Directorate of Tourism Services (STD). "These initiatives have allowed the exchange of ideas about the demand for travel for travel abroad and the innovative development of destinations in the New Age," the press release continues.
STD subdirector Jennifer Si Tou was present at the ceremony, where she shared the initiatives that have been implemented in Macao to promote and improve the tourist services of the territory. These include “the intersectory integration of the concept 'Tourism +', the combined formation ('online' and face-to-face) directed to the professionals of the sector and the quality tourism assessment program”, as well as the Macao courtesy campaign. This initiative, it is recalled, has often organized training actions designed for local tourist operators, with the purpose of improving courtesy and hospitality at reception to visitors around the world. According to data published by STD in mid -June, these lectures have already reached more than 1,500 professionals in a two -year period.
Although the game remains Macao's primary industry, STD guarantees in a statement that this performance “is the result of joint efforts from various parts of the city” to provide better and more diverse tourist offer. The measures implemented in this sense “intend to attract visitors from different markets, contributing to the proper diversification of the territory economy, the optimization, refining and strengthening of the integrated tourism and leisure industry, consolidating the position of Macao as a world center of tourism and leisure”.
Data from the Directorate of Statistics and Census Services (DSEC) prove the growing attraction of the continent's tourists by Macao. In May alone, visitors from the interior of China performed about 72.4% of the total number of tourists, representing an increase in the order of 31.4% compared to the previous month.
In addition to Macao, the most well rated destinations by Chinese tourists in 2024 were Singapore, England, New Zealand, Spain, Hong Kong, France, Australia, Malaysia and Argentina.</description><pubDate>2025-07-02 05:14:59</pubDate></item><item><title>DSAT did not properly supervise special taxis services, reveals audit</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/07/02/dsat-nao-fiscalizou-adequadamente-servicos-de-taxis-especiais-revela-auditoria-2/</link><description>Over the years, the Directorate of Services for Traffic Affairs (DSAT) has not properly supervised the services of the special taxis, whose dealership is the Macau Taxi Radio Services Company. The conclusions were taken by the audit commissioner in a report released on Friday. The report points out failures in the inspection of the minimum number of vehicles in operation, marking service and road safety. Raymond Tam, Secretary for Transport and Public Works, has already requested an internal investigation.
 
A report released on Friday by the Audit Commissioner (CA) revealed that the Directorate of Services for Traffic Affairs (DSAT) has been neglecting the supervision work of special taxi services.
At issue is the operation of 300 taxis, whose concession was attributed, in two lots, to the same concessionaire, the Golden Dragon group, linked to Chan Meng Kam, former deputy to the Legislative Assembly.
The concession contract stipulates that the service provided must be supervised by DSAT, however, the body “did not adequately comply with its inspection attributions,” says the audit report.
Regarding the inspection of the minimum number of vehicles in operation, the CA concluded that the concessionaire did not comply with what was stipulated in the concession contract for a long period of time, "the problem being particularly severe during the time of daytime traffic."
The audit report says that DSAT not only did not adequately oversee the operation of special taxis, but also adjusted, by its own initiative, the calculation of the minimum number of vehicles in operation, being less demanding with the concessionaire. Twice, the criterion of the minimum number of vehicles in operation was changed based on the justification of the concessionaire that said that the aging of vehicles was affecting the operation of special taxis
This, according to the CA, “damaged the public interest”, also pointing out that, before the criterion adjustments, DSAT had applied a fine for breach of contractual provisions on an occasion, but no sanctioning procedures were initiated after adjustments.
The audit gives as an example the situation of the so -called “red taxis” in January this year: according to the parameter adjusted by DSAT, the minimum number of vehicles in operation is reduced by about 24% compared to the calculated number using the original parameter. Even so, the concessionaire could not meet the criterion in every month during the analysis period.
On the other hand, considering that the vehicle operating ratio is fixed to different times, the concessionaire should have at least 20% of the fleet vehicles for mobilization purposes, “so the argument that the aging of vehicles affected the minimum number of vehicles in operation is not justified”.
In addition, the argument that the mere existence of “waiting” taxis could meet the population's travel needs “not justified”, since “besides relevant data show that the immediate call failure rate of special taxis is quite high, part of the situation is also based on the fact that the taxi call system only searches taxis within a specified area, that is, if a taxi is not if a taxi is not if a taxi is not if a taxi Finding in this specified area cannot be called immediately, hence it is difficult to prove the reasoning of DSAT, nor can it be used as a reason to adjust the criterion. ”
Regarding the inspection of the Marking and Highway Safety Service of the Special Taxis, “the concessionaire did not provide the marking service as required, not only not providing passengers information about its taken within the stipulated time, but also dramatically shortening the taxi assignment time through its own initiative”, says the audit.
Regarding any absences or delays due to the marking mechanism, "DSAT did not proactively control them using the operational records provided by the concessionaire." At the same time, it was found that half of the “red taxis” had not completed the installation of the behavior monitoring system and driving state before its entry into operation, as required, and that alert systems of about 25% of the “red taxis” had never been able to load any alert data to the dealership system, “continuing the problem by resolving almost six years after the entry into operation of the 'red taxis'. This highlights “insufficiency of DSAT's inspection efforts”.
“All above situations have resulted from the non -rigorous application of the relevant provisions of the DSAT concession and non -compliance contracts, its assignment attributions,” says the audit report, adding that “it is clearly unfair to competitors and potential competitors who have believed and complied with the rules of good faith if the concessionaire does not comply with the rules after a rigorous process. competition ”.
In addition, “DSAT should have made an exhaustive assessment and established corresponding clauses” before the second public tender, but did not change the “minimum number of vehicles in operation”.
“DSAT must comply with its legal attributions to properly and determined, perform an exhaustive analysis, identifying the respective deficiencies and proceeding to its timely correction, defining the conditions of the competition and the effective contractual provisions that can effectively respond to the needs of the company in any new competition procedures to be launched in the future and to establish the corresponding inspection measures, with a view to continuing the continuation of the Public interest, in the sense of better satisfying the needs of travel of the population ”, bound CA.
 
Government requires internal investigation
 
Reacting to the conclusions of the audit report, Raymond Tam assured that the government attributes “high importance to identified irregularities” and said that DSAT “assumes full responsibility for the incident”. In a statement, the Secretary for Transport and Public Works said that an internal investigation procedure will be instituted.
According to the secretary, instructions were given to DSAT to proceed to “comprehensive review of all procedures, regulations and current regimes related to the supervision of the special taxis service, ensuring the rigorous and diligent monitoring of observations and recommendations presented in the audit report”. "Practical and effective measures will be adopted to reinforce and improve the oversight of the operation of special taxis, correcting the identified deficiencies and ensuring safeguarding the public interest," said the ruler.
Raymond also emphasized that “the subject will be treated with absolute rigor, without any tolerance”, assuming that “DSAT presented failures and deficiencies in the process” and, in view of this, the secretary committed to “substantially intensifying its supervision and management, improving the system to ensure the fulfillment of his inspection attributions, in order to ensure the normal functioning of all public transport services, including the special taxis. ”</description><pubDate>2025-07-02 05:15:54</pubDate></item><item><title>Brand left by the Portuguese in Asia “was not erased,” says Ramos-Horta</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/07/02/marca-deixada-pelos-portugueses-na-asia-nao-foi-apagada-diz-ramos-horta-2/</link><description>The president of Timor-Leste considers that the brand left by the Portuguese in Asia has not been erased and that the Luso-Asian communities spread throughout the region are the “living proof of this unavoidable truth”. The head of state spoke at the opening session of the fourth conference of the Luso-Asian communities, which ended yesterday.
 
The president of Timor-Leste, José Ramos-Horta, stated that the brand left by the Portuguese in Asia was not erased and that the Luso-Asian communities spread throughout the region are the "living proof of this unavoidable truth."
“The brand left by the Portuguese in Asia has not been erased over time. Our communities are the living proof of this unavoidable truth. The result is something that lasts: the birth of simultaneously European and Asian communities,” said José Ramos-Horta.
The head of state was speaking at the opening session of the fourth conference of Luso-Asian communities, which ended yesterday, with the participation of communities of Sri Lanka, Malaca (Malaysia), Myanmar, Macau, Thailand, Goa (India) and the flowers and jakarta (Indonesia).
According to Ramos-Horta, those communities are not only “linked to Portugal”, but also to each other, because “Portuguese managed their Asian territories with a sense of interconnection”. "Cultural, administrative and religious bonds Uniam Goa and Malaca, Flores and Sri Lanka. For a period, Timor was administered by the governor of Macao," he said, explaining that the church also played a central role in that connection. The Church, according to the president, brought faith, but also "formal education, written and spiritual discipline."
Remembering that the descendant communities of Portuguese in Asia are “often invisible in national narratives” and “forgotten by school manuals”, the president stressed the importance of joining to remember, but [also] to reinvent ”.
“This conference gives you room to reflect on the past,” but also continued the head of state, to a “opportunity to shape the next chapter of history”, which will be discussed with the Dili Declaration proposal, which was approved this Sunday, and with the creation of the Association of the Portuguese Communities of Asia. "This association will be more than a network of people and communities. It is a promise and a commitment: preserving, registering and enabling. Recognize the value of the often marginalized or forgotten communities," said José Ramos-Horta.
According to the president, the Association of Portuguese Communities of Asia will give voice to Lusophone communities with international governments and institutions, will support research and economic sustainability, but will also help protect the stories and identities of peoples.
In a message, read by the Portuguese Ambassador in Dili, Manuela Bairos, the Prime Minister, Luís Montenegro, expressed the support of the Portuguese government to the objectives of the conference, the availability to host a meeting in Portugal, as well as “accompanying the efforts of institutionalization of the project that the Dili Conference proposes to promote”.

"It is necessary to innovate," the businessman told Lusa, during a break at the Portuguese restaurant Calm, who inaugurated this year in the Chinese capital.
Sitting in a room attached to the establishment, Carlos Miranda prepares green tea on a traditional Chinese table. "Tea always fascinated me," he said. "I never drank coffee," he added.
In the corner of the table is a prescription book - the kitchen of Macau from my grandfather's house - published in 1992, by Graça Pacheco Jorge. Descendant of a family established in the territory since the seventeenth century, the author was a central figure in the dissemination of Macanese cuisine.
Carlos Miranda also is linked to Portugal of family origin, through a Portuguese-grandmother. “My family is from Zamora, in the northern interior of Spain, but I have family members in Lisbon,” he said.
With about 200 square meters and place for 40 people, the Portuguese restaurant is in the heart of Beijing's diplomatic zone, north of Sanlitun, one of the busiest and most cosmopolitan areas of the Chinese capital. The menu includes: Codfish to Brás, Lagareiro Octopus, Cabyla rice, seafood rice or duck rice. “Rice is attractive to the Chinese,” he said.
In the opposite direction, Miranda took to the north of Portugal tea, a drink originated in China for thousands of years. “I wanted to do something linked to ecological agriculture,” he said.
The agricultural project began about a year ago in the Minho region, in land near the Peneda-Gerês National Park. "The idea was to plant in the park, but as it is national ecological reserve it became impossible. I was on the slopes," said the businessman, praising the local conditions of moisture, altitude and soil. "North Portugal is humid, has clean rivers and, in the last analysis, was the European country where, in a recent study, tea revealed better concentration of antioxidants," he said.
The first sheets will take time: "Only after four or five years can you start to spoon with quality."
The plantation was designed for a niche market, focused on biological and proximity product. "It makes no sense to compete with China or India. Let's do gourmet tea, with zero pesticide guarantee, for demanding consumers," he said.
Although he never worked directly in the tea industry, Carlos Miranda is an enthusiast. “I drink tea every day,” he confessed.
While waiting for the first harvest in Minho, Carlos Miranda already serves the other side of the world Vinhos do Douro and Dão. "We have to do different things, not always be for the same," he said.
In China, the Spaniard has built a career in restoration over 27 years, with several establishments that have become a reference among the expats community in the country. "I am a training cook. I worked in Porto and Lisbon in the 1990s, and then I came to China. I had restaurants in Beijing, Liaoning, Dalian and Xiamen, when there was no western food in these cities," he said.
Calm down works with a team that knows Miranda's course well: "Chinese chief cooking has been with me for 20 years."
Clients include Chinese Portuguese -speaking students and Chinese diplomats and professionals who lived in Lusophone countries: “I met very interesting people here.”
The agricultural project now forces you to spend more time in Portugal. "Tea requires care. In January we will build a small factory to process the product." Until then, get over and await. “It's a slow process, but that's what makes it interesting,” he concludes. Lusa</description><pubDate /></item></channel></rss>
