Yonhap news agency reported that Yoon's accusation is related to the December 3 decree that plunged the country into enormous political turmoil. Other South Korean media outlets published similar reports. Yoon was previously charged and arrested because of the martial law decree. The Constitutional Court is separately deliberating whether to formally dismiss Yoon as president or reinstate him. The magistrates followed up yesterday's decision with an order to keep Yoon detained. The South Korean president was arrested last week in a dawn operation.  Yoon, a conservative, has firmly denied to the Seoul Central District Prosecutor's Office any wrongdoing, considering that the imposition of martial law was a legitimate act of governance intended to raise public awareness of the risk that the liberal-controlled National Assembly would obstructing their agenda and the dismissal of senior officials.
During the announcement of martial law, Yoon called Parliament “a den of criminals” and promised to eliminate “blatant followers of North Korea and anti-state forces.” After declaring martial law, Yoon sent troops and police to Parliament, but the deputies still managed to enter the plenary and vote unanimously to annul the decree, forcing his government to revoke it. The imposition of martial law, the first of its kind in South Korea in more than 40 years, lasted just six hours. However, it evoked painful memories of dictatorial regimes from the 1960s to 1980s, when military-backed leaders used martial law and emergency decrees to suppress opponents.</description><pubDate>2025-01-27T06:55:45+08:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Resident that will have circumventing more than 300 residents from the interior of China is in pre -trial detention</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/01/27/residente-que-tera-burlado-mais-de-300-residentes-do-interior-da-china-fica-em-prisao-preventiva/</link><description>A few days ago, police authorities discovered that a local man had scammed more than 300 residents from the interior of China under the pretext of providing support to obtain employment in Macau.

In March, Macau tourism will be promoted at ITB Berlin.
 
The Board of Tourism Services (STD) was promoting Macau to Madrid between the past Wednesday and yesterday. At the International Tourism Fair (Fitur), in the Spanish capital, the objective was to attract visitors to long -haul markets to Macau.
The start of promotional activities at FITUR included an exchange on the opening day of the fair for leaders of the European tourism industry. Among the participants were officials from Turismo de Portugal, the Portuguese Association of Travel and Tourism Agencies (APAVT), the European Confederation of Associations of Travel Agencies and Tour Operators (European Travel Agents' and Tour Operators' Associations – ECTAA), the Spanish Confederation of Travel Agencies, travel agencies, among others, with a total of more than 40 participants.
At that meeting, Helena de Senna Fernandes, director of DST, pointed out that the reinforced presence at this year's FITUR marks the beginning of a series of promotional actions for Macau in 2025 aimed at the European market. The official said “we look forward to the promotional activities and major events planned for this year to showcase the new dynamics of Macau's development as a global tourism and leisure center and increase tourist flows from Europe”.

Under the supervision of leader Kim Jong-un, Pyongyang tested on Saturday guided cruise missiles to “increase the effectiveness of strategic measures against potential enemies” and according to the “moving security environment,” said the North News Agency -Corean Knca.
In a statement cited by KCNA, North Korea's Ministry of Foreign Affairs criticized the joint military exercises of the United States and South Korea, which it described as “worrying provocations”.
On Wednesday, the United States, South Korea and Japan held a joint exercise, during which several US Air Force reconnaissance planes flew over the Korean peninsula. “Reality shows that the DPRK [acronym in English for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, official name of the country] must respond to the United States with the most severe countermeasures, from A to Z, as long as this country continues to reject its sovereignty and its security interests, and that this is the best option to deal with the United States,” said North Korean diplomats.
Pyongyang also accused the United States of wanting to “gain superiority of power through their incessant military expansion”, creating an “increasingly dangerous security environment” on the Korean peninsula and in the region.
According to KCNA, Kim Jong-un said that North Korea “will always make tireless efforts in a responsible manner” to “defend sustainable and lasting peace” through “a more powerful and developed military muscle.”
North -tested cruise missiles hit the targets after traveling elliptical trajectories of about 1,500 kilometers, Pyongyang said, adding that the test "had no impact on the safety of neighboring countries."
South Korea's military announced on Saturday that it had detected "multiple cruise missile launches" from the interior of North Korea toward the Sea of ​​Japan at around 4 p.m.
North Korea's test came after Donald Trump said on Thursday that he was willing to meet in the future with Kim Jong-un, whom he described as "a smart guy."
In an interview with US television Fox News three days after taking office, Trump promised that he would contact the North Korean leader, with whom the Republican conducted negotiations of unsuccessful denuclearization in his first term (2017-2021).
After the first summit with Kim in 2018, Trump unilaterally announced the suspension of the usual military exercises with South Korea, considering them “very provocative” and “tremendously expensive”.

At the entrance of Tong Vu, large lobsters drag themselves inside aquariums. This year are being sold to the purchase price, because the times so require it.
Tong Keng Seoi, the manager, has lobster from Australia at 498 patacas, instead of the usual 900 (107). Option that brings more business volume to the old seafood restaurant in Macau during the Lunar New Year, with a full house and “a 30% increase in orders compared to the previous year”.
By this time, a banquet for 12 people, with lobster, ears and sea cucumbers, shark fin soup, piglet and roasted chicken, can cost between four thousand and 12 thousand patacas. “Consumption is, this year, much lower than previous years, but we are very busy and the main reason is because we offer the lowest possible price,” says Tong, who laments the fall in local purchasing power.
At the Campo do Dragão restaurant, 200 meters, the numbers also suggest retraction. Lin Zhiyuan, space manager, speaks of “600 to 800 tables” reserved throughout the month - “less 20% to 30%” than in 2024.
The difficulties can be recognized in other areas of the city. On a walk through downtown Macau, small street food businesses win over traditional restaurants and taverns.
Chan Chak Mo, deputy and president of the Union of Associations of Restoration and Beverage Owners, confirms the caution environment in spending: “General consumption is low, street food costs around 60-70 patacas,” he says .
After three years of pandemic and the strict 'zero covid' policy, the numbers of the game, engine of the local economy, are already close to the values ​​of 2019. However, despite the regeneration of the sector, in small and medium-sized companies, the wound remains. if opened.
In the case of restoration, in November, according to the latest official statistics, the volume of “Chinese restaurants and that of food and soup stores have dropped 4.3% and 3.7%, respectively”. .
And then there is the other side of the border. Quality products and services, lower prices and the possibility of, since 2023, a daily circulate of two thousand vehicles with Macao enrollment in the interior of China, make neighboring Zhuhai a fierce competitor of the small local commerce. “It is estimated that about 50 million US dollars who were previously spent on Macau and Hong Kong per month and are now spent on Shenzhen [neighboring Hong Kong] and Zhuhai. And obviously this has a huge reflection on the welfare of small businesses, ”says the Mayor of Commerce and Luso-Chinese industry.
Carlos Cid Álvares, also executive director of the Macao National Bank Overseas Bank, suggests adaptations: “Small businesses have done business equally for 20 years or 30 years and have to adapt to a new reality that is that of a younger population, with other needs ”.
Another sequel to the economic moment: in 2023, 3,712 births were recorded in the Chinese semi-autonomous region, 43.5% less than 10 years ago (6,571).
For Tao Xuemei and Wong Chio Fan, a young couple, personal finances and Chinese coffers do not allow them to take the step: “We are worried about having children because of the national debt, because of the economic recession. The choice for motherhood really depends on the country's economic capacity and debt repayment capacity”, summarizes Tao, 28 years old, working as a school counselor. “We don’t want to have children just to pass on [our] debts to them,” adds Wong, a 35-year-old contractor.
Finances are the theme that about 20% of people lead to consultations with Mickey Hung Sen Chun, Master of Feng Shui, a Chinese millennial practice that studies the influence of space on people's welfare.
This Lunar New Year, which starts on Wednesday, casinos will continue to prosper, says the master. “As the symbolism of the serpent is associated with wisdom and mystical luck, many visitors may be more inclined” to gamble, Hung further predicts.
In the negative level, the year of the serpent “is often accompanied by indifference and hatred”, and the fact that “there were many important historical events” in this sign of the lunar calendar may be a source of apprehension, warns the master, who points to the risk of future “similar occurrences”.
The Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor in 1941; the Tiananmen student repression in Beijing occurred in 1989 and the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001. All years of the serpent.
At the national level, Hung estimates, “with the gradual recovery of the world economy, China's exports could be positively affected, which will help it achieve the growth objective set”.
China, shaken by a deep real estate crisis, the main investment vehicle for Chinese families, launched several economic stimulus measures in the last quarter of last year, including reducing banks' mandatory reserve ratios and interest rates. Beijing also promised to pursue “more proactive” budgetary policies and a “moderate easing” of monetary policy, to boost domestic consumption. “The question is whether what they are doing at the moment, with all these macroeconomic support policies, is enough to stimulate domestic consumption”, assesses Nicholas Chen, analyst at consultancy Fitch Solutions, highlighting the weight of the real estate crisis “on sentiment of the consumer.”
Chen notes that, although China's gross domestic product reached Beijing's goal and grew 5% by 2024, Fitch Solutions foresees a slight slowdown by 2025 “to about 4.7% due to macroeconomic contrary winds, as well as slow domestic consumption, ”he adds.
Legend has it that the 'nian' ('year', in Mandarin), a mythical beast, takes to the streets these days and hunts for animals and people to devour and crop fields to ruin. As it is intolerant to noise and the color red, people started decorating their houses in red and launching fireworks and fireworks to scare away the monster.
Macau does not challenge conviction. The city is preparing the crossing for the new year. The streets dress as tradition dictates. Tong Vu, waiting for the snake, hung red lanterns, also seeing if lobsters would sell better next year.

The levels of air pollution in the Thai capital put it among the ten most polluted cities in the world.
The measure was announced through social networks by the governor of Bangcoque, Chardchart Sittipunt, who stated that 352 schools of the Metropolitan Administration of Bangkok were closed due to pollution.
The number is much higher than the approximately 200 schools that did not open the previous day in Bangkok, whose metropolitan area is home to more than 17 million people.
The city was classified Friday as the eighth most polluted city in the world, according to the IQAir portal, which measures air quality around the world, by measuring PM2.5 particle levels, registering 175 micrograms per meter. cubic (µg/m³), well above the limit of 25 µg/m³ recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The capital of Bangladesh, Dhaka, the Pakistani city of Lahore and the capital of Nepal, Kathmandu, top the list with a concentration above 200 µg/m³.
WHO advises to avoid exposure for more than 24 hours to concentrations of PM2.5 over 25 mcg/m3, due to the risk of respiratory, cardiovascular and carcinogens associated with these particles, so small that they can pass directly to the bloodstream .
Thai Transport Minister Suriya Juangroongruangkit announced that electric trains and buses will be free in traffic-choked Bangkok for seven days from January 25 to 31, 2025, among some of the measures aimed at reducing pollution. atmospheric.
However, the Thai agriculture ministry has been trying to clean the sky, creating artificial clouds to increase moisture level and reduce pollutant particles that float in the atmosphere. Agricultural burnings are also being controlled.
One of the main problems of atmospheric pollution in Thailand is the time of burning agricultural collus, which usually occurs between January and April, early in the plantation season, coinciding with the country's dry season. This burning, a cheaper method than the removal of plants by hand or with machines, is used by farmers in Thailand and neighboring countries, such as Cambodia, Burma and Laos.</description><pubDate>2025-01-27T06:55:47+08:00</pubDate></item><item><title>UPM organizes the “exchange fair” to promote academic opportunities</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/01/27/upm-organiza-a-feira-de-intercambio-para-promover-oportunidades-academicas/</link><description>As part of its commitment to providing exchange and learning opportunities, the Macau Polytechnic University (UPM), through the Student Affairs Division (DAE), organized the “2025 Summer Exchange Fair”, which was held at its facilities and included the participation of 11 world-renowned higher education institutions.

“The biggest positive factor for Macau would be if the Chinese economy grew and consumer confidence levels improved,” said Vitaly Umansky, analyst at the consultancy firm Seaport Research Partners.
More than 70% of the people who visited the territory in 2024 came from mainland China, whose economic growth reached the 5% goal set by Beijing by 2024. But Nicholas Chen, Creditsights analyst, said the company of the Financial Notation Agency group Fitch expects a slowdown to 4.7% this year, in part due to poor private consumption.
The consumer confidence index in China fell in September to the lowest level of the last 34 years, stressed Jeffrey Kiang, analyst at Consultant CLSA. That is, "if the prospects for Chinese consumers are not good, they will be able to tighten their belt, reduce travel and consumption," including Macao, Nicholas Chen explained.
The Chinese Communist Party has launched a series of stimulus measures, including the reduction of interest rates and mandatory bank reserves and the anticipation of thousands of millions of its budget in 2025 to fund construction projects.
Beijing also expanded a consumer goods exchange system and raised the salaries of millions of public servants to revive domestic demand. “The [Chinese] Government has already said that it will launch more measures to stimulate the economy”, said Vitaly Umansky, who hopes above all for a recovery in confidence among the middle class: “I think it will happen, it’s just a matter of time”.
Creditsights expects Chinese consumer confidence to rise in the second half of 2025, along with real estate price stabilization, which have been falling for 19 consecutive months.
The issue is of great concern to Beijing, due to the implications for social stability, since housing is one of the main investment vehicles for families and the real estate sector – adding indirect factors – represents around 30% of the Chinese economy. “There will certainly be some side effects, because part of the measures that are adopted to boost domestic consumption could flow to the Macau gaming sector”, said Nicholas Chen.
The analyst believes that China will also expand the list of cities whose residents can apply for 'individual visas' to visit Hong Kong and Macau, a method used by 35.2% of tourists who passed through Macau in 2024.
Vitaly Umansky does not have the same opinion and points out that since January 1st, residents of the neighboring city of Zhuhai can now visit Macau once a week and stay for up to seven days.
On the other hand, analysts agree that casino revenues will be far from the historical maximum of 303 billion patacas recorded in 2018 next year. “One thing is clear: the Government aims for moderate revenue growth in the future”, said Jeffrey Kiang, recalling that authorities forecast gaming revenues of 240 billion patacas in 2025, which would be an increase of 5.8%. “When the Macau Government publishes a forecast, it is usually very conservative and is based on prior discussion with the Liaison Office” of the Chinese Central Government in the city, said Vitaly Umansky.
The analyst does not believe that Beijing has any measure up its sleeve to control the resumption of casinos, similar to the campaign that began with the arrest of the leader of the largest VIP betting company in the world, in November 2021. “Much of the reprehensible behavior in Macau disappeared with the 'junkets'. As long as things like that don't happen again, I don't expect any kind of campaign in the short term,” said Umansky.

The Macanese community in São Paulo, Brazil, is declining in participation, particularly among younger generations. Internal disputes, pandemic and lack of cultural identity are factors and the largest contributors. To preserve its heritage, the community has to find new ways to get involved.
 
The Macaense community in São Paulo, Brazil, has been vibrant and united, with regular and crowded activities and meetings. However, internal disputes and the impact of the pandemic caused the active participation of the community to decrease. The Macao de São Paulo House currently has 110 members, however, it is estimated that the actual number of Macanese in Sao Paulo rounds 300 to 400. The average age of members is quite high and the younger generations seem to be losing The interest in Macanese culture and community. Although São Paulo has a larger Macanese community compared to other states of Brazil, the community in Brazil as a whole is relatively small compared to other countries. In an interview with the final point, Pedro Martins, whose inheritance Macaense dates back to Frederico Martins and Angelina Guerreiro, deepens the Macanese experience in São Paulo, as well as the challenges that threaten its preservation. To safeguard the Macanese culture, Pedro believes that the house needs to involve and educate the younger members about its heritage and rewrite the definition of “Macaense” in a diaspora context. In general, the young man who traveled 17,970 kilometers to be present at the meeting of the 2024 Macanese communities considers that more initiatives are needed to revive and strengthen the Maca community in São Paulo and Brazil.
 
How would you describe the Macanese community in São Paulo, if it is a united community and if it continues to maintain its connection to Macau?
The Macanese community of São Paulo had an initial moment, especially with the first generations that arrived in Brazil, very rich. It was very alive. They arrived in the 60s and 70s, mainly macanese from the generation of the 1930s and 1940s. Some brought their parents and also came with their young children and, until about the 2000s, the community was very united. In the 1970s until the 1990s, they gathered more informally, they used a house from some Macaense who had a larger space, they also used Casa de Portugal, there in Sao Paulo. They had a coral [choir], had culinary activities, also gathered in Chinese restaurants, were very alive. The apex of this liveliness of the Macao de São Paulo house occurred in the 1990s, when all the houses of Macao around the world received money to build their own home, that was the apex. It was the moment when they gathered the most, they had lunch every Sunday, coral, dance, organized pieces in Patuá, this was the most thriving moment of the community of São Paulo. Since 2000, the Macaense community of São Paulo began to live a moment of fall in its interactions, in its experience. I attribute two main factors to this fall in power, one of them was the issue of internal disputes between members who eventually turned away from each other and also the pandemic, which caused people with the old age to lose the habit of attending the house . Today, the Macao de São Paulo House is experiencing a moment of little liveliness, which can be seen by the fact that only six people from Sao Paulo for the meeting of this year's Macaenses came.
 
How does Brazil, in general, see Macau?
Macau is still very unknown to Brazil. Still very recently started to emerge videos of Brazilians who say “Look, there is a city in southern China that speaks Portuguese, which preserves the Portuguese…”, but is still very unknown. Even today Brazil does not pay as much attention as China itself gives the importance of Macau as a connection platform between the two countries. Macao still has a lot to be explored by Brazil, to understand this Lusophone integration, for universities partnerships, for media organizations, to understand Macau's role in this interaction with China. In this context, the Macaense community could play a very important role, even to make this connection but, due to the low number of macanese near the Brazilian population, ends that Brazilians themselves, newspaper organizations, academic organizations, the Brazilian diplomatic body itself, They need to have a larger initiative and seek Macau to explore this potential.
 
In this sense, what role does the Macau House of São Paulo play in São Paulo and, more allegedly, in Brazil?
The Macao Casa de São Paulo was originally very important to maintain the unity and coexistence of the macanese who went to Brazil in the 60s and 70s. Today the role has become a lot, because those macanese who came, many are already already With a very advanced age and his children no longer grew are together, they no longer created friendships as their parents created. Today she no longer plays a role of allowing friends gathering, but of preserving the community's community experience and the children of the Macanese. This is its biggest role and the biggest challenge, how to make the new generations, the generations that were born in the 70s, 80s and onwards to my generation, can maintain this sense of belonging to Macao, this sense of being Macaense through this community experience? The way it has been lived lately, which is a more individualized experience, all consider themselves macanese but do not have a community experience. It is very easy to dilute in Brazilian culture, end up, over time, losing this connection to Macau. Macao ends up becoming a footer in their bibliography and no longer something from everyday life or something they always remember. I see that Macao de São Paulo's house is fundamental to allow this community experience, which preserves the identity and a sense of belonging to the Macaense community.
 
Would you say that São Paulo has a largest Macanese community than other Brazilian states?
In Brazil the only places with significant communities are Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, other states have a maximum of a Macaense. From what I have news, outside Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, only the state of Pará has a Macaense. All are concentrated in Rio and São Paulo. São Paulo has a larger community than Rio de Janeiro, were much more macanese to Sao Paulo, but close to the communities of the United States, Canada, Australia and Portugal, Brazil is much smaller.
 
How many associates does the house have?
Today there are 110 members only that, for you to analyze the Macanese community of São Paulo, you can not just look at this picture of associates because many macanese, over the last 20 years, have left, have disassociated from the house. I estimate that today, considering all who were born in Macau or have some connection with Macao, are around 300 to 400, but only a quarter of this is that it really goes to the house.
 
What is the average age of associates?
Of those born in Macau, most of them are in their 80s/90s. There is also a significant number who are in their 70s, but the bulk are really those in their 80s and 90s. The children of these Macanese, many of whom were also born in Macau but were very young, two or three years old in Brazil, are in their 40s and 50s. Considering all the associates, like these Macanese people, their children and now their grandchildren and great-grandchildren, I think the average age should be around 30 to 40 years old.
 
And the house has any stimulus or goal to bring younger?
The big challenge of this is that in the last 20 years of Macao de São Paulo's house, the young people, both in the 40/50 years, and my generation of 20/30, have lost their habit of living Macau, to go to the Home, eat macanese food, have contact with Patuá, understand the importance of this ancestry they have. This made them lose their interest in attending the house. Those people who really attend events, especially lunch, are all elderly in the 80/90 year. The young people lost this experience. This is very dangerous because the community experience of the macanese is essential to maintain the culture, without this experience the culture is diluting and is lost over generations. At home this is an essential mission, if she wants to continue to exist in the next 20/30 years. The challenge is how to show these young people the importance of maintaining this Macanese experience, convincing them that even if they have not grown in Macau, even though in the last 30 years or 20 years they have not attended the home, It is very important to go back to frequent and maintain the culture and experience.
 
In addition to lunches, does Casa de Macau de São Paulo organize more activities or other events to bring the community together with that of Rio de Janeiro?
Historically, especially when the houses in São Paulo and Rio were built, the property itself had many exchanges between the houses. In the Casa de Macau in São Paulo, one of the great highlights compared to other houses in the world is that there were many pieces written in Patuá. We have a lady, very old, called Maria, her nickname is Mariazinha, she is Macanese and she is known in São Paulo as the Patuá lady, because she wrote many plays in Patuá and directed these plays. Outside of Macau, and perhaps Portugal, Brazil was one of the only communities that had plays written and performed in Patuá. There were also Macanese choirs that sang songs in Portuguese, Patuá, English, even Cantonese. There were also dances, plays, there were many activities that were very lively, very energetic. Today, with the deterioration of the community, the events are more limited to lunches, where some important event in Macau is celebrated, Portugal Day, Saint John's Day, Christmas, Chinese New Year, but these events are limited to just lunches and shared experiences. There are no more plays, choirs, all those events that you had in the past have been lost over time.
 
In this sense, what are the difficulties that the house of Macao de São Paulo is going through?
I think there are several difficulties, but they are all connected to two central problems, one of which is the absence of younger people in the house, young people both aged 20 to 30 and 40 to 50 years old. It's a very big problem, in which there is a predominance of only those aged 80 to 90 years old. Young people mean the future, without young people without a future, this is a big central problem. Young people have lost this sense of belonging to the community experience within Macanese culture and the community, this is the main problem. Furthermore, I can also mention two events that happened in the last 20 years that separated Macanese from this age group of 70 to 90, which were some internal disputes and also the pandemic. These two events caused the community itself, which was previously very united, to also move away. This causes this sense of belonging to Macau to be lost, so much so that one of the reasons, in addition to advanced age, in addition to geographic distance, in addition to the issue of adaptation, is one of the main reasons why very few Macanese people came to this year's Macanese meeting it was the distance from each other within the community. This lack of social integration meant that they did not have as much motivation to come to the meeting, something that in the past, for example in the 1998 meeting, more than two hundred Macanese came from São Paulo and now five came. This is something very serious. I mention an issue, now more about Macanese identity, which is an important topic that several Houses around the world address. Today the Macanese community has a very big challenge of updating the term “Macanese”, that is, what does it mean to be Macanese? The definition is dynamic, throughout history it has been updated with each historical reality. Over the last 400 years, the meaning of being Macanese has been adapted and today the great challenge is how to define Macanese encompassing the large diaspora. It is the first time in history that there are more Macanese in the diaspora than Macau Macau, it is very important that the new definitions of Macanese encompass the realities of the diaspora. In the case of São Paulo, specifically, one of the challenges of defining what it means to be Macanese is understanding that, now in São Paulo, Macanese ethnically have become very diluted. All children of Macanese descendants who were born from the 70s and 80s onwards have only one Macanese parent, the other parent is from another ethnic group. This is a very big challenge because how are you going to define Macanese considering this reality, considering this issue of ancestry? Thinking about Macanese as a whole, the community of São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro or Australia have a current characteristic, they are multinational, they are globalized. They are all inserted in very different cultures, but they are united by this sense of belonging to one. Here I quote two very important authors from the Macanese community who help us update the meaning of being Macanese. One of them is Jorge Rangel, who at this year's Macanese meeting said a very interesting phrase: “We are all Macanese.” We all have a sense of belonging to Macau. This is very important because this definition encompasses the reality of diasporas, people who were not born in Macau or did not grow up in Macau, but who want to preserve this sense of Macanese identity. The other author is also called Jorge, Jorge Morbey. He was former president of the Macau Cultural Institute and also wrote some articles, in which he said that Macanese are both those born in Macau and those born in the diaspora, in the oldest diaspora such as Shanghai, Malaysia, Goa, Portugal, as well as the new diaspora, which are those born in the United States of America, Canada and Brazil. These two definitions they give, both Rangel's of “we are all Macanese” and Morbey's of considering all the children of the diaspora to be Macanese, are fundamental to account for this new reality of the Macanese.
 
And have not been a problem for the house?
A very particular reality of the Macau Houses in Brazil is that, thinking about meetings, both for young people and communities, the travel cost is the highest of all the Houses in the world, because as there is no direct flight from Brazil to China , to Macau, to Hong Kong. It is always necessary to take a long flight first to Europe, the United States, the Middle East or even Africa and then another to Hong Kong or Macau. These two necessary flights, from Brazil to somewhere in the middle and from there to China, make trips very expensive. I was talking to people from the United States community and they need just one flight, there are direct flights from San Francisco to Hong Kong, even people from Portugal also have shorter flights or flights with fewer stops [stopovers]. Not in the case of Brazil, there are two very large flights and this makes traveling to Macau very expensive. Also thinking about the costs for the community experience there in Brazil, this is also another big challenge. Houses have a very high maintenance cost. Casa de Macau de São Paulo is a very large piece of land, it requires a lot of maintenance, a lot of cleaning, a lot of conservation. In Rio de Janeiro too, they also had several problems during the pandemic with robbery and theft, which required reconstruction and renovation. All these costs end up greatly harming the community experience. This financial issue greatly affects both day-to-day living and participation in youth and community meetings.
 
Were these issues reported to the Government?
As far as I know, São Paulo does not have a culture of asking the Government for help. This will be something that is very difficult to ask for now, especially because the Macanese community is different from other communities, it is very small, it has never had such a large participation in the Government as the Italian community, the Armenian community or even the Portuguese community itself. . The Macanese community has always been very small and never had very strong connections with people from the Government. I believe that it is also a global challenge for Macanese communities, such as rethinking their financial management, creating a fund to manage heritage, achieving frequent financial returns, talking to cultural preservation institutions such as Fundação Oriente, the Conselho das Comunidades Macaenses, the International Institute of Macau, to create a new financial management perspective for the maintenance of the Houses. In fact, even at the meeting of the Macanese communities, the president of the Fundação Casa de Macau had a meeting with representatives of each House of Macau and presented the issue of seeking greater dialogue with the Houses to provide more financial and logistical support.
 
Is the dialogue with other Houses of Macau something constant or just revived when they meet?
In the old days, especially with the Macao House of Rio de Janeiro, the dialogue was something more institutionalized. You had the house of Macau de São Paulo as an institution contacting the other houses. Today, this contact was very individualized. For example, some macanese from Sao Paulo goes to Canada and will visit the house there, he goes individually, not representing the house. There are no excursions. This is also a very sad thing, because this relationship of houses to a more institutional level would allow much more partnerships, be it financial partnerships or logistical partnerships. For example, at this year's Macanese meeting I noticed that US houses are the majority [majority], I think 70% -80% of the macanese who came to meet are associated with these homes. They could greatly help other houses that have fewer people, for example, giving hotel address tips, airline ticket tips, get -togethers, lunches. This lack of institutional dialogue between houses harms a lot of partnerships that could be very rich for the community. I even talked to the macanese of the house of Rio de Janeiro and many of them who are older, in the 60/70 range, mentioned that in the beginning, when the houses were built, had a very strong dialogue between them and that even made it easy Much trips to the meetings of the time, it made a lot of facilitating the purchase of airline tickets, much made the partnership to have a better stay in Macao a lot. This was much richer, had much greater potential for community preservation and experience.
 
He has spoken a lot about the identity issues of the Macanese community, particularly among the younger generations. How does Brazil's strong cultural identity interact with the Macanese identity of the diaspora that lives there? Does it affect her in any way? Is it a deterrent for young people?
This question is very interesting because in Brazil it can be seen, with the adaptation of the Macanese community to the location, that this adaptation was so strong, this sociocultural integration was so strong, that it threatens to dilute Macanese culture. There is a risk that the Macanese community in São Paulo will easily end up becoming part of Brazilian culture. Brazilian culture is very similar to Macanese culture in essential matters, in language, in the Catholic religion. The fact that Brazil has a very mixed population ended up integrating the Macanese in a very strong, very peaceful way. A strong expression of this dilution of the Macanese community is the fact that there was not a single couple from the Macanese community, from the generation born after the 70s, who married and had children. All Macanese who were born in Brazil from the 70s onwards are now married to other Brazilians and have children who only have one Macanese parent. This is the greatest example of this very strong integration in Brazilian society. This very strong integration is an even greater challenge for the Macanese community, to make young people have a sense of belonging to Macau. I have heard reports from some of the Houses in some other places in the world that, because they are made up of more Macanese, there have been many marriages within the community. This in Brazil, both because of this cultural integration and because of the smaller number of Macanese, ended up not happening and ended up being a very big challenge for this sense of belonging.
 
Would you say that the issue of distance between Brazil and Macau also weighs on this challenge?
It is a logistical issue, from Macau being too far and not being very easy to travel here. On average, from Sao Paulo to Hong Kong or Macao, considering all the logistics effort, it spends around 30 hours. 30 hours is a long time, not only for the matter of time but for the financial issue. This also ends up moving away from Macao, also the other problems we approached.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>DSAL sees significant increase in job placements and candidate assistance</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/01/27/dsal-regista-aumento-significativo-nas-colocacoes-de-emprego-e-assistencia-a-candidatos/</link><description>In 2024, the Directorate of Services for Labor Affairs attended about 14,700 people in search of employment, marking a significant increase over the previous year.

Consumer Price Index (IPC), the main indicator of inflation, continued to slow down in December to 0.1% and the accumulated price climb by 2024 was only 0.2%, aggravating deflationist pressures in the second largest economy in world.
Deflation consists of a fall in prices over time, as opposed to an increase (inflation). The phenomenon reflects weakness in domestic consumption and investment and is particularly dangerous, as a fall in the price of assets, usually contracted using credit, generates an imbalance between the value of loans and bank guarantees.
Another effect is to lead to the postponement of consumption and investment decisions as a result of expectations of lower prices in the future, which can create a downward spiral in prices and demand that is difficult to reverse, affecting the entire economy.
The drop in prices began in 2022, with the devaluation of the most important asset in China: residential real estate. Since Beijing liberalized the sector in the 1990s, the properties have constituted the main investment vehicle of Chinese families, leading to a boom in construction, which transformed the cities of the Asian country. This economic strategy now seems to have gone too far.
A train trip through China allows you to glimpse thousands of empty or unfinished towers. Different analysts are currently calculating enough empty properties to house more than 90 million people - about nine times the Portuguese population.
“There was a lot of fictitious growth in China”, observed Michael Pettis, professor of financial theory at the Guanghua School of Management, Peking University, to the Lusa agency. “Excess investment in all types of non-productive construction projects inflated growth for several years”, he described.
Now, the prospect of a prolonged fall in property prices has led to a loss of consumer and investor confidence and a flight to safer alternatives.
Products with guaranteed capital, such as time deposits, have become the preferred choice of savers, which led China's central bank to reduce interest rates, aiming to encourage the allocation of capital in the economy.
Term deposits at state banks currently pay 1.6% per year, compared with more than 4% five years ago.
With few safe assets available, banks, insurers and fund managers have accumulated public debt securities, reducing their profitability. Chinese state obligations to ten years now yield about 1.6%. “One of the factors is the expectation among investors that cuts will be decided in directors [defined by the Central Bank], as the latest economic activity remains weak and the political measures announced so far seem to have not been able to propel expectations. Growth, ”wrote James Reilly, an analyst at the capital Economics, in a report widespread last week. "This helps to explain why short -term yields have also fallen, with yield [of obligations] to two years to go down to 1%," he said.
Finally, as regards the real estate, a situation is particularly aggravated by the circumstance of the Chinese population has entered a rapid process of decline.
The population shrank in 2024 for the third consecutive year and UN estimates predict that they fall to less than half of the current number until 2100. "Women are more aware," Zhao Hua, a 28 -year -old Chinese from Beijing, Lusa, told Lusa. "Gender inequality remains deep in China: men want a traditional family in which women take over their children and household chores," he added.
Several young Chinese women heard by Lusa underlined the discrepancy between this type of mindset with the expectations of a society that has modernized and urbanized to a parallel rhythm in modern history.
According to the World Bank, in 1980, only 19.4% of the Chinese population lived in urban areas. In 2023, the rate rose to around 66%. Resorting to immigration to counter population decline and stimulate residential real estate appears to be excluded: China defines itself as a “non-immigration” country. Beijing does not recognize dual nationality. The granting of citizenship is based on the principle of “jus sanguinis” (right of blood), and can only be granted to those with Chinese ancestry.</description><pubDate>2025-01-27T06:49:01+08:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Grand Prix Museum prepares festivities to celebrate Lunar New Year</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/01/27/museu-do-grande-premio-prepara-festividades-para-comemorar-o-ano-novo-lunar/</link><description>The Grand Prix Museum celebrates the Lunar New Year with various activities between January 29th and February 4th, including calligraphy of couplets, an exhibition on the history of the Grand Prix and the “VR F3 Pit Stop Challenge”. The museum will be open on the seventh day of the Lunar New Year, February 4, and will offer sign language audio-guide and video services to promote inclusivity.
 
The Macau Grand Prix Museum (MGPM) has prepared a series of activities to celebrate the Lunar New Year, with the aim of enriching the festive atmosphere and providing a memorable experience for residents and visitors alike. With support from the Tourism Services Directorate (DST), these activities will take place between January 29th and February 4th, when the Year of the Snake is celebrated.
One of the main attractions will be the “destic handwriting activity for the year of the snake”, which will take place in the MGPM Cave. Daily, between 12h00 and 13h00 and from 15h00 to 16h00, specialized professionals will be available to write and distribute traditional destics, such as the characters “Spring/Happiness”. Visitors will also be able to use materials provided by the museum, such as paper, brushes and ink, to write their own destics, taking home a reminder of the serpent's new year's festivities period.
In addition to calligraphy, the MGPM presents “A Racing Legacy – Drivers’ Collection Exhibition”, an exhibition that highlights the history of the Macau Grand Prix through a valuable collection of items from drivers sponsored by SJM. This exhibition, which will be accessible to the public until February 3, includes helmets, gloves and racing suits, providing a unique opportunity to appreciate the relics of past and current racing champions.
Another highlight of the activities is the “VR F3 Pit Stop Challenge”, which challenges participants to try the adrenaline of a car change of a formula 3 car during a virtual race. This interactive experience will be available until February 17, allowing visitors to feel part of the real pit stop team, challenging them to complete tasks in less than two minutes.
To increase accessibility and inclusion, the museum has introduced, since January 25, audio-guide and video language services, ensuring that all visitors, regardless of their abilities, can fully enjoy the exhibitions. Interested parties can access these options by scanning QR codes installed with the exposed items.
The MGPM will open its doors on February 4, the seventh day of the Lunar New Year, thus remaining available to the public, contrary to the usual closure on Tuesdays. The opening hours will be from 10h00 to 18h00.</description><pubDate /></item></channel></rss>
