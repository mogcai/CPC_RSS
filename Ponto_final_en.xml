Raymond Tam, Secretary for Transport and Public Works, had already promised benefits for those who use electric vehicles.
The Government decided to reduce tariffs for public charging of electric vehicles by around 10%. The order, published yesterday in the Official Bulletin, comes into force on February 1st of this year. In addition to reducing tariffs, the nominal output power of slow charging and fast charging was also adjusted.
The objective of this measure, explains the Directorate of Environmental Protection Services (DSPA) in a press release, is to “achieve the national Dual Carbon Target”, “implement the lines of government action with regard to the continuous improvement of a system that guarantees green mobility” and “further promote the use of electric vehicles”.
The Government had already adjusted, in 2024, the tariffs for electrical charging of means of transport. The change involved the reduction in the energy charge relating to public electrical charging tariffs for medium charging and fast charging and the bringing forward, by three hours, of the “empty hours” for slow charging, from 11pm to 8pm.
“The Macao SAR Government will continue to improve charging facilities in accordance with the Electric Vehicle Promotion Plan in Macau and increase, in a timely manner, the number of charging facilities at different speeds and standards and battery swapping facilities in public parking lots or neighborhoods that meet the appropriate conditions for this,” reads the DSPA press release, which also adds that “it will urge the electricity concessionaire to optimize the management platform of electricity charging, ensuring the provision of high quality charging services”.
Last week, in the Legislative Assembly, Raymond Tam promised that the Government would implement a series of benefits for those who use electric vehicles and announced the launch, later this year, of a “pilot project of super charging stations for light and heavy vehicles”. This initiative foresees the installation of four charging stations for light vehicles and three for heavy vehicles on Rua da Patinagem, in Cotai. As explained by the Secretary for Transport and Public Works, charging for five to ten minutes at these stations will allow a range of between 300 and 400 kilometers at these “super-charging stations”. The government official also promised to introduce discounts for those who charge their electric vehicles in public parking lots.</description><pubDate>2026-01-13 02:03:55</pubDate></item><item><title>FDCT: “Results of industry–university–research cooperation are increasingly visible”</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2026/01/13/fdct-resultados-da-cooperacao-industria-universidade-investigacao-sao-cada-vez-mais-visiveis/</link><description>Vincent U, chairman of the board of directors of the Fund for the Development of Science and Technology (FDCT), said yesterday, during a clarification session on project financing programs, that “the results of industry-university-research cooperation are increasingly visible in Macau”, adding that, currently, three local technological innovation companies are already in the preliminary stage of admission to listing, with prospects of listing on the market of a main stock exchange in 2026.

Alongside sharing cutting-edge research, the university highlighted the central role of its new campus in Hengqin, already under construction, which hopes to transform the future of higher education in the region.

On January 11th, the Lakeside Theater stage served as binoculars to reflect on the past of the University of Macau (UM) and, above all, to project the future of the institution. UM officially began celebrating its 45th anniversary, in an event that brought together government authorities, partners and its academic community. The focus, however, quickly shifted from past achievements to the ambitious vision that will shape the coming years, the full operationalization of the new campus in the Hengqin Deep Cooperation Zone, scheduled for 2029.
In his speech, Rector Yonghua Song traced the institution's metamorphosis from its origins as the University of East Asia to becoming Macau's only public research university with international status. However, the decisive moment that set the tone of the celebration was the announcement of the advancements at the Hengqin campus. After construction begins in late 2025, UM aims to operate an integrated “dual campus” model, positioning itself as a central engine to transform Macau and Hengqin into a hub of high-level international talent.
Kong Chi Meng, director of the Education and Youth Development Services (DSEDJ) and representative of the Secretary for Social Affairs and Culture, reinforced this ambition, highlighting UM's mission as an institution “rooted in Macau, integrated into the nation and with a global vision”. Kong expressed the expectation that the university, being the first to be established in Macao-Hengqin International Education (University) Town, will play an exemplary role in the integrated development of the two territories.
The ceremony was not limited to speeches. To illustrate its practical impact, three researchers from the Faculty of Science and Technology presented cutting-edge projects that range from sea to air. Zheng Zhedong demonstrated work on localization and reconstruction with drones, Carlos Silvestre presented projects with unmanned surface vessels and Xu Qingsong introduced his research on service robots with legs.
The day also coincided with the university's “Open Day”, with activities taking place on the main campus, at its Hengqin Research and Education Transition Site and at the Zhuhai Science and Technology Research Institute. The 45th anniversary slogan, “Advance and Achieve Beyond”, and the logo created with geometric shapes that suggest both the Chinese philosophical concept of “round heaven and square earth” and a sailing flag, aim to demonstrate the spirit of an institution in motion.
Throughout 2026, UM will organize a series of academic, cultural and involvement activities with alumni, which can be found over the next few days, on the university's official page, where the institution's past achievements and its navigation towards an increasingly integrated and international future will be found at the center, the institution believes.</description><pubDate>2026-01-13 01:23:48</pubDate></item><item><title>AI course organized by DSEDT and Huawei attracted 30 participants and 16 companies</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2026/01/13/curso-de-ia-da-dsedt-e-da-huawei-organizam-atraiu-30-participantes-e-16-empresas/</link><description>The Practical Training Course in Artificial Intelligence (AI) with Huawei Certification began yesterday, as part of the digital training program for technological companies for transformation with AI, jointly organized by the Economic and Technological Development Services Department (DSEDT) and Huawei (Macau). This course takes place at the Economic and Commercial Services Center between China and Portuguese-speaking Countries of the Guangdong-Macao Deep Cooperation Zone in Hengqin.

The course attracted 30 participants from 16 certified technology companies.
Yau Yun Wah, director of DSEDT, said, at the opening of the course, that “artificial intelligence is currently an important driver for the upgrade of global industry”. “It is expected that the course can train more talents with essential AI skills in Macau, helping technology companies to accurately take advantage of the golden opportunity of AI training in the industry, integrating new quality productive forces in product development, process optimization and service innovation, promoting a deep integration between technological innovation and industrial innovation”, said the person in charge, quoted in the press release.</description><pubDate>2026-01-13 01:23:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Japan and South Korea want to strengthen ties in the face of tension with China</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2026/01/13/japao-e-coreia-do-sul-querem-reforcar-lacos-diante-de-tensao-com-a-china/</link><description>Japanese Prime Minister, Sanae Takaichi, and South Korean President, Lee Jae-myung, promised yesterday to strengthen security and economic ties in the face of escalating tension with China, a measure that aims to “boost diplomacy” in the region.

“This collaboration between the two countries is of strategic importance for both nations,” said the Japanese prime minister during a two-day visit to Nara, her hometown, where she met with the South Korean leader, according to the Japanese newspaper The Japan Times.
Sanae Takaichi also noted that the two countries reached an agreement over the remains of South Korean citizens who died in Japan after being recruited for forced labor during the Japanese occupation, with Tokyo agreeing to carry out DNA testing.
The two sides advocated “more visits of this type” between the two countries, following Lee's visit to China for talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping, when there is growing tension with Tokyo. “I hope this visit will help elevate relations between Japan and South Korea to a new level,” Takaichi said after the meeting.
The Japanese prime minister both leaders hoped to “consolidate a strong personal relationship” to “promote closer ties between our neighbors in the midst of a complex global geopolitical situation.”
While Takaichi did not address the differences with China and the recent exchange of accusations between the two sides following a series of statements on Taiwan, Lee emphasized the need for Tokyo, Seoul and Beijing to “identify common ground and communicate effectively.” “I want to emphasize the need for the three countries to identify common ground for communication and cooperation,” Lee said, reiterating the importance of achieving “complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula to establish lasting peace in the region.” “We agreed to continue coordinating efforts to deal with the North Korean issue,” he added.
The parties also agreed to cooperate in the recovery of the remains of victims of the great flood of 1942, which killed almost 200 people — including 136 Korean workers — in a coal mine in Yamaguchi Prefecture.
The South Korean head of state described this measure as a “small but significant progress on historically important issues” for South Korea. “In an increasingly complex world order, I believe that cooperation between South Korea and Japan is more important than ever,” said the South Korean President. “Political uncertainty is growing, multilateralism is being tested and the independence of global production chains is being exploited”, lamented Lee, adding that there are “challenges” that will have to be “faced” through “mutual respect and trust”.

In response to a written question from deputy Ho Ion Sang, the director of the Institute of Social Action (IAS), Hon Wai, said that several support centers in Macau had recently installed more than 340 innovative technological equipment aimed at promoting the safety of the elderly, people with disabilities and workers.
The Institute of Social Action (IAS) announced that Macau's nursing homes and special care centers have been increasing their supply of technological equipment, with the aim of guaranteeing the safety and health of the elderly, people with disabilities and workers. The information was provided by the director of the IAS, Hon Wai, in response to a written question from deputy Ho Ion Sang, in which he highlighted the importance of using intelligent technologies and innovative products in raising the level of support services provided to those most in need.
In the message sent to the Government, the deputy pointed out that the “rapid aging of Macau's population”, the “increasing diversification of demand for care by people with disabilities” and “society's desire for high-quality community care” are growing threats to “the traditional model of social services”, increasingly unable to respond to Macau's demographic profile.
The solution proposed by Ho Ion Sang involves the development of “technological capabilities” and the acquisition of “innovative products”, as well as strengthening the application of artificial intelligence, so that technology is interconnected effectively and successfully in the daily care of the elderly and people with disabilities. At the same time, the Government must also apply the concept of “industry-academia-research” and integrate scientific research work into locally developed social equipment and services.
In the response text, the president of the IAS assures that “the Macao SAR Government has paid attention to the service needs of the elderly, people with disabilities and their families”, as evidenced by the measures included in the “Action Plan for the Development of Support Services for the Elderly in the Next Ten Years” and in the “Planning of Rehabilitation Services of the Macau Special Administrative Region for the Next Decade”, both in force between 2016 and 2025.
Hon Wai says that the measures foreseen in these plans “proactively” promoted the scope and effectiveness of the acquisition of “technological equipment from Macau and neighboring regions” in support and rehabilitation services in the territory. According to data provided by the person in charge, 15 nursing homes and nine special day care centers recently added a total of 290 pieces of equipment for the elderly to their facilities – namely, bed alarm systems, automated medication management systems, intelligent systems for electronic health records and service management systems.
In parallel, 12 residential rehabilitation structures and five daytime skills stimulation centers acquired 53 pieces of rehabilitation technology equipment, including virtual rehabilitation systems, dynamic systems for recovery training, 'sit-to-stand lifters' and equipment for gait training with body weight support. The person in charge adds that these new devices “increase physical capacity” and “ensure the housing and life safety of people with disabilities”, in addition to providing added value to the work of employees.
GOVERNMENT WILL CONTINUE TO INTERCONNECT TECHNOLOGY AND SOCIAL SERVICES
With regard to the application of intelligent technologies in the field of elderly care, the person responsible states that the Directorate of Economic and Technological Development Services (DSEDT) will continue to coordinate efforts with other entities and facilitate the application of innovative products and services, according to the “real needs” of the population.
The Fund for the Development of Science and Technology (FDCT) has also supported higher education institutions and companies in Macau “in developing research in areas such as health maintenance and intelligent care for the elderly”, says Hon Wai. An example of this is the financial support programs it regularly launches, aiming to implement results and solutions in the field of scientific research, or the “Industry-University-Research Contact Grants Online Platform”, which establishes a bridge between academia and industry.
In addition, the FDCT also supported the creation of a “small smart pharmacy” of traditional Chinese medicine and a study on “an artificial intelligence application for assessing the cognitive capacity of elderly people”, making use of eye tracking technology.
Speaking on behalf of the IAS and the Macau Science Center, Hon Wai recalls that, in 2025, the “Intelligent Mobility Aid Design Competition” was organized, aimed at “inspiring secondary school students to apply their knowledge and skills in the areas of science, technology and innovation”. Although still in the drafting phase, the “Guidelines on the Design and Adaptation of the Home Environment for the Elderly of the Macao SAR” will soon be implemented, which will act as a “reference” for the interior design, construction and engineering sectors.
Community awareness is also part of the Government's plans, which intends to install “in the future” an exhibition area on adapting the home environment for the elderly. The aim is, therefore, to “stimulate the development of the service industry aimed at seniors”.
On a final note, the president of the IAS guarantees that the next ten-year plans of the Macao SAR Government will focus on the application of intelligent technology in social services, “in order to obtain better management and greater efficiency in the provision of services” in the area in question.</description><pubDate>2026-01-13 02:04:46</pubDate></item><item><title>Macau Chinese Orchestra will “Break the Dawn” this Friday</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2026/01/13/orquestra-chinesa-de-macau-vai-romper-a-aurora-esta-sexta-feira/</link><description>“Romper da Aurora” is the name of this year’s first concert by the Macau Chinese Orchestra, which takes place this Friday, January 16th, at 7:45 pm, in the Small Auditorium of the Macau Cultural Center. “With the theme of the dawn, a symbol of hope and a new beginning, the ‘Romper da Aurora’ concert will take the public on an exciting artistic journey that celebrates the sunrise through a repertoire of classical and contemporary Chinese works”, describes the press release released by the Cultural Institute (IC).

Marcus Im began by taking stock of the progress of UPM's pedagogical operations in the Deep Cooperation Zone. According to the rector's presentation, in the first phase, a temporary post will be installed to begin postgraduate teaching initiatives, in the current year of 2026. The UPM campus will be built in a second phase, with construction scheduled to begin in 2027 and completed in 2030.
At that time, the person in charge said, “the headquarters in Macau and the UPM campus in the Cooperation Zone will embrace new opportunities for teaching activities in cross-border, international and regional areas”.
In turn, the deputy director and deputy chief architect of the UTSC Architectural Design and Research Institute, Huang Jun, presented the institute's design and results. He stressed that this is a “prestigious” institution, which has “successfully” completed landmark projects, such as the University of Macau (UM) campus in Hengqin, and “has accumulated vast experience in integrating cultures, innovating functions and seeking sustainable development”.
In a statement, UPM says that the meeting served to acquire “a deeper understanding of cutting-edge ideas in campus planning, which will serve as a valuable reference for its subsequent work”. It also adds that “it will actively raise resources from all parties and constantly promote the construction of the campus in the Cooperation Zone, with the aim of cultivating more qualified professionals for the country and for Macau”, thus contributing to the region becoming “a place for the aggregation of outstanding international qualified professionals”.</description><pubDate>2026-01-13 23:56:57</pubDate></item><item><title>Macau and Hengqin discuss cooperation plans for 2026</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2026/01/13/macau-e-hengqin-discutem-planos-de-cooperacao-para-2026/</link><description>The Fund for the Development of Science and Technology (FDCT) and the Economic Development Services Bureau of the Guangdong-Macao In-depth Cooperation Zone in Hengqin (DSDE) held the “Disclosure Session of the Joint Support Policy for the Industry–University–Research Project between Macau and Hengqin” in 2026, in the In-depth Cooperation Zone.

Livraria Portuguesa will host an event to present Alice Kok's new book on January 24th. Entitled “Mind to Mind – The Diverse Horizons of Macao Contemporary Art: A Selection of Curatorial Essays (2008-2025)”, the work brings together a collection of essays on 68 exhibitions opened in Macau between 2008 and 2025, all curated by the president of Art for All Society (AFA).
The title “Mind to Mind” (translatable as “From Mind to Mind”) serves as a mirror for the purpose of this collection: the mind of the artists and the mind of the audience, connected through a bridge formed by the curatorship of Alice Kok. The work itself “is, in fact, a collection of minds”, explains the curator, in conversation with PONTO FINAL.
The title in Chinese expands this idea using an expression of Buddhist origin which, in simplified form, means that the mind has the ability to accumulate “seeds” and manifest them in concrete actions and experiences, as soon as the right conditions arise. In the context of this metaphor, Alice Kok is the fundamental driving force that unites the “seeds” of art that have sprouted in the territory over almost two decades and the public thirsty for knowledge. “The title in English therefore refers to the way I connect different people and create a channel of communication through art.”
The broad temporal coverage of the work allows us to follow the artistic transformations that have occurred in Macau over the last 18 years, at a time when the AFA was still taking its first steps and the public's relationship with art was even more modest. “When AFA was founded it only had six members, and now it has 80”, notes the curator. The association “grew exponentially” during this period, following the vibrant rhythm of an increasingly cosmopolitan, artistic and international city.
At the end of the first decade of the 21st century, “the cultural industry was still beginning” to take shape. “We made a big effort, and that effort is showing itself today” – not only in the number of exhibitions and cultural initiatives that take place in the city's galleries, but also in terms of artistic appreciation. "We have evolved a lot in terms of the dissemination and professionalization of art. The public is now more used to Macau having exhibitions every week."
When taking a retrospective of Macau's art, it is inevitable to also contemplate his own evolution as an artist. "The first exhibition I organized was in 2008, when James Chu, the founding member of AFA, invited me to curate a solo exhibition. At the time, I didn't really know what to do", she confesses, laughing.
The initial insecurity gave way to an experienced and self-assured artist, who dedicated the last 18 years to learning the theory of art and the way it metamorphoses in the specific context of Macau. An evolution that, he believes, will also be noticeable to readers of the book: “I would say that the more recent texts are better, as I have strived to be better and better”.
With the exception of “two or three texts” that were left aside, the anthology brings together practically all the works in which he participated throughout his career. And these are not just curatorial texts: “I also plan the entire exhibition, including the financing and conceptual proposal, choose the artist, work with the works of art, prepare the promotions... It's a whole process that I wanted to immortalize in the book, as if to mark the achievement of a milestone”. The most challenging part of editing the book was, therefore, not selecting the texts that would comprise it, but rather dividing them into different thematic chapters.
“From the beginning, when I wrote this proposal for the book, I decided that I wanted to separate the texts into different categories”, he explains, hesitating on the last word. "Categories, not: guidelines. Different contexts, such as “personal growth”, “social assistance”, a section dedicated to women, another on group exhibitions on the development of art in Macau…”.

SPECIAL PARTICIPATION OF TWO MENTORS

Although the event at Livraria Portuguesa will feature a presentation by the author herself, there is still room for two special guests to speak: Carlos Marreiros and Ung Vai Meng. More than two great figures in Macau's arts and culture, they are also, from a more personal perspective, mentor figures of enormous importance for Alice Kok's artistic development.
Ung Vai Meng's mentorship dates back to 2004, when the painter held the position of director of the Macau Museum of Art (MAM). “He was the one who gave me the opportunity to help coordinate an art project at the museum, called ‘Inward Gaze’”, he recalls. It was a national performance art project curated by Ung Vai Meng himself, in which all award-winning artists were entitled to participate in an exchange program in France for a month.
"As I had just graduated from an art school in France, I was invited to coordinate this program. It was very important for my career, and I was always grateful for the opportunity", she acknowledges, stressing that this first contact was consolidated into a mentoring relationship essential to the development of AFA – and to her own growth as an artist.
"I very much see him as my main mentor; a highly regarded curator and artist whose work I greatly admire. So, for this occasion in which I wrote a book after 18 years of work, of course I thought of him. As he wrote the foreword to my book, I invited him to come to the launch to share his ideas with the audience."
As for the professional and friendly relationship with Carlos Marreiros, it all started with an invitation to take part in the second edition of ARTFEM 2020 – Macau International Biennial of Women Artists. An initiative that, it is important to mention, was unprecedented worldwide: to date, it continues to hold the title of the only international biennial dedicated exclusively to female artists.
Alice Kok reports that, since then, the architect has followed the development of her career and clarified the doubts that have arisen in the meantime, in a dynamic that almost resembles that of disciple and teacher. "You've watched me grow over all these years, and we still meet very often when I have questions. You teach me a lot."
Having finished reflecting on the last two decades, Alice Kok now dares to try to guess what will be beyond the horizon in the coming years. Just as he recognizes the role of older and experienced artists in building their artistic identity, he believes that the future of art involves precisely the same strategy – mentoring, advising and supporting young people who are still just considering a possible future in art.
"Our professional development must continue with an educational mission. It is necessary to help younger people to see art as a substantial professional choice", contributing to the region's creative fabric continuing to strengthen itself from generation to generation. "When we talk about art and culture, we are not talking about a short-term achievement or a commercial investment. It is something long-term, like planting a tree – and the secret is that the more experienced artists help the younger ones to flourish."</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>China calls for preserving stability in Iran in the face of US threats</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2026/01/13/china-pede-que-se-preserve-a-estabilidade-no-irao-face-a-ameacas-dos-eua/</link><description>China called yesterday to “preserve the stability” of Iran and expressed its “opposition to any external interference or the use of force”, in response to Washington's warnings about a possible escalation against Tehran.
At a press conference, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning stated that Beijing “expects and supports Iran to maintain national stability” and reiterated China’s opposition to “interference in the internal affairs of other countries” and “the threat or use of force in international relations”.
As declarações surgem depois de órgãos de comunicação norte-americanos terem noticiado que a Casa Branca está a ponderar diferentes opções, incluindo medidas militares, em relação ao Irão, ao mesmo tempo que Washington instou os seus cidadãos a deixarem o país por razões de segurança. Mao declared that China “expects all parties to do more to contribute to peace and stability in the Middle East.”
Regarding the security situation and protests in Iran, the spokesperson assured that China “will closely monitor developments” and will adopt “all necessary measures” to protect its citizens in the country.
On the economic front, Mao reiterated the position already expressed yesterday by the Chinese embassy in Washington in the face of US President Donald Trump's tariff threats, directed at countries that maintain trade relations with Iran.
The spokesperson stressed that “there are no winners in a tariff war” and stressed that China “will firmly defend its legitimate and legal rights and interests”.
The statements come after Trump announced the imposition of additional tariffs on countries that “do business” with Iran, a measure that China has classified as a unilateral sanction, in a context of growing diplomatic and security tension around the Persian country.</description><pubDate>2026-01-13 23:53:03</pubDate></item><item><title>Cáritas Macau calls for more attention to the mental health of the population who don’t speak Chinese</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2026/01/13/caritas-macau-pede-mais-atencao-a-saude-mental-da-populacao-que-nao-fala-chines/</link><description>Cáritas raised awareness of the mental well-being of the population that does not speak Chinese, following an 86% increase in requests for online help in 2025. That year, the service received 138 requests for online help through the service in English, an increase of 86%. Requests for telephone assistance also grew, reaching 98, an increase of 17%.

Cáritas Macau has called for greater attention to the mental well-being of the non-Chinese speaking population, following an 86% increase in online requests for help in 2025. Cáritas Suicide Prevention Services operates a helpline in Cantonese, Mandarin, Portuguese and English.
Last year, the service received 138 online help requests through the service in English, up 86%. Requests for telephone assistance also grew, reaching 98, an increase of 17%. "Most non-Chinese speakers feel alone in Macau. We should be more concerned about them," said Benedict Lok, a counselor at the service.
Requests for help came from people with diverse backgrounds, including the Netherlands, the Philippines, Canada, the United States, India and the Macanese community. The Macanese are a Eurasian community, the majority of whom are of Portuguese descent, with roots in the territory. Lok indicated that 30% of requests were related to access to community resources, 14% involved topics related to suicide, and 2% were from individuals “who simply felt alone and were looking for someone to talk to.” "Typically, at night, people feel more emotional. More than half of orders happen between 4pm and midnight," noted Lok. “Some of them just want to speak in English, feeling they can express themselves better,” he explained.
Official data indicate that there are 57,688 inhabitants whose nationality is neither Chinese nor Portuguese, representing 8.5% of the population. The 2021 census indicates more than 2,200 people born in Portugal living in Macau. The latest estimate given to Lusa by the Consulate General of Portugal pointed to around 155 thousand Portuguese passport holders among residents of Macau and Hong Kong.
The director of Caritas Macau, Paul Pun, explained that the population born outside China generally prefers face-to-face consultations. "So far, our volunteers who know foreign languages ​​also know Chinese, which is enough to help most of them. But, of course, the more [volunteers], the better," he told Lusa.
The charity's Suicide Prevention Services are supported by more than 90 volunteers and ten full-time staff. Within this group, 20 volunteers and three full-time workers are proficient in foreign languages. Pun expressed a desire to expand the team.
In the first half of 2025 there were at least 101 suicide attempts, including 14 children aged 5 to 14, double the number recorded in the same period in 2024, the territory's public broadcaster said in October. Also according to the Portuguese-language channel TDM – Teledifusao de Macau, since the release of data on suicides between January and March at the end of May, the Health Services have not released this statistic again, which is usually published quarterly. In the most recent balance, Macau recorded 18 deaths by suicide, four fewer than in the first three months of 2024.

What if the sunset over the Colosseum in Rome was captured with a Chinese watercolor brush? And a Lingnan alley was designed with classic European pastels? This is the proposal for the collective exhibition “No Trilho de Matteo Ricci”, which the Fundação Rui Cunha gallery opens today, at 6:30 pm. The exhibition brings together the work of 18 doctoral artists from the University of Macau who retraced, in reverse, the historic journey of the Italian Jesuit priest Matteo Ricci, using Indian ink as a “historical pen” for yet another recurring contemporary dialogue between East and West.
Macau will always be the stage and base for the encounter between the two extremes of “Eurasia”. The study trip of this group of artists, held in 2025, started from the point where Matteo Ricci disembarked more than four centuries ago to found Catholic missions in China, our own city of Macau. The route took the painters first to cities in the province of Guangdong, such as Guangzhou and Zhaoqing, and then on a tour of Italy, passing through Rome, Venice and Florence. The result is the 33 works on display that convey the “on-site temperature” of creation, with wind marks on the Xuan paper and street dust on the edges of the paintings.
The artistic cast consists of 18 Chinese creators, namely Zhang Yan, Ma Xinlin, Zhang Wenhua, Yu Peng, Zhang Jing, Huang Xishen, Tan Jiacheng, Shen Minting, Wang Jingmeng, Mo Shuying, Zhang Pingting, Wang Hanzhi, Li Ranqing, Huang Ronghui, Lai Shian, Li Haihao, Zhao Xinxin, including professor and academic supervisor Zhang Yan, and curators Li Ranqing and Lei Meihang. For curator and co-artist Li Ranqing, the project works as a “contemporary practical fieldwork” of Chinese painting, woven around a 400-year-old route of cultural exchange.
"When you see the sunset over ancient Rome in watercolor and the corner of a Lingnan alley in pastels, you are looking at not just landscapes, but also a gentle touch between two civilizations realized through art. Just as Matteo Ricci introduced Western knowledge to China, through Chinese translation centuries ago, we used the language of Chinese painting to try to transform this trajectory through mountains and seas, into a continuous dialogue between civilizations. We chose to present the exhibition in Macau because it is not only the starting point of Ricci’s journey, but also the spiritual anchor of our creation.” says Li Ranqing. The exhibition is the materialization of a long curiosity by Professor Zhang Yan, born in Zhaoqing, in the interior of China, the city where Matteo Ricci passed through in the 16th century.
The figure who inspires this artistic journey, Matteo Ricci, was one of the pioneers of this cultural exchange between Europe and China. Born in Italy in 1552, Ricci arrived in Macau in 1582, where he prepared for his mission to Asia. Unlike other missionaries, he adopted an approach of cultural assimilation, deeply learning the Chinese language, literature and customs. With the Chinese name Lì Mǎdòu, he dressed as a Confucian scholar, translated classical Western works of science and mathematics, and created the first world map in Chinese. His strategy of dialogue and respect, which allowed him access to the imperial court in Beijing, made him a unique figure, better known as a sage who brought knowledge than simply as a religious missionary.
The exhibition, which will run until January 24, is free to enter and is organized by the University of Macau in collaboration with entities such as the Chinese Traditional Painting Art Committee of the China Artists Association and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area Artists Alliance, with the support of the Guangdong Provincial Center for International Cultural Exchange.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Taiwan announces “general consensus” with US on trade agreement</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2026/01/13/taiwan-anuncia-consenso-geral-com-eua-sobre-acordo-comercial/</link><description>Taiwan announced yesterday that it had reached a “general consensus” with the United States on a trade agreement, which had not yet been finalized since Donald Trump’s tariff offensive in early 2025.

“The objective of trade negotiations between the US and Taiwan has always been to seek reciprocal tariff reductions without imposing tax increases”, highlighted the Taiwanese Trade Negotiations Office. Taiwan and the United States have reached a “general consensus” on this point, which allows Taiwan to “obtain preferential treatment,” the cabinet added in a statement.
Taiwan and the United States began negotiations in April to finalize a trade agreement after the US President threatened to impose a 32% tariff on Taiwanese exports, later reduced to 20%.
Taiwanese leader William Lai promised to increase investment in the United States and seek to further reduce tariffs on exports and avoid new duties on Taiwanese electronic chips. Hours earlier, the New York Times had said that the agreement would include a reduction in tariffs on the island's exports and a commitment by TSMC, the world's largest manufacturer of advanced semiconductors, to increase investment in the United States.
The agreement, which has been negotiated for months, is undergoing legal review and could be announced in January, three unidentified sources told the North American newspaper.
The agreement would reduce tariffs on Taiwanese products to 15%, in line with tariffs imposed by Washington on imports from Japan and South Korea.
As part of the agreement, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) would also commit to building at least five new semiconductor factories in Arizona (southwest), according to one of the sources cited by the newspaper.
On August 7, the United States Government imposed a 20% tariff on Taiwanese products, with the exception of semiconductors and various electronic devices, which are the main driver of the island's exports. Since then, the two sides have held several rounds of negotiations, in which Taipei requested a reduction in tariffs and preferential treatment.
TSMC announced in March 2025 plans to increase investment in the United States to $165 billion (141.5 billion euros), to build new factories, advanced chip packaging facilities and a research center in Arizona.
The company, whose main customers include Apple, Nvidia and AMD and which dominates the high-end chip segment, currently operates an advanced semiconductor factory in Arizona and could begin mass production at a second factory in 2027.
Taiwan is a world leader in semiconductor manufacturing. US President Donald Trump accused the island of robbing the US chip industry. Approximately 60% of Taiwan's exports to the United States are in the information and communications technology sector, including semiconductors.

According to a study now revealed, the extreme temperature and pressure conditions generated during this event favored the evaporation of lighter isotopes, permanently altering the satellite's internal chemistry.

The Chinese Chang'e-6 mission brought new evidence about the origin of the dichotomy between the two sides of the Moon, revealing that a gigantic impact changed the composition of the lunar mantle, according to a study published yesterday.
The investigation, led by scientists from the Institute of Geology and Geophysics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, is based on high-precision isotopic analysis of basalts collected by Chang'e-6 in the South Pole's Aitken basin, the satellite's oldest and largest impact crater, and was published in the scientific journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).
The researchers detected that samples from the far side have significantly higher proportions of the heavy potassium isotope compared to lunar rocks collected on the Apollo missions on the visible side.
After excluding other factors, such as irradiation by cosmic rays or later magmatic processes, the team concluded that a large primordial impact, which occurred more than 4,200 million years ago, caused the loss of moderately volatile elements in the lunar mantle.
According to the study, the extreme temperature and pressure conditions generated during this event favored the evaporation of lighter isotopes, permanently altering the satellite's internal chemistry.
This loss of volatiles will have made it difficult to generate magma on the hidden face, which helps explain its lower volcanic activity and more rugged relief, in contrast to the vast basaltic plains of the hemisphere visible from Earth.
Scientists emphasize that this discovery provides new clues to understand how large impacts influenced not only the surface, but also the internal evolution of the Moon in its initial phases.
The Chang’e-6 mission, launched in May 2024, was the first to collect samples from the hidden side of our natural satellite.
China is preparing new unmanned lunar missions, such as Chang'e-7, scheduled for 2026 and destined for the south pole of the Moon, and Chang'e-8, scheduled for 2029 with the participation of 11 countries, which will lay the foundations for future manned missions.
The Asian country has invested heavily in its space program, with achievements such as the first moon landing on the far side of the Moon, carried out by Chang'e-4, and the sending of the Tianwen-1 mission to Mars, which made China the third nation to reach the red planet, after the United States and the extinct Soviet Union.

The program aimed to “effectively implement health promotional work in the community” and its activities “obtained positive feedback from residents”.
In a review made on Monday, the director of Health Services, Alvis Lo, recalled that the Government has been implementing the “national development strategy with priority to health”, “having the health of the population as the center and promoting the decentralization of resources”. “Last year, the Health Services committed themselves to implementing the various works of the Action Plan for a Healthy Macau Healthy Community, with a view to raising the general level of health of residents”. The Cultural Institute, in turn, organized a series of cultural, artistic, cultural and reading activities, while the Sports Institute carried out several sporting activities, aimed at all residents, in order to jointly contribute to their physical and mental health.
On the occasion, the “Health and Wellbeing Station” was also launched, which is an extension of the “Healthy Community” program, developed jointly by the Cultural Institute, the Sports Institute and the Health Services. The first community scenario is made up of three elements, namely, cultural nutrition, the scientific movement and health information. In the first phase, eight stations are installed, which in the future will be expanded to 12 stations, providing regular and convenient health promotion services for all residents, “in order to make health resources available easily and immediately, jointly realizing the government's vision of a Macau based on a dynamic, cultural and happy state”, highlight the Health Services.
The first phase of the “Health and Wellbeing Station” activity has already started and runs until March 31st, from Monday to Friday, from 8am to 10am and from 4:30pm to 6:30pm, at Parque Municipal Dr. Sun Yat Sem, Jardim de Luís de Camões, Leisure Area of Jardim Lok Ieong, Jardim Vasco da Gama, Leisure Area of Alameda da Tranquilidade, Parque Dr. Carlos d’Assumpção, Jardim de S.

The case involves a total of 18 defendants, including Lee Sio Kuan, the first defendant in the case as well as representative of the candidacy committee and head of the list for the “Ou Mun Kong I” elections, one of the six lists excluded in the 2021 elections.
According to the indictment, Lee Sio Kuan, in collusion with other defendants, offered a tourist tour, meals and gifts to more than 200 Macau residents to collect enough signatures from voters, with a view to submitting the request for recognition of the candidate list in question to the Electoral Affairs Committee of the Legislative Assembly (CAEAL).
Ten witnesses were heard at yesterday's hearing and, according to the newspaper Ou Mun, all indicated that they did not participate in the aforementioned tourist tour organized by Lee Sio Kuan, by the General Union of Workers' Forces of Macau that Lee leads, or by the “Ou Mun Kong I” list.
The aforementioned case was investigated by the Commissariat against Corruption (CCAC), after being forwarded by the Public Prosecutor's Office. According to the release of the CCAC case in 2022, the agent, Lee Sio Kuan, and a tour guide, were responsible for organizing a half-day tourist tour, having provided meals and distributed gifts such as liquid laundry detergents and umbrellas with the words “vote for this candidate list” printed on them. “Such activities and gifts were all financed by the aforementioned representative, having managed to attract more than 200 voters to fill in their personal identification data and sign the respective bulletins proposing the list in question”, pointed out the CCAC. The organization also highlighted that, during the investigation, several people confessed that, through cell phone applications or information transmitted by word of mouth, they learned that all they had to do was sign the bulletins to be able to access a tourist tour and free meals.
The aforementioned case of electoral corruption involves several witnesses, informed the TJB, and expects that the provision of witness statements will continue until the end of February.</description><pubDate>2026-01-13 23:57:59</pubDate></item><item><title>Wynn Resorts double awarded in human resources competition</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2026/01/13/wynn-resorts-premiada-duplamente-em-concurso-na-area-dos-recursos-humanos/</link><description>Wynn Resorts was named the “Leading Brand in Human Resources and Talent Development” and the “Leading Brand in Social Responsibility and Innovative ESG Practices” in the 5th National Human Resources Innovation Competition, one of the most prominent competitions in this area.
This year's competition was made up of six categories and attracted more than 500 entries from across the country since its launch in October last year. After several rounds of screening and evaluation, the jury experts chose 220 winners – including Wynn, which announced the victory in a press release yesterday. “These awards demonstrate the industry’s official recognition of the company’s outstanding achievements in talent cultivation and development, corporate social responsibility and sustainable development,” it reads.
Speaking specifically about the Leading Brand in Human Resources and Talent Development award, Wynn attributes this distinction to the “success” of the Local Development Program, co-organized by the company and the Government's Department of Labor Relations.
According to the statement, “the program adopts a ‘hire and train’ approach, providing Macau residents, especially young people, with specialized training lasting 12 to 36 months”, incorporating interdepartmental agreements and international standards. So far, 160 trainees have been trained, with 80% of these receiving promotions after completing the program.
When it comes to the award for Leading Brand in Social Responsibility and Innovative ESG Practices, Wynn says it recognizes employees “as a crucial asset and the core of its social responsibility”, so “their health and well-being” are inseparable factors in the brand’s environmental, social and governance (ESG) development strategy.
In the last two years, since the launch of the Wynn Healthy Business Program, the company has organized more than 100 health-themed activities – with more than 50,000 participants joining – and collaborated with government departments, medical institutions and social organizations, with the aim of “promoting a health-oriented culture” and establishing itself as “an example of innovation in the industry”.
The National Human Resources Innovation Competition is jointly organized by the Human Resources Management Commission of the Chinese Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT) and consultancy HRLead and co-organized by business associations from Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau.</description><pubDate>2026-01-13 01:22:57</pubDate></item><item><title>Light Rail breaks new passenger record in 2025</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2026/01/13/metro-ligeiro-bate-novo-recorde-de-passageiros-em-2025/</link><description>The Light Rail broke a new passenger record in 2025, with 316,800 people using this transport service between January and December. The data reveals growth of around 80% compared to the previous year, 2024, although the month with the highest passenger flow, November, has not yet managed to surpass the daily average of December 2019. On the 23rd of January, the Government will begin a public consultation on the extension of the Light Rail service, in order to respond to passenger travel needs and promote the continued development of this means of transport.

The Light Rail received 316,800 passengers last year – the highest annual number ever since the means of transport began operating. The data available on the Macau Light Metro Society page shows a growth of approximately 80% compared to the previous year of 2024 and an even more significant increase of 291% compared to 2023, the first year in which the metro remained in uninterrupted circulation for twelve months.
It was in November that there was a greater flow of passengers, with a daily average of around 32,600 people. Although this was the busiest month since the metro began charging fares, it was still slightly below the first month of operation, December 2019, when there was a daily average of 33 thousand passengers. Remember, however, that in this first month all trips were free.
Although the Christmas festive season brought 1,139,972 visitors to Macau, metro trips decreased by 15.3% in December compared to the previous month, to 27,600 passengers. On the other hand, the month of June was the one in which the lowest number of passengers was recorded, with a daily average of 19,800 people.
In an overview of 2025, the second half of the year proved to be much busier than the first, with three consecutive months (September, October and November) presenting a daily average of more than 30,600 passengers. This is a trend that can also be observed when analyzing data from previous years, in which the months after September – inclusive – reveal a greater flow of passengers compared to the beginning of the year.
Data referring to 2024 helps to illustrate this situation, with successive increases from 15,200 passengers in October to 16,900 in November and 23,100 in December. However, it is important to remember that the Seac Pai Van line was introduced in November and the Hengqin line in December, helping to breathe new life into the flow of passengers. In total, 176,100 passengers used the Light Rail in 2024.
In 2023, the total number of passengers was 81,050, with particular emphasis on the month of December. The 6,500 passengers recorded in November more than doubled in December, when 13,900 people used the Light Rail for their journeys. In this case, the increase was due to the extension of the Taipa Line service to Barra Station, thus making the connection between Taipa and Macau.
The years 2022 and 2021 were less busy, with respective totals of 16,650 and 17,900 passengers. In October 2021, the metro was forced to stop for six months to replace high-voltage electrical cables, and passenger transport services on the Taipa Line were resumed from April 3, 2022. In July of that year, services were suspended again between the 11th and 23rd due to epidemic prevention measures enacted by the Macao SAR Government.
In 2020, the total number of passengers was 34,600, with almost half of this number (16,000) corresponding to passengers in January, when travel was still free. Travel began to be charged from February, the same month in which the frequency of the service was reduced in response to the evolution of Covid-19 cases in the territory.
The Light Rail began operating in December 2019, with free travel for all passengers. The average number of people who used the metro this month was 33,000, the highest monthly average to date.

DSOP WILL COLLECT OPINIONS ON METRO EXPANSION

Although Light Rail coverage has expanded over the last few years, young people in Macau continue to regret the limitations of the transport network and opt for other means, such as the bus. These were the results of a survey carried out in June last year by the New Chinese Youth Association of Macau, in which only 1.5% of the 647 young people interviewed said they depended on the metro for their daily journeys.
Within the population interviewed, almost 70% said they travel on the Light Rail once every three months, with the main reasons for complaints being related to “stations located very far from home” (46.1%), “insufficient network coverage” (35.6%) and “impossibility of reaching the destination directly” (33.3%).
The Public Works Department (DSOP) announced yesterday that the Government will carry out a public consultation on the “strategic study for the development of the Macau Light Rail” between January 23 and February 28, during which “several sessions will be held to collect opinions from the public and professional sectors”. Citizens can participate in collecting opinions by mail, by telephone or through the form on the thematic electronic page on the DSOP website.
“The development of the Macau Light Metro is an important project of the Macao SAR Government”, highlights the organization. The extension of the service to “areas not yet covered” is part of the effort to promote “the continuous development” of the transport service and the need to meet the travel needs of residents and tourists.
According to information previously provided by the Secretary for Transport and Public Works, Raymond Tam, the Southern Line will cover the area from the Macau Border Post on the Artificial Island of the Hong Kong–Zhuhai–Macau Bridge, passing through Zone A of the New Landfills, NAPE, Lake Nam Van, Sai Van, to Barra Station. In turn, the West Line will start at the Qingmao Border Post, pass through Fai Chi Kei and end at Barra Station. The Taipa North Line will cross the Zone E station, zones D and C and connect to Oceano Station. Finally, the Seac Pai Van Line will run from Seac Pai Van Station to the edge of Vila de Coloane.</description><pubDate>2026-01-13 02:05:26</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
