The proposal, released by Lee on the Facebook social network, comes when South Koreans are two weeks to choose at the polls their president for a single five-year term, in a vote triggered by the dismissal of former President Yoon Suk Yeol.
The latest polls show that Lee, the opposition's Democratic Party candidate, leads the race to the scheduled June 3 elections with a 51%support rate. "We will make the president more responsible and decentralize power," Lee said in a Facebook post. "A presidency of four years and two terms would allow interchangeary assessments of the administration, which would increase its responsibility."
Subsequently, in response to journalists at an event in Gwangju, Lee stressed that the South Korean Constitution does not allow a presidential mandate revision to be applied to the leader in office, Yonhap News reported.
Lee also proposed a series of measures designed to give more powers to Parliament, such as the limitation of the President's right of veto and the requirement of parliamentary approval for the declaration of martial law. "If discussions progress sufficiently, we can ask what people want in local 2026 elections or the 2028 general elections, even if backwards," Lee wrote on Facebook.
The election of the next president of South Korea is a crucial step in replacing export power on the way to political stability, after Yoon's martial decree in December, triggered the country's worst constitutional crisis in decades.
On Saturday, Yoon abandoned the Popular Power Party, paving the way for conservatives to attract more indecisive voters, when the failure of martial law still lays a dense shadow on their candidate Kim Moon-Soo.
Kim, Yoon's former Labor Minister, was praised by conservatives for opposing Yoon's dismissal and refused to apologize for the decree of martial law.</description><pubDate>2025-05-19 05:53:44</pubDate></item><item><title>Macau and Hong Kong interested in collaborating with Portuguese ports</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/05/19/macau-e-hong-kong-interessados-em-colaborar-com-portos-portugueses/</link><description>Sea Policy Director Marisa Lameiras da Silva said the authorities of Macao and Hong Kong expressed interest in exploring potential collaborations with ports in Portugal.

IAS considers urgent to face the problem
 
The Institute of Social Action (IAS) held an interdepartal meeting last Friday that focused on exchange with social work and education entities in the reinforcement of mental health and suicide prevention, as well as optimizing the mechanisms and measures of emotional support in Macao.
IAS president Hon Wai reiterated that the government has attributed “maximum attention” to the suicide problem, having reinforced intersectory cooperation and allocated support resources for the community.

The main reason for the descent was an increase in the weight of visitors who arrived on organized excursions and spent less than a day in Macao.
 
The average consumption of each visitor in Macao, excluding in casinos, fell 13.2% in the first quarter of the year, compared to the same period of 2024. According to the direction of statistics and census services (DSEC), the per capita expense of not -related tourists was 1,989 patacas between January and March.
Official data show that the main reason for the descent was an increase in the weight of visitors who arrived on organized excursions and spent less than a day in Macao.
In the first three months of the year, these excursionists accounted for about 59% of all tourists who entered the city, compared to less than 54% in the same period as 2024.
While this type of visitor spent per capita only 729 patacas, 10.8% less than between January and March last year, the expense of tourists who slept at least one night in Macao reached 3,807 patacas, less 5.4%.
Still, the decrease in the total expense of visitors not related to the game was lower, 3.6%, to 19.6 billion patacas, because the increase in the number of tourists "mitigated part of the decrease," DSEC said.
Macau received 9.86 million visitors between January and March, 11.1% more than in the same period of 2024 and the second highest amount ever for a year starter. "We have more and more tourists, but the level of consumption is lowering," warned, last week, the leader of the government of Macao, Sam Hou Fai. The chief executive of the region pointed to "a change in the consumer model, the way of visiting", since "young visitors have their own way of doing tourism, the experience will be different."
Also DSEC had, on May 2, pointed out the “change in the consumption pattern of visitors” as one of the main reasons for the 1.3% of Macao's economy between January and March.
It was the first time that the territory's gross domestic product has shrunk in homologous terms since the end of 2022, when the region began to raise restrictions due to Covid-19 pandemic.
The economic benefit of tourist services - the sector that dominates the economy of Macau - fell 3.8% in the first quarter of the year.
In mid -April, Sam Hou Fai recalled that “savings increased” in mainland China - by far the main source of tourists to Macau - although the country has been in deflation (annual consumer prices) for three consecutive months.
The government leader argued that these data show that the Chinese population also has "a feeling of risk", which was already coming before the United States began a trade war with China. Sam Hou Fai has admitted that the fares could lead visitors to spend less, especially in case of Renminbi devaluation.

The Directorate of Statistics and Census Services (DSEC), which revised preliminary data released earlier this month, justifies the retreat with the “change in the consumption pattern of visitors”. Authorities warn again to the challenges caused by the international conjuncture and uncertainties in Sino-American relations.
 
The Directorate of Statistics and Census Services (DSEC) has now reviewed GDP data released preliminarily earlier this month and confirmed the 1.3% of Macao's economy in the first quarter in relation to the same period last year. The first quarter GDP was reviewed to 99.76 billion patacas, which is equivalent to 85.2% of the first quarter economic volume of 2019.
According to DSEC, this fall of the economy was due to "the basis of relatively high comparison of the first quarter of the previous year and the change in the consumption pattern of visitors." The implicit deflator of GDP (99.6), which measures the global price variation, descended 0.5%compared to the first quarter of 2024.
Regarding external demand, it was observed that, although the number of visitors from the visitors increased by 11.1% compared to the first quarter of last year, global exports of services registered a homologous fall of 3.4% in the quarter under analysis, also due to the “change in the consumption pattern of visitors and the relatively high comparison of the previous year's year's quarter”, explains the DSEC.
The body points out that exports of other tourist services decreased by 11.7%of the first quarter of 2024, however, 12.7%grew, compared to the identical quarter of 2019, and exports of game services increased by 1.6%in annual terms. Regarding foreign trade in goods, exports and imports of goods fell 9.2% and 5.1%, respectively, compared to the first quarter of the previous year.
Internal demand was "relatively stable" in the first quarter, with private consumer expense increased by 0.3%, in annual terms, "thanks to the continuous stability of the economic environment and the labor market." The government's final consumer consumer expense has also risen 1.1%. In addition to these, gross fixed capital formation rose 7.3%, compared to the first quarter of 2024, “because companies continued to invest more in Macao,” says DSEC in a statement. It should be noted that, in the private sector, investment in construction and investment in equipment grew 24.1% and 19%, respectively. While in the public sector, investment in construction and investment in equipment registered homologous decreases of 14.6% and 6.1%, respectively, “due to some large public works were completed”.
In the note released, the DSEC also says that since the beginning of this year, "the international conjuncture marks some volatility and challenges, the driving force of the growth of the global economy is not sufficient and the uncertainties in Sino-American relations have grown."
The body also says that "taking into account the rapid changes in the consumption pattern of visitors, their preferences and consumer demographics affected the intention to consume the visitors of Macao," there was a drop in visitors' expenses, "causing a certain impact on the development of the Macao Tourism sector."
Thus, fluctuations in the process of recovering the local economy in the first quarter of this year were found, but "Macau's economy maintains the pace of recovery in global terms, public finances remain stable and local development is positive." "Overall, Macao's economy will not mark a cyclic recession if there are no major changes in the internal and external context, a continuous tendency for recovery, the DSEC statement concludes.</description><pubDate>2025-05-19 05:52:44</pubDate></item><item><title>Hypothecary loans register increase in March</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/05/19/emprestimos-hipotecarios-registam-aumento-em-marco-2/</link><description>In March, the new mortgage loans for housing and commercial loans for approved real estate activities were growing in relation to the previous month, Macao monetary authority (AMCM) said.

The executive indicated that he will take into account the ideas and then elaborate a proposal.
 
Sam Hou Fai had already implied that there are changes in the pecuniary reimbursement plan in economic development. Last Thursday and Friday, the government met several associations to hear opinions on the subject.
Tai Kin IP, secretary for the economy and finance, met with industrial and commercial sectors, as well as unions and organizations of "Think Tank". The leaders of the associations have agreed that it is necessary to review the objective and nature of the distribution of pecuniary reimbursement and to consider “the viability of the adoption of other forms of attribution and combinations of attribution”, such as consumer cards or consumer valleys, for example.
According to the associations heard by Tai Kin IP, the introduction of the 183 -day stay requirement in Macau should be studied, paying attention to any exceptions, such as working, studying or spending old age inside China.
The secretary for the economy and finance thanked the “valuable opinions” presented by the representatives, ensuring that they will serve as an “important reference” for when the government advances to revise the conditions of the pecuniary reimbursement plan.
LAM, secretary for social affairs and culture, listened to opinions and suggestions from the representatives of the different sectors' associations, namely social services, cultural and recreational activities, education, youth and academic study.
Those responsible for these sectors agreed with the revision of the pecuniary reimbursement plan, considering that “it is necessary to clarify the objective of the policy of the monetary reimbursement and gradually promote the optimization of the regime”. The associations heard by LAM also suggested setting a limit to the number of days of stay in Macao, exempting residents who study abroad, who are spending old age or work inside China, for example.
There were also who suggested the adjustment of the attribution criteria, in order to save MSAR resources "that could be used to help the most vulnerable groups." The groups also suggested that other forms of attribution of the pecuniary check were implemented.
The secretary stated at the meeting that all requests from the different sectors of the company will be submitted to a comprehensive analysis, which will be carefully considered, "with the aim of realizing the work of improvement of the monetary reimbursement in a timely manner."
It is recalled that the pecuniary reimbursement plan was implemented from 2008, and at the time a temporary beneficial measure being in response to economic recession and high inflation, whose objective was to share with the population the result of economic development, if there were conditions in government coffers. In recent years, through this pecuniary reimbursement plan, the government assigns 10,000 patacas to each permanent resident and 6,000 to each non -permanent resident.
In early March, the chief executive guaranteed the continuity of the plan, but warned that the value and form of attribution of the checks could be changed.</description><pubDate>2025-05-19 05:54:43</pubDate></item><item><title>Asian Forum reaffirms a fundamental role of the WTO in resolution of commercial disputes</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/05/19/forum-asiatico-reafirma-papel-fundamental-da-omc-na-resolucao-de-disputas-comerciais/</link><description>Those responsible for trade in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum (APEC) adopted a joint statement in which they reaffirm the fundamental role of the World Trade Organization (WTO) to resolve commercial disputes.
 
In a context of growing global tensions due to the new US tariff policy, the ASIA-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) statement underlines the need for significant and structural reforms in the WTO so that it can respond more effectively to the current challenges of global trade.
The statement underlines the commitment in a transparent commercial environment, predictable and favorable to companies, stressing the urgency of modernizing the multilateral commercial system simultaneously. "We recognize the importance of the WTO to advance commercial issues and recognize that the rules agreed within the organization are an integral part of the world commercial system," says the joint statement issued at the end of the two-day event on the South Korean Island of Jeju.
WTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, who was present at the meeting, also appealed APEC's political support for APEC significant and inclusive reforms before the 14th Ministerial Conference of the Organization, scheduled for March 2026.
The text, adopted unanimously, also recognizes the potential of artificial intelligence, resilient supply chains and digital integration as fundamental axes for the sustainable growth of regional trade. "Since the beginning of technical negotiations, on Thursday, May 8, the differences in positions between the countries have been accentuated. However, under the leadership of the host country, the main members have demonstrated the maximum flexibility to find common language on the direction of cooperation of world trade," says the statement of the South Korean Ministry related to the declaration of the Forum.
According to the local news agency Yonhap, some rumors suggest that direct language, such as “rejection of protectionism” or criticism of “unilateralism”, was excluded due to Washington's pressure to maintain politically neutral content.
The meeting took place after the imposition of “reciprocal” and sectoral customs rights by the United States to various countries, including South Korea and China. Despite the tension, both Washington and Beijing agreed this week with a temporary reduction in their rates and opened a 90 -day window for new negotiations.
However, APEC's economic report provides that regional growth decreases from 3.6% by 2024 to 2.6% in 2025, with exports to grow only 0.4% compared to 5.7% in the previous year.
During the event, the US commerce representative, Jamieson Greer, drew attention by holding several bilateral meetings requested by the countries affected by the new tariffs.

"We appeal to the Macao government to make sure journalists are not prevented from doing their work from keeping citizens informed," the coordinator for Asia of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists (CPJ), Beh Lih Yi, said.
Since May 8, the Macau Executive has organized three public events in which it only allowed the presence of daily and weekly newspaper reporters, television stations, radio and news agencies. The Macao Government's Social Communication Office (GCS) told Lusa that the exclusion of the online and monthly press was “common practice” and that it depended on the organizing entities of public events. A repeated justification, using virtually the same words, by the background for the development of science and technology and the monetary authority of Macao, event organizers on May 8 and 12, who excluded online and monthly press.
On Friday, in a note on an event organized together by six public entities and widespread by GCS, the 'online' and monthly press was excluded “due to the limited space on site”. "Journalists should be able to cover events of public interest without fear of reprisals," said Beh Lih Yi.
On April 17, two All About Macau journalists, an online newspaper with a monthly paper version, were detained by police while trying to enter the local parliament hall to attend the presentation of the political program in the area of ​​administration and justice to 2025.
The Legislative Assembly claimed that there was a “great influx” of journalists and that “the space for interviews, as well as the places available in the Plenary Room are limited”. "There has been a systematic erosion of press freedom in Macao, with denial of entry to journalists and restricted access to public events," warned the coordinator for CPJ Asia. "The detention of two reporters simply for trying to cover a legislative session marks a disturbing climb in the repression of independent journalism," lamented Beh Lih Yi.
The leader argued that "authorities must withdraw any potential accusations against All About Macau reporters and allow journalists to work without interference."
The online and monthly publication accused the Legislative Assembly of preventing “repeatedly All About Macao journalists from doing their normal reporting work under false pretexts”.
The Macao Journalists Association, led by one of the detained journalists, Ian Sio Tou, had previously expressed concern about the increase of official events without coverage of the media and “discriminatory practices” to the sector.

These factors, however, are “balanced by high reserves and above pairs and surpluses of the current scale, which offer some margin in a context of an international price of the most challenging oil and limited sources of financing,” write Fitch analysts.
In the note that accompanies the decision to maintain the rating in B-, below the level of investment recommendation, the Fitch provides a slowdown of economic growth to 2.8% this year, which compares with the 4.4% registered last year, and considers Angola to grow more than 3% next year.
The country will also face a lower oil price in the next semesters, around $ 65 per barrel, comparing it to the $ 79.5 last year, and a “small decline” in production, from 1.1 million daily barrels in 2024 to 1.07 million this year, which will have a significant budgetary impact due to the strong dependence on the export of this raw material for foreign currency.
Regarding public debt, there was a “abrupt reduction” last year to 54.6% of GDP, which compares with a 70.7% ratio at the end of 2023, “mainly motivated by primary budget surpluses, strong nominal GDP growth and € 1.9 billion external debt payments”, about $ 1.7 billion euros.
For this reduction contributed the internal audit by the Angolan authorities, which found duplication of data that represented a reduction of $ 1.8 billion, about 2% of the GDP of this Portuguese African country.
Fitch foresees a budget deficit of 2.4% of GDP this year and 2.3% next year, essentially because of the fall in oil revenues, and also estimates that expenditure on fuel subsidies decrease to 1.8% by 2025 and 1.4% by 2026, which implies an administrative increase in the price of fuel supported by users.</description><pubDate>2025-05-19 05:53:40</pubDate></item><item><title>Owner of the first model Ia from China focused on Portuguese prepares entry into bag</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/05/19/dona-do-primeiro-modelo-ia-da-china-focado-no-portugues-prepara-entrada-em-bolsa/</link><description>The company that developed China's first linguistic model that uses artificial intelligence (IA) for Portuguese is planning to list on the bag and expand in the Lusophone markets, the founder told Lusa.
 
Lin Yuchu said the Zhuhai -based Deepranx has plans to enter the Hong Kong or Shenzhen stock market. More than ten companies in Portugal and Brazil have invested three million Yuan to use Deeco-Model, a large linguistic model specializing in Portuguese language content. But DeepTranx's executive president stressed that the company wants to go further. “In the future, we will enjoy Macau as a gateway through the initiative‘ a track, a route ’to expand ourselves to the Lusophone markets,” said Lin.
The initiative “a track, a route” is a global strategy for infrastructure development adopted by the China government in 2013 and has invested in more than 150 countries.
Lin began to work in automatic translation between Chinese, Portuguese and English in 2012, when he was a student at the University of Macau.
Already after founding DeepTranx in 2018, the businessman identified opportunities in the Lusophone market and created China's first great AI model focused on Portuguese, "since AI sectors in Chinese and English were already saturated." "In 2022, we updated a complete and large linguistic model after advances in AI algorithms," he added.
Deeco-Model supports text, image, audio and video processing, covering 17 sectors, including finance, technology and culture. "It is more specialized and professional than other traditional models for local content," said Lin, giving as an example "consultations on the laws of Macau or the history and culture Lusophone."
The system can also differentiate between European Portuguese and Brazilian Portuguese, identifying grammatical, lexical and phonetic variations.
DeepTranx employs 40 full -time workers and 3,800 linguists on a freelance regime, which specializes in Portuguese variants and 100,000 multilingual data employees worldwide. "To date, we got 30 million yuan in financing," said Lin.
The investment came from companies such as Chinese Tencent and Baidu technological giants and the owner of the largest Chinese Internet Literature platform, China Literature Ltd, “in addition to small and medium -sized companies in Zhuhai,” added DeepTranx leader.
The interest in the Portuguese language in China has grown rapidly in the last 25 years, fueled by the evolution of trade between China and Lusophony, which in 2024 only surpassed $ 225 billion.

Still, about 38% of these hypertensive people do not have controlled pressure, highlighting the importance of improvements in the health system to promote greater prevention and treatment. On the other hand, the recent self -control and monitoring system already indicates positive results, with over 1 million measurements performed in 2024.
 
In the context of public health actions, health services (SS) held a press conference, in anticipation of the “World Hypertension Day”, to disclose essential information on the prevalence, monitoring and control of this condition. According to the “Health Inquiry of Macau 2016”, approximately 25% of the population has hypertension, which highlights a large -scale public health challenge.
Hypertension is a primary risk factor for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, with potentially serious consequences, including myocardial infarction, strokes and heart failure. Associated symptoms such as chest pain, dizziness and respiratory difficulties may indicate acute complications, requiring a rapid and effective response. The diagnostic and treatment rate still has enhancement margins, although recent efforts have contributed to significant advances.
The implementation of the quality indicators system in 2023, which bears the name of “Quality Indicators System for Chronic Disease Management” and that introduces the cyclic model “Planning-Exciting-Initially focused on Diabetes, but extended in 2024 to the scope of hypertension, expected to include this year the management of blood Lipid anomalies, thus forming an integrated system of prevention and control of the so -called “three hyper”.
The system aims to promote continuous management of chronic diseases and the territory recorded improvements in adherence to treatment, as indicated by the Family Medicine Assistant in the area of ​​Community Health Care of Health Services, TAM Kwong Ho. By 2024, the hypertensive treatment rate reached 89.6%, while the rate of blood pressure control, ie the proportion of patients with controlled levels, reached 62.6%. These numbers represent an increase of 14.1% in the control rate over the previous year. In addition, 11,590 new cases were stabilized, reaching a level of blood pressure considered controlled.
The system proposes regular monitoring by residents through self -assessment posts. In 2024, more than 1.14 million blood pressure measurements were performed at these posts, with about 87,000 active users, showing significant involvement of the community in early prevention.
In the area of ​​diabetes, data indicate that 60.1% of patients properly control blood glucose, 71.2% maintain blood pressure under control and 60% have levels of blood lipids within the recommended parameters. These indicators reflect a positive evolution, with the overall compliance rate of the three parameters to rise to 29.3%, an increase of 9.1% compared to 2023.
During the week of the “World Hypertension Day” several promotion activities were performed, including blood pressure verification events, with a participation of more than 12,000 residents in 2024. These actions aim to sensitize about the importance of early diagnosis, regular monitoring and adoption of healthy lifestyle habits, aligning with national health protection strategies, as indicated by medical NGGA Teng, also present during the conference.</description><pubDate>2025-05-19 05:48:58</pubDate></item><item><title>Macau receives a prize of “Best Destination for Annual Conference”</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/05/19/macau-recebe-premio-de-melhor-destino-para-conferencia-anual/</link><description>Macau was selected as the “Best Destination for Annual Conference” in the first edition of the Asia-Pacific Corporate Conference Exhibition (APCAC, on the original English acronym), which took place on May 15 and 16 in Shenzhen. This is the second time that Macau has received this type of distinction in just over a month, after being selected as a destination of excellence in “brilliant star” convention and exhibitions last April.
The Institute for the Promotion of Trade and Investment (IPIM) has installed a stand on site and presented before the public of the conference the advantages of the brand “Mice² Macao x Hengqin” and the organization model “an event, two locations”, referring to Macau and Hengqin. According to an IPIM statement, several APCAC buyers addressed the institution of Macao in order to know more details about the organization of conferences in the region, proving the success of the presentation.
The award was awarded after the vote of about 100 institutions and companies dedicated to sectors such as investment, science and technology, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, logistics, finance, and tourism and consultancy.
In recent years, the convention and exhibition sector in Macao has been repeatedly recognized by international authorities of the sector, and the last awards took place in early April. This recognition shows a “optimistic” perspective regarding the region's “development perspectives” in this specific area, as well as helping to “continually promote the international influence of Macao”.
APCAC, organized by TTG Asia Media's subsidiary within China, is a business contact scholarship that streamlines corporate annual conferences where participants together discuss industry trends in Asia-Pacific, promoting business opportunities through presentation sessions such as IPIM.</description><pubDate>2025-05-19 05:53:43</pubDate></item><item><title>Hello Kitty Themed Bus makes free trips in the North Zone</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/05/19/autocarro-tematico-da-hello-kitty-faz-viagens-gratuitas-na-zona-norte/</link><description>A themed bus of the character Hello Kitty had its inaugural trip yesterday, at 10:00, in Lotus Square in the Ilha Verde neighborhood. The bus officially goes into operation today, with free trips that can be reserved by residents and tourists through the Electronic page created by the Directorate of Economics and Technological Development Services (DSEDT).
The route begins and end at the Qingmao border post, with five other landing points along the way: Rua da Hortense, near the border post of the siege gates; Eastern pearl of black sand; IAO Hon Market Garden; Yat Yuen (Canidrome); and The Waterfront Duet Macao, in the Fai Chi Kei housing neighborhood. In addition to marking the seats, passengers can also consult the Map navigation function on the 'site' as well as a “gastronomic map of the north zone”, with stores surrounding stores.
The interior of the bus presents a decoration totally dedicated to the character of the Japanese company Sanrio throughout the body, including in the seats and support bars. The objective of this “new tourism experience”, explains DSEDT in a statement, is to attract residents and tourists to the North Zone through “interactivity and fun of thematic bus” and provide new development opportunities to community commercial establishments.
This new project is part of the “Flora Fête With Sanrio Characters” activity, which began by DSEDT and the North Zone of Macau on March 29. According to data released by the organizing entity, until May 15 more than 170,000 visitors had participated in consumption incentive activities and 79% of respondents said they had increased consumption in the North Zone. Among the events dynamized under this activity include dance shows, “meetings” with characters and opportunities to take photographs.</description><pubDate>2025-05-19 05:48:58</pubDate></item><item><title>China expects a fair and lasting peace agreement</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/05/19/china-espera-um-acordo-de-paz-justo-e-duradouro/</link><description>China said he expects a fair and lasting peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine, while Moscow and Kiev prepare to hold their first direct negotiations since 2022 in Istanbul, Turkey.
Ukrainians and Russians are sitting for the first at the negotiation table since the spring of 2022, but the absence of Russian President Vladimir Putin, at the meeting leaves mitigated hopes for any progress towards signing a peace agreement. "We hope that all parties involved will continue the conversations and negotiations to reach a fair, lasting and binding peace agreement, acceptable to all parties, in order to achieve a political solution to the Ukrainian crisis," said China's Ministry of Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jean at a press conference.
Beijing, he added, expects a “political solution” to the “crisis in Ukraine” to be reached soon.
China has repeatedly affirmed that it wants to play a constructive role to achieve peace and stressed that Europe must have a word to say in peace negotiations.
Since the beginning of the war, Beijing has kept an ambiguous position on conflict, appealing to respect for the “territorial integrity of all countries,” including Ukraine, and attention to the “legitimate concerns of all” states, referring to Russia. Thus, he opposed unilateral sanctions against Moscow, although the West has accused China of supporting the Russian military campaign, something he has always denied, and providing Vladimir Putin essential components to produce weapons.
European countries have repeatedly appealed to Chinese leader Xi Jinping to use their influence on their Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, to wage conflict, although some argue that China gave priority to reinforce its relations with Russia, which has imported oil and gas at lower costs. However, spokesman Lin has announced that Deputy Prime Minister Zhang Guoqing will visit Russia from May 19 to 22 for a meeting of the presidents of the Intergovernmental Committee of Cooperation between Northeast China and the Far East in Russia.
Commenting on the visit, Lin recalled that Xi and Putin agreed during the last visit of the Chinese leader to Moscow to "continue his cooperation" and explore ways to promote it "with greater vitality and vigor."</description><pubDate>2025-05-19 05:53:41</pubDate></item><item><title>Ruins from São Paulo will have lightning protection systems and anti-Passar networks</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/05/19/ruinas-de-sao-paulo-vao-ter-sistemas-de-proteccao-contra-raios-e-redes-anti-passaros/</link><description>The installation of lightning protective devices in the ruins of Sao Paulo will finally advance on May 27, almost a year after a radius hit the facade and caused the fall of a stone. The monument's restoration works will also cover the bronze statues, with the installation of a bird protection network near the Virgin Mary figure.
 
The Cultural Institute (IC) and the Directorate of Public Works Services (DSOP) will advance with the installation of lightning protection devices and an anti-presidential network in the ruins of São Paulo, a monument that was reaching a radius almost a year ago, on June 12, 2024. The first phase of restoration and maintenance of the facade's bronze statues will take place between May 27 and late June, that certain exhibition areas will be closed to ensure public safety and make the assembly of bamboo scaffoldes possible.
The presentation of the plan was made at the 2nd Ordinary Plenary Meeting of this year's Cultural Heritage Council, chaired by the President of the IC, Leong Wai Man. In this session, it was detailed that IC and DSOP are already coordinating the restoration of stones and bronze statues on the monument facade and the installation of a lightning protection system, in order to improve the ability to respond to severe or severe meteorological conditions or any natural disasters. The Center for the Preservation and Transmission of the Cultural Heritage of the Macao Palace Museum - a project based within the Macao Art Museum that collaborates with the Beijing Palace Museum - will contribute to the execution of restoration work and the general conservation of the monument with the availability of “scientific equipment” and “specific technologies”, according to a statement released by CI.
In the same press release, it is read that “the Council has agreed with these initiatives and believes that these actions have the potential to further promote the merit of the restoration and safeguard work of the Macao Cultural Heritage, through multiple channels and relying on the continuous deepening of public understanding and sensitization”.
According to the calendar planned by the body, the order of work begins with the assembly and disassembly of bamboo scaffolding and the installation of seals in the adro and the staircase of the ruins of São Paulo, from May 27-30 and on June 17 and 22. These days, the monument - including the virtual reality exhibition area and the Museum of Sacred and Crypt art - will be temporarily ended with the public. In the second phase, from June 18 to 21, seals will be installed in Adro and Ruins Stairs, and all areas of exposure will remain open to the public.
 
Bird Protection Network completed in June
 
In addition to the reinforcement of protective mechanisms for climate phenomena, the IC will also clean and repair the Virgin Maria Bronze statue in the center of the ruins facade. Quoted by the Cheng Pou newspaper, IC president Leong Wai Man, said that the statue has been degraded over time and is currently “seriously eroded” despite regular cleaning actions and the installation of bird dissuade nails.
The statue of the Virgin will be the first to be restored between the end of May and the end of June, following the statue of the second level of the facade. Cleaning work will only end in early 2026, with the cleaning of the statue of the baby Jesus and the white dove that represents the Holy Spirit.
An anti-presidential network will also be installed near the statue of the Virgin Mary, the one that is most deteriorated. Taking as an example other international monuments of historical-cultural work, the IC official explains that the intention is to create a “noninvasive” network, made up of “very thin” grids that do not interfere with the visibility of visitors. The network will be installed experimentally and should be completed at the end of June, when this strategy will be determined to affect the “observation experience” and whether or not it will definitely be installed.

According to the latest report of the World Ranking of Press Freedom of the Reporters Without Borders, in 2025 Timor-Leste ranked 39th between 180 countries, falling 19 positions compared to 2024, when it was in 20th place. In 2023, Timor-Leste ranked 10th.
For Cândido Alves, a journalist for Radio and Television of Timor-Leste (RTTL) and current president of the Press Union Club of Timor-Leste, in the "eyes of the world" the country seems to be a free country with regard to the press, but "there are aspects that still need improvements." "This is why I often say to rulers that improving the performance index of press freedom not only depends on the efforts of journalists, requires cooperation from all sectors, namely economic, social, political and security," said Cândido Alves.
The journalist stressed that it is in the political area that they often face difficulties in, for example, confirming information. "The state's contribution so that journalists have access to difficult sources is also a contribution to press freedom in Timor-Leste. Therefore, we ask rulers not to hide or run away from journalists when they need data. This is important," he explained.
Cândido Alves also lamented the low salaries paid to journalists. Admitting that the profits of the media are low, the journalist said that only the minimum wage of $ 115 (about 102 euros) cannot be paid. "This is extremely difficult and has an impact on the performance of our press freedom rate," he said.
For the veteran journalist of the Suara Timor Loro Sae Micael Malimau newspaper, there are still gaps that need to be improved, although it has been 23 years since the restoration of independence, which are marked on Tuesday. "I think the journalist's role is fundamental. However, reality shows that there are still impediments from the government whenever journalists try to fulfill these functions," said Mikael Malimau.
The journalist gave an example of the detention last year of a journalist for the security forces last year when coverage of eviction in Dili. "From my perspective, freedom of the press is underway, but in practice there are still impediments on the part of the rulers. So I say that although there is freedom of the press, it still faces obstacles," he said.
Already the journalist of the Media National Group (GMN), Oki Ganna, said there is freedom of the press, but is not full. "Freedom of the press is freedom for journalists to cover issues of public interest without being pressured, threatened or attacked," he said, stressing that this also includes access to public data, sources and documents. "Freedom of the press is the freedom to ask questions without being humiliated, but in fact none of this happens in Timor-Leste," he said.
