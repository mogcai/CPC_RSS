After classes, students at Pui Va Secondary School remain in the classroom, distracted to explore a smart condition. These paintings - explains Ruan Zhan Teng, a school teacher at the school - act as interactive projectors and are used as soon as the first year, to write, watch videos or participate in classes with digital media.
"In the third year, students begin to learn to identify artificial intelligence in everyday life, basic programming and photos and videos generated by AI," the computer teacher added to Lusa.
The change took place in 2024 and is stipulated in the law: AI should be included in primary education (with a workload of 17 hours and 20 minutes per year), from 7th to 9th grade (19 hours and 20 minutes) and from 10th to 12th (18 hours and 40 minutes).
Despite the requirement, Andy Chun Wai Fan, professor and director of the University of Macao Information and Communication Center in Education, note that schools face two obstacles: lack of resources and faculty formation. “Some schools have only one information technology teacher,” said Fan, also referring that institutions generally have computer classes only once a week.
Pedro Lobo, a teacher in this area, with 30 years of experience in the territory, including at the Portuguese School of Macau, is concerned about the lack of training. "Most teachers are already a certain age, they have not grown with this new technology ... So the mindset is still short of all this evolution, and change is being so fast that it can hardly follow," explained the Portuguese.
Education authorities require teachers 30 hours of annual IA training, however, wolf considers not sufficient. Although this year has already studied almost 40 hours, the teacher says he is "little prepared".
Regarding this government policy, Andy Chun Wai Fan also remembers that it is required to schools that address ethics, innovation and collaboration in the domain of AI, although it fits the institutions the creation of the manuals themselves. “We do not have a manual about what to teach (…), each school has its own ideas about what to do with its students,” wolf reacted, explaining that he teaches “transferring AI to school work”, either through image generation, small game development, AI ethics approach and copyright issues.
In a different record, the Pui Va Secondary School, which introduced AI in 2021, assumes to be “well prepared” to “the change”. The institution spends about two million patacas (230 thousand euros) a year on AI tools, employs seven information technology teachers (IT) and hired a university professor in Beijing to support. "We want students to be able to use artificial intelligence to identify problems and solve real -life problems," noted the director of the IT Office of Chinese educational establishment, Chong Wai Yin.
Here, students work, for example, with programming languages ​​(Python, Tencent, Iflytek), and AI models such as Deepseek and ChatgPT, engaging in intelligent city projects, in the first cycle, and in the creation of applications, at a later stage, said Zhao Qichao, former professor at the University of Beijing Aeronautics and Astronautics, who teaches in Pui. “In the first cycle, we developed smart cities, automated houses and AI -powered parking systems (…). In the second cycle, students create mobile applications and sustainable technological projects,” he explained.
In April, the Secretary for Social Affairs and Culture, LAM, announced that Macao's educational reforms for 2025 will focus on AI and include plans for an intelligent classroom in all schools.
The Government of Macao attributed to the school network under the direction of the Directorate of Youth Education and Development Services (DSEDJ) 15 million Patacas for AI software for this school year.
In an email sent to Lusa, DSEDJ stated that the government “attributes great importance” to the teaching of information technologies. "The medium and long term plan for non-higher education (2021-2030) identified 'reinforcement of creativity and technological education' as one of the main directions of development," he explains in the note.
However, Pedro Lobo questions the pressure on young students: "Are we seeing children 8, 9, 10 years old to develop applications? Maybe 1% is capable. The rest does the best they can. They have classes and homework that never end."

"The Persian Gulf and its surrounding waters are important channels for international trade in goods and energy," said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun at a press conference in Beijing.
Guo stressed that "maintaining security and stability in the region is in the common interest of the international community" and argued that "efforts to promote conflict distension must be intensified."
The spokesman reacted to the proposal presented on Sunday by the Iranian parliament, following the US attack on nuclear facilities in Iran, so that the Ormuz Strait is closed to maritime traffic-a global impact on the hydrocarbonette trade and has yet to be approved by the Iranian National Security Council.
Guo reiterated that Washington's military operation “exacerbates tensions in the Middle East” and revealed that China, along with Russia and Pakistan, presented to the United Nations Security Council a resolution project that appeals “an immediate and unconditional ceasefire” between Iran, Israel and the United States. "Attacking nuclear facilities under the safeguards of the international atomic energy body is a serious violation of the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and International Law," said the spokesman, asking "all parts" to avoid climbing and defending the return to the "path of political solution."
Guo did not comment directly directly from the statements of the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who urged China to intercede with Iran to avoid the closure of the narrow. "I appeal to the Chinese government in Beijing to contact you, as they are strongly dependent on Ormuz's Strait for Oil Supply," Rubio said in an interview with the American Television Station Fox News.
The eventual closure of the Strait of Ormuz would affect global trade and, in particular, China - Iranian oil importer and Tehran's strategic partner.
The Chinese Embassy in Tehran yesterday indicated that the "vast majority" of Chinese citizens has already been taken from Iran, in view of the aggravation of the conflict with Israel, intensified by Israelite attacks and US bombardments against nuclear facilities.
According to Chinese diplomatic mission advisor Minister Fu Lihua, the embassy coordinated the withdrawal in close collaboration with the Chinese Foreign Ministry and Diplomatic Representations of China in Turkey, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Turquemenistan and Iraq.
The operations were carried out by road from Tehorão and other risky areas to land borders with neighboring countries, such as Azerbaijan and Turquemenistan, the Chinese official news agency Xinhua said on Sunday. At border posts, such as Astara or Bajgiran, support teams were highlighted to facilitate exit procedures and ensure the safety of Chinese citizens, Fu explained.
According to official data, about 4,000 Chinese citizens currently reside in Iran. The Chinese embassy needed the few Chinese citizens who remain in Iran have already been transferred to safer areas.
China also carried out withdrawal operations in Israel, from where about 300 Chinese citizens, mostly students, were transported terrestrial through the borders with Egypt and Jordan, given the risk of aggravation of the conflict with Iran. Beijing installed Chinese citizens who still remain in Israel to register for future operations.
 
China, Russia and Pakistan ask in the UN immediate ceasefire
 
Three members of the UN Security Council, China, Russia and Pakistan, presented a resolution project asking “an immediate and unconditional ceasefire” between Iran, Israel and the United States.
The information was released by the Chinese ambassador to the UN, Fu Cong, to the Security Council, which held an emergency meeting following US attacks that aimed at Iranian nuclear facilities.
The three countries are currently the main allies of Iran on the Council and it is highly unlikely that the resolution will be approved, given the veto power of the United States within the agency. Even so, the resolution-which is not yet scheduled to be voted-uses a diplomatic language because it appeals, besides a ceasefire, the “protection of civilians, respect for international legality and the return to dialogue and negotiation”.
Fu Cong, such as Russian ambassador Vasili Nebenzia, unnecessarily condemned US bombardment of the Iranian nuclear centrals, a position that was not assumed by any of the European countries with a seat on the Council (France, United Kingdom, Denmark, Slovenia and Greece).
Ambassador Vasili Nebenzia was particularly hard in highlighting "cynical statements (from other countries) about their willingness to return to the negotiation table, as if high -caliber bombist attacks against Iran had not occurred." "Hypocritically, they paint Iran as the part that derails the negotiation process," he said.
Israel has been ongoing an offensive against Iran since June 13, which has justified with the progress of the Iranian nuclear program and the threat that the production of ballistic missiles by Tehran represents to the country. Iran has repeatedly denied the development of nuclear weapons and claims the right to perform peaceful nuclear activities.
Telavive's attacks destroyed Iran's nuclear infrastructures and killed high military commands and Iranian scientists working on the nuclear program. Tehor has responded with missile vacancies on major Israeli cities and several military facilities spread across the country.
 
Petroleum prices rise 4% at the opening of Asian markets
 
Petroleum prices rose 4% at the beginning of Monday's Asian Scholarship negotiations, before limiting their climb, for fears of supply disturbances due to war between Iran and Israel. Prices went up after the US attacks that aimed at Iranian nuclear central weekend and the threats of retaliation of Teer will have caused fears. At the beginning of the day, the American WTI oil barrel rose 2.53% to $ 75.71 after exceeding $ 77, while the North Sea Brent oil barrel rose 2.42% to $ 78.87 after exceeding $ 81, its highest level in the last six months.</description><pubDate>2025-06-24 00:52:53</pubDate></item><item><title>Chan hin chi draws the “universe in millimeters” at the Rui Cunha Foundation</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/06/24/chan-hin-chi-desenha-o-universo-em-milimetros-na-fundacao-rui-cunha/</link><description>The Rui Cunha Foundation presents a drawing exhibition tomorrow entitled “The Universe in millimeters”, which brings together 245 pieces signed by Chan Hin Chi. The exhibition is free and will remain patent to the public until July 5.
 
The Rui Cunha Foundation will present tomorrow, at 18:30, a design exhibition entitled “The Universe in Milmeters”, which brings together 245 pieces signed by Chan Hin Chi.
The show brings together works that the artist has completed or outlined from 2017 to 2025, drinking inspiration from the places he visited and landscapes that has glimpsed over the last eight years. The Rui Cunha Foundation detailed in a statement that, of the 245 works on display, 56 are medium -sized designs and 189 small sketches where the artist eternalized details of different cities, as if they were “messages drawn and sent to posteriority”.
Sketches, not exceeding the size of a postcard, propose to “create an infinite and fascinating visual world” in a “limited space” through the domain of lines and colors. The title of the exhibition refers precisely to the ability to create a three-dimensional world from a diminished space, "where one sees the great from the small."
Although the city of Macau is the great protagonist, the pieces on display also include glimpses from other worlds played by the author's trait, such as Japan, Germany, Switzerland, France, Spain, Portugal, the Taiwan region and the Chinese cities of Chengdu, Foshan, Doumen, Harbin and Beijing.
Chan hin Chi, a jurist by profession and scholar of Luso-Chinese languages ​​and cultures, has been dedicated to drawing since retiring from the Board of Directors of TDM-Macao teledifusion. In addition to Mandarin and Cantonese, he also dominates the Portuguese and English languages.
In the preface to the exhibition, quoted by the Rui Cunha Foundation, a link is established between the “delicacy and patience” necessary for the formation in law with the improvement of the art of design, which has been practicing since childhood. “The practice of design and law activities are, respectively, emotional and rational, but inclusive and combinable”, reflects the same note. "The works that are found in this exhibition were, exactly, produced in the loop between them the two activities referred to by the author, apparently mismatched. These drawings have nourished, rejuvenated and purified the heart of the author, allowing him to travel in time and space, to penetrate between past and actuality, flying and sailing in a blue sky and sea."
The exhibition is free and will remain patent to the public until July 5.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Sam Hou Fai seeks to reinforce cooperation with cities of the great bay</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/06/24/sam-hou-fai-procura-reforcar-cooperacao-com-cidades-da-grande-baia/</link><description>The chief executive began a visit to several cities of the Great Bay on Sunday.

The months from January to March usually correspond to the period of higher incidence of flu during the winter, while May to August correspond to the period of highest incidence of flu during the summer.
According to the flu surveillance data in hospitals, from the second half of May, a number of patients similar to flu, especially among adults. The positivity rate of the influenza virus test has increased continuously, from 1.9% in the same period last month to 12.4% last week.
Authorities also say that the positivity rate of covid-19 tests, which reached their peak in mid-March (44.3%), began to descend, however, due to the influence of the epidemic in neighboring regions, the positivity rate in the last four weeks was about 14%, which means the new type of coronavirus is still active in the community.
Lately, cases of collective infection of diseases with flu -like symptoms have been increasing, and seven cases in the same month to ten cases last week, especially in day care centers, kindergartens and primary schools. Five cases caused by influenza A virus, two cases caused by influenza B virus, a case caused by the new type of coronavirus, a case caused by influenza virus and other respiratory viruses and a case was not confirmed the pathogenic agent.

This is the lowest number of May since at least 2020, according to the statistical data on the Institute's page for Municipal Affairs (AMI).
Last month, nine cases of falling water drops from air conditioners, 758 cases of solid waste abandonment, 11 disorders not collected from pets, 191 spitting or launching of nasal mucus, 171 of materials or objects, and 239 cases categorized as “others”.
The 1,379 assessments applied this month, distributed by the six categories mentioned, were the lowest of the year so far. Between January and April 2025, they accounted for 1,739 to 1,381 assessments in the Macao region, following a mostly decreasing trend, except for a slight climb in March.
Compared to last year's homologous period, there is a reduction of about 12.4% in total issues issued. This decrease is related above all to the number of spitting, placement or abandonment of materials and objects and other unmisted cases, which last year had added far higher numbers of 238, 218 and 351 cases, respectively, totaling 1,574 occurrences.
Retracting by 2020, the year to date back to the oldest data of the AMI 'website', there is a total of 1,611 assessments in May. In the same month of the following year, this number rose to 1,809. In turn, 2022 and 2023 registered successive falls to 1,672 and 1,420 cases, respectively.
The total offenses observed in the first five months of this year, from January to April, is thus fixed at 7,626, a number less than the same period of the last five years. Only 2023 accounted for fewer assessments (7,604), 2021 stood out for the opposite reasons (8,967).
According to available statistical data, the most common transgressions in Macao since 2020 have been the abandonment of solid waste, the placement or abandonment of materials and objects in inappropriate places and the occurrence of spit or launch of nasal mucus, highlighting the number of cases filed and filed in the general category of “others”.</description><pubDate>2025-06-24 00:52:51</pubDate></item><item><title>Galaxy is the most awarded macao resort on the t+l luxury awards Asia Pacific 2025</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/06/24/galaxy-e-o-resort-de-macau-mais-premiado-nos-tl-luxury-awards-asia-pacific-2025/</link><description>Galaxy Macau dominated this year's edition of T+L Luxury Awards Asia Pacific, raising top places in the categories of best hotels, hotel spas, hotel swimming pools and macao general directors. The region also stands out on the list of the best integrated resorts in the entire Pacific Asia region, where it was placed in three of the ten winning positions.
 
Galaxy Macau hotels were the most awarded in this year's edition of T+L Luxury Awards Asia Pacific, published annually by Travel+Leisure (T+L) magazine. In addition to the four categories for Macao, the Galaxy was also considered the second best integrated resort in the Asia-Picific region in 2025.
Following a selection process conducted by a team of T+L editors and employees, the nominees were submitted to the public vote for two months from February to April. As the magazine explains in its 'website', the types of categories associated with each country or region vary according to "the different dimensions and strengths of industries in different locations." In Macao, the categories contemplated were “best hotels”, “best hotel spas”, “best hotel pools” and “best general directors”.
Among the thirty hotels considered for the first category, the audience vote highlighted ten: Galaxy Hotel, The Londoner Macao, W Macau - Studio City, Banyan Tree Macau, The St. Regis Macao, Wynn Palace, Four Seasons Hotel Macao Cotai Strip, Mandarin Eastern Macau, The Parisian and Andaz Macau. The Londoner Macao, which headed last year's list, was thus dethroned by Galaxy, which in 2024 had been 4th.

Like last year, the Galaxy Macau Grand Resort Deck again leads the top 10 of the best hotel pools in the territory. “From 'geysers' and waterfalls to waterfalls and a serene white sand beach, this world of aquatic adventures has everything,” praises T+s, in the usual commentary dedicated to the first places of each category. In the following positions are the Banyan Tree Macau, The St. Regis Macao, Altira Macau, Nüwa Macau, Studio City Hotel, Artyzen Grand Lapa Macau, Grand Hyatt Macau, Morpheus and Raffles at Galaxy Macao.
Going to the fourth and final category, regarding the best general directors, the highlight goes to Joanne Chan of Banyan Group, who made history by being the first hotel born in Macao driving one of the city's five-star hotels. In the remaining four places on the list are Stuart Wayne Douglas, from The St. Regis Macao, Adrian Chan, from W Macau, Gonçalo Monteiro, from The Londoner + Conrad Macao, and Franck Droin, from Mandarin East Macau.
Outside the specific categories to Macao, the region is mentioned again in a general category of “Best Integrated Resorts in Asia Pacific in 2025”, in which Galaxy Macao arises in second place, only surpassed by Marina Bay Sands de Singapore.

The current deputy elected for direct suffrage admits to being facing a “severe challenge” in the elections this year, namely for a team without the context of traditional organizations and resources.
 
The power of synergy formalized the candidacy for legislative elections and presented yesterday the list of six candidates led by current deputy Ron Lam. The legislator admitted that the team is facing “severe challenges” since the population of Macao has shown an attitude of indifference to elections.
Ron Lam pointed to the fact that the number of lists in direct suffrage is the lowest in the history of masters and said he was feeling indifferent to elections, which "is also a reflection of [citizens] disappointment about society," he noted. In this year's legislatures, the Commission of Electoral Affairs of the Legislative Assembly (Caeal) validated eight lists for direct suffrage, which represents a descent to almost half of the number recorded in 2021.
To journalists, Ron Lam also warned of the group's lack of resources. According to the deputy, the electoral expenses of the power of the synergy were the lowest among all list elected in 2021, and the expenses of the list that spent the most were ten times higher. Caeal information shows that Lam's list has spent 247,000 Patacas in the election campaign four years ago, while the list that spent the most used 2.6 million patacas.
"It is challenging for us, that we do not have the context of [large] organizations or resources. With incomparable resources and electoral indifference, our list suffers a greater negative impact, which makes us very concerned," he said.
Ron Lam, in this sense, appealed to the vote of residents to "bring different voices to Parliament and allow the government to listen to public opinion and respond to the real and accurate needs of residents." "If voters are apathetic and not vote, the list may not even be able to keep a place," he warned.
The candidate said he hopes to continue serving society and give residents "a voice" in the Legislative Assembly, even though he recognizes that "the [team] force is small" and not all requests to the government can be answered.
The group applied for the 2017 elections, but without success in access to Hemiciclo, having returned to the cargo in 2021 and obtained 8,764 votes, allowing an deputy to elect. This year's list has the participation, as number two, by Johnson Ian, columnist, former table tennis athlete and president of the Macao Synergy Association, as well as the Joe Chan Environmental Protection Activist, with the number five in the list.
According to Ron Lam, its political program focuses on employment, economy and population welfare issues, including installing the government to reduce the number of non-resident workers of large companies, especially concessionaires. In addition, it intends to ask the executive to provide more support for small and medium -sized companies and the employment market. "We will also require the executive's governance to be open and transparent, including the opening and transparency of public finances and the need for open consultation on policies, to ensure the effectiveness of policies and that they can respond to the real needs of the community," he said.
Ron Lam's team also hopes that passenger transport services will be introduced into the territory online, as well as adjust the so -called ecological island plan, ensure press freedom and animal protection, among others.</description><pubDate>2025-06-24 00:54:54</pubDate></item><item><title>Portuguese are of the most concerned with the use of nuclear weapons and the Third World War</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/06/24/portugueses-sao-dos-mais-preocupados-com-uso-de-armas-nucleares-e-terceira-guerra-mundial/</link><description>The Portuguese respondents were those who demonstrated, in an opinion study conducted in 12 European countries, to have more fear of the use of nuclear weapons, a possible third world war and a European war beyond Ukraine.
 
"Most Europeans are waking up to the reality that they live in a very different world. Although the fear of a Russian attack on the NATO territory is less widespread than some analysts suggest - although it is felt with intensity in certain border states, such as Poland, Estonia and Romania, as well as in Portugal - it is the growing fear of a nuclear conflict that captures the new European anxiety," the counsel more clearly captures the council. European External Relations (ECFR, in the English acronym) in a published study.
One day before the start of the two -day summit of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) marked by strong geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and Ukraine and the need to increase defense investment, ECFR discloses an opinion study that covers 12 countries (Portugal, Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Romania, Spain, Swiss and Kingdom United) and 16,440 respondents over 18 years old.
Asked if they would be concerned about potential events, Portuguese respondents indicated greater concern regarding the use of nuclear weapons (85%), a third World War (82%) and an even larger war on European soil besides Ukraine (77%). It was the highest percentages among the countries heard.
In the opposite sense, the Portuguese questioned were less concerned about a possible Russian invasion of the country (54%) and the breakdown of the European Union (EU) or NATO (65%and 66%, respectively).
The Portuguese respondents (which were 1,010, heard between May 16 and 28) also said they were more restless than the state invests too much in defense and discovers other policies than not to invest enough and this handle the country's safety.
When US President Donald Trump, most of those questioned in Portugal (54%) they believe that the republished affected the relationship between Europe and the United States, but such a connection will improve when he leaves.
The 12 countries selected by ECFR for this opinion study are based on criteria such as geographical balance and dimension.
NATO allies gather on Tuesday and Wednesday in summit in the Dutch city of The Hague under the urgency of spending more in defense, hoping that there is no war, but preparing for the worst.
This meeting of NATO leaders and ministers will serve to discuss world events and their impact on Euro-atlantic security, with allies to prepare for war without expecting it to really happen.
There is a goal of reaching 3.5% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) with traditional military spending (Armed Forces, Equipment and Training) and 1.5% of the additional GDP in double-use infrastructures, civil and military (as related to cybersecurity, readiness and strategic resilience), an increase compared to the current goal of 2%.
In Portugal, the government announced that it would anticipate the goal of 2% of GDP in defense to 2025.
Last Wednesday, Mark Rutte greeted this Portuguese ad, stating that this is “great news”, which arrived even before the summit's start.
In 2024, Portugal invested about 4,480 million euros in defense, approximately 1.58% of its GDP, which placed the country among NATO allies with the lowest military expense -below the target of 2% -according to the government and the organization estimates.
Portugal will be represented at the Hague summit by the Prime Minister, Luís Montenegro, and by the Ministers of Foreign and Defense, Paulo Rangel and Nuno Melo.

About 14.2 million barrels per day of gross oil and 5.9 million barrels per day of other oil products, or about 20% of world production, passed the strategic corridor of the Strait of Ormuz, off the first quarter, according to the United States Energy Information Agency (EIA).
It is the practically unique route of export of the Saudi Arabia raw, the United Arab Emirates, Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar and Iran.
Here are the main Asian countries to which this oil is intended:
 
China
 
Experts estimate that more than half of oil imported by East Asia passes through the narrow. This is the case of China: according to EIA, in the first quarter imported 5.4 million barrels per day of gross oil through Ormez. Saudi Arabia was its second largest supplier of 'black gold' last year, with 1.6 million barrels a day, ie 15% of the total of its imports, according to EIA. Iran himself became an important source of hydrocarbons: in April, he exported 1.3 million barrels a day to China. Most are bought by small Chinese refineries (known as teapots) that operate independently of state oil companies - a way to avoid US sanctions. China absorbs over 90% of Iran's oil exports.
 
India
 
India imported 2.1 million barrels per day of Crude through the narrow in the first quarter, according to EIA. India is strongly dependent on the narrow, with the Middle East to provide about 53% of its oil imports in early 2025, according to the local financial press, namely Iraq and Saudi Arabia. This is sufficient to leave a new nervous deli in the face of tensions climbing, although the country has increased its purchases of Russian hydrocarbons in the last three years. "We will take all the necessary measures to ensure stable fuel supply to our citizens," Indian oil minister, Hardeep Singh Puro, "has been diversified our supplies in recent years ... Our distributors have reservation for several weeks and continue to be fueled through various channels," he said, without further details.
 
South Korea
 
According to data from the country's oil industry, about 68% of South Korea's gross oil imports go through the Ormuz Strait - a volume of 1.7 million barrels a day, according to EIA. The country is particularly dependent on Saudi Arabia, which last year was responsible for one third of its oil imports, becoming the main supplier of the country. "To date, no disturbances were recorded in imports of gross oil and liquefied natural gas from South Korea, but a supply crisis may arise due to the evolution of the situation," acknowledges the South Korean Ministry of Energy in a statement. "The government and industry interveners prepared for emergency situations, maintaining a strategic oil reserve equivalent to about 200 days of supply and sufficient gnl reserves," he insisted.
 
Japan
 
Japan imports 1.6 million barrels a day of gross oil through the Ormez Strait, according to EIA. And, according to Japanese customs data, 95% of gross oil imported by the archipelago last year came from the Middle East.
The country's power transportation companies began to adapt: ​​"We are currently taking steps to reduce the time of our ships in the Gulf," Mitsui Osk told AFP.
 
Other countries
 
The rest of Asia (two million barrels a day), namely Thailand and the Philippines, but also Europe (0.5 million) and the United States (0.4 million) were other destinations of gross oil that passed the Strait of Ormuz in the first quarter.
 
Limited alternatives
 
Asian countries could try to diversify their sources of supply - namely reinforcing their purchases of American hydrocarbons - but it would be impossible to replace large volumes from the Middle East.
In the short term, “the high oil reserves of oil, OPEC reserve capacity [Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries] and the production of schist gas in the United States may provide some protection,” they consider MUFG experts cited by AFP.
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have infrastructures that allow them to get around the Strait of Ormuz, which could some disturbance, but their traffic capacity, estimated by EIA by about 2.6 million barrels a day, remains very limited. And the Goreh-Assk Pipeline, created by Iran to export through Oman's Gulf, which has been inactive since last year, has only a maximum capacity of 300,000 barrels per day, also according to EIA.

According to the statement of the Asian country's search and rescue team, the operation is “extreme and challenging” and help to the young woman, whose condition is unknown, continues. The Rinjani volcano is about 3,700 meters high.
The young woman fell into an area near a lake while trying to reach the top of the volcano, about 1,200 kilometers from Jakarta, along with 12 other people.
In the search operation, which was suspended at least once due to bad weather and terrain difficulties, dozens of staff participate, who work with the help of drones for air monitoring, communication devices and medical equipment, among other tools. “The rescue team went down to a depth of 200 meters, but had to go back to the storm,” reads the statement, which does not provide data on the current state of the Brazilian, which fell to an estimated depth between 150 and 200 meters.
In turn, Brazil's Foreign Ministry issued a statement on Sunday that ensured that its Jakarta Embassy "mobilized local authorities at the highest level" for this operation in a "remote region, approximately four hours from the nearest urban center."
In addition, he indicated that two embassy employees would travel to the scene to personally supervise the rescue work.
Rinjani is an active volcano and the second tallest in Indonesia, which attracts numerous international tourists every year. Has not erupted since 2016.</description><pubDate>2025-06-24 00:52:53</pubDate></item><item><title>Macao City Day and the Dutch defeat</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/06/24/o-dia-da-cidade-de-macau-e-a-derrota-dos-holandeses/</link><description>With so many dates on the calendar, why is the city day of Macao on June 24?
In 1622, Macao was then an important commercial warehouse between mainland China, Japan and the rest of the world, and the Dutch, which were in full maritime and commercial expansion, decided to invade the territory on June 24. They were defeated in the one that became known as the Battle of Macao and became a milestone in history, also for being the only time when Portuguese, Chinese and Macanese came together to fight the ordinary enemy. “It was the biggest attack” of those people to the Chinese city, says former professor at the University of Macau, Jorge Cavalheiro, to the end.
They entered the northeast zone of the territory, next to the water reservoir, and reached the area where today is the Jardim da Vitória. “They were overcome with the help of Mount Fortress,” explains the historian, adding: “It was not even completed, it was only in 1626,” he recalls, explaining that it was the Jesuits who lived there who helped. “The military, with the help of the Jesuits, managed to defeat the Dutch,” he says.
 
Portuguese and Spanish were enemies of the Dutch
The Dutch were historical enemies of the Spanish, especially due to the eighty -year war, and when Portugal was under Filipino dominion between 1580 and 1640, this rivalry was particularly evident. But not only. "In a way, in terms of commercial and sea competition, the Dutch were also rivals of the Portuguese," he says. “The Dutch occupied the Portuguese territories of Brazil, in that northern part of Brazil, occupied parts of Angola and, in the Far East, occupied a part of the islands we had in Indonesia and conquered Malaca, as early as 1641,” says Jorge Cavalheiro.
They were therefore a "threat" to the Portuguese overseas territories. "When they are beaten or defeated in Macau, it is obvious that this was important in the context of the time, so that the Dutch went to take our place in Japan," he says. “When the Portuguese are expelled from Japan in 1639, they are the Dutch who take our place,” he says. It is recalled that the Tokugawa Xogunate, which took power in the early seventeenth century, feared the growing influence of Christianity and the Dutch were on the fringes of religion. “They were only interested in commerce and the Portuguese did not, since, beyond trade, they tried to do the miscegenation,” he says.
 
A common threat and city day
 
When, on June 24, 1622, the Dutch tried to invade Macau, they were confronted with the opposition of all. “The Chinese always interested the presence of the Portuguese in Macau, because it was the intermediaries - it was the Portuguese who went to the Canton Fair and they were the ones who bought the Chinese products and sold them in Japan, India and Europe,” recalls Jorge Cavalheiro. In fact, the historian adds, it is necessary to remember the importance of China's silk for the Japanese and the silver of Japan to trade in China. "A foreign threat to the territory would harm the Portuguese, but also the Chinese and the macanese, who were linked, in a way, to some trade," he explains.
Marking the date makes sense, even if it is not a national holiday. "If Macau had been invaded at that time, he would clearly change commercial circuits and life in the city," he says.
It is recalled that the date on which it is marked this ephemeris is also the day of St. John the Baptist, the patron saint of the territory. “The miracle of St. John the defeat over the Dutch was attributed to a miracle and this reveals the importance of staying there the city,” he says.
It was at the time of a city, which was contained inside the wall, without the field, Macau was also an important point of trade. “The Dutch were the great enemies of the Portuguese and Portuguese commerce. This defeat over the Dutch was very important and, therefore, was the day of the city,” he says.</description><pubDate /></item></channel></rss>
