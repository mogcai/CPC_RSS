Andy Wu, in statements to the newspaper or Mun, said he believed that vacation reserves for Japan will gradually recover from next month, when travel prices to Japan will rise again.

Andy Wu also said that the global price for travel to China remains stable compared to previous years, with the average price of the Xinjiang route to exceed 10,000 Renminbis and the Mongolia Route to round between 3,000 and four thousand Renminbis.</description><pubDate>2025-07-08 04:27:31</pubDate></item><item><title>Fifteen Filipino Police detained for disappearing rooster gamblers</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/07/08/quinze-policias-filipinos-detidos-por-desaparecimento-de-apostadores-de-lutas-de-galos/</link><description>Fifteen police have been arrested and are being investigated for their alleged responsibility in the kidnapped and possible murders of at least 34 people involved in rooster fights, the Philippine police chief announced yesterday. The missing people were accused of glowing in those competitions - extremely popular in the country - and, according to a testimony, their bodies were thrown into a volcano lake with police complicity. The victims disappeared in 2021 and 2022, when they were on their way or to return from roar fighting arenas scattered throughout the main region of Luzon, in northern Philippines, including in the metropolitan area of ​​the capital Manila.

The head of the National Police, General Nicolas Torre III, said at a press conference last week that a key witness, under the pseudonym Totoy, provided crucial details. According to the witness, the affections and workers of the rooster struggles were strangled and mutilated before being thrown into the lake. Police investigators corroborated the details and evidence provided by the witness, which will be used in criminal complaints to present by the Justice Department against the suspects, he said. The witness told local TV stations that he decided to speak out because his former standard would be allegedly threatening to kill him. According to it, I wanted to help relieve the agony of the families of the victims, who demanded justice for their missing family members. "I was very shocked," Torre admitted, adding that the witness's allegations - which is under police protection - "strengthened the determination of really solving this, because what happened was wild and unacceptable."
Criminal complaints will be presented against the influential businessman, owner of rooster fights and other game businesses, but also against other suspects, said Secretary of Justice, Jesus Crispin Reulla. The businessman denied the accusations. Remulla said she would ask Japan to help provide technology to help traces the remains of the victims, who could still be recovered from the bottom of Lake Taal, although about four years have passed.</description><pubDate>2025-07-08 04:32:31</pubDate></item><item><title>Optorenses optimists with future, but concerned with low income</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/07/08/timorenses-optimistas-com-futuro-mas-preocupados-com-baixos-rendimentos/</link><description>Most Timorese are optimistic with the future of Timor-Leste, but is still concerned about low income, lack of infrastructure and job shortage, an inquiry was completed by Asia Foundation.
 
The “Tatoli Inquiry”, which in this edition interviewed 1,503 Timorese from all municipalities in the country, has been held since 2013 and aims to collect the opinions of the population to produce relevant data for public policies. "The inquiry has concluded that, although 69% of the Timorenses consider that the country are following in the right direction, respondents are still concerned about essential services and economic opportunities," says the investigation, released last week.
Timorese, according to the document, identify low income (53%), lack of infrastructure (36%) and the scarcity of quality jobs (27%) as the three largest problems at national level.
Regarding the individual economic situation, only 53% considered that their household is in a 'good' or 'very good' situation, the lowest value since the issue was introduced in the inquiry in 2016. “The inquiry also recorded less satisfaction with various aspects of health and education services, particularly among those residents in Dili. Public services are increasing, ”says the document.
Regarding government priorities, 69%of respondents indicated health, followed by education and training (59%) and roads (58%). “These priorities coincide with those of 2023 and 2022, although order has changed, 2025 being the first year in which health emerges as an absolute priority,” can be read in the report.
The inquiry has shown that people residing in urban media give more priority to health, education and training, while rural residents identify roads, water and electricity as more urgent. The poor quality of education is the second largest concern among urban residents (39%), young people between 18 and 34 years old (28%) and people with some formal education (20%).
The perception of health services is generally positive, with 78% to say that when they needed they had available doctors and nurses, 82% to admit that the family is treated with respect in local health centers and 58% to consider that when they needed, there were drugs available in health centers. "Interestingly, residents in rural areas have more positive perceptions in all aspects of health services than urban residents.

These changes will have to do with “the requirements of social development and the progress of the construction of road and carril transport networks”, said the Secretary for Transport and Public Works at yesterday's plenary meeting (AL), detailing that, in the review of contracts, the government will consider the organization of the organization as the factors as the organization of the factors as the organization of the factors personnel and career distribution, for example.
It is recalled that the concessionaire companies of the bus service are Transmac and TCM. Concession contracts were signed in 2021 and end at the end of 2026.
Ella Lei, in his oral interpellation, said that, “due to the continuous increase in the number of passengers of buses, the working pressure of the front line of bus services, especially drivers and stops, is increasing,” so “authorities should reinforce the support and protection of the work and work of the work of drivers and workers, and improve the work environment, to increase safety, to raise security in safety, to increase safety in safety, to increase safety in safety, to increase safety in safety in safety conduct, quality of services and ability to respond to unforeseen situations ”.

The leader of the Macau Economic Association notes that many tourists go to the neighborhoods just to take photos with the facilities, without contributing to consumption. Lau Pun Lap also says that the government lacks “well thought out plans” to the areas affected by the closure of the satellite casinos.
 
Lau Pun Lap, president of the Macao Economic Association, criticized the limited economic effect regarding the placement of intellectual property facilities (IP) in community neighborhoods. The economist admitted that government initiatives in the matter of “IP economy” are a “very good idea”, but failed to boost the community's economy.
"Due to the small scale [of the projects], visitors tend to move to these community neighborhoods to just take photographs, and then leave and consume nothing," said the former coordinator of the former Policy Study Office, a service whose name was now changed to the direction of regional policy and development study services.
"The flow of visitors in Rua do Cunha is already prosperous and, therefore, IP initiatives can have some effect, while in other areas, such as the Green Island or the surroundings of Luís de Camões Garden, the effect is a little far from satisfactory," he added.
Speaking to the Cheng Pou newspaper, Lau Pun Lap pointed out that, during the implementation of promotional activities, the government did not ponde how to reinforce cooperation with traders and community organizations to maximize effectiveness in economic promotion.
"The authorities should open cooperation with stores in IP projects, namely through the granting of law, so that, for example, coffee shops can make cakes or coffee or stores sell products with images of IP," he said.
It is recalled that the government began last year to carry out different projects to place large IP dolls in non-tourist zones to promote tourism and the community economy.
This year, two large -scale projects were launched on international IP, including the activity “Flora Fête With Sanrio Characters”, the Directorate of Economics and Technological Development Services (DSEDT), North Zone and Ilha Verde neighborhood; The “Pop Mart Macao Citywalk” project of the Directorate of Tourism Services on the sidewalk of São Lázaro Church, Luís de Camões Square, Largo de Santo Agostinho and the leisure zone of Rua do Pai Kok da Taipa. Both projects comprise activities such as photo sharing on social networks and consumer raffles after purchases in certain stores.
DSEDT had revealed the desire to repeat the introduction of the IP project in Nape and Zape zones, from mid-November until next year, to “attract a flow of people and improve the business environment” in response to the closing of satellites in the short future.
Still on the end of satellite casinos, Lau Pun Lap acknowledged that there will be an impact on the economy and that the government has a lack of “well thought out” and “effective” plans and measures to deal with the situation. "I noticed that the government has planned some contracted, but the conception of outdoor or terrace markets is not well thought out, the effect may not necessarily be good if they do not do a good job. Initiatives must be more vigorous and not so simplistic," he said.
Lau Pun Lap considers it important to bring tourists to consume in community neighborhoods in order to boost trade, also referring that, so far, "not all six ancient zone revitalization projects have achieved the expected results."
On the other hand, Lau Pun Lap maintains confidence in improving the local economy in the second half of this year, however, stressed that Macao's biggest problem is the imbalance in its development. In the economist's opinion, the community's economy will continue to be affected by the trend of consumption inside China by Macao residents, along with the fact that the standard of consumption and the structure of tourists are different from those of the past, especially with the decrease in consumption capacity.</description><pubDate>2025-07-08 04:28:31</pubDate></item><item><title>Resident deposits increased, but loans decreased</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/07/08/depositos-dos-residentes-aumentaram-mas-emprestimos-diminuiram/</link><description>The monetary mass grew again in May, according to statistics published yesterday by the Monetary Authority of Macao (AMCM).

The cooperation agreement for the deposition of inert materials in the maritime areas of the interior of China does not take the government of the idea of ​​building a landfill south of Colaane that aims to receive construction waste. At yesterday's plenary meeting of the Legislative Assembly (AL), Raymond Tam reiterated the intention of the executive.
By the way of an oral interpellation of Lam Lon Wai about the development of the maritime areas of Macao, Ron Lam and Lo Choi in took the opportunity to ask the secretary whether the signing of the agreement between the sons and the interior authorities of China could not dispense with the construction of the ecological island.
Not responding directly to the questions of the deputies, the secretary for transport and public works stressed that “Macau is a small and small territory and, in this assumption, solutions from other parts of the world may not apply” to the territory. In addition, "at the regional level there are limitations regarding the treatment of materials and of course certain materials, by law, the interior of China does not accept."
The former director of Environmental Protection Services (DSPA) also recalled that in 2016, when he arrived at the body, the landfill landfill that exists in Macau was already saturated.
More than a year ago, the government has proposed the construction of this ecological island. This project consists of the creation of landfill in the maritime zone about a kilometer of the coast, between Hac Sá and Cheoc Van, which will serve to deposition construction waste, garbage incineration ash, solidified fly ash and construction residues.

The government is already studying the viability and layout of the light metro line that is expected to cross the Macau Peninsula, advanced Raymond Tam. The secretary for transport and public works detailed that this new line will go from the artificial island of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge to Barra, passing through the new landfills, Nam Van and Sai Van. After the preliminary study, the government is expected to launch a public consultation on the project.
At yesterday's plenary meeting, Raymond Tam listened to deputies' complaints about traffic problems in the city, then adding that the goal is that there is a circular network in the peninsula.
The secretary also indicated that the works of the western line of Metro Ligeiro, which should go from Barra to the doors of the siege, passing through the inner port and Fai Chi Kei, for example, will have less impact on traffic and life of the population, as part of the work will be underground. At the same time, the government intends to hire a specialized entity to provide study services on the western line layout, to assess the possibility of integration with flood prevention works.
Already the east line of the light Metro, which runs from the airport and the maritime terminal of the Taipa to the doors of the siege, passing through zone A of the new landfills, should be ready in 2028 and could go into operation in 2029, reaffirmed Raymond Tam.
The secretary admitted that investment in the light meter has been elevated at the same time as "benefits are not yet evident." However, when the circular line on the peninsula is finished, "the traffic pressure will be relieved."
The news about the light meter were revealed by the secretary after the oral interpeairs of Ella Lei and Leong Hong Sai, who asked for traffic reordering measures in the interior port.

"Global optimization of the inner port is a long -term process. The Government of MSAR will continue to improve the general spatial disposition of the area, based on the framework of the MSAR Director Plan and considering the current situation and development needs," said TAM in his response, adding that "they will be considered, in an integrated manner, factors such as traffic, disaster protection and public spaces, with a view to reinforce vitality and resilience of the area ”.</description><pubDate>2025-07-08 04:30:56</pubDate></item><item><title>Volcano in Indonesia Expile ash column over 18 kilometers high</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/07/08/vulcao-na-indonesia-expele-coluna-de-cinzas-com-mais-de-18-quilometros-de-altura/</link><description>The Lewotobi Laki-Laki volcano in eastern Indonesia yesterday expelled a column of ashes over 18 kilometers, weeks after an eruption that led to the cancellation of flights to Bali.

Nominal wages increased by 1% over the previous year, limited by smaller bonuses, and rose to a much slower pace than expected by economists.
 
The real wages of Japanese workers have registered the largest descent since September 2023, with inflation surpassing wages, a problem for the government, which faces elections within two weeks.
Real salaries decreased by 2.9% over the previous year in May, far above the consensus of economists, which provided for a 1.7% drop, Japan's Ministry of Labor said yesterday.
Nominal wages increased by 1% over the previous year, limited by smaller bonuses, and rose to a much slower pace than expected by economists.
The strength of the underlying wage trends has powered the Banco do Japan precautions (Boj) in relation to any rulings of interest rates. But the fall in real wages represents a headache for the minority coalition in power, before the July 20 elections, which will elect 124 of the 248 members of the Parliament High Chamber for a six -year term.
The frustration of the Japanese electorate has been increasing, pressuring political leaders to present more convincing strategies to relieve pressure on the cost of living.
Japan's main inflation rate was 3.7% in May, far above the BOJ 2% goal, driven by widespread increases in all essential goods, from diet to service rates.
Prime Minister Shigeru's Democratic Liberal Party Ishiba has promised a monetary help of 20,000 adults (118 euros) along with additional initiatives to stimulate wage growth.
Still, recent opinion polls suggest that this punctual increase is not popular with voters, many of whom are leaning on the proposal of the constitutional democratic party, the main formation of the opposition, to reduce VAT.
Regarding monetary policy, current raises of nominal wages may give boj margin of maneuver for new rates.
The Central Bank is evaluating the next past, in a context of uncertainty in tariff negotiations with the United States.
Yesterday's report showed that the base salary increased by 2.1%, but a more stable subscriber, which avoids sampling problems and excludes bonuses and overtime, revealed that full-time workers' salaries rose 2.4%, remaining 2%or above them for almost two years.
Boj's next decision is scheduled for July 31, with markets to expect the Central Bank to maintain the reference rate at 0.5%.

With each step, the walls show new screens filled with meaningful scribbles - some dating back to abstract expressionism, with their traces and poignant colors, while in others they overlap paper cutouts in innovative collages. It could be a museum of modern art, but there is a peculiarity that differentiates these works: artists are between one and three years old.
Each of the six nursery classes was invited to be inspired by a specific artist, popularized by certain artistic idiosyncrasies, and to create similar work. Similar but not equal: more than honoring the great painters of the twentieth century, the purpose of the exposure is to exercise children's creativity and allow them to express themselves freely, without notion of "right" or "wrong."
"We chose the most appropriate artist for age," explains director Nair Cardoso, while conducting the end point by the (right) exhibition entitled "Little Artists, Big Inspirations." The “Jasmine” and “Iris” classes, composed of students up to two years old, were attributed Yayoi Kusama and Wassily Kandinsky, respectively, for their work centered on geometric shapes - no less imaginative but easier to refer.
The level of demand (and also creativity) rises with the four classes of older students, aged between the two and the years. The “Lotus” class was in charge of studying the abstract forms of Pablo Picasso; The Blossom class experienced the irreverence of Jackson Pollock's action painting; The "Rose" discovered Henri Matisse's dynamic collages. Lavender may have been the class that won the most coveted theme: the figure of Frida Kahlo, dominated by images of flowers, nature… and, of course, the iconic monochte.
“They only talked about the monochla, the lipstick, the wreath…”, smiled Sandra Monteiro, the head of the day care center. It does not mean, however, that all students portrayed the Mexican painter equally-the same reference image branched into possible multiple interpretations, all equally valid. For some students, the color predominated: the center of the screen was dominated by a huge red spot, inspired by the wreath and the loaded lipstick. Others preferred to draw the sketch of a face with an intense line in the background zone, so intense that surrounding the whole face. “Although everyone is from the same class, we can also see the differences in the development of the fine motricity of each child,” notes the educators.
Near the daycare entrance, as a kind of business card, a collective board was placed where all the students participated. At first impression, the work may seem like a visual cacophony of blemishes and smudges, but it gains meaning when it considered its purpose: the freedom and creative expression of the nursery were gathered there in the form of ink, without filtering or restrictions. It is a single work to which hundreds of different students contributed, endowed with their own identity and artistic vision.
"If it's a blur, which is a blur; if they want to use only one color, they use only this color. That's what it is. They can be scribbles, but it's their scribbles. And how we can introduce the scribbles more artistically, ask?" Exactly the same way as museums do: "Just put a frame and we give due value to the work."
 
Its own philosophy
 
The art exhibition is a concentrated microcosm of what happens in the inner space. “The day care center is not very large, but it is well enjoyed,” says Nair Cardoso and Sandra Monteiro, conducting the end point through the space corridors and presenting each of the rooms-except those where, at noon on Thursday, children slept the nap under the supervision of teachers.
“All the corners are enjoyed. From this corridor, for example, we made a display of children's works,” they indicate, signaling a small exposure about the importance of bees in the ecosystem, dominated by a card made of card. “Here, we were able to transform a studio what for a while was just a passing zone”-point to a room full of toys and creative possibilities, where even the walls are decorated with CD-Roms and used coffee capsules. The materials are so many and so diverse that it only becomes noticeable the absence of plastic and screens when the educators themselves enhance it.
“We have no screen time,” clarifies Nair Cardoso, lamenting that even pediatric services choose to include screens, flashy colors and, in a word, “excessive stimuli” on their facilities. "Current cartoon are very fast, with several images at each second fraction, and overload the children's brain. It's terrible for its development. In fact, pediatricians recommend the cartoon that we have seen in the old days…".
In addition to environmental concern, the decision to avoid toys and plastic materials also follows the same logic of providing fun that properly stimulate the child's brain. "Plastic makes annoying sounds and always provides the same sensation. The temperature is always the same, the smell is identical ... Here, in the nursery, we want to play with diverse materials." From felt to wood, "we have different smells, different textures, different temperatures."
Concern with sensory stimuli aligns with Reggio Emilia's philosophy, on which the entire pedagogical strategy of the São José International Nursery is based. The basic principles of this approach are explicit outside the day care center, in which it is clear that the central figure of teaching is the child herself and her holistic development. According to this perspective, socialization, creative expression and critical thinking occupy as - or more - important in the brain development of tender children as the acquisition of curriculum items.
This daycare concept of the daycare accumulates the guidelines stipulated by the Institute of Social Action (IAS) and the Diocese of Macao are accumulated. "With these three influences, we ended up making a philosophy of ours alone." Religion is present throughout the establishment, though non-imposing-while abounding the posters that mention God and the Catholic values ​​of “faith” and “kindness”, the prayer room is restricted to teachers and staff. “I think that, as educators, we should not impose religion, but to influence parents to implement it at home if they want,” justifies Sandra Monteiro. "Our function here is to give children correct values ​​- which, deep down, is the root of religion."
IAS imposes nine monthly activities, each subordinate to a specific theme. The last theme worked was the basic geometric shapes, such as circles, square and triangles - or even more unusual forms such as hearts or stars. The lesson was learned, but with the characteristic touch of the day care. Instead of monotonous explanations or 'puzzles' that could raise feelings of frustration, children were familiar with matter through clippings and collages that were then proudly boasting in a thematic exhibition.
"Although we do not use very traditional methods to teach, we incorporate the matter into artwork in a more holistic way. It is playing that children learn, especially up to three years old." Teaching linguistic skills follows the same reasoning. In parallel to classes specifically intended for Portuguese, English and Chinese, children are in constant contact with the three languages ​​that prevail on the streets of Macao. "The lady who exchanges the diapers speaks Chinese, the assistant speaks English, the teacher speaks Portuguese ... Each communicates in his language, as is happening there. It is as if we were a large multicultural family. As a result, children develop their abilities in each of these languages, without even realizing it."
The type of education implemented in the São José International Nursery, although increasingly publicized around the world, still finds some resistance in Macao. “Perhaps it is for lack of knowledge,” Nair Cardoso intervenes, noting that alternative teaching methods are “little disclosed” in the region or, associated with “total permissiveness”. This is not the case, it guarantees: "It is not because we are this approach that we are sloppy, so to say, or that we leave the child without routines."
Still, new generations of parents are gradually revolutionizing the traditional molds of teaching in Macau. "We have very young parents, turned to creativity and increasingly informed. We note that there is a desire to do more and better than our parents could do."</description><pubDate /></item></channel></rss>
