"The agreement for the removal of Lai Chee-Ying of the association with other PIC [acronym in English for people in custody] was made at its own request," said authorities from the Chinese semi-autonomous region.
In a statement issued on Monday night, the Hong Kong government did not disclose the reasons presented to support Jimmy Lai's defense request, which was not allowed to choose his defense lawyers. But the authorities recalled that "the legal representative" of the entrepreneur "also publicly clarified that he is receiving proper treatment and care in prison."
An Irish lawyer who represents Jimmy Lai, Caoilfhionn Gallagher, however, told the Canadian newspaper “The Globe and Mail” on Monday to be very concerned about the health of the 77-year-old businessman who suffers from diabetes.
The Hong Kong government said the Correctional Services Department (CSD) "is committed to ensuring that the custody environment is safe, protected, human, appropriate and healthy."
The department "implemented a mechanism to safeguard the rights of people in custody, including regular independent visitors, ie peace judges, who inspect prisons," the authorities said. "The CSD consistently deals with matters related to Lai Chee-Ying in strict compliance with these mechanisms," said the government of the territory.
The statement came up hours after the organization of human rights amnesty International had published a report rejecting the accusations against Jimmy Lai, considering that they "relate to legitimate exercises of freedom of expression without inciting violence."
Lai has been detained since the end of 2020 on charges of collusion, under the national security law imposed by the Chinese central government months earlier to repress an old-time manifestations and pro-democracy.
Amnesty International concluded that of the 78 cases already completed under the National Security Act, at least 66 "involved only legitimate expression that should not have been criminalized, without evidence of violent conduct or incitement."
In response, the Hong Kong government accused “anti-china organizations” and media ”of making“ irresponsible and absurd comments, distorting the truth about the national security case ”involving Jimmy Lai,“ with the intention of perverting the course of justice ”.
On Monday, the European Union denounced a “continuous erosion of civil freedoms” and “severe restrictions” to independent political opposition and civil society in Hong Kong, five years after the imposition of the National Security Act.

According to a statement, the judges unanimously voted to accept a petition, presented by about 30 conservative senators who accuse Shinawatra of "serious ethical violation."
In mid-June, a conversation with former Cambodia Prime Minister and current Senate president Hun Sen was released in which Paetongtarn Shinawatra questioned the role of a high Thai army commander in the context of a border conflict between the two countries.
The judges also approved for seven votes in favor and two against Shinawatra's suspension, which will be effective “until the [final] decision of the Constitutional Court”, which could take several weeks or even months, according to the statement.
"I accept the court decision," the prime minister said yesterday to journalists, in front of the government palace in Bangcoque. "I want to reaffirm that it was always my intention to act in the best interest of my country," added Paetongtarn Shinawatra. Deputy Prime Minister Suriya Jungrungruangkit is expected to become the interim prime minister, although there is no official confirmation yet.
China yesterday expressed hope that Thailand will be able to maintain "stability" following the decision of the Constitutional Court. "As a neighbor friend, we hope Thailand will maintain its stability and development," said Mao Ning, spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs at a press conference.
On June 24, King Maha Vajiralongkorn ratified a ministerial remodeling after the Bhumjaithai party abandoned the government coalition due to the so -called telephone.
The remodeling resulted in the removal of the government of former deputy minister and interior minister Anutin Charvirakul, leader of Bhumjaithai. The next day, the party announced that it would present a motion of censorship against the prime minister in Parliament on July 3.
Shinawatra also faces investigations over an alleged violation of ethics by Thailand's anti -corruption agency, whose decision can also lead to its dismissal.
On Saturday, thousands of protesters joined the capital of Thailand to demand the resignation of the Prime Minister.
About four thousand protesters, according to news agency France Press, filled the streets of Banquecoque, shaking Thai flags and applauding speeches, interspersed with screams of indignation.

The analysis recalled that the local housing market has been in recession in the last six months and has recorded a 14% annual break in transactions. He also pointed out that the vacancy rate of stores in Nape rose due to the closing of satellite casinos by the end of the year.
 
The local real estate market can recover in terms of the volume of housing transactions in the second half, reversing the decreasing trend of transactions and prices, the predictions of the Centaline real estate agency points out.
The Centaline released yesterday the prospects of the real estate market and said he expects a gradual recovery over the next six months of the number of transactions for about 300 purchases and sales per month, compared to an average of 220 per month in the first half of the year. He considered that "it is widely expected" that the federal reserve will reduce interest rates again in the second half, which "should mitigate market pessimism and boost the real estate market," he said.
The analysis also provides that more real estate prosecutors will briefly launch new sales, as the recent launch of the luxury real estate project in Praia Grande was "well-veritable" by the buyer audience, with a "remarkable change in the market atmosphere."
The Centaline, in its balance of the performance of the sector in the last six months, described that the residential market of Macao "continued in recession", with a volume of transactions of approximately 1,341, which represents a 14% break compared to the same period last year.
The report also highlighted a significant drop in prices. "In the first semester, it was estimated that the price of residential housing per square meter would be 72,000 patacas, in contrast to the 89,000 patacas registered in the same period of 2024, and the descent reached 20%. The average price hit the lowest level of the last decade," he noticed.
In this context, the agency explained that the market recession was also due to world economic instability and increased geopolitical conflicts, as well as the impact of the total closing of satellite casinos by the end of the year.
In addition, the government lines announced in April “little mentioned the real estate sector” and no direct support policies were introduced to the real estate market, mourned the Centaline, stressing that these factors made potential buyers even less confidence in the market.
 
Rate of vacant stores falling
 
Regarding the lease of commercial stores in the territory, Centaline revealed that 18 cases of high amounts of high amounts were recorded, ie with a monthly income over 200,000 patacas, in the last six months, and most transactions involved stores in the central zone near the ruins of São Paulo. "The search for stores in the tourist zones is high thanks to the continuous growth of the number of tourists visiting Macao," he noted.
The company's analysis says that the storage rate of stores in several districts registered a drop, and the East Zape zap was the highest reduction, from 10.8% to 9.68%, while the other zones saw a decrease between 0.1% and 0.75%.
However, affected by the closure of satellite casinos, the vacancy rate of stores in NAPE rose from 12.19% to 15.4%, thus being the only area with an increase in the unemployment rate in Macao.
As for the offices, Centaline said that 39 transactions were made in the first half of the year, a 30% break in annual terms, and in the near future, office spaces continue to be mostly leased instead of purchase and sale.</description><pubDate>2025-07-02 14:22:12</pubDate></item><item><title>Analysts project Yuan's climb against the dollar in the face of fear with US debt</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/07/02/analistas-projectam-subida-do-yuan-face-ao-dolar-perante-receio-com-divida-norte-americana/</link><description>Chinese market optimism continues to increase, with analysts projecting a Yuan appreciation against the US dollar, driven by growing concerns about US debt sustainability.
 
The Popular Bank of China (Central Bank) yesterday set the daily reference rate at 7,1534 yuans per dollar, an appreciation compared to the rate from Monday, 7.1656, and the strongest level since early November.
In June, Yuan traded in the domestic market (OnShore) was valued 0.41% compared to the dollar, accumulating 1.2% gains in the second quarter and 1.86% in the first half of the year.
"Compared to the end of April, domestic customers are less pessimistic about China's short -term growth perspectives, as macroeconomic data have been more resistant than initially feared, despite the significant divergence between exports and domestic demand," wrote investment bank analyst Goldman Sachs, Lisheng Wang, in a report released on Sunday.
Investors are increasingly concerned about the sustainability of US public debt, anticipating a devaluation of the dollar due to the reduction of confidence in the country's governance, expansionary fiscal policies and increasing long -term financing costs, Wang added.
The US investment bank predicts that Yuan will continue to strengthen, lowering the 7 barrier for each dollar over the next six months.
The Chinese currency registered a significant volatility this year, falling to its weaker level (7,3506) on April 9, when trade tariffs between China and the US intensified.
Yuan began to recover after the commercial ceasefire between the two countries and the progress in the negotiations held in London last month. In the first half, the total range of Chinese currency negotiation was about 2.6%.
Wang pointed out that the feeling in the domestic market is improving, with expectations that China-Eu negotiations will help support Chinese exports in the second half.
Citic Securities, one of the main Chinese brokerages, said Yuan has remained relatively stable since June, in a context of weakening the dollar.
The narrow difference between the central official parity rate, the 'ONSHORE' quote and the 'offshore' quote reduced pressure on the central bank to intervene in the currency market, the broker said in a report widespread on Friday, providing for Yuan to stay in a short-term low-term state.
Although US tariffs on Chinese products continue to press exports, Yuan's exchange rate will depend above all on internal political support-especially consumption-and advances in trade negotiations between China and the US, the investment bank concluded.

Francis Tolentino, who has just finished his term as leader of the majority in the Philippine Senate, is forbidden to enter China, as well as in the territories of Hong Kong and Macau, according to the China Ministry of Foreign Affairs. "Some time ago, some antichinese politicians in the Philippines have adopted a number of malicious words and actions on China -related issues, aiming to serve their own selfish interests, which has damaged China's interests and undermined the relations between China and the Philippines," the ministry pointed out in a statement. "The Chinese government is determined to defend its national sovereignty, security and development interests," he added.
In a declaration widespread yesterday, Tolentino said that “he will continue to fight-so he belongs to the nation” Philippine, adding that he faced the sanction as a medal of honor and that no foreign power could silence him.
Tolentino is the author of two bills that demarcate the claims of the Philippines in the disputed Southern Sea of ​​China. The two laws, called the Filipine Maritime Zones Law and Archipelagic Maritime Routes Law, were promulgated last November. The laws reaffirmed the extent of the country's sea territories in the Southern Sea of ​​China and the right to resources in these areas.
The laws were quickly condemned and rejected by China, which claims virtually the entire Southern Sea of ​​China. "Any objections of China must be answered with an unshakable defense of our sovereign rights and adherence to the legal results of arbitration," Tolentino said at the time.
Tolentino also accused China of planning to interfere with the May interchange elections in the Philippines and launched an investigation into alleged Chinese spy as a senator.
Philippines and China have been involved in verbal and physical clashes about their claims in the region. The confrontations between the Chinese and Philippine Naval and Coastal Guard in the disputed sea have become increasingly common in the last two years, with the Philippine side to release videos of Chinese boats firing water cannons.</description><pubDate>2025-07-02 14:18:11</pubDate></item><item><title>Garbage in sea and beaches should stay for some time</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/07/02/lixo-nas-areas-maritimas-e-praias-devera-manter-se-por-algum-tempo/</link><description>The Directorate of Maritime and Water Affairs Services (DSAMA) has asked the sea sector and citizens who want to move to the beaches to pay attention to the accumulated waste situation in these places, which is due to the “heavy rains and the rainfall that is felt in the river river zone” and is “dragged by the currents and the surrounding areas of the surrounding areas and areas.

Dsama says that, in recent days, the types of trash dragged on the maritime areas of Macao were mainly branches of plants and household waste. "Due to the continuous increase in the amount of garbage and tides that can drag waste to the beaches and coastal waterfront, DSAMA has constantly proceeded to remove waste at sea and have coordinated with the cleaning company to highlight more personal trash on the beaches," says the body a press release.
"Considering the meteorological conditions, the direction of the winds, the ocean currents and the geographical factors, it is expected that the waste will continue to be dragged by the currents to the maritime areas and the beaches of Macao over the next week, so the removal work will continue for some time," said the body, ensuring that he will continue to monitor the removal of waste and highlight staff to reinforce staff to reinforce the patrol.</description><pubDate>2025-07-02 14:21:07</pubDate></item><item><title>Great Japanese Manufacturers Confidence increased to June</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/07/02/confianca-dos-grandes-fabricantes-japoneses-aumentou-ao-junho/</link><description>Confidence between the great Japanese manufacturers increased in June, reflecting resilience in the face of the US tariff war. The indicator for the large non-industrial manufacturers fell slightly from 35 to 34, remaining close to a record.
 
The confidence between the great Japanese manufacturers increased in June, reflecting resilience in the face of the US tariff war and supporting the hypothesis of a new rise in the interest rates of the Japan Bank in the coming months.
The feeling of the country's leading manufacturers rose to 13, compared to 12 in March, according to Banco do Japan's Quarterly Tankan report (Boj), released yesterday.
The indicator for the large non-industrial manufacturers fell slightly from 35 to 34, remaining close to a record. Economists expected values ​​of 10 for manufacturers and 34 for the services sector.
A positive value indicates that optimists outweigh the pessimists. The perspectives have generally remained unchanged for large manufacturers and non -manufacturers. The feeling also remained practically the same for the smallest companies.
Better reading than expected for the feeling of great manufacturers is likely to give the governor of Boj, Kazuo Ueda, the confidence that he can maintain the debate around a possible increase in the reference interest rate on the agenda when his advice meets at the end of the month.
This important indicator has been positive for over four years, supporting the Central Bank's argument that the economy continues to recover, with weaknesses of weakness.
Business feeling is a key indicator for authorities, who seek to assess whether wage dynamics can be sustained.
The Central Bank of Japan warned, in its last statement of economic policy, that growth can slow as commercial policies and others weigh on companies' profits. If companies see their margins reduced, they may have to slow down the pace of wage increases.
Over the past two years, large companies have promised, during annual salary negotiations, extending salary increases of 5% or more, the largest gains in more than three decades. These gains have fueled the hopes of a virtuous economic cycle, with increasing expense to stimulate demand -induced inflation.
Price indicators are likely to point out long -term inflation expectations over 2%. This may reinforce Boj's opinion that underlying inflation is approaching its goal and increasing the hypotheses of a rate as rising in July.

The Electoral Affairs Committee of the Legislative Assembly said it had forwarded the information of the candidates for the State Security Defense Commission, but did not reveal that types of documents will be analyzed, nor if the opinions concerned will be made public.
 
The Electoral Affairs Commission of the Legislative Assembly (Caeal) has already delivered information from the candidacies to the State Security Defense Committee for the purpose of verifying the eligibility of the candidates, determining whether the candidates defend the basic law and are patriotic and faithful to MSAR.
Although the new electoral law for the Legislative Assembly established seven circumstances that must be taken into account in the verification of the candidacies, the authorities did not reveal how the evaluation process will result, namely what the documents and information that will be analyzed will be.
"Regarding the issue of qualification, whether or not a person defends the basic law, whether it is faithful or not to sinhers, it is up to the [State Security Defense Defense Defense] to find, to ascertain," Seng Ioi Man, president of Caeal, said in response to a journalist about the details of the verification process.
Seng Ioi Man reiterated that the State Security Defense Commission will issue a binding opinion to Caeal and, on Caeal's decision, will be taken based on the opinion of the State Security Defense Commission, and "there will be no claim or appeal."
It is recalled that in the 2021 elections, when the candidacy of six lists involving 21 candidates were disqualified because they were not faithful to MSAR and not defending the basic law, CAEAL had indicated that eligibility assessment had information such as speeches or actions, including comments on social networks, as well as participation in certain activities.
The judge also did not confirm whether the authorities will publish or disclose the binding opinions of the State Security Defense Commission. Seng Ioi Man stressed that the application verification process is still underway as "documents and data are many." "When we have results and decisions, we will publicize to the public. We are still discussing some matters," he said.
According to the electoral calendar, Caeal must publish the decision on the verification of applications by July 15. Subsequently, depending on whether or not complaints or resources, the definitive lists should be published on July 18 or, later, on July 31.
 
Lists without photography
 
CAEAL recalled that it received a total of 8 applications for direct suffrage elections and 6 nominated suffrage candidacies, having proceeded last Saturday to affix candidacies on the Public Administration building.
Contrary to the previous elections, this year is not allowed to take photographs from the posted lists. Seng Ioi Man, who was unable to provide a legal basis for the ban, stressed that the decision is to safeguard the protection of the personal data of the persons in question, given that the affixed lists contain identity information, such as the date of birth and the resident identity ticket number, as well as the home and candidates address.
"Caeal found that this information contains a lot of personal data from these people. We decided not to take pictures due to the protection of personal data, after a prudent weighting while ensuring the right to public information," he said. "If we allow to film and then the photographs will circulate on the internet, people's information will be released. Caeal does not consider it prudent," he said.
On the sidelines of another Caeal meeting held yesterday, Seng Ioi Man pointed out that the polling report was discussed to make life easier for voters. In this case, bulletins are made with quick ink absorption paper, with more space between lines between candidacies and with square highlighted the blue color to decrease the possibility that the voter stamps on the wrong place, in order to reduce the occurrence of null votes. In addition, the role of bulletins will be thicker and will have less transparency to ensure the confidentiality of the vote.
CAEAL added that it will develop a voting report for voters with visual impairment so that they can enter alone in the voting chamber to vote.</description><pubDate>2025-07-02 14:24:28</pubDate></item><item><title>Game revenues exceeded the mark of 21 billion for the second consecutive month</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/07/02/receitas-de-jogo-ultrapassaram-a-marca-dos-21-mil-milhoes-pelo-segundo-mes-consecutivo/</link><description>For the second month in a row, casinos earned more than 21 billion patacas in June. This value represents a 19% increase compared to June last year. Throughout the first half of this year, game revenues reached 118.7 billion, 4.4% over the same period as 2024.
 
The casinos operating in Macao obtained, in June, gross recipes slightly over 21 billion patacas. This value reveals a 19% rise compared to June 2024, when game revenues were 17.7 billion. Data related to gross game revenues last month were revealed yesterday by the Directorate of Inspection and Game Coordination (DICJ).
This is the second best month of the year for game revenues and is also the second consecutive month above 21 billion patacas. In May, the revenues were slightly above at 21.2 billion. Between January and April, casinos' revenues always prowled at 18 and 19 billion Patacas.
Looking at the game recipes since the beginning of the year, the casinos made 118.7 billion of patacas in the first half. This value reflects an increase of 4.4% compared to the first six months of 2024, when revenues were only 113.7 billion.
These values ​​are far above what was registered at the height of the pandemic: 33.7 billion in the first half of 2020, 49 billion in the first half of 2021 and 26.2 billion in the first half of 2022. However, they are not at the same level as the restrictions imposed by the government to deal with Covid-19: in the first half of 2019, for example, gross game revenues were almost 150 billion.
In all 2024, gross game revenues ascended to 226.7 billion patacas, according to DICJ data. This figure meant an increase of about 24% compared to the 183 billion of 2023. In the years of pandemic restrictions, 2020, 2021 and 2022, the gross revenues of the casino industry were 60.4 billion, 86.8 billion and 42.2 billion patacas, respectively. Before the pandemic, in 2019, the game sector had revenues of 292.4 billion patacas and in 2018 of 302.8 billion, for example.
It is recalled that in the first budget for this year, the authorities predicted that the gross casinos revenues rise to 240 billion patacas in 2025. However, the beginning of the year was short of expectations, so the government presented a review of the budget in which it moderates expectations and now foresees 228 billion game revenues. If in the second half the game recipes are identical, the objective will be exceeded.
Tax revenues from the game industry account for more than 80% of all of the MSAR tax revenues. The review of the game law, which came into force in 2022, stipulates that sector concessionaires have to pay a direct tax of 35% of their revenues, plus an annual amount of 2% for a public fund and 3% more for urban development, MSAR tourism and social security promotion.</description><pubDate>2025-07-02 14:23:04</pubDate></item><item><title>Macau returns to childhood with children's film festival</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/07/02/macau-regressa-a-infancia-com-festival-de-cinema-infantil/</link><description>The Cinemateca Paixão again hosts the Macau Children's Film Festival between July 5 (Saturday) and August 10, with a different program that ranges from almost centenary classics to movies finished debut. The “Family Ticket” is one of the news of this year's edition, which already has several sold out sessions.
 
A year after the first edition, the Macau Children's Film Festival returns to Cinemateca Paixão with a vast collection of children's movies - and not only.
The event, integrated at the Macau Children's Arts Festival, includes more than two dozen films that transcend generations, styles and cultures: there are American, Chinese and Japanese works; animation and live-action projects; Classics of the 30s and other finished debut last year.
In conversation with the final point, the president of the CUT Association - the entity responsible for the programming and organization of Cinemateca, the only space in Macao dedicated to independent cinema - confirms the intention to create a diversified poster at a time when the same stories are constantly being retrained. “By showing classics like 'Snow White', we intend to show children how the plots they know today were introduced to the public at the beginning,” explains Rita Wong.
In parallel, the latest and most modernized versions of classics such as “Cinderella” are also displayed in 2015. “There are many versions of the same classics, currently, and we want the public to compare animated versions and real actors adaptations.”
Being in the general theme “Adaptation”, most of the films chosen for the second edition of the festival seeks to establish a comparative bridge with other artistic domains or creative processes, such as literature and musical theater, in a reflection on the different forms of materialization of the same history. “We have movies that had musical adaptations, such as 'The Lion King', and others that originated in children's literature, such as“ George, The Curious ”or“ The Wild Things Site ”, frames the president of the CUT Association.
In addition to the films, the festival offers complementary activities such as workshops or lectures conducted by relevant personalities of Macau's art scene, such as Amanda Chan or the founders of Rolling Puppet's alternative theater of puppets, which will help achieve a deeper understanding of the cultural meanings of the works.
The public adhesion to this year's programming is being significant, as several sessions already sold out at the Cinematheque Electronic Ticket. “This year we focused more on the family and raise family tickets, where an adult can bring a child at no extra cost, which may have increased demand,” says Rita Wong. However, it is rushed to add, "These movies are also good for adults. Anyone, adult or child can simply watch these movies and enjoy it in the same way."

"Once transmitted to Earth, the images were processed and produced by scientific researchers," the Chinese space agency said on its official portal. Tianwen-2 has been in orbit for 32 days, now more than 12 million kilometers from Earth, with all systems working normally. This mission represents an important milestone for the Chinese space program, being the first to collect samples of an asteroid and bring them to the earth. The ambitious operation, expected to be more than a decade, will also include the exploration of the 311P comet, located in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. The first phase of the mission will focus on asteroid 2016ho3, known as 469219 Kamo'oalewa, considered an almost-terrestrial satellite due to its orbit near the earth and around the sun.
According to the established plan, the probe should take about a year to reach its first destination. Upon arrival, will perform approximation maneuvers and remain in orbit of the asteroid to identify the most suitable zone for sample collection. Once this operation is completed, the ship will return near the Earth, where a separate capsule should bring the samples to study at the end of 2027, before the probe continues to travel to Cometa 311p, located about 300 million kilometers from our planet. This project fits the ambitious Chinese space program, which has already reached remarkable achievements such as the Chang'e 4 landing landing on the hidden face of the moon-a worldwide primacy-and the arrival in Mars, making China in the third country to achieve this feat after the former Soviet Union and the United States.</description><pubDate>2025-07-02 14:17:47</pubDate></item><item><title>Casin-satellite closure can help traditional casinos</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/07/02/encerramento-dos-casinos-satelite-pode-ajudar-casinos-tradicionais/</link><description>The closing of the 11 satellite casinos may give a boost to the recipes of traditional casinos, indicated experts to the Ggraia portal. Analysts explain that gamblers from Macau and Hong Kong, who usually frequent the satellite casinos, should migrate to traditional casinos.
It is recalled that SJM, Melco and Galaxy have recently announced that by the end of the year they will fail to explore the 11 satellite casinos that operate currently. In addition, of the six Mocha clubs, explored by Melco, three will be closed.
Ben Lee, head of the Igamix sector consulting firm, noted that gamblers who frequent the satellite casinos is “quite different from that captured by large resorts”, and stressed that satellite casinos have a more local regular market and also from the neighboring region.
An executive from one of the Macao dealers who did not want to identify, he said: “It is possible that some very low level customers, used to playing in the satellite casinos, to be excluded from the market” after the closure of these satellite establishments, but, on the other hand, another part of these gamblers can now head to the electronic play areas of the casinos directly, instead of their tables with Croupiers live, “which usually have higher table limits” than these players can afford.
Another executive shares the opinion, noting that some mid -level players should accept offers from companies such as MGM Macau and Wynn Macau, as “these two casinos do not only serve the high -level games segment,” also having elements of electronic games or [machines] live multiplay. This was a reference to electronic table games that have a live croupier, but with placement and settlement of electronic bets. These traditional casinos in the city center "can potentially attract medium and low level customers [of satellite casinos," the sector executive noted.</description><pubDate>2025-07-02 14:16:28</pubDate></item><item><title>Agreement on inert materials makes ecological island even more dispensable, defend environmentalists</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/07/02/acordo-sobre-materiais-inertes-torna-ilha-ecologica-ainda-mais-dispensavel-defendem-ambientalistas/</link><description>The government's project for the construction of the ecological island, a landfill to be built in the south of Coloane, near Hac Sá beach, has been criticized by various environmentalists. Now, both the Hong Kong Dolphin Conservation Society and Joe Chan have re -criticizing the project, saying it is unnecessary, as it was recently signed an agreement for the deposition of inert materials between the masters and the interior of China.
 
The recent signing of the cooperation agreement for the deposition of inert materials in the maritime areas of the interior of China is another factor that shows that the construction of the ecological island is unnecessary, defended the Hong Kong Dolphin Conservation Society. At the end, Macao Joe Chan's environmentalist highlighting the opinion.
This “Cooperation Agreement for the Management Work of the Innert Materials Office resulting from Macau demolitions and buildings in the areas of the interior of China” announced a long -term mechanism for the disposition of inert materials resulting from mashed demolitions and buildings in the interior maritime areas of China. At the time, the Government of MSA explained the agreement with the need to advance works of great wingspan, such as the construction of the eastern east line, which will require the use of a tunnel drilling machine. With the agreement, the inert materials resulting from macao demolitions and constructions can be treated in the maritime areas of the continent.
More than a year ago, the government proposed the construction of this “ecological island”, justifying that the construction landfill was saturated. This project consists of the creation of landfill in the maritime zone about a kilometer of the coast, between Hac Sá and Cheoc Van, which will serve to deposition construction waste, garbage incineration ash, solidified fly ash and construction residues. However, this project has been criticized because, according to environmentalists, it is an important habitat area of ​​Chinese white dolphins. An investigation into white dolphins conducted by the University of Zhongshan indicated that between 2020 and 2021, 144 white dolphins used the waters of Macao.
Vienna Mak, vice president of Hong Kong Dolphin Conservation Society, said in statements to the newspaper Cheng Pou, that it is no longer necessary to build the ecological island in the waters of Macao and that the government should actively protect the habitat from white dolphins.
The official recalled that the recently signed agreement allows Macao construction waste to be transported inside China, "thus opening new possibilities for the construction residues of Macao." Therefore, “it is no longer necessary to create the ecological island in the habitat of white dolphins in the waters of Macau,” he defended. "The protection of Chinese white dolphins is urgent" and "the government must commit to citizens to suspend the landfill project of the ecological island and accelerate the creation work of the Macao white dolphin reserve," said Hong Kong Dolphin Conservation Society.
"I fully agree with the Hong Kong Association," Joe Chan said at the end, justifying that, allowing the waste to be transferred to the interior of China, "there is no longer urgent" in the construction of the ecological island. Still, “the Macao government should not take mainland China policy as guaranteed, as we still have to find methods to reduce and recycle construction materials and inert, because not all waste is acceptable,” said the Macau Green Student Union Association.
For Joe Chan, China's interior authorities already help Masters in many environmental problems and, therefore, argue that Macau must "fulfill their obligations" and "reduce the amount of household and construction through regulation and education."</description><pubDate>2025-07-02 14:25:44</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
