The Housing Institute indicates that the commercial facilities are still undergoing renovation and processing licenses. The data shows that 2,214 families have already completed the purchase of affordable housing units in Zone A and 1,636 families have already received the keys.

The Government is coordinating the delivery of affordable housing units in Zone A of the New Landfills and expects that the first restaurants and shops in the area will open before Chinese New Year, that is, in mid-February.
According to the Housing Institute (IH), cited by Canal Macau in Chinese, the aforementioned commercial facilities are located on the ground floor of the Tong Chong Building and the Tong Kai Building, including a restaurant, a bank, a supermarket, a pharmacy and a space for general commercial activity, all of which have been leased.
The commercial spaces are currently undergoing renovation work and processing licenses for operating activities, with the Government “accelerating procedures” to allow the facilities to begin operating as quickly as possible.
According to the most up-to-date official data as of last Friday, the three affordable housing units in Zone A – the Tong Seng Building, the Tong Chong Building and the Tong Kai Building – that were part of the competition in 2019, have already sold 2,214 units, that is, with promissory purchase and sale contracts signed. Among these, 1,636 families have already received the keys, and more than 500 households have applications for mortgage loans that have not yet been completed.
In this case, Zone A has already started to receive residents and is expected to register a gradual increase in population. However, residents denounced the lack of additional facilities in the area. According to Jornal Ou Mun, apart from the only two bus stops to enter and leave the area, there are currently no other complementary facilities in operation, with the exception of a health post.
The complex of public facilities in Zone A, in Lot B6, close to the three aforementioned affordable housing buildings and which incorporates municipal markets, shopping centers and car parks, has remained closed to the public since its completion.
The IH, in response, added that, since September last year, three bus lines have been operating in Zone A with connections to the Macau Peninsula, Taipa, Cotai and Hengqin Post, in order to facilitate public transport for residents living in the area. “With the facilities in Zone A coming into operation and the occupancy of the units underway, the Government is currently assessing the local environment to establish convenient access routes for residents when traveling to bus stops”, he highlighted.
The Executive also promised to increase the bus routes serving Zone A, and is working to extend the service coverage of some existing routes to the area before the Lunar New Year. During public holidays, the Government will coordinate with bus operators to facilitate the temporary operation of route 101XS to alleviate passenger congestion.
In addition, IH assured that it is monitoring the construction works of more cultural, recreational and social services facilities in Zone A of Novos Aterros, which will be progressively opened to better meet the daily needs of residents.</description><pubDate>2026-01-14 00:07:53</pubDate></item><item><title>Wynn, Galaxy and Sands announce salary increases</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2026/01/14/wynn-galaxy-e-sands-anunciam-aumentos-salariais/</link><description>Three of the gaming concessionaires operating in Macau have already announced salary increases for their workers. The increases announced by Wynn, Galaxy and Sands will be more than 2%.

Three of the six major tourism and leisure companies have already announced salary increases for their workers. They are Wynn, Galaxy and Sands.
In a statement sent to newsrooms yesterday, Wynn Macau announced a salary increase of between 2% and 4.5% for eligible employees, excluding top management, at Wynn Macau and Wynn Palace, “in recognition of their professionalism and exceptional contributions over the last year”. The salary increase will come into force from March 1st of this year, covering 98% of the current 11,803 employees.
Eligible workers with a monthly salary of up to 16,000 patacas will receive a salary increase of 500 patacas; workers with a monthly salary above 16,000 patacas will receive an average salary increase of 2%. In addition, a special subsidy equivalent to one month's gross salary will also be paid to eligible employees on January 30, 2026.
Linda Chen, president and CEO of Wynn Macau, said, quoted in the statement: "The company's success depends on the tireless efforts and dedication of each team member. We look forward to sharing the fruits of our collective achievements through this salary increase." "This year has a special meaning, as we celebrate the 20th anniversary of Wynn Macau and the 10th anniversary of Wynn Palace. We look forward to continuing our journey together, seeking new heights for Wynn and Macau, and embracing an even brighter future together", highlighted the Wynn manager.
Galaxy Entertainment Group, in turn, announced that all eligible workers, with a position equal to or less than 'senior manager', will receive a salary increase from April 1, 2026, which will benefit around 98% of the group's employees.
All eligible team members who joined Galaxy before January 1, 2026 will receive the following salary adjustments: team members with a monthly base salary of up to MOP16,000 will receive a salary increase of MOP500, while team members with a monthly base salary above MOP16,000 will receive a 2% salary increase.
“Galaxy thanks all team members for their dedication and hard work and looks forward to achieving even more success together, guided by the belief of ‘One Team, One Goal'”, says the group in the press release sent to newsrooms yesterday.
On Monday, Sands had also announced salary increases, in addition to a bonus worth a salary attributable to 99% of workers. The operator's salary increase takes effect on March 1. Eligible full-time team members who receive monthly salaries of up to 16,000 patacas will receive a salary increase of 500 patacas, resulting in a salary increase of between 3.1% and 4%. Eligible full-time team members who receive monthly salaries above MOP16,000 will receive a 2% salary increase.
Remember that the results of a recently released survey indicate that local companies plan to increase salaries by 2.23% on average throughout 2026.</description><pubDate>2026-01-14 00:07:01</pubDate></item><item><title>IAM rules out the possibility of expanding the Kennel’s medical-veterinary services</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2026/01/14/iam-afasta-possibilidade-de-expandir-servicos-medico-veterinarios-do-canil/</link><description>The Institute for Municipal Affairs states that there are no conditions to extend the external veterinary consultation service, which now only operates in the morning on weekdays. In response to requests from residents about extended hours and more spaces for consultations at the Municipal Kennel, the organization says that human and clinical resources remain insufficient to implement the plan.

The lack of human and clinical resources was the justification given by the Institute for Municipal Affairs (IAM) for rejecting the expansion of medical-veterinary services at the Municipal Kennel, namely the extension of opening hours and spaces for consultations.
"To balance the rational use of public resources with the quality of service, the Municipal Kennel must simultaneously deal with medical care, sterilization, disease monitoring and prevention and emergency rescue of sheltered animals. Currently, human and clinical resources remain insufficient to extend external consultation services for public pets", states the IAM, quoted by Radio Macau in Chinese language.
The IAM's position came after some residents expressed their concerns about the scarcity of medical-veterinary services at the Municipal Kennel, due to the fact that these services only operate on weekday mornings, with very limited vacancies.
According to information on the official Municipal Kennel portal, consultation hours are from 9:15 am to 1:00 pm, from Monday to Friday, and are closed on Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.
"Opening hours are very short, only half a day a day. There are only a few spaces available per day. With so many people with pets in Macau, they may have to queue early in the morning and still not be served. It's really inconvenient," said a resident, surnamed Cheng, who called in on Monday to "Fórum Macau", a morning program on Radio Macau.
It was therefore suggested that opening hours be extended to at least a full day, with more comprehensive opening hours. The resident also highlighted that, although there are private veterinarians, the services provided by the Municipal Kennel must be the most credible and reasonably priced.
The fee for the first consultation at the Municipal Kennel is currently 150 patacas, according to the organization, and each subsequent consultation is 80 patacas, not including the fee for medicines, which cost 20 to 800 patacas.
The Municipal Kennel's services also cover vaccination, quarantine and issuance of health certificates, microchip implantation and other procedures for pets, in addition to basic services for clinical diagnosis, prevention and treatment of diseases.
The services adopt a pre-booking system, with four appointments at the veterinary clinic being available for booking each working day. The waiting line will be opened without prior appointment only when there are spaces available on the day.
Limiting the hours of external veterinary consultations at the Municipal Kennel is not a recent issue. In 2023, Lei Kit Ian, member of the Community Services Advisory Council, proposed that the IAM extend the hours for external veterinary consultations on weekdays until 5 pm, and also provide services on Saturday mornings, to meet the high demand.
On Radio Macau, Leong Chon Kit, also a member of the Community Services Advisory Council, argued that the IAM should take advantage of the organization's restructuring to implement the extension of the Municipal Kennel's opening hours until 6pm from Monday to Friday, but also add spaces for consultations on weekends, to allow working residents to take their pets for treatment at the Municipal Kennel.</description><pubDate>2026-01-14 00:09:49</pubDate></item><item><title>Gaming dealerships benefit from HK$150 million exemption in 2024</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2026/01/14/concessionarias-de-jogo-beneficiaram-de-isencao-de-150-milhoes-de-dolares-de-hk-em-2024/</link><description>Under the rule that grants a reduction in contributions from the gross gaming revenues of concessionaires that manage to expand the customer market from foreign countries, the Government exempted gaming operators from paying 150 million Hong Kong dollars in 2024. The information was given yesterday by the Government to the deputies of the Second Standing Committee of the Legislative Assembly (AL).

In 2024, gaming concessionaires obtained an exemption from paying contributions worth 150 million Hong Kong dollars, under the regulation that benefits gaming concessionaires that manage to expand the market of customers from foreign countries. The information was shared yesterday by the Government to the deputies who make up the Second Permanent Committee of the Legislative Assembly (AL). This regulation came into force precisely in 2024.
Deputies Ip Sio Kai and Lam Lon Wai summarized the committee's meeting with the Government, which was attended by Tai Kin Ip, secretary for Economy and Finance. According to Ip Sio Kai, Government representatives stated that each casino has designated zones for international bettors and data generated by gaming activities carried out exclusively in those zones can be used as a basis for fee reductions.
In the past, PONTO FINAL tried to find out what proportion of gaming revenue came from foreign gamblers, as well as how the Gaming Inspection and Coordination Directorate (DICJ) monitors the data presented by concessionaires. The DICJ only indicated that the operators “establish a database, with a view to storing the supporting documents and relevant information that must be presented to the DICJ for the purposes of reducing or exempting contributions”, committing themselves to “supervision work in accordance with the law and regulations related to the operation of games of chance in casinos”.
Cited by the Ou Mun newspaper, Lam Lon Wai and Ip Sio Kai also indicated that some deputies on the commission expressed concern about investment agreements in non-gaming related businesses signed between the six main leisure companies and the Government. Data presented by authorities says that gaming concessionaires increased their investments in non-gaming government projects by 170 million patacas, according to the contracts.
At the meeting, the Government also reported that the University of Macau, the Macau Polytechnic University and the Macau Tourism University recorded revenue growth in 2024 of around 30%.
It was also mentioned that the budget execution of the new Hospital das Ilhas, in 2024, was just over 20% because it was still in its initial phase of operations, which meant that the recruitment of staff and the acquisition of equipment progressed more slowly than expected.</description><pubDate>2026-01-14 00:08:48</pubDate></item><item><title>New FAOM leaders meet with Chief Executive after recognition in Beijing</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2026/01/14/novos-dirigentes-da-faom-reunem-com-chefe-do-executivo-apos-reconhecimento-em-pequim/</link><description>In a meeting held at the Government Headquarters, the Chief Executive, Sam Hou Fai, met with the new governing bodies of the Federation of Workers' Associations of Macau (FAOM). The dialogue, which followed a recent official visit to Beijing where FAOM's work was valued, focused on strengthening labor protection and social stability, outlining priorities for the federation's new mandate.

Following a recent official visit to Beijing where the work of Macau's institutions was recognized by President Xi Jinping and the Central Government, the Chief Executive, Sam Hou Fai, received this Monday, January 12th, the newly elected members of the 37th Board and the Supervisory Board of the Federation of Workers' Associations of Macau (FAOM). The meeting, which was also attended by the Secretary for Economy and Finance, Tai Kin Ip, served to align priorities on safeguarding workers' rights and the role of the federation in social stability.
Sam Hou Fai began by congratulating FAOM on the successful election of its new governing bodies, led by new president Lam Lon Wai. During the meeting, the Chief Executive highlighted that, during his recent visit to the Chinese capital, both the President and the Central Government “fully” recognized the results achieved by the Macao SAR government last year, highlighting that these advances included a “significant contribution” from FAOM. In addition to Secretary Tai Kin Ip, the meeting was also attended by the head of the Chief Executive's Office, Chan Kak, the director of Labor Affairs Services, Chan Un Tong, the new president of the FAOM Board, Kong Ioi Fai, and the new president of the Supervisory Board, Ho Sut Heng, among other members of the Federation's board and supervisory board.
The leader of the Macau executive praised the federation for constituting a “core force” in strengthening the foundations of love for the country and for Macau, thus contributing to an “unshakable” implementation of the “one country, two systems” principle. He also highlighted his “proactive” role in uniting and serving workers and maintaining the stability of society, thanking the work carried out over the years in defending labor interests and building harmonious labor relations.
Looking to the future, Sam Hou Fai expressed the expectation that, under the new leadership, FAOM will continue to unite workers from all sectors, with a special focus on young people. The focus on specialized training to increase the “professional competence” of workers was highlighted as one of the ways. The ultimate objective, as mentioned, is to work together with other associations to “fully implement the Central Government’s plans”, promote the principle of “one country, two systems” and “build hand in hand a more harmonious, beautiful and happy Macau”.
For the new year, Sam Hou Fai reaffirmed the government's commitment to continue working with all sectors of society to meet the expectations of the Central Government and President Xi Jinping, following the concept of “working with an entrepreneurial spirit and moving forward together, persisting on the right path and focusing on innovation”.</description><pubDate>2026-01-14 00:01:06</pubDate></item><item><title>4,925 suspicious transactions recorded last year</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2026/01/14/registadas-4-925-transaccoes-suspeitas-no-ano-passado/</link><description>The number of suspicious transaction reports last year fell to 4,925. Still, 2025 was the second year with the most suspicious transactions since at least 2012. Last year, most suspicious transactions were reported by gaming operators. Last year, 118 reports of suspicious transactions were sent to the Public Prosecutor's Office.

In 2025, 4,925 suspicious transactions were reported, according to statistics published on the Financial Information Office (GIF) website. Around 73% of suspicious transactions last year were reported by gaming operators. In addition to these, 20.5% were reported by financial institutions and insurance companies and another 6.4% by other institutions. GIF says that, last year, it sent 118 reports of suspicious transactions to the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Compared to 2024 figures, there was a 6.1% decrease in reports of suspicious transactions. This was mainly due to the reduction in the number of complaints made by the gaming sector in 2025, explains GIF.
Despite the decrease compared to 2024, last year's 4,925 suspicious transactions make 2025 the second year with the most complaints since at least 2012. The year 2024 was, then, the year with the most reports of this kind received by GIF, followed by 2025. In third place was 2023 with 4,614. Between 2012 and 2015, the number of suspicious transactions reported was around 1,800.
On its website, GIF explains that “criminals need to use different techniques to conceal the large amounts of money received before they can be integrated into legitimate businesses”, which can “involve carrying out various transactions through different means, from the simplest to the most sophisticated either through financial institutions or through non-financial institutions”.
Thus, in addition to traditional money laundering systems, such as the use of bank deposits, transfers between accounts, currency remittances or investments in different financial products, “in recent years, the most recent trends or methods detected in money laundering indicate that it is entities belonging to the non-financial sector that have been used to carry out money laundering activities to hide or disguise the illicit origin of funds”.
Money laundering and terrorist financing are crimes punishable by a prison sentence that, at its maximum limit, can reach 12 years. Failure to report suspicious transactions is considered an administrative offense and is subject to a fine of up to 500 thousand patacas when the offender is an individual or 5 million patacas in cases where the offender is a legal entity.</description><pubDate>2026-01-14 00:10:28</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
