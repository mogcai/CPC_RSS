According to sources cited by the British newspaper, which asked not to be identified, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce considers that Mexico would have unlimited access to BYD's advanced systems and technologies and that the country's proximity to the United States could mean that Americans could also access these technologies.
BYD announced in 2023 plans to build a factory in Mexico, where it would produce about 150,000 vehicles a year and create 10,000 jobs. The plan of the Shenzhen -based company also included the manufacture of cars in Indonesia, Brazil and Hungary.
However, Chinese automobile manufacturers need commercial approval to produce vehicles abroad, and Beijing is giving preference to countries that are part of their international infrastructure development initiative known as “track and route”.
According to the newspaper, Donald Trump's return to the White House has made Mexico some of the enthusiasm for the BYD project, making it more prior to maintaining relations with the northern neighbor in the face of the threat of rates on transionic trade.
After Trump's team accused Mexico of being a “rear door” for Chinese products to enter the United States without paying applicable taxes, the Mexican government announced rates against Asian country's textiles and Chinese steel and aluminum investigations for alleged unfair competition. "The new Mexican government has adopted a hostile attitude towards Chinese companies, which makes the situation even harder for BYD," explained one of the sources cited by the Financial Times.
For Rhodium analyst Gregor Sebastian, "the Mexican government would obviously like to get some Chinese investment, but its commercial relationship with the United States is much more important."
In a recent interview with FT, BYD's executive vice president, Stella Li, said the company “has not yet decided” what will happen with the plan to open a factory in Mexico: “Every day there are different news. We have to always be seeing how to improve and satisfy, to get the best result for everyone.” However, in February, Li had advanced that Byd would choose the location of the factory before the end of the year.
By 2024, the electric car manufacturer sold more than 40,000 vehicles in Mexico, and revealed that the goal for this year is to double sales volume and open 30 new dealers in the country.

At the meeting, the determination of the Government of MSA was determined in the widening of health coverage and the development of the 'Big Health' industry in the region.
 
The head of the MSAR executive, Sam Hou Fai, met this Tuesday with the honorary president of the Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH), Zhao Yupei. The session took place at the government's headquarters and focused on the development of the 'Big Health' industry in Macao and the expansion of services offered by the island health care complex.
Sam Hou Fai began to emphasize the importance of the 'Big Health' industry in the diversification of the economy and the long -term prosperity of Macao, reaffirming the sector of “Health+Tourism” as one of the themes of interest of the Government of MSAR. According to a press release of the Social Communication Office, the Chief Executive thanked the Pumch contribution to the success of the Macao Medical Center (namely, by sending an “elite team”) and ensured that with the joint effort of the MSAR and the Beijing Hospital, it will be possible to “create a first -class medical center with international influence”.
Also under the meeting with Zhao Yupei-who also performs the functions of president of the Chinese Association of Medicine Professionals, member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Honorary Advisor to the Macao Medical Center-the head of the Executive of the MSAR took the opportunity to congratulate the expansion of specialized external consultation services, for the non-resident population. Sam Hou Fai believes that the widening measure, implemented this March, will contribute to “significant improvement” of the distribution of medical resources and services in Macau: in addition to a “convenient option” to non-residents, who no longer have to leave the territory to seek treatment, is also an attractive option for residents of the large bay and southeast Asian countries.
After the meeting, the head of the Executive of the MSAR and the honorary president of the PUMCH witnessed the signing of the agreement “Operational Cooperation Rate 2025 of the Island Health Care Complex - Macao Medical Center of the Peking Union Medical Hospital”, by the secretary for social affairs and culture, LAM, and PUMCH President Zhang Shuyang.
Also present at the meeting of the Secretary's Chief of Staff for Social Affairs and Culture, Lin Yuan, the director of the Department of Advertising and Culture Conduct Central Government, Wan Sucheng, Pumch President and Honorary Advisor to Macao Medical Center, Zhang Shuyang, and Pumch Vice President Han Ding.
It is recalled that the islands hospital provides medical services with three levels of rates, and level I is free medical care for local residents. Level II refers to 30% discount on the way health care, while level III is international health care, private service, intended for residents and people abroad, and corresponding rates refer to the market price of private health care services.
The Islands Hospital, the largest medical service complex in the territory, went into operation on September 15, 2024. At the inauguration ceremony, the then chief executive HIAT SENG ensured that the new establishment would encourage the development of the 'Big Health' industry in Macao and the high quality health tourism sector.

According to advanced information in a MIECF statement, contact scholarships will lean on topics such as “debut economy projects”, “International Low Carbon Development”, “Environmental Protection between Public Organizations of Macao and Hengqin”, “Offer and demand for green buildings” and “cooperation and exchange between integrated tourism and leisure companies”. The biggest highlight goes to the initiative “Economics of debut @macau - project launch X Innovative Contact Scholarship Session”, which is the first time that the event “provides a platform for the dissemination and connection of green innovation projects through project and commercial correspondence roadshows”.
Traders interested in participating in green contact bags can access the official event page to pre-regret, and MIECF will provide professional interpretation on site. This year's edition will also introduce Miecf Chatbot, another unpublished activity in the history of the event, which will resort to artificial intelligence technology to provide information and correspond profiles from exhibitors and traders, “thus improving the experience of participation in exhibition and the efficiency of meetings”.
During the exhibition period, several international exchange activities will be held. MIECF states that, in the last two editions of the event, a “Brazilian buyer has successfully established commercial contacts with companies from inland China” in the areas of solar energy and carbon credits, now planning to broaden this partnership with Hengqin. In turn, a Shangoi low -carbon technology organization aims to take advantage of the occasion to “promote its environmental and technological projects, as well as explore opportunities for green finance cooperation with the financial institutions of Macao”.
This year, MIECF will continue to make a green transformation counter available to provide business consulting services, with the intention of promoting green transformation into domains such as ESG, green certification and green technological transition.</description><pubDate>2025-03-20 04:58:11</pubDate></item><item><title>Counselors of the Portuguese communities of Asia and Oceania gather in Dili</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/03/20/conselheiros-das-comunidades-portuguesas-de-asia-e-oceania-reunem-se-em-dili/</link><description>The Regional Council of the Portuguese Communities of Asia and Oceania will meet in Dili, between Thursday and Friday, to discuss the problems and challenges that affect Portuguese citizens in those regions.
The meeting, the first to be held in Timor-Leste, who in 2023 had a counselor, will take place at the Embassy of Portugal in Dili, joining the counselors of the Circle of China, the Circle of Australia and the Circle of Timor-Leste.
"Although there are other topics, related to consular issues, education and teaching and economic part, one of the main topics has to do with the trying to collect a set of problems, challenges that the communities face," the Portuguese community counselor in Timor-Leste told Lusa.
Filipe Silva pointed out that the challenges are different from community to community, but there are transversal issues, such as the fact that emigrants now have no access to a family doctor in Portugal. "Although we understand what is the option, because we can not assign 150 or 200 patients to a doctor and then people are not there, but how we can be careful that these situations are not fully forgotten," he said.
In the case of Timor-Leste, Filipe Silva gave as an example the question of correspondence vote, which does not apply, as in the cases of Switzerland or Macao. "In Timor-Leste there is no mail distribution. The mail takes a lot of time to arrive here and are issues that worry the community a lot," he said.
The work agenda of the Regional Council of Asia and Oceania includes a meeting with the president of Timor-Leste, José Ramos-Horta, on Thursday, the day that will also be made debates on cooperation programs between the circles in the education and associativism sector, in the area of ​​economics and consular issues and on artistic and cultural potentialities.
On Friday, the counselors will discuss the main problems that affect Portuguese communities in Asia and Oceania and hold a meeting with the Portuguese community in Timor-Leste.</description><pubDate>2025-03-20 04:57:07</pubDate></item><item><title>DSSCU appeals to urgent scheduling of the inspection of lifts</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/03/20/dsscu-apela-para-agendamento-urgente-da-inspeccao-de-ascensores/</link><description>The Directorate of Soil Services and Urban Construction (DSSCU) appeals to those responsible who have not yet made the annual inspection of the lifts who do so “as soon as possible” in order to ensure their safe operation and proceed to any repairs or corrections.
The DSSCU recalls that the Legal Security Regime of Ascenders (Law No. 14/2022) entered into force on April 1, 2024, covering the more than 10,500 lifts, 151 technicians, 41 maintenance entities and ten inspector entities currently registered in the Masters. In accordance with the provisions provided for by law, those responsible for the lifts (“ie the business company, the Assembly of owners or those who hold the exploitation of establishments”) must hire a maintenance entity and another inspector to maintain and periodic inspection to be performed at least once a year.
It is recalled that this legislation came into force almost a year ago, and therefore, it is imperative to “schedule the inspection as soon as possible, in order to allow sufficient time” to monitor any reparations and issue the “inspection approval declaration”. DSSCU informs that it has posted notifications in buildings that have not yet complied with this obligation, as well as drawing attention to the existence of "disabilities in the security devices of a small part of the lifts." If the “necessary benefactors” are not completed within three years, periodic inspections will be held every eight months rather than annually.
Information on lifting technicians and maintenance and inspection entities is public and can be consulted on the DSSCU Thematic Electronic page. Alternatively, interested parties can contact the DSSCU contact center through 85903800.</description><pubDate>2025-03-20 04:56:41</pubDate></item><item><title>There are “weaknesses” in the development of Portuguese in Macau, they say investigators</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/03/20/ha-pontos-fracos-no-desenvolvimento-do-portugues-em-macau-dizem-investigadores/</link><description>The Popular Republic of China wants to build a Lusophone identity in Macao, but, given its unique characteristics, there are several challenges ahead, the researchers of the East Institute of the Higher Institute of Social and Political Sciences in Lisbon, Li Guofeng and Nuno Canas Mendes are concluded.
 
The objective has been the construction of a common Lusophone identity in the MSAR since the transfer of administration in 1999, but there are several “weaknesses” that can make the development of Portuguese difficult. It is the conclusion of a work on “the teaching of Portuguese in the MSAR and the construction of a Lusophone identity”, by the researchers Li Guofeng and Nuno Canas Mendes, presented at the Spring 2025 conferences, at the Macao Scientific and Cultural Center in Lisbon, on March 17.
After the transfer of administration, in 1999, when observing the teaching of Portuguese in the MSAR, there was a movement of promotion of Portuguese language and culture in Chinese territory. This was the motto for research work, which seeks to answer the question: "What are the reasons that enhance the dissemination of the Portuguese language by the Chinese part after the transfer in 1999?"
In studying this issue, Li Guofeng explains, we chose, in this paper, by a “constructivist approach”, which identifies identity as “a product socially built throughout life and interactions in that society”. With “retroactive effects”, there is thus a common past with the objective of having a common destination, building a “imaginary community” based on the Portuguese language, defined “by a higher power”.
 
The Macao Case Paradigm
 
The case of Macau turns out to be paradigmatic. Looking at Hong Kong, for example, "the use of English is treated as something that is not welcome on the part of the authorities," as it can ask questions about "political cohesion with mainland China." And if, in other colonies, one usually tries to “adapt” some data from the past, in the territory it does not happen. "Relations between Portugal and China are generally peaceful and friendly, and, in the past centuries, in Macao, there were no great political risks such as Hong Kong," he says, explaining that "territory has always depended - and continues to depend on China." There would be no problems in promoting the Portuguese language.
Another factor that leads to a greater ease in the promotion of the Portuguese language, currently, is “relatively weaker presence of Portuguese language and culture in the territory”, during the Portuguese administration. "This means that China now can now guide the development of this language and this does not happen in Hong Kong," he says, stressing that for Beijing, "the dissemination of any future language in China, in the first place, cannot be risks to national security and political stability."
In addition, language dissemination “has to be organized, oriented or even controlled by the Chinese party to defend Chinese interests” and objectives can be seen at various levels. "For the MSAR is to foster tourism, to have a tourist, international, European tourist destination, and also diversify the pillars of economic development, thus increasing business opportunities with other countries," he says. In regional terms, by promoting the Portuguese language, the interests of the great bay is also promoted. "It is an area that China wants to develop to open to the outside world, will serve to defend the national interests of China and is another channel to encourage economic exchanges between China and Portuguese -speaking countries, mainly for the promotion of Portuguese in the territory," he adds.
 
A clear guidance is still missing
 
However, the researcher says, it is not yet seen “a very clear superior design about the Portuguese language, that is, in terms of language policies, of linguistic planning there are no guidelines for Portuguese in Macao”. It may be indicated that there is the Macao Basic Law, where the Portuguese language is elevated to the official language statute, as well as several reports of the central government, which mention it as an objective, but, according to Li Guofeng, there is no express and manifest will in the way.
Highlighting the role that universities in the territory have in this field of the development of the Portuguese language, the researcher highlights some, among the higher education institutions. “Macao Polytechnic University has been very active in this field and there is a job that Instituto Camões cannot do in Macau, China,” he says, specifying: “They publish pedagogical manuals directed to Chinese students.” It also emphasizes the collaborations between the Higher Education Institutions of Macau and China, as well as the various academic activities whose objective is to deepen the knowledge of the Portuguese language.
In his contacts with Macao and China higher education institutions and different teachers and researchers, Li Guofeng highlights a nomination, which was left by fellow Chinese: “I have more confidence to participate in a lecture organized by Macau than by Portugal.” On the one hand, the Portuguese institutions “do not specifically study the situation of the Portuguese language in China” and, on the other, “there are always some considerations of political security by the Chinese teachers”, as it is a foreign country, rather than being Chinese territory.
Among Macao's attraction factors, the researcher highlights the use of Portuguese -related state -of -the -art technology, highlighting two laboratories from the University of Macau, and the creation of research centers. “In 2000/2001, there were 600 and such students at the Portuguese Institute of the East, and in the teaching year of 2021, there were over 4000 students,” he says: “It is a very significant increase.”
 
The challenges of the Portuguese language in Macau
 
Faced with this scenario, Li Guofeng says the way to the growth of Portuguese in Macau has some bumps. First, the competition of English. “To study any foreign language, there are always two reasons: I like this language and, of course, by comparison, Portuguese is less attractive than English,” he says. Then, a language is studied because there is need, but, given the dimension of the territory, "there is no large labor market for those graduated in Portuguese." There are, therefore, several challenges, and there is “a weak base of resources and materials”, which is important “to promote Lusophone identity”.
Thus, it is clear the “intention” of the central government and the Government of MSar to “build a strengthening a Lusophone identity in Macao”, but this will only be an objective, as long as it does not impact national security. Therefore, since 1999, despite being “in a prosperous development situation”, there are still some “weaknesses in the Lusophone identity in Macao”.</description><pubDate>2025-03-20 04:58:05</pubDate></item><item><title>Poetry and Illustration: stimuli to “create from our own world”</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/03/20/poesia-e-ilustracao-estimulos-para-criarmos-do-nosso-proprio-mundo/</link><description>André Letria, illustrator and founder of Pato Logic Publisher, participated yesterday in a session at the Luso-Chinese Secondary School of Luís Gonzaga Gomes, where more than 80 students were present. The initiative was held within the 14th edition of Rota das Letras-Macao Literary Festival and explored the students' visual creativity. At the end, André Letria outlined parallels between illustration and poetry, central theme of this edition of the festival: ways that do not have to give answers and that encourage the creation of “our own world”.
 
André Letria, illustrator and founder of Pato Logic Publishing, was yesterday at Luís Gonzaga Gomes Luso-Chinese Secondary School in a session that sought to stimulate the visual creation of 88 students. The initiative was held within the 14th edition of Rota das Letras - Macau Literary Festival.
André Letria's illustrations have been filled in books and newspapers since 1992. In 2010, the illustrator founded the Pato Logic Publisher, through which he created books such as “Sea” (Mention of Fiction in Bologna Ragazzi Awards), “If I were a book” (translated into over 20 languages) or “War” (winner of more than 20 premiums). He was invited to integrate juries to international illustration awards such as Illustrartra, Iberoamerica illustrates, 3 × 3, Aoi World Illustration Award, Bolognaragazzi CrossMedia Award. André Letria has also traveled around the world to talk about his work as an illustrator and editor.
This time, Macau came to present his craft to the students of the Luso-Chinese Secondary School of Luis Gonzaga Gomes. It began by presenting your work and what can be the creation of illustration. “I started by showing things I have published from the perspective of visual creation, not just making dolls that serve as decoration of texts, but from a significant creation perspective and substance,” he said later in statements to the end.
In particular, André Letria showed his latest book, “How to Create a Library”, released late last year in conjunction with Inês Fonseca Santos.
Then André Letria challenged young people to complete with an illustration a story started by themselves. "Nowadays, when it takes an increasingly accurate visual literacy to understand the images and realize their ability to produce meaning, it seemed to me that it could be interesting," the illustrator commented, adding that the idea ended well, given the "enthusiasm and the amount of things varied and surprising they eventually produced."
André Letria has experience in this type of exercise with children and young people. He made similar initiatives in Portugal and other parts of the world, and felt differences in the results achieved yesterday by the children of Macau: "Here it seemed to me that there was a greater opening, I saw things happen very quickly, with a lot of imagination and in a very immediate way, that may be in other places would not happen."
"Here I felt a great freedom," he said, noting that "the differences in the education system and mentality are noted in this kind of very fast challenges to produce something creative and there are sites where more barriers, more shame." Letria recalled that, in other sites, with "educations more facing immediate success or problem solving," young people "question the meaning of that."
But André Letria argues that, like what happens with poetry - the central theme of this edition of the Literary Festival - in the illustration "we are not waiting for explanations for the world or instruction for life; we are waiting for anything that encourages us to create our own world." "The conclusion we remove is that things need no answer," he said.
André Letria speaks today to a university audience at Macao Polytechnic University: “I will make a more serious presentation and related to my route and about my publisher, logical duck”. On Saturday, at 15h, the illustrator will participate in a session in the old municipal slaughterhouse, entitled "Draw Words, Write Images", to which the session "If I were a book" will follow in the same space.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Net Welfare Regime Assets for civil servants reach 37.6 billion</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/03/20/activos-liquidos-do-regime-de-previdencia-para-funcionarios-publicos-atingem-376-mil-milhoes/</link><description>The Macao Public Service Workers' Welfare regime has closed last year's exercise with net assets set at 37.6 billion patacas, which is available for benefit payment.
The amount reflects an increase of 5.76 billion patacas compared to the registered in 2023, the year in which 31.83 billion of patacas were raised. That is, an increase of 18%.
The calculation was released in the demonstration of the annual movements of the public service workers' social security regime, published yesterday by the pension fund in official bulletin.
Last year, among the revenues of contributions, 820.7 million Patacas came from the accounts of individual civil servants' contributions, 1.64 billion patacas came from the accounts of MSAR contributions. Investment renovations and contribution application plans totaled 40.97 billion of patacas.
The demonstration also reveals a variation in the number of taxpayers. Last year, there were 660 new registrations and 580 canceled their registration, making the total number of taxpayers until the end of last year was 24,035 people.
It is recalled that the said pension scheme came into force on January 1, 2007, being a retirement guarantees plan provided by the government to public services workers, based on the defined contribution system.
Public services workers and the government make contributions to previously set rates monthly. The Pensions Fund applies to the respective contributions to the application plans provided by the regime, depending on the taxpayer's willingness. In this case, retirement guarantees are allowed to taxpayers through the accumulation of contributions and income from the respective applications.

The first quarter was the most expressive, representing almost half of the total number of the year. On the other hand, the number of passenger complaints decreased about 12%.
 
The amount of fines paid by taxi drivers who committed offenses increased by 47% in 2024 compared to the same period. In December last year, the total amount ascended at 233,700 patacas, while the accumulated amount in 2023 was 159 thousand patacas.
According to the data available on the Electronic Service Directorate Page for Traffic Affairs (DSAT), also the number of cases of fines payments rose from the 106 accounted for in 2023 for the 138 registered last year. It is clarified, in the documents provided by the authority, that the number of cases and the amounts marked therein “correspond to confirmed infringements” of regulations and legal regimes related to light passenger transport cars, “where taxi drivers have already paid the fines”.
Over the past two years, the first quarters - marked by a period of greater movement on the MSAR roads, due to Chinese New Year celebrations - were those in which more cases of payments for infringement and, consequently, the amount paid by taxi drivers were recorded. In the period between January and March 2024, there were 64 instances in which drivers committed irregularities and paid fines, which ascended at a total amount of 124,500 patacas. The second and third quarters registered an equal number of fines - 21, each - whose total amount was slightly higher between April and June (31,500 patacas) than between July and September (30,600 patacas). In the last quarter, the fines rose again to 32, as well as the amount paid, which added 47,100 patacas.
On the other hand, the number of complaints filed by the citizens to DSAT by 2024 decreased about 12% in homologous terms, with a decrease from 1,252 to 1,107. The largest number of complaints made to the body focused on the attitude of drivers (832 complaints), followed by criticism of taxi equipment (8 complaints) and a category regarding “other” situations (143 complaints). All of these aspects were less expressive than in the year 2023, except for the category of “suggestions”: passengers submitted 124 suggestions to DSAT in 2024, in contrast to the 66 communicated in the year 2023. Last year was, in fact, the one that accounted for more suggestions made by the passengers since at least 2020 - year to which the first data made available on the page DSAT.
It is recalled that, according to traffic data released by the Public Security Police (CPSP) body, in January 2025 187 taxi drivers were recorded, which reveals an increase of 206.56% compared to the 61 irregularities recorded in the same month of 2024. 870 in 2024.

The executive guaranteed further support to the deepened cooperation zone in Hengqin, from various domains such as policies, legislation and resources. In response to an interpellation of Deputy Lei Chan U, the government reiterated the hope of accelerating integration between Macao and Hengqin.
 
The government admits that the upcoming governance works will attribute greater importance to the development of hengqin, framing the Hengqin project “at a higher level of the priority works delineated” in the lines of government action.
The guarantee arose in a response from Study and Regional Development Services and Policies (DSEPDR) to a written interpellation of Deputy Lei Chan U. The body reiterated “persistence in the new strategic position” that connects Macau and Hengqin. It stated that this is how the government recently decided to create a “leadership group to promote the construction of the in -depth cooperation zone between Guangdong and Macao in Hengqin”, in order to reinforce the coordination of the different areas of Mountain.
Through the new working group, the government also expects to increase support for the construction of the in -depth cooperation zone, "namely in terms of policies, legislation, funds and human resources guarantee, in order to proceed to institutional innovation and the articulation of the rules," he said.
According to Cheong Chok Man, DSEPDR's director, a set of “emblematic works and projects” that will function as a driving force to boost the implementation of a united space around “common policies, ordinary life, common factors and common services” will also be launched in the future. The work will help, said the body, to accelerate the construction of a new conjuncture of integration between Macao and Hengqin in terms of regimes, systems and policies, in order to achieve “more fruitful results” for the development of hengqin.
The authorities, in response, remembered that the central government's decision to develop Hengqin aims to boost the economic diversification of the territory, providing greater convenience of life and employment to the population of Macao. The government has ensured that it has given great importance to the development of Mountain Island and is committed to integrating the conjuncture of national development.
It is recalled that Deputy Lei Chan U interpelled the authorities about the guiding lines and the objectives of the present mandate of the government, being aware of the calendar of the elaboration of the five-year plan of Macao socioeconomic development.
This year will finish the five -year Macao and the government will start planning the third. DSEPDR said it had performed periodic evaluation work on the implementation of the 2nd five -year plan and will have the respective overall balance this year. "The Government of MSar will address the study of the elaboration of the five-year third plan, taking into account the new trends, the new tasks and the new demands that emerged as a result of the new conjuncture of development," he said. The body also assured that the plan will be formulated in accordance with the reality of Macao, in favor and for the benefit of local development in the long run.</description><pubDate>2025-03-20 04:57:05</pubDate></item><item><title>Seoul on maximum security alert before a decision on president</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/03/20/seul-em-alerta-maximo-de-seguranca-antes-de-decisao-sobre-presidente/</link><description>South Korea police will activate the highest level of alertness and mobilize all agents on the day of the Constitutional Court's decision on the formal dismissal of President Yoon Suk - YEOL.
 
South Korean authorities announced the plan yesterday, in an effort to avoid mass protests and possible attacks on important facilities, including the court, in the midst of the current climate of political tension in the country.
The plan includes the mobilization of 14,000 Shock Police in Seoul, representing 60% of the available disorder control forces in the country, according to the Yonhap Public News Agency. The exact date of the hearing has not yet been released, but it is expected to happen before the end of March.
The Constitutional Court concluded at the end of February the analysis of Yoon's dismissal process, due to the imposition of the statement of martial law on December 3.
Personal safety units, detectives and special forces will be mobilized around the court, and antiDronist equipment will also be mobilized to prevent illegal flights on the area, which was declared air exclusion zone last week.
Authorities have warned that any attempted invasion of the court will result in immediate arrests.
There are fears about a possible repetition of incidents of 19 January, when Yoon supporters broke into Seoul's Western District Court to protest the decision to prolong the president's detention.
During the clashes, attacks on police officers and journalists were reported, as well as damage to facilities.
On Saturday, thousands of South Koreans filled the streets of downtown Seoul in major demonstrations in favor and against Yoon, without incidents.
Yoon's powers were suspended after the National Assembly, controlled by the opposition, was dismissed on December 14, 11 days after the martial law imposed.
Yoon argued that the martial decree was necessary to overcome the “anti-state” liberal opposition, which, he said, improperly used the legislative majority to block his agenda.
Despite the blocks of hundreds of strongly armed military, the deputies gathered a quorum and voted unanimously to lift the martial law hours after Yoon declared it. The Constitution limits the exercise of such powers to times of war or comparable national emergencies.
Yoon's legal saga, which also includes a criminal accusation separated by rebellion, stirred state matters, diplomacy and the economy and became a test of resistance to the country's democracy. If the Constitutional Court dismisses Yoon, this will trigger an early presidential election within two months.

According to the body, the use of mobile phones and electronic devices during classes and intervals should be limited.
 
From next school year, secondary schools in Macau will have guidance to regulate the use of students' mobile phones in the campus, issued by the Directorate of Youth Education and Development Services (DSEDJ). The guidelines, which will also cover the use of other electronic devices, will specify the occasions and periods of time when students can use these devices.
"The use of mobile phones and electronic devices by students should be limited during classes and intervals, except in specific educational activities under the guidance of teachers or other special circumstances, such as emergency contacts," said Leong I on, head of the DSEDJ Secondary Education Division, in statements made yesterday to the Macao Macao Forum Program of the Radio Macao channel.
The DSEDJ thus aims to issue schools to manage mobile phone use to schools among young people, so that “students learn their use at certain heights and places”.
According to Leong I on, authorities also provide school assistance measures in the implementation of guidelines, including support to schools in the acquisition of centralized mobile management equipment for the placement of appliances, for example, in furniture.
The official understands that the use of electronic devices in the campus is common, with students to use us to research information and do group work, however, hoping to improve young people's literacy compared to the internet.
"Ciberalfabetization involves the ability to use the internet and values. Especially with the development of artificial intelligence, it is believed that the activities of young people on the internet will be increasingly frequent and will be part of their lives, but should use the internet correctly," he said.
In turn, Cheang Sek Kit, head of the DSEDJ Curriculum Development and Evaluation Division, recalled data from an international report to indicate that the use of computer products for students for one in two hours is adequate and satisfies their needs.
In this context, DSEDJ had previously provided schools guidelines on the use of computer equipment and guidelines on the teaching and learning of the internet, serving as a reference during the pedagogical work. "Allows students to use the internet properly for an average of one hour a day and take a break after using electronic products for 20 minutes," he explained. Cheang Sek Kit added that international investigations also show that the use of information products by students in a suitable time contributes to improving their performance in mathematics and creative thinking.
The executive stressed that the training of teachers in the field of internet literacy had been included in teachers development programs and, in addition, DSEDJ is working with different departments to launch awareness work, hoping to educate young people for a safe and healthy use of the Internet.
The Sheng Kung Hui Community Service Association, which was also on the radio program, warned of emotional impact on young people with increasing internet use. The organization carried out an inquiry into the internet literacy in 2022 and found that the longer the young people spent on the internet, the worse was their mental state.
"They always paid attention to their own messages on social networks, which easily affected their emotions and caused anxiety," he said. The association also drew attention to the growing trend to the internet dependence at a younger age, having received younger cases of seeking help involving children aged 6 to 8 years.</description><pubDate>2025-03-20 04:59:05</pubDate></item><item><title>Bank of Japan maintains unchanged rates in a context of economic uncertainty</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/03/20/banco-do-japao-mantem-taxas-inalteradas-num-contexto-de-incerteza-economica/</link><description>The Bank of Japan (Boj) decided yesterday to maintain interest rates unchanged, in line with expectations and despite the persistence of inflation, pointing to the uncertainties about the world economy.
 
At the end of a two -day meeting, the institution chose to maintain the reference rate by 0.5%after increasing it in January.
Boj is adopting a cautious stance, underlining the potential consequences of the trade war triggered by US President Donald Trump. The US directly aimed at Japanese steel exports. "With regard to the risks for our perspectives, there are still great uncertainties about economic activity in Japan, including the evolution of the commercial situation (…) and raw material prices," the Boj said in a statement.
Already last week, the governor of Boj, Kazuo Ueda, expressed concern about "the uncertainty surrounding the evolution of economy and prices abroad."
The maintenance of the status quo in monetary policy was widely anticipated by markets.
After an increase of 0.25 percentage points in January, “Boj intends to evaluate the impact of his recent changes in monetary policy on the economy before making the next decision,” said Stefan Angrick of Moody’s Analytics before the announcement. "At the same time, the position of customs measures and Washington's threats maintained the financial markets under pressure, giving Boj even more reasons to stand still," he added.
In addition, in a precarious and volatile global economic and commercial environment, it is likely that central banks from the United Kingdom and the United States also choose to maintain the status quo this week.
To counteract the return of inflation in Japan after two and a half years, Boj began to squeeze the rates in March 2024, after ten years of ultra-compliant monetary policy at which rates remained virtually zero.
Boj increased rates twice last year and again in January. In the opinion of analysts, the institution is expected to increase rates later this year. "This bank tightening cycle is still far from ending ... There is a strong probability of a rate climb at the May meeting," said Marcel Thieliant of the capital Economics. "After all, inflation is well above the 2% goal set by Boj (…) and spring wage negotiations have resulted in even higher wage increases than last year, which should lead to new rising pressure on inflation in the coming months," he explained.
Consumer prices in Japan, excluding fresh products, increased 3.2% in January, in annual terms, the highest value since a year and a half and far above the goal of 2%, in a context of rising cereal and energy prices.

Hong Kong government leader John Lee has ensured that the vote will "select a new generation of legislators who are patriotic, capable and responsible." The elections will be held on December 7th.
The chief executive also stressed that he asked the office of constitutional matters and the continent, responsible for relations with Beijing, to work with the Electoral Commission.
John Lee said the two agencies will “work closely (…) to make proper planning and elaborate contingency plans in areas such as advertising, recruitment and formation of electoral personnel”.
The current members of the Legislative Council (Legco), with 90 seats, end the four -year term later this year.
Since the last electoral reform in 2021, Legco does not have any representation of the opposition. This is because the current regulation prohibits the participation of candidates who are not considered patriotic.
All candidates must undergo a loyalty assessment and support at least 10 of the 1,500 members of the electoral committee, which also directly appoints 40 legislators.
Legco's structure states that only 20 seats will be elected by direct suffrage by Hong Kong citizens, less 15 than before electoral reform. The other 30 are filled by representatives of functional groups, mainly linked to specific industries, crafts or professions.
The Hong Kong electoral committee currently has 90 seats, which will be filled in a new vote scheduled for September 7.
Almost 8,600 voters were registered in this body, which includes companies, professionals and delegates from the Legislative Body of the mainland China. According to 2024 data, published by Hong Kong Free Press.
In March 2021, Beijing enacted legislation designed to ensure that only patriots govern the Special Chinese Administrative Region. Action resulted in a significant reduction in democratic representation, rigorous control over electoral processes, and the constitution of a pro-peak assessment panel in charge of selecting candidates.
The Hong Kong government argued that the reform was going to ensure the city's stability and prosperity. Most opposition politicians were arrested, left the city or withdrew from political life since Beijing imposed a national security law in June 2020, in response to old mass protests the previous year.

On March 21st and 22nd, Macau will be the scene of the circus show “Entrelating Peace”, produced by the Swedish company Cirkus Cirkör. Combining stunts, live music and a deep message about the search for unity and understanding in challenging times, the work invites the public to reflect on their own journeys and the importance of human connection. In an interview with the final point, two of the artists left their impressions about Macau and the circus art.
 
“Intelace Peace,” an innovative work by the Swedish Company of Contemporary Cirkus Cirkör circus, arrives in Macau to intrigue the public in the large auditorium of the Cultural Center, through a message of unity and humanism. The event is a collaboration between the Macao Cultural Institute and the famous company, known for its unique style that combines circus art with strong social messages. In an interview with the final point, the cast stressed the expectation that “intertwining peace” can lead viewers to a deep reflection on the human condition and incessant pursuit of unity and peace in times of uncertainty and division.
The work, which took 11 weeks to be created, focuses on the complexity of human experiences, questioning what each individual really wants to achieve throughout life. Alexander Weibel Weibel, one of the artists who make up the cast, from Spain, expressed the essence of the show: "We are all looking for a purpose. What do you want to achieve in life? How can you make the world a better place?" These questions emerge naturally during the presentation, we explained Weibel, and establish an intrinsic dialogue between the artists and the audience. The essence of the spectacle is promoted through the art of the circus, but, above all, in the interrelationship between viewers and performances. He pointed out that there are differences in each region where they pass with the show. “Before Macao, we were in Japan where people are more discreet, generating an environment on stage completely different from other regions that bring more reactions from the public,” Weibel described.
Aino Ihanainen, Finnish artist who besides being acrobat also created part of the scenario, shared his view of a central element of the narrative, the handcut, which symbolizes human interactions. While holding one of her small characters, she says she developed an almost maternal affection, Aino explained: “The knitting acts as a powerful metaphor for the way people live and interact. Some follow a straight path, while others complicate their lives with intricate plots.” This symbolism is essential to understand the multifaceted reality of relations between people, reflecting the continuous struggle between the simplicity and the complexity of life.
The show goes far beyond the mere display of acrobatic skills. Combining live music, dancing and a scenario that is transforming, “intertwining peace” creates a visual and sensory experience. Weibel, who uses his talent in equilibrium during performance, highlights the importance of fusion of elements in the show: "Music and acrobatics intertwine, creating an environment where the public can feel emotions through each movement." Artists not only perform acts of physical dexterity, but also turn the stage into a space where art and live music intertwine, providing an immersive and intimate experience.
Tricot strands that make up scenography are not only like elements for acrobatic acts, but also play a key role in creating the visual and emotional environment of the scenario. The stage becomes a kind of tapestry between sound, space and movement, with knitting pieces that fall apart to the small touch or serve as climbing walls.
Along with the presentations, the company intends to hold a series of workshops, which start today and will allow the public to explore the techniques and philosophy that underlies the work.
Tickets to “intertwine peace” are available on Enjoy Macao and Ticket Network platforms, with prices ranging from 200 to 500 Patacas, including discount options. With a duration of approximately 1h30, and without break, the show is directed to an audience over 13 years.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>China wants to work with France to "prevent the world from returning to the jungle law"</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/03/20/china-quer-trabalhar-com-franca-para-evitar-que-mundo-regresse-a-lei-da-selva/</link><description>Chinese diplomacy chief said yesterday expect China and France to “work together to prevent the world from returning to the jungle law” in a conversation with the diplomatic counselor of the French presidency Emmanuel Bonne. Quoted by Chinese Official News Agency Xinhua, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi stressed that the global situation is in a state of “growing uncertainty and instability” and appealed to France and China to “reinforce their strategic partnership, jointly protect genuine multilateralism and oppose unipolar hegemony”.
During the telephone conversation, Emmanuel Bonne said he hoped China play “an important role in obtaining a fair, solid and sustainable peace agreement” in Ukraine, a conflict in which Beijing has kept an ambiguous position over the years. Wang Yi said his country "has always defended the resolution of the" crisis "through dialogue" and greeted "all efforts that lead to a ceasefire, a necessary step towards peace," according to a statement issued by the Chinese Foreign Ministry, the same day that US president Donald Trump and Russian homologist Vladimir Putin, agreed to start the process of peace with the peace process. Ukraine, with a partial ceasefire, centered on infrastructure and energy.
The Chinese diplomat also urged China and the European Union to resolve commercial and economic friction through dialogue after months of disputes between the two parts on issues such as Chinese electric vehicles. "France is opposed to commercial and tariff wars and is willing to work with China to properly resolve economic and commercial frictions through dialogue," said Bonne.</description><pubDate>2025-03-20 04:57:08</pubDate></item><item><title>Beijing greets efforts for a ceasefire after calling between Trump and Putin</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/03/20/pequim-sauda-esforcos-para-um-cessar-fogo-apos-chamada-entre-trump-e-putin/</link><description>China greeted yesterday “all efforts” to reach a ceasefire in Ukraine a day after US President Donald Trump contacted his Russian homologist Vladimir Putin. "Since the beginning of the crisis, China has defended the resolution of conflict through dialogue and negotiations. We support all efforts to reach a ceasefire, as we believe this is a necessary step in peace," said the spokeswoman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, Mao Ning, when asked about the conversation between US and Russia leaders.
As for reports on the alleged involvement of Chinese companies in extractive activities in Ukrainian territory occupied by Russia, Mao Ning said "he was not aware of the specific details mentioned." "However, China's position on the Ukraine crisis has always been consistent and clear. The four points proposed by the [Chinese] President Xi Jinping remain our fundamental orientation line to address the issue," he added.
The White House and Kremlin reported on Tuesday about the call between Trump and Putin, in which the Russian leader temporarily agreed to suspend the attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructures while Washington and Moscow exploit technical negotiations for a sea cease in the Black Sea and eventually permanent peace.
Ukrainian President Volodymir Zelensky said "Putin rejected in practice the proposal of a global ceasefire" and denounced Russian's continuous attacks on Ukraine.
Since the beginning of the invasion, China has defended respect for the “sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries”, in reference to Ukraine, while appealing to the “legitimate concerns from all parts”, in reference to Russia.
Beijing opposed unilateral sanctions against Moscow and called for a peace process that respects the balance between European security and global stability. In this context, China has maintained a close relationship with Russia, with an increase in bilateral trade and a diplomatic stance that has been criticized by the West, which accuses Beijing of providing key pieces to the Russian military industry, something the Chinese government denies.
On Sunday, will take place in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, a new round of conversations led by the US, with the presence of Russian and American delegations, while Ukraine is expected to decide his participation in the coming days.</description><pubDate>2025-03-20 04:57:07</pubDate></item><item><title>Malaysia guarantees that she will watch 15 Palestinians deported by Israel</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/03/20/malasia-garante-que-vai-vigiar-15-palestinianos-deportados-por-israel/</link><description>The Malaysian government has declared yesterday that it will closely follow the activities of the 15 Palestinians released from Israeli arrests and deported to Malaysia under the ceasefire agreement reached with Hamas in mid-January. The indication of the Malaysian authorities comes the next day that Israel has broken the truce with the restoration of attacks on the Gaza Strip, which, in the last 48 hours, caused more than 970 dead, according to a balance released yesterday by the Ministry of Health of the Palestinian Enclave, controlled by the Hamas Extremist Group since 2007.
Since the beginning of the conflict, in October 2023, 49,547 people have been killed in the Gaza Strip, according to the ministry, quoted by the French agency AFP. In Kuala Lumpur, Government spokesman Datuk Fahmi Fadzil stressed that Malaysian security authorities will always be aware of the everybody of the 15 Palestinians, namely will monitor their “movements and location”, and will also regulate their “activities” in the country. On Tuesday, Malaysian Foreign Minister Mohamed Hassan announced that Malaysia was ready to receive 15 of the 380 Palestinians sentenced to feature and released-along with dozens of other prisoners with lighter penalties-under the truce agreement signed between Israel and Hamas. The government spokesman said that about 100 of the long-term prisoners released by Israel will be housed in Qatar and others in Türkiye. Israel demanded that prisoners considered more dangerous for their security to be deported from the Palestinian territory.
The war broke out in Gaza after an unprecedented attack by the Palestinian Islamite group Hamas on Israeli soil on 7 October 2023, which caused about 1,200 dead and more than two hundred hostages. After the Hamas attack, Israel triggered a large -scale offensive in the Gaza Strip, which caused more than 49,000 killed, and a humanitarian disaster, destabilizing the entire Middle East region. In mid-January, the parties reached an agreement on a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, accompanied by the release of 33 hostages in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli prisons.</description><pubDate>2025-03-20 05:00:33</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
