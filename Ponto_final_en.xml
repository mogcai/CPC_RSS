The statement was made in response to a written interpellation presented by Deputy Ron Lam, who warned of the aggravation of the mice pest in Macau after “successive cases” in eating establishments.
 
The Institute for Municipal Affairs (AMI) ensures that the control of rodents in public spaces in Macau is at a “acceptable” level and that the number of complaints reduced 36% compared to 2019.
Data follows the following of a written interpellation of Deputy Ron Lam, where he expressed concern about the “successive cases of mice rats in Macao's restaurants and supermarkets” in recent months. In response, the chairman of the Board of Administration for Municipal Affairs, Chao Wai Ieng, ensures that AMI has made efforts to promote urban environmental hygiene and “actively reinforced rodent elimination work”, namely through the placement of bait and traps in public spaces.
According to the data presented in the response document, the number of waste containers on public roads “lowered from about 1600” to current 92, thus reducing the unhealthiness conducive to pests and rodents. Regarding the deratization work, AMI reports that the number of traps in public spaces rose to about 1400, compared to the approximately 200 that existed in 2017. The traps are periodically collected and analyzed by “specific personnel”, in order to “understand the trend of rodents in various neighborhoods and take the measures due to their prevention and control”.
In parallel, throughout 2024 27,000 boxes with baits were placed through the territory of Macau, divided into 25 zones with specific needs (flower flower beds, green areas, sewage mouths, among others). In each of these zones, “an intensive elimination work lasts five weeks is performed,” the AMI adds.
Since 2019, the evaluation of the work has been the responsibility of an “academic institution in the interior of China”, which investigates the amount of rodents in the public spaces of MSAR according to national criteria. To proceed to this count, traces of the movement of rats are observed, such as “waste, holes, bites, living or dead rats, etc.”, in various zones ranging from markets and parks to public roads near housing buildings.
AMI reiterates that the results of investigations in recent years position Macao at a “acceptable” level as to the proliferation of rats. The number of complaints has also been decreased, from 1,113 complaints registered in 2019 to 711 in 2024 (ie a decrease of 36%). Since deratization is a “long -term work”, largely facilitated by prevention, AMI concludes by appealing to the “active collaboration of the entire population of Macao” in the prevention and control of pests, “for the improvement of environmental hygiene”.
Ron Lam's written interplies had been published on January 9, days after three commercial surfaces of the Royal supermarket chain suspended operation due to rodent infestations. Shortly after this incident, another similar case was detected in a restaurant in the San Kio neighborhood. The deputy recalled that, at the time, AMI found that the "prevention and control measures of these rodents were insufficient" and that "prevention equipment was not adequately installed in the food treatment zone." In addition, many restaurants and market stalls said they have verified the worsening of this type of pest in Macau, just leaving the windows open to the establishment "becoming a nest of rats."
In the interpealing, Deputy Ron Lam questioned the AMI about the “concrete measures” that the institution proposed for prevention in affected areas (especially the North Zone) and the “concrete results” that had already been obtained. He also requested the disclosure of detailed information about the number and location of the rodents.

The parliamentarian took the opportunity to ask for more and better shelters for stops throughout the territory.
 
Ella Lei presented yesterday a written interpellation to the government in which she questions the organization of careers and bus routes in zone A of new landfills. The deputy linked to the Federation of Macao Workers' Associations (Faom) recalls that soon residents will begin to move often to that zone.
At the interpetement, Ella Lei recalled that last year, the number of bus trips ascended to about 230 million, more than in 2019, for example. In addition, "with the increase in the number of tourists, it is expected that bus services and public transport will continue to face challenges in the future, with many passengers reflecting that it is still difficult to travel by bus, especially during the end hours."
According to data from the Directorate of Services for Traffic Affairs (DSAT), in July last year, there were a total of 439 bus stops in Macao, with 348 of them interiors, have shelters or housed by nearby commercial houses. DSAT is studying the feasibility of building 15 more shelters in stops. On the other hand, the authorities also carried out renewal works of 75 bus stop shelters, however, “some residents consider that the seats of new bus shelters are shorter, which makes their use inconvenient for the elderly and people with disabilities,” said the deputy at interpellation.
Thus, "it is suggested that the government will continue to reinforce construction work and optimize the conception of bus shelters" and, at the same time, "Administration must highlight staff to reinforce the guidance and assistance to passengers in large pawns flow, and to disseminate to passengers the traffic habits of Macao and knowledge about the safe crossing of the road."
Regarding the provisions in zone A of the new landfills, the government had already indicated that there will be a bus parking center and four public transport interfaces, and the stops will be placed with a 300 meter spacing. Soon, it is recalled, the public housing that is being built in that area should be available and residents can move there.
Ella Lei says, then, that once the construction works are still underway and most of the area is still under construction, with traffic deviations that occur from time to time, “authorities should proceed to a close planning and construction of relevant routes and storage stops, etc., in order to provide a better travel environment to residents”. “What is the government's planning for bus and shelter routes? How many lines of buses will be available and is there any calendar for the construction of the interfaces? ”, He questioned.</description><pubDate>2025-03-11 01:58:05</pubDate></item><item><title>Average life expectancy in China increases to 79 years in 2024</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/03/11/esperanca-media-de-vida-na-china-aumenta-para-79-anos-em-2024/</link><description>The average life expectancy in China reached 79, after increasing 0.4 years in 2024, according to data from the National Health Commission released yesterday.
The “healthy lifestyle of the Chinese people and the implementation of a series of strategies” by the authorities had a “direct effect on the improvement of health” of the Asian country, explained the director of the National Health Commission, Haichao Law, at a press conference, on the sidelines of the annual session of the National Popular Assembly, the country's maximum legislative agency.
Law detailed that the average life expectancy in 2024 was one year and seven months higher than in 2019, which represents a “very positive pace of improvement” in five years.
The official also highlighted the “diminishing” in life expectancy between the different regions of the country, which said it was symptomatic of “an improvement in equality [in access] to health”.
Law stated that life expectancy currently exceeds 80 years in cities such as Beijing and Shanghai (east) and coastal provinces such as Jiangsu (east), Shandong (east), Zhejiang (East), Guangzhou (Southeast) and Hainan (south).
In recent decades, China has recorded gains in many health indicators, such as life expectancy and child mortality, although data tends to be different between the prosperous coastal cities and the country's east and eastern areas.
China registered population declines in 2022, 2023 and 2024, the first contractions since 1961, when the number of inhabitants decreased as a result of the failure of the great leap industrialization policy in front and the hunger followed.
It is estimated that by 2035 about 400 million people over 60 live in the Asian country, which will represent more than 30% of China's population, with the consequent negative impact on the country's workforce and economy.</description><pubDate>2025-03-11 02:02:07</pubDate></item><item><title>Registered three cases of collective influenza infection in schools</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/03/11/registados-tres-casos-de-infeccao-colectiva-por-gripe-em-escolas/</link><description>Health services reported three cases of collective flu infection in schools in Macau, encompassing a total of 18 students.

According to the broker's accounts, the daily game revenues of the casinos were 638 million patacas during this period. In February, the daily average revenue of casinos was 644 million.
These numbers are justified by the “strong number of visitors during the Golden Week of the Lunar New Year”, in which Macau received 1.31 million visitors-reaching 95% of pre-covid levels, according to the Tourism Services (STD).
Analysts JP Morgan project that gross game revenues are stable in March, reaching approximately 19 billion patacas, which, to confirm, will cause the first quarter of this year to remain stable compared to the same period of 2024. However, JP Morgan expects gross game revenues to grow 5% in the second half of this year, resulting in a “modest growth” of 3% for the general year.
In February, the casinos operating in Macao had total gross revenues of 19.7 billion patacas, which means a growth of 6.8% compared to the 18.4 billion reached in the same month last year. Cumulatively, between January and February this year, casinos got gross revenues of 38 billion patacas. For all this year, the government expects the game industry to reach 240 billion patacas in revenues, which makes the expected monthly average of 20 billion. In 2024, gross game revenues rose to 226.7 billion patacas.</description><pubDate>2025-03-11 01:55:10</pubDate></item><item><title>Cold front will lower the temperatures again</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/03/11/frente-fria-vai-voltar-a-baixar-as-temperaturas/</link><description>The alternation between the cold and the heat that has been registered in early March will continue at least more this week. According to the Meteorological and Geophysical Services (SMG), due to the influence of a maritime air stream and a Northeast monsoon, it is expected that the weather conditions of alternation between cold and heat will be returned and that the time in the region is humid.
It is expected that, from tonight, Macau gradually becomes influenced by a maritime air stream. Relative humidity will rise again and, with weak wind, it is likely to occur fog and rain in the coastal regions of Guangdong, so visibility will be low.
According to the SMG, a cold front will reach the coast of Guangdong next weekend, predicting that it can bring thunder and thunderstorms into the province. However, "the occurrence of this year's first thunderstorm in Macau depends on the intensity and position of the cold front upon arrival," explains the authorities, adding that, "regardless of the possibility of thunderstorms in Macao, sweeteners are expected to increase." Therefore, "it appeals to the population to continue to pay attention to the latest meteorological predictions."
After the cold front of this weekend, another Northeast monsoon will affect Macao, and with the increase in the north quadrant wind, the temperature will come down again. Thus, it is expected that next week the time in the region will be scheduled for meteorological changes of alternation between cold and heat. In addition, given the occurrence of fog, the visibility will be low.
Until this Saturday, the maximum temperatures will remain between 23 and 26 degrees Celsius, but Sunday's giving birth to temperatures to the 14 minimum and 20 maximum, according to SMG.</description><pubDate>2025-03-11 02:02:03</pubDate></item><item><title>CCPPC approves political resolution that reaffirms 'a country, two systems'</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/03/11/ccppc-aprova-resolucao-politica-que-reafirma-um-pais-dois-sistemas/</link><description>The Chinese people's Political Advisory Conference (CCPPC) approved a political resolution that again demands the persistence of the 'a country, two systems' principle, as well as 'Macau ruled by its people' and a high degree of autonomy.

The workshop was conducted by Macao artist Tsang Tseng Tseng, expert in the traditional Chinese landscape painting. In her introductory lecture, the doctoral student at the Chinese Academy of Art presented and analyzed some of the works of Wu Li (baptized as Simon-Xavier a Cunha), painter of the Qing dynasty with historical connections to Macao.
During the workshop, the artist took as references some works by Wu Li to demonstrate certain techniques and artistic characteristics intrinsic to the work of the Chinese master. This is an example of the willow in the work "Spring Comes To the Lake" or the use of the traditional technique "Ox-Hair Ts'un", used to improve the texture of rocks in the work "Singing Qin in the Pine Valley".

Shim Woo-Jung's statement arises following rumors that the prosecution would be withdrawn and the case closed, after the prosecutor decided not to appeal the court's decision to release the leader. "I followed the principles of due process of law after having collected various opinions of the investigation team and others," Shim told reporters, justifying the decision not to appeal.
Shim considered that the decision does not justify dismissal-as they ask for opposition forces-and said it will respond "in accordance" if the South Korean parliament takes steps to dismiss it.
Yoon Suk-Youol was arrested in mid-January on charges of insurrection for declaring martial law in December.
Following the decree, which lasted only a few hours, was deprived by the National Assembly, but remains in office while the Constitutional Court evaluates the legality of the deposition.
After almost two months detained, Yoon was released on Saturday after a court of Seoul decided that the detention exceeded the legal period and that the accusation was presented after detention.
The attorney general declared yesterday that he respects the court's decision, taking into account the authority he has to decide on these issues, but stressed that he disagrees with the calculation used in the decision and ordered the accusation team to refute this point during the ongoing criminal proceedings.
The rebellion is the only accusation against which a South Korean president does not enjoy immunity.</description><pubDate>2025-03-11 02:02:12</pubDate></item><item><title>New pairing session offers more than a hundred job offers</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/03/11/nova-sessao-de-emparelhamento-disponibiliza-mais-de-uma-centena-de-ofertas-de-emprego/</link><description>The Directorate of Services for Labor Affairs (DSAL) and the Directorate of Economics and Technological Development Services (DSEDT) will collaborate in organizing a employment pair -up session on March 29, which will provide more than a hundred vacancies in various certified technological companies.

The warning arises after a 71 -year -old male patient was admitted to treatment at the Early Saint Januario Hospital Emergency Service on February 27. Yesterday, March 10, the patient was still hospitalized.
Health authorities recall that legionnaires' disease is not transmitted through contact with people or the intake of food and beverage. Legionella bacteria lives in natural aquatic environments and, occasionally, in artificial aquatic systems, proliferating in favorable circumstances such as warm waters or moist places. Infection occurs by inhalation of aerosols contaminated with the bacteria.
With the aim of reducing the risk of contraction of the disease, health services appeal to citizens to adopt measures agreement with current disease prevention and control guidelines, which are an example of “reinforcement of immunity”, the use of “properly conceived water supply systems” and the “periodic maintenance of water filters at home or water supply equipment”.
The incubation period of the bacteria is 5 to 6 days after infection and may extend to 14 days. Symptoms are similar to those of a flu and may include headache, cough, fever, fatigue, lack of art, muscle pain, diarrhea and abdominal pain. The diagnosis is made by identifying symptoms and performing laboratory tests.
The risk of developing complications increases in men, elderly, smokers, alcoholic individuals, people with weak immunity or steroid treatment. The disease can be treated with antibiotic drugs, some of the most serious complications being respiratory failure, pulmonary abscesses or even death.</description><pubDate>2025-03-11 02:02:04</pubDate></item><item><title>Deputy warns of pressure from medical students in access to the work market</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/03/11/deputado-alerta-para-pressao-dos-alunos-de-medicina-no-acesso-ao-mercado-laboral/</link><description>Chan Iek Lap, deputy and doctor, says that the government has not done enough work to evaluate the demand for qualified staff in the local employment market, a problem that will cause pressure in terms of searching for future medical graduates. The president of the Macao Medical and Health Federation also criticized the government's suggestion for these students to change their professional path to the 'Big Health' industry.
 
The government warned of any difficulty for future medical graduates to enter the job market and appealed to dedicate themselves to the Big Health industry. Deputy Chan Iek Lap has not been optimistic about the change of the professional path by students in medicine, still criticizing the government's predictions about human resources in different areas of society.
"The executive has data on the significant increase in the number of medical students in recent years, but has not been able to make the policy -in -law adjustments, which reflects the insufficiency of talent reserve predictions and search market demand studies," said the doctor, in statements to the newspaper or Mun.
It is recalled that, according to health services, Macau will have more than 600 health graduates per year by 2027, of which 150 will be licensed in medicine each year, whose number may exceed the search for local medical services. In this sense, licensees in medicine should feel pressure on access to employment.
Chan Iek Lap, president of the Macao Medical and Health Federation, argues that the government should start promoting professional career planning for students since general secondary education, rather than in the last year of senior secondary education, to provide them with information about professional development.
"The government should also disclose, in comply, data related to the demand for students qualified to students through secondary schools, to help them make reasonable choices in their academic and professional planning," he said. The deputy is at the same time concerned about the lack of local professionals in the area of ​​cyber security. The government, it is recalled, has encouraged local students in recent years to continue their studies in this area.
 
Expectation and reality
 
Regarding the government's government's appeal to move to the Big Health sector, Chan Iek Lap said there will be “difficulties and many challenges” for this professional path change, although the industry has the potential to develop.
"If a doctor, who has no professional training in engineering, change to start selling medical devices, how can one stand out from the competition?" He asked. The legislator also pointed out that 'Big Health' posts may not be able to meet students' salary expectations. In addition, he pointed out that there will be difficulties for a medical student to return to his position as a doctor, to abandon the profession and to have contact with clinical experience for a few years.
Chan Iek Lap, in this case, expects students in medicine to continue to practice a doctor upon completion of the course and, if there are no local jobs, can consider working outside the territory, such as Hengqin or Zhuhai, as an alternative. Regarding students who are still attending the medical school, Chan Iek Lap suggested that they participate in clinical stages in hospitals in Macau or neighboring regions, in order to accumulate experience in diagnosis and treatment, increasing their professional competitiveness.</description><pubDate>2025-03-11 01:57:06</pubDate></item><item><title>North Korea shoots “several unidentified ballistic missiles”</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/03/11/coreia-do-norte-dispara-varios-misseis-balisticos-nao-identificados/</link><description>North Korea yesterday fired "several unidentified ballistic missiles," the South Korean army said, the day Seoul and Washington began the annual military exercises "Freedom Shield."
 
"Our military detected several unidentified ballistic missiles fired from Hwanghae province towards the Western sea around 1:50 pm," said the staff, using the Korean designation to the Yellow Sea.
The launches were made hours after the South Korea and the United States armed forces began annual military exercises, which runs until March 20 and that North Korea considers an essay for an invasion of the country.
In a statement, the North Korean government classified maneuvers with a “dangerous act of provocation” that increases the risks of a military conflict.
South Korea and the United States began the exercises yesterday, but interrupted the royal fire training while Seoul investigates bombing by mistake of a civil area during an exercise last week.
About 30 people were injured, two of which are gravity when two South Korean fighters KF-16 fired eight MK-82 bombs against a Pococheon civilian, a city near the North Korean border.
In a presentation to South Korean journalists, the country's Air Force yesterday confirmed the initial assessment that one of the KF-16 pilots had introduced the wrong coordinates for the bombing site.
The pilot, who was not identified, did not recognize the error during a verification before taking flight and, hurrying to comply with the scheduled time, could not visually check the target before continuing with bombing.
The second pilot had the correct coordinates, but only focused on maintaining training with other aircraft, launching the bombs and following the instructions of the first pilot, according to the presentation made to journalists and to which the US Associated Press news agency had access.
South Korean Air Force Chief of Staff General Lee Youngsu today apologized for the injured and material damage caused by the incident, which "should never have happened and should not happen again."
Military authorities have stated that real fire training will be resumed after the ongoing investigation is completed.

In a report, the International Institute for the Stockholm Peace Research (Sipri) stated that there was a 64% drop in China deliveries between 2020-24 compared to the previous five years.
The change was driven by China's domestic weapon industry growth, with designed and locally produced systems replacing equipment that was previously bought mainly to Russia - a trend that will probably continue, the report said.
Siemon Wezeman, researcher at Sipri's Arms Transfer Program, said it took 30 years for China to progressively replace high -tech weapons imported by locally developed technologies.
"In the last five years, the main things China still mattered from Russia were basically two: helicopters and engines - which are extremely difficult to produce if there is no experience on the subject - and that's when China stood out," he said. “China currently manufactures its own engines for combat aircraft, transport aircraft and ships. The same is true of helicopters, in which China has developed its own totally Chinese helicopters and is gradually eliminating imports of helicopters from Russia and also European models, ”said Wezeman, in the report.
The decrease in Chinese imports contributed to a 21% overall reduction in the set of arms remittances to the countries of Asia and Oceania. The region's quota part in world imports of weapons also decreased from 41% in 2015-19 to 33%.
East Asia, in particular, has seen imports of weapons decrease 22%, not only due to the fall in demand from mainland China, but also thanks to reductions in Taiwan and South Korea purchases of 27%and 24%, respectively.
Japan was the only country in the region to increase the amount of weaponry imported, registering a 93%increase, according to the SIPRI report.
China has also left the top 10 of Arms importers for the first time since 1990-94, while four countries in the Asia and Oceania region-India, Pakistan, Japan and Australia-have entered the list of the world's largest weapon receivers. The trend reflects the growing concerns between some of the neighboring countries in the face of China's rise.
In eastern Asia and the southern Pacific, Beijing has adopted a more assertive stance, which resulted in successive picardies with neighboring countries, including Japan, Philippines or Vietnam, and has caused the apprehension of Australia and New Zealand, as Beijing widens its influence on the region's small island nations.
With regard to weapons exports, SIPRI stated that 44 states received Chinese weapons between 2020 and 2024, most of whom in Asia and Oceania, which represented a 77%quota, followed by Africa, who received 14%. However, 63% of the weapons exported by China had a single client, Pakistan.
Chinese weapon suppliers have become even more dominant in Islamabade acquisitions and purchases, representing 81% of weapons received between 2020 and 2024, compared to 74% in the previous five years.
Although China was the fourth largest weapon exporter, a 5.4% decrease in its weapons remittances compared to 2015-19, as well as a drop in its global weapon sales, from 6.2% to 5.9%.
Despite China's efforts to increase weapon exports, the report said that many of the major importers are not buying Chinese weapons systems for political reasons.
