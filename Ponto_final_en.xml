In the Hong Kong stock exchange, it was BYD itself, which had recently reached historical maximums, which led the falls, falling 8.08%. Its component branch, the BYD Electronic, fell 4.01%.
Other important companies such as Geely (-7.98%), Dongfeng (-6.37%), LI Auto (-5.73%) and BAIC (-2.46%) have also registered losses, as well as Xiaomi (-2.26%), which does not have electric vehicles as the main line of business but is betting on these products, having presented its second model last week.
On the continent, China's largest car builder, state Saic (-2.01%), and other reference brands such as Changan (-2.73%) and Great Wall (-5.52%), registered falls simultaneously.
Descents appear after BYD has announced discounts on 22 purely electric models and plug-in hybrids by the end of June: for example, the cheapest of its range, the Seagul utility car will see its price reduced by 20% to 55,800 yuan (6,793 euros). The largest cut will be that of the seal seal seal, whose price will fall 34%, to about 102,800 yuan (12,514 euros).
"Although some of these discounts were already being implemented in April, the official announcement sends a powerful sign about how difficult the final market is," explain the analysts of Morgan Stanley, cited by Bloomberg.
BYD is trying to reduce the inventory, focusing on getting rid of older models that do not include new assisted driving systems that will be incorporated for free into their new vehicles, something that is putting additional pressure on dealers.
One of the main groups of Chinese dealers, Zhongsheng Holding, was also dragged yesterday, falling 2.54%.
In recent months, both local and international brands-for example, Tesla or joint venture between Chinese GAC and Japanese Toyota-also announced interest-free payment plans, reducing entry fees or price reduction of some of their models.
CPCA employer secretary general, Cui Dongshu, predicted a few months ago that the price war between car builders in China would continue this year, in a context of “extremely fierce” competition, although it has also stressed that sales could increase thanks to the “replacement plan” of antique products by new government subsidized.

He was completely crazy!” Trump wrote on Sunday on his social network, Truth Social, making use of the usual uppercase letters. "I have always said that he wants all of Ukraine, not only part of it, and perhaps it is revealing true, but if he does, it will lead to the fall of Russia!" He added.
According to the Ukraine Air Force, the country was hit at dawn on Sunday by an attack of 367 projectiles, including 69 missiles and 298 drones, after other massive attacks the night before. The Ukrainian authorities recorded 13 dead. "[Putin] is unnecessarily killing many people, and I'm not just talking about soldiers. Missiles and drones are being fired at Ukrainian cities for no reason," Trump said. The US leader also criticized Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for "doing no favor of his country when talking about how he speaks." "Everything that comes out of your mouth creates problems. I don't like it and it's better than stop," he warned. Volodymyr Zelensky asked on Sunday to put pressure on Russia to force her to cease the attacks.
The leader stated that "the silence of the United States and other countries only encourages Putin." Since mid-February, Washington has made repeated calls to a ceasefire and has approached Moscow for this purpose, without concrete results to date. Trump met a week ago with the Russian homologist for almost two hours. At the time, he was positive, and deleted any additional pressure on Moscow.</description><pubDate>2025-05-27 03:02:51</pubDate></item><item><title>Timor-Leste introduces Wolbachia method to decrease dengue and chikungunya</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/05/27/timor-leste-introduz-metodo-wolbachia-para-diminuir-dengue-e-chikungunya/</link><description>The Timor-Leste Ministry of Health announced yesterday that it will introduce from July in Dili mosquitoes with the Wolbachia bacteria, with the aim of reducing cases of dengue and chikungunya in the country.
The Wolbachia method foresees the release of mosquitoes contaminated with the Woldbachia bacteria, which will reproduce with local mosquitoes, creating a population of insects with that bacteria, which reduces the transmission of dengue, chikungunya and zika.

According to the official, the release of mosquitoes with Wolbachia will not be done at once, but in a phased way.
Upon completion of the process, monitoring will be made to evaluate the success of the implementation, explained Filomeno Pinto.
The official also said that in Dili the mosquitoes with Wolbachia will be released in four administrative posts, namely Dom Aleixo, Vera Cruz, Nain Feto and Cristo Rei, covering a total of 24 juices.

ASEAN, whose presidency is currently assumed by Malaysia, holds two annual head of heads. The Member States of ASEAN arrived at an agreement of principle in November 2022 to integrate Timor-Leste in the regional organization, becoming the country to have the status of observer and being able to attend all meetings, including in the summits.
The presidency and the Timorese government had pointed out the year 2025 for the fulfillment of full adhesion.

According to preliminary estimates from the Ministry of Health, work and welfare of Japan, only 721,000 children were born in 2024 the lowest number that there has been registered since statistical studies in the country began 75 years ago, when a “baby boom” was registered with a record number of 2.69 million births.
Today these "babies" are 75 years old and Japan, which is experiencing an endemic birth crisis, warns experts, will reach a critical mass from this year, which describe as the "problem of 2025".
"Problem 2025" is the name given by experts such as Takao Komine of the Japan International Policy Studies (IEPI), the multifaceted - economic, social and even international crisis - that Japan will begin to face this year when Baby Boomers enter "old age".
It will be the beginning of a domino effect that will begin in the elderly homes and progressively affect Social Security, assistance programs and, ultimately, the national economy, and which comes as the country's prime minister Shigeru Ishiba warned earlier this week that the financial situation of Japan "is worse than Greece."
According to an inquiry carried out in 2021 by the National Institute of Studies of the Population, eight out of ten couples consider that the cost of children's education is the main obstacle to having more than one child. The second most prominent reason is the lack of space.
Six out of ten respondents also consider it extremely difficult to reconcile professional and family life and long working hours discourage couples.
There are now 200 euros subsidies per month per child up to 18 and parents will be able to apply for children under three years old even if they are not working, but the battle horse is teleworking.
From April this year, a series of measures designed to transform the work regime will gradually enter into force: companies will be required to allow workers with preschool children three years or more to choose from at least two work-style options, such as teleworking, working hours reduction or working hours, and allowing workers with children under three years to work from home.
Nursing care services to the elderly will be the first to feel the effects of the “problem 2025”. From this year, according to the IEPI report, “it is almost certain that there will be a sudden increase” of the number of people who need these care. Social Security is already the main underlying factor to Japan's budget deficit.
A third problem is geographic. "Problem 2025 is a crisis in large urban areas," such as Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya, "where the increase of the elderly population will feel more strongly," says the report.
Japan is running out of time to solve the problem of falling birth rate, according to researchers who estimate that the country will have lost 30% of its population by 2070.
Professor Yamaguchi Shintaro of the University of Tokyo applauded the measures adopted by the government, but considers that they are insufficient. "Women spend five times more time on housework and children's care than men," the professor told Japanese state station NHK. "If men got more involved in the care of children, as in Western countries, we would be closer to the solution," he added.

In response to a written interpellation of Deputy Ho Iong Sang, the body advances that it has sought to improve the victims support network, as well as reinforce the advice and monitoring of aggressors.
 
The Institute of Social Action (IAS) organized a basic training course on the treatment of cases suspected of domestic violence against children, bringing together about 600 professionals such as police agents, doctors, teachers and social workers. The information was released by IAS President Hon Wai, in response to a written interpellation of Deputy Ho Iong Sang.
The course was streamlined following the launch of the magazine version of the “Procedures Guide for the Treatment of Cases Suspected Domestic Violence against Children”, available on the IAS Electronic page in Chinese, English and Portuguese languages. It is recalled that the body had already issued a similar but more widespread guide on the treatment of cases of domestic violence in the region, which later evolved into a document specifically centered on monitoring minor victims.
The new guide was prepared in the first half of last year, and was submitted to consulting the opinion of public services and social work institutions over the second half. In the final product, published in March this year on the IAS page, it is read that action strategies are divided into three different levels: primary prevention, where sensitization activities are promoted between the general population; Secondary prevention, in which crisis situations are identified and families with greater risk of “provoking incidents”; and tertiary prevention, where front line workers intervene in seizures and seek to safeguard the physical and psychological security of minors.
The offensive acts perpetrated against children are divided into four categories, which may occur simultaneously: physical damage, sexual abuse, psychic offensive and inadequate care. Risk assessment is determined through varied criteria, extending from observable physical damage such as bruising and lacerations to behavioral signs, of which is an example to iracilibility, anxiety or self-mutilation.
Although the treatment of cases suspected of domestic violence is “a continuous and arduous mission”, IAS expresses the intention that the guide will provide “clearer and more concrete guidelines” and speed up “collaborative processes between different entities” in the joint responsibility to ensure the well-being of Macao children.
 
IAS guarantees “zero tolerance”
 
The interpellation of Ho Iong Sang also presented two additional questions on the subject of domestic violence, related to the need to reinforce prevention work and the victim support network.
Regarding the second point of the deputy's intervention, IAS guarantees that they have “resorting to different channels” to publicize messages of “zero tolerance to domestic violence”, installing the victims to ask for support as soon as possible and to familiarize themselves with the different forms of self-protection.
In this regard, the body advances to have moved six “zone cooperation networks” and encouraged more than 40 social service institutions to organize lectures and activities for the dissemination of the Domestic Violence Prevention and Fighting Law. Awareness actions even extended to tourism and leisure companies, with the initiative “Promotional Ambassadors Friendly Buddies”.
Regarding interdepartmental collaboration, by the way, IAS underlines that it has maintained “close collaboration” with various bodies - such as the Public Prosecution Service, the Directorate of Justice Services (DSAJ), the Directorate of Services for Laboral Affairs (DSAL) or the Directorate of Youth Education and Development Services (DSEDJ) - on the measures of protection of victims and the monitoring of aggressors.
With regard to the victim support network, IAS states that interdepportional collaboration maintained with the institutions already mentioned ensures that vulnerable people have access to measures such as economic or judiciary support, temporary shelter and protection, support for school or employment, free health care and individual or family counseling.
"In the future, the Government of MSar will continue to promote the work of prevention and the treatment of domestic violence and to collaborate with all residents of Macao in the creation of a positive and interaction atmosphere for the construction of a harmonious society," says the president of IAS.
According to official statistics last year, 133 processes of domestic violence were preliminarily established. After investigation, only 12 were considered crimes of domestic violence.

Li arrived in the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta, on Saturday afternoon, for a three -day visit to the largest economy in Southeast Asia. This was the first stop of his first visit abroad this year.
Indonesia and China are members of the 20 (G20) group, which brings together the main developed and emerging economies, and the BRICS Group. Li traveled with 60 Chinese entrepreneurs to participate in the Indonesian business reception on Saturday night.
In his statements, he stressed that the Chinese economy has fired rapidly this year, despite the growing external challenges. "The current international situation is an impasse," Li said, at the event that was also attended by a subiator. "Unilateralism and protectionism are increasing, and intimidation behavior is growing," he said.
Li said that this year is the 70th anniversary of the creation of the Movement of Non -Aligned, started by Asian and African countries in the Indonesian city of Bandung, at a time when the world was in a historic crossroads.
Bandung's spirit of solidarity, friendship and cooperation played a key role in unity and cooperation between the global southern countries, he said. "More than seven decades later, the world is once again in an important crossroads," he noted.
Li has appealed to all countries to look for ordinary terrain and solve differences through dialogue and peaceful coexistence.
Subiano expressed gratitude to the Chinese government and the Chinese companies that participated in the Indonesian economy, "created jobs, transferred technology and generated confidence among all companies."
The leader also invited Chinese entrepreneurs to invest more in Indonesia. Bilateral trade exceeded $ 147.8 billion (about 130 billion euros) last year, increasing a growth of 6.1%.
Li pointed out that China has been, nine consecutive years, for Indonesia's largest commercial partner. The International Cooperation Program “Track and Route”, launched by Beijing, has recorded “substantial progress” in the country, including the construction of nickel castings and the first high -speed Asian high -speed rail connection.
Indonesia aims to play a more relevant role in providing nickel and other raw materials to Chinese electric automobile manufacturers, a rapidly growing sector.
On Sunday, Subiato received Li at a ceremony at the Merdeka Palace in Jakarta, before both of them are at the closed door for a bilateral meeting. "The current international situation goes through a huge disturbance, and the peaceful development faces numerous uncertain and unstable factors," Li said in the opening speech.
Subiato underlined the close historical relationship between Indonesia and China, stating that the two countries live an important moment in bilateral relations. "I reiterate our commitment to reinforce our global strategic partnership with the people and the government of China," he said. "We believe this will bring benefits not only to both countries, but also for the entire Asian region," he said.

“The charm of the serpent: chasing dreams” is the name of the exhibition that opens today, at 5:30 pm, at the Rui Cunha Foundation, and which has 30 works of art by the authorship of autism and other intellectual difficulties. The show ends on June 7th.
This is an initiative promoted annually by the Association for Macao Intellectual Development Services (Asdim) and which aims to “make known the imagination and creativity of the work done by young people with autism and diverse intellectual difficulties”.
Here will be presented the work of members of the schools and associated centers, which this edition resulted in a total of 30 works of art, created by the students of Kai Chi School, the Kai Chi initial training center, the Kai Lung Vocational Center, the Kai Hono Center and the “Sam Meng Chi” snack.

Official Journal China Daily reported that the state administration for market regulation (SAMR) authorized last week the operation, which has among the buyers the private asset manager and the Tencent technology giant.
The business “highlights continuous consolidation in China's commercial real estate market, with the main technological and financial companies increasingly aware of opportunities in the sector,” said the newspaper, in the context of the prolonged real estate crisis of the country and the weak demand.
These 48 shopping centers are located in various cities of the country, including Beijing and Canton (Southeast).
So far, SAMR has not confirmed the value of the operation, but the securities Times cites “market sources” that claim that the value is 50 billion yuan.
The presence of PAG in the group of buyers marks a new chapter in its relationship with Dalian Wanda, which last year formalized an agreement to sell 60% of its business centers management subsidiary to an investor group led by the asset manager for about 60 billion Yuan.
The Chinese group closed this agreement at the end of 2023 to avoid an immediate reimbursement of 30 billion Yuan (3.6 billion euros) plus interest through the subsidiary IPO, Zhuhai Wanda, as repurchase of the participation that investors had already purchased.
Wanda, focused on the real estate sector, had already tried the deal in 2021 and 2022. On this last occasion, the plans fell over the ground under the scrutiny of Chinese regulators.
Analysts had already warned that if the subsidiary would not become public, Wanda would face a “serious liquidity pressure”, which led the conglomerate to start a campaign to sell assets and fundraising, as well as to request postponements in the reimbursement of obligations.

The secretary for social affairs and culture reiterated the importance attributed to youth development and promised to create opportunities for young people to participate in international affairs.
 
LAM, secretary for social affairs and culture, reiterated support for Macao's young people in relation to participation in international exchanges, asking, however, that young people assume the responsibility of “telling the history of China and Macau well” abroad.
"The government has been attributing great importance to the development of young people and is committed to creating more opportunities for them to contact international affairs and improve their global qualities," he said.
LAM spoke on Sunday during the awards ceremony of the 5th Diplomatic Discourse Contest for Higher Education Institutions of Macao, where he stressed that the government has worked to deepen the patriotic spirit of young people and their understanding of the country's diplomatic policies.
"In the future, the government will deepen its cooperation with the RPC Ministry of Foreign Ministry, to promote youth diplomacy projects, encouraging young people to contact the outside world so that they can acquire knowledge and improve their skills in international exchange," he admitted.
In this case, the secretary stressed that Macao has a special position as a connection from China to the outside world, as well as the meeting of western and eastern cultures, which left Macao's young people an “honorable mission” of “telling the story of China and publicizing the voice of Macao”.
Pointing out that Macau is opening into the world with an inclusive attitude, Lam said young people are the main driving force of social progress and therefore should promote the good narrative of China and Mand.
At the same time, the ruler again mentioned the instructions of Chinese President Xi Jinping given to Macau during her visit to the territory last year, in which the central government leader stressed the need for Macau to respond to national development strategies and play a more important role on the international stage. "Be more open and tolerant, join forces and attract talent from around the world, looking to be a window for the exchange between Chinese and Western civilizations," warned Lam.
The ruler added that young places are showing enthusiasm and commitment to international issues, stressing that she has felt "proud" by young people and is "full of confidence" in Macao young people.
In turn, Liu Xianfa, Commissioner of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China, said he hoped that young people from Macao will serve national construction by cultivating a “strong sense of nationalism” and participating in the country's diplomatic practice. The representative also encouraged the new local generation to have an innovative and reform spirit, dedicating himself mainly in the area of ​​technological innovation.
Liu Xianfa also stated that the body will take advantage of his diplomatic capabilities to help Mandate widen his external cooperation and accelerate his diverse development.</description><pubDate>2025-05-27 03:05:50</pubDate></item><item><title>Guam Governor Visit Taiwan</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/05/27/governadora-de-guam-visita-taiwan/</link><description>Taipé receives this week Lourdes A. Leon Guerrero, the governor of Guam, the American territory of the Pacific who would be a key actor in any Chinese military action against Taiwan. Leon Guerrero has been making his first trip to the island since taking office in 2019.
Military strategies usually include guam in their war games due to the large amount of troops and equipment from the United States that houses.
Although Taiwan and the United States do not have military treaties or even diplomatic ties, Washington is expected to respond to any attack and use Guam as a stopping point for many of these operations.
The island welcomes about 9,700 members of all the main branches of the US Armed Forces.
Guam is located east of the Philippines, about 4,750 kilometers from mainland China, which places it within the reach of Chinese ballistic missiles, including those fired from submarines.
Previous crises involving China and the US about Taiwan caused small panic in Guam, with many people wondered if the island would become a target for Chinese missiles.
Guam has been an important advanced military post since World War II, dominated by the Andersen Air Force base and its many peripheral facilities. There is also a strong naval and sea presence, with about 30% of the land of territory occupied by US military facilities.
Guerrero arrived in Taiwan on Sunday and is expected to stay until Saturday. According to Taiwan's authorities, Guerrero is expected to meet with the territory leader, William Lai, and the head of Foreign Affairs portfolio, Lin Chia-Lung, as well as visiting the Ministry of Transport and Communications and meeting with various local chamber presidents. According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, tourism, health care and fishing will also be part of your schedule.
Guam residents are US citizens, although they cannot vote in the presidential elections.

The presence of internationally recognized artists, such as Julio Pomar, an icon of Modernism, and Grace Morais, whose work combines tradition and innovation is highlighted.
Júlio Pomar, a giant of modern art in Portugal, is well known for his ability to combine elements of expressionism, cubism and surrealism in works that dialogue with social and political issues, which at the same time reflect Portuguese history and culture, always with a strong burden of social criticism and reflection.

In a publication on its official social networking account, the China State Ministry of Security wrote that foreign spies may be hidden in view of all, using various identities to carry out activities that threaten the country's national security.
The ministry highlighted five false identities usually used by foreign spies: tourists who do not tourism, academics who do not conduct real investigation, businessmen who do not do business, and “insincere lovers” who exploit relationships to collect information.
Some agents may approach Chinese students abroad and pretend to be "foreign friends who share the same interests," and then try to recruit them through love relationships, the ministry warned. "Don't be fooled by a sweet conversation and never reveal to them sensitive or confidential information," he warned.
The ministry also urged the public to alert national security authorities about any suspicious people or activities.
In recent years, China has intensified counter -espionage work, with the State Ministry of Security to publish a series of messages on social networks to sensitize the public for possible threats in seemingly normal contexts.
In Sunday's publication, the ministry warned of academics to “approach suddenly and overly warmly” and for foreign friends and online contacts who are “excessively anxious and attentive” in search of romantic relationships.
Foreign spies can infiltrate universities and research institutes by going through academics interested in exchanges and collaboration, read in the statement.
They can also use financial incentives or promises of academic or personal favors to extract sensitive information and fundamental technologies from China, he said. It is strictly forbidden to bring confidential material to academic events abroad, he added.
Citizens should also be careful with occasional foreign tourists and family visitors who show interest in natural landscapes and geography near military or sensitive areas, or who wanders, photograph or try to use high precision cartographic equipment in these zones.
People should also be aware of those who try to induce local residents to conduct illegal surveys and recognition on site on their own.
The Revised China counter -espionage Law, which entered into force in 2023, extended the definition of espionage acts and reinforced the investigative powers of the National Security Law application agencies.
Under these stricter rules, the ministry announced in March that an former engineer of a Chinese investigation institute was sentenced to the death penalty for selling material to foreign espionage agencies.

Alvis Lo recalled that, in parallel to relief work, the team also participated in several coordination meetings with local health services and representatives of the World Health Organization (WHO) in Myanmar, where opinions and cooperation plans for epidemiological prevention in the areas affected by the disaster were exchanged.

A week after winning the 21st championship, secured on the 38th and last round of I issue 2024/25 with a 2-0 triumph over Vitória de Guimarães, to finish two points ahead of Benfica, the 'Leonino' set was back to the 'eagles', now in direct confrontation.
The 'lions' have not achieved such a feat since the beginning of the 21st century, more precisely since 2001/02, when they won the championship, five points ahead of Boavista, and the Portuguese Cup, with a 1-0 triumph against Leixões, by Carlos Carvalhal, led by László Bölöni. If Romanian did all the solo work, Rui Borges has, in his side, to share the 'double' by three, as it was Ruben Amorim who started, in the I League with 11 wins, and João Pereira was also in games of both competitions.
As for the big 'stars', on the pitch, of these two exploits, separated for 23 years, they have their own names, in Brazilian Mário Jardel, author of 42 goals in the 2001/02 Championship, and Swedish Viktor Gyökeres, with 39 in 2024/25.
At the National Stadium, after the Turkish Kökcü gave an advantage on the 47th minute, the Swedish Gyökeres, in the last play of regulatory time, of a penalty, redid the equality at 90+11, and Harder consumed the turnaround at 99.
With justice, as it was the most compact team in regular time, Benfica was second to win the cup, but Renato Sanches and Leandro Barreiro eventually ruined the afternoon for the emblem of Luz. Sanches made a penalty about Gyökeres, in a play that should have just been 'killed' by Barreiro.
Sporting, which clearly arrived at Jamor of 'hangover' due to excesses at two -time championship festivities during the week, took advantage and eventually controlled extension to a completely demoralized Benfica.
Coach Rui Borges ended up not surprising in the initial eleven of the 'lions', with Captain Hjulmand in return and St. Juste in place of the injured Diomande, while Bruno Lage launched unexpectedly Dahl and Bruma, leaving Di Maria again on the bench.
Sporting even came in better, but from the 15th minute the game began to be the incarnate, which practically didn't let the new champions come out of their midfield, forcing the mistake and the wrong passes. In one of these moves, Debast lost the ball in a forbidden zone and only a great defense from Rui Silva to the post prevented Pavlidis's goal, at the first sign of danger in the game.
There was a very dangerous new bid from the Greek striker, who this time failed the target, and Bruma, who still made any of the fans celebrate goal in Jamor. Just for this, and the full disappearance of the game's Sporting, Lage's team deserved to have gone to the break in advantage.
The second part practically started with the Kökcü goal, with the Turkish shifting and right out of the area, in a move where Sporting players became more concerned with contesting a foul on china. Shortly thereafter, throw practically the same, but this time Carreras even knocked down, before Bruma celebrated what would be Benfica's second.
As might be expected, the incarnates dropped the lines, always waiting to go out in quick attacks, while Sporting has more ball. However, the game ended up living several breaks, such as Benfica players to 'abuse' medical assistance, a situation that really had an impact on the 'lions' game.
Rui Borges's team was well running the ball, but found no solutions, with Gyökeres. Already after Belotti, who had surrendered Pavlidis, had been close to the second goal, Trincão had a tie, but fired very weak against Samuel Soares, in the one who seemed to have the determining bid of the final.
Everything seemed pointed to an incarnate triumph, with Barreiro equally close to 2-0, but the luxembourg and then Renato Sanches "completely blurred the painting".
In the last bid of regulatory time, Trincão drew from midfield, initially was pulled by Barreiro, but the midfielder gave up the play and Sporting came to the draw.
Already with the ball in Gyökeres, the Swedish exceeded António Silva and, when he entered the area, suffered a lack of Renato Sanches. As always, the Scandinavian was lethal of penalty and everything followed for extension.
Samuel Soares still prevented Gyökeres 'bis' with a great save, but Sporting even reached the second goal, with Harder to appear loose in the area and the right head after the center of Trincão.
The turnaround was consummated and now it had to be Benfica to try equality, something that was never close to happening. Lage also launched Di Maria and it was the Argentine who ended up bothering Rui Silva, twice, but always without giving much work to the Leonino guardian.
Already with the game completely broken, Harder started on the left, gave Gyökeres, ending the Swedish, at the entrance of the area, for watching Trincão to the goal that ended any questions in the club that would raise the Portuguese Cup 2024/25.

Still, last year, there was a slight decrease in environmental noise compared to 2023.
 
Last year, a slight drop in environmental noise levels was registered compared to 2023, show the data from the annual report published on the website of the Directorate of Environmental Protection Services (DSPA) and analyzed by the end point.
DSPA has six environmental noise monitoring stations - Avenida de Horta e Costa, Cidade de Braga Street, Correia da Silva Street, Ecological Zones, Seac Pai Van and Areia Preta - and the average values ​​registered last year was 65.78 decibels (DB (A)). In 2023, the average of the six monitoring stations was 66.41 dB (A). Over the past few years, significant fluctuations have not been registered in these values. In 2022, the average was 65.25 dB (A) and in the previous year of 65.63 dB (A).
In the 24 -hour calculation, the Avenida de Horta and Costa monitoring station was the noisiest last year, with a total rate of 71.7 dB (A), less 0.3 dB (A) than in 2023. Of the six stations, the least noisy was the black sand, with 61.6 dB (A). This has also been the trend over the last few years.
In the report, DSPA says that the slight decrease in the noise of Avenida de Horta e Costa, which is “affected mainly by road traffic”, was mainly due to the increase in the number of electric vehicles and the decrease in economic activities. On the other hand, due to “the completion of the foundations of a adjacent construction shipyard”, noise levels at the city of Braga Street also decreased.
On the contrary, noise in ecological zones increased due to the “entry into operation of integrated entertainment facilities” and the beginning of the regular operation of the light meter, among other factors, explains DSPA in this report.
Each of the noise monitoring stations has 24 -hour microphones, noise analyzers, climate monitoring equipment, modems and an environmental software management platform. In the report, DSPA emphasizes that, “to ensure the accuracy of environmental noise monitoring data and the stability of the appliances”, it has been “constantly perfected and optimized and environmental noise monitoring stations”.
In addition, the body highlights that an efficient quality warranty and control system has been established for noise monitoring equipment, through which noise monitoring and regular maintenance monitoring stations in calibration centers that meet the necessary qualification requirements, and monitoring the daily automatic calibration of equipment, among others.</description><pubDate>2025-05-27 03:04:50</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
