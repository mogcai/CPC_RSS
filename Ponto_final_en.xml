Tai Kin IP, secretary for the economy and finance, reiterated that the executive wants to increase macao international cooperation.
 
The government wants to attract more international organizations and regional economic and commercial institutions to Macao, pointed out yesterday Tai Kin IP, secretary for the economy and finance, at the plenary meeting of the Legislative Assembly (AL). In response to an oral interpellation of IP deputy Sio Kai, the ruler attributed “great importance to the reinforcement of international exchange and cooperation”.
The secretary stressed that "MSAR has well-developed infrastructures, a favorable social and business environment, as well as a narrow connection with China in many ways, having synergistic advantages of internal and external connectivity and sino-widen cultural integration." "These are determining factors for attracting international organizations and regional economic and commercial institutions to establish offices or delegations in Macao," he added.
Tai Kin IP has also ensured that if these international organizations want to settle in Macau, the executive "will proactively follow the process" and strive to create "favorable conditions to attract organizations or institutions that contribute to the construction of" a center, a platform, a base "to set themselves" in the region.
The secretary gave as an example the fact that the Monetary Authority of Macao (AMCM) dedicates himself to deepening financial cooperation with Portuguese-speaking countries, the large Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Bay and international markets, "creating adequate conditions for international financial institutions and even international organizations to settle in Macau."

Still, the secretary for the economy and finance did not detailed what plans are these. The theme dominated yesterday's debate at the Legislative Assembly, with several deputies requesting measures to protect these workers.
 
The executive will support workers who run out of job after the end of the satellite casinos, yesterday said Tai Kin IP. At yesterday's plenary meeting, the secretary for the economy and finance said the government "has already evaluated and prepared response plans."
"If workers are affected by changes in the operation of the satellite casinos, DSAL [Directorate of Services for Laboral Affairs] will follow up on the law, in order to ensure the legitimate rights and interests of workers, and will take initiative to seek to know the professional interests of affected resident workers, as well as provide adequate vocational training and relevant information," said Tai Kin IP.

Used by several deputies to give details of these contingency plans, Tai Kin IP said only that "the government has made a sufficient assessment that encompasses the situation of the functioning of the satellite casinos and surrounding stores as well as workers." "The government already has enough information and is well prepared," he added.
It is recalled that in 2022 the government revised the game law, determining the closure of the satellite casinos after a three-year transition period-which ends on December 31 this year. The government indicated that it required the dealers to which these satellite casinos are linked to all workers.

During the discussion, Ron Lam re-interrogated the government about what he considers to be an exaggerated proportion of non-resident workers (TNR) in the territory. About this, Tai Kin IP reiterated that the authorities' premise is to ensure that priority is given to workers residing in access to employment. According to data released yesterday by the secretary, by the end of March, there were 183,368 TNR, less 13.170 than at the end of December 2019.
Tai also said that by the end of March this year, resident workers who held positions of medium and high level management staff represented 90%, and this proportion could increase in the future.</description><pubDate>2025-05-14 00:38:32</pubDate></item><item><title>Beijing raises a ban on Chinese airlines to receive Boeing aircraft</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/05/14/pequim-levanta-proibicao-as-companhias-aereas-chinesas-de-receberem-avioes-da-boeing/</link><description>China raised a ban that prevented Chinese airlines a month ago from receiving Boeing planes. Thus, aircraft delivery manufactured in the United States can be resumed, according to Chinese sources in statements to Bloomberg agency on condition of anonymity.
 
China raised a ban that prevented Chinese airlines a month ago from receiving Boeing aircraft after commercial negotiations with the United States, which temporarily reduced the customs rights of each party.
Beijing authorities have begun to inform domestic carriers and government agencies this week that aircraft deliveries in the United States may be resumed, according to Chinese sources in statements to Bloomberg on anonymity, because the information is confidential.
Airlines were given freedom to organize deliveries in their own deadlines and conditions, one of the sources added.
The resumption of deliveries to China is an immediate boost for Boeing.
Defrosting occurs when the world's two largest economies agreed to a tariff truce, with the United States to reduce to 30%, for 90 days, its combined rates of 145% over most Chinese imports.
China has agreed to reduce its 125% customs duties over US products to 10% and to eliminate other counterfeit against the United States since April 2.
Still, the restoration of aircraft deliveries may be short -term if the tariff war is not resolved during the three months of suspension.
In this scenario, the American aeronautical giant based in Arlington, Virginia, will be able to see the price of its aircraft increase compared to its two main competitors, European Airbus and Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac), which seeks to gain land in the domestic market with state support.
Boeing was spared tariffs during the last episode of the trade war during the first presidency of Trump (2017-2021), but their sales to the Asian giant have been falling since 2019.
By 2022, it was expected that 25% of Boeing's international deliveries would go to China, but by 2023 the number dropped to 9%. On the other hand, experts believe that if the trade war is not stuck, the dispute will make US companies in all sectors higher prices for pieces and raw materials that buy to China, which means they will face the double challenge of relocating part of their production and losing competitiveness in the Chinese market.

The pact was well received by the financial markets and Nikkei, the main Tokyo scholarship index, rose more than 2% after the announcement of the agreement, which reduced fears of a global recession as a result of the trade war.
Japan, which has received US priority treatment in negotiations, has not yet reached an agreement with Washington and prepares for a third round of dialogue, which is expected to take place in May. Tokyo has been asking Washington to exempt from all tariffs that US President Donald Trump has been implemented since he returned to the White House, with a particular emphasis on 25% on vehicle imports, which account for about 30% of Japan exports to the United States. Washington, by his side, will have asked Japan to accept a larger quota of his cars and agricultural products. Hayashi defended yesterday the pace of negotiations: "It is natural that there are differences in agendas and the calendar of negotiations, since each country is in a different situation."</description><pubDate>2025-05-14 00:38:37</pubDate></item><item><title>Diversified program for “June, Portugal month” and visit by Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa postponed</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/05/14/programa-diversificado-para-o-junho-mes-de-portugal-e-visita-de-marcelo-rebelo-de-sousa-adiada/</link><description>The program prepared for “June, Portugal's month” in Macau was officially presented yesterday, bringing together a diverse program of about 30 events throughout the month of June.

That is, it has removed possible retaliatory measures against US concessionaires in Macao before tensions and deteriorated relations between the two countries, a situation previously alerted by the Fitch consulting agency. “The six game operators follow the Macao law. Since following the law, these operators develop their businesses, healthily, surely, they are certainly protected and supported by the government,” said Sam Hou Fai.
It is recalled that Xia Baolong had a meeting on Monday with the industrial and commercial sector, where she asked local entrepreneurs to "come together" to fight "the increase in unilateralism and commercial protection in the United States." "Hong Kong and Macao entrepreneurs have to be united and put themselves on the same side of the state. In this situation, there is no way out if we make appointments and concessions," said Tai Kin IP, secretary for the economy and finance, citing Xia's words.
The ruler spoke shortly before China and the United States announced an agreement on Monday, with effect from today, under which they will reduce mutual customs rights by 115 percentage points for 90 days.
 
Patriotic associations
 
In the present visit to Macao, the director of the Hong Kong and Macau affairs office, under the tutelage of the State Council, gave guidance on the reinforcement of patriotism, through the expansion of traditional local associations. According to the chief executive, Xia Baolong expects traditional patriots associations to “lead society” in development and “expand to unite society” in terms of influence rather than quantity.
Sam Hou Fai added that Xia Baolong told the government to take "adequate measures" for the upcoming legislative elections, which are scheduled for September this year, to ensure that the election "results in fair and equitable", while elevating patriotic legislators who love Macao.</description><pubDate>2025-05-14 00:39:33</pubDate></item><item><title>Economy gained 30 billion patacas in 2023 with non-game elements</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/05/14/economia-ganhou-30-mil-milhoes-de-patacas-em-2023-com-elementos-nao-jogo/</link><description>Tai Kin IP said yesterday that, according to the government's assessment, it was found that by 2023 a total production was generated by more than 30 billion patacas for the economy of Macao from non-game elements. The Secretary for the Economy and Finance responded to an oral interpellation of Ron Lam, which asked for details on the inspection of projects in non-game projects made by the concessionaires.
In the response, the ruler recalled that in 2022 the MSar celebrated new concession contracts for the exploitation of play in the territory with the six operators and, under these contracts, the concessionaires would have to implement these investment projects according to the award proposals presented in the public tender.
Tai Kin IP stressed that concession contracts provide for an inspection mechanism that the concessionaire is obliged to present to the government, in advance, the proposal for the execution of concrete projects referenced in the investment plan, which must include the concrete content of the investment project, the value of the investment and the term of its execution, for approval purposes.
The government coordinates with the competent services for continuous monitoring of the execution regarding the concrete project. For the purposes of changing a proposal for the execution of approved concrete projects, the concessionaire is obliged to submit the request to the Government of the MSAR, accompanied by a detailed report and proof documents, explained Tai.
Concession contracts also stipulate the obligation of each carrier to submit annually to the government a report on the execution of concrete projects, which must include the situation of the execution of concrete investment projects, the amount invested, the deadline and the results of their execution.
Finally, the secretary stressed that, with a view to making a more objective assessment, the Government conducts, through independent institutions, external audit, in compliance with the investment plan of each concessionaire.</description><pubDate>2025-05-14 00:38:29</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
