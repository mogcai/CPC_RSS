"We never provide lethal weapons to either party involved in the conflict and rigorously control the double-use civil and military articles. Ukraine knows it very well," the Ministry of Foreign Ministry spokesman Mao Ning said yesterday at a press conference. The spokesman added that China opposes “unfounded accusations” and “political manipulation” in response to the head of the Ukrainian external information service, Oleh Ivasshchenko, who told Ukrainian press on Monday that “Kiev can confirm that Beijing provides important materials and equipment to 20 Russian military factories”.
Last month, Ukraine had already accused China of providing direct military assistance to the Russian weaponry industry. According to Ivashchenko, your country has data that confirms that "China provides machines, special chemicals, gunpowder and components specific to the Russian defense industries." Since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, China has kept an ambiguous position on conflict, appealing to respect for the “territorial integrity of all countries,” including Ukraine, and attention to the “legitimate concerns of all” states in reference to Russia. Beijing opposed “unilateral” sanctions against Moscow and called for a “political solution” to the conflict.
The West accused China of supporting the Russian military campaign, which he has always denied, and to provide Russian leader Vladimir Putin, essential components for weapons production. European countries have also repeatedly appealed to Chinese leader Xi Jinping to use their influence on Putin to end conflict, although some argue that China has given priority to reinforce its relations with Russia, which has imported low -cost oil and gas.</description><pubDate>2025-05-28 06:45:59</pubDate></item><item><title>Telephone and cyber throws softened in the first quarter with a break of 12%</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/05/28/burlas-telefonicas-e-ciberneticas-abrandaram-no-primeiro-trimestre-com-uma-quebra-de-12/</link><description>The Judiciary Police admits a “slowdown” of the gown growth trend using telecommunications and cybernetic. In the first quarter of this year, a decrease of 12%was registered in annual terms in the number of cases of telephone and online scans. The body has revealed that it completed the expansion of the Coordination Center to combat the raising of crimes with the use of artificial intelligence technique.
 
The number of cases of circumstances using telecommunications and cyber burles saw a decrease of 12.1% in the first quarter of this year compared to the same period of 2024, from 288 cases to 253. The amount of damage recorded in the fraud also found a decrease of 28.4% in annual terms.
"With the continuous reinforcement of the work to combat circumvents in recent years, the growth tendency of telephone and online mockery shows signs of slowing down," the Judiciary Police (PJ) said.
I am Sio Keong, a PJ subdirector, also recalled that last year 1,260 cases of telecommunications and cybernetics were established, which involved a loss of approximately 232 million patacas, ie a decrease of 1.4% and 25.3%, respectively, compared to the previous year. "Reflects that the work to combat the circumvents has achieved results, particularly public awareness of fraud prevention has continually improved," he said.
However, the authorities have again appealed that citizens are on alert to the burlas, despite the "global growth of fraud cases to have been locked." Sou Sio Keong drew attention to the “continuous prevalence” of the schemes practiced through the theft of credit card data, online purchases, orders and investments.
"Criminals are constantly updating their methods of making fraud. Macau registered the first case of fraud using artificial intelligence this year and the schemes have become more complicated, technologically advanced and confused," said the responsible, noting that, in relation to the work of fighting the burlas, "there is still a lot to do."
The representative was yesterday at the ceremony of the entry into operation of the modernized Coordination Center to Combat PJs of the PJ, which completed the improvement works earlier this year and ended the experimental operation phase. The project had already been advanced in the government lines and provides for the installation of more advanced equipment to improve the effectiveness of investigating burla crimes and their awareness tasks.
According to the presentation of the PJ, the expansion of the structure of the Coordination Center for the fight against the combat to the combat to the application of technology and data systematization, and more advanced facilities have been introduced, such as a new data screen to monitor the tendency of territory crimes in real time. A zone of interactive experience “Deepfake Artificial Intelligence” was also created, showing how the technique works and is applied to the burles.
In the center was also created an independent support cabinet with a direct line to immediately treat requests for public assistance, thus increasing the efficiency in response to emergencies, "allowing the bank sector to send personnel to the place in severe cases to recover as much as possible," he added.
Sou Sio Keong said that a new phase of anti -fraud work will be promoted after this conclusion of the modernization of the Coordination Center to Combat Burks. Thus, PJ will establish a narrower connection mechanism with police authorities from neighboring cities, reinforce transfronist collaboration, work to intercept transfers transfers of fraudulent foundations and improve the exchange of information related to the prevention of burlas.
The PJ also revealed the plan for updating its Wechat anti -Burning mini -program and which is in preparations for the launch of the “Week of Bond Prevention Sensitization”. Since the launch of PJ's PJ anti-Burning Miniprogram in April last year, more than 67,000 uses have been registered by the public and more than 5,000 numbers of mobile phones or high-risk crossing sites have been identified.</description><pubDate>2025-05-28 06:49:58</pubDate></item><item><title>Tesla sales in Europe fall in April while Chinese manufacturers grow</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/05/28/vendas-da-tesla-na-europa-caem-em-abril-enquanto-fabricantes-chineses-crescem/</link><description>Tesla sales in the European Union fell to half in April, while the Chinese car builders recorded gains, according to figures published yesterday by manufacturers.
 
Tesla, harmed by the boss's reputation, Elon Musk, and an aged range, saw the European Union sales figures fall 52.6% in April and 46.1% in the year, according to the European Association of Automobile Manufacturers (ACEA).
Tesla's market share fell to 1.1% in the first four months of 2025, with 41,677 vehicles sold, compared to 77,314 in the same period last year.
Leader in Electric Car Sales by 2024, Tesla was exceeded in April in this category in Europe for a total of ten brands, including Volkswagen (which is recovering the delay in electric cars), BMW, Renault and the Chinese Byd, according to Jet Dynamics, a company that analyzes the industry.
Skoda's new small electric SUV (Volkswagen Group), Elroq, led the sales table. Tesla Model Y, former market leader, was 9th place.
Electric cars continue to conquer the European market (+26.4% in annual terms), representing 15.3% of sales in April, according to Acea.
Sales of electric cars evolve to very different rhythms in the various European countries, as a function, namely, bonuses and tax benefits distributed by governments. Germany, Belgium, Italy and Spain have seen sales trigger, while in France they are in a slight decline. "Electric vehicle sales are slowly gaining momentum, but growth remains very gradual and unequal among EU countries," said Acea Director-General Sigrid de Vries, quoted in a statement from the European Association. "For electric vehicles to become a common choice, it is essential that governments continue to create the necessary conditions, such as tax and purchase incentives, recharge infrastructures and [low] prices of electricity," he said.
In this context, with the most affordable sales prices, hybrid cars (with a small electric battery that can be recharged during driving) continue to dominate the European market (+20.8% since the beginning of the year), absorbing the market share so far reserved for gasoline cars (-20.6%).
In the whole of all energies, the Volkswagen group continues to dominate the European market (+2.9% in April), while the second classified, Stellantis, begins to limit damage after a few difficult months (-1.1%), thanks to Peugeot, Jeep and Alfa Romeo brands.
Rechargable hybrid vehicles (with a gasoline engine and an electric battery that binds to the recharge to recharge) recovered (+7.8%), namely in Germany and Spain, and now represent 7.9% of the market.
Chinese cars, according to the Dynamics jet, contributed significantly to the success of electric and plug-in hybrids.
Chinese brands such as BYD, MG, Xpeng and Leapmotor grew 59% in a year in the referred categories, compared to 26% of other brands. “It remains to be seen whether the European Union will respond to the boom of Chinese rechargeable hybrids with the imposition of customs rates,” as he did with electric cars, reflected Felipe Munoz of the Dynamics jet.
Tesla is in particular suffering from the positions defended by Elon Musk and actions under the doge, the Trump Administration Commission responsible for drastic cuts in federal expenses in the United States.
In the first quarter of 2025, Tesla sales fell 13% over the previous year, with a particularly accentuated drop in the EU, where the numbers fell 45% over the same period of the previous year.
Elon Musk guaranteed on May 20 that Tesla's commercial situation recovered and that sales are "good". He also said that he would devote only one or two days a week to Doge and the rest of the time to the management of companies he has, especially Tesla.

In an analysis presented by lawyer José Álvares, the discussion relevant to the world political-economic situation is part of the usual “Talk at Sunset”, organized by the International Advertising Association Maca China, this time at Vasco Bar. The initiative invites the public to share cocktails while clarifying doubts about the current actions of the American Office. The event takes place today at 18:30.
 
The International Advertising Association Macao China (IAA) holds today, at 6.30 pm, one of its traditional night meetings entitled “Talk at Sunset”. This event, regular and formatively, this time will have as its central theme “Donald Trump's communication strategies: beyond noise”. The lecture will be conducted by Portuguese lawyer, resident in Macau, José Álvares, whose experience and perspectives promise to provide an in-depth analysis of the US President's communicational universe.
In a world context marked by rapid changes and a growing influence of social networks on politics, Trump's tactics have been the subject of study and debate. Known for the use of controversial statements and provocative rhetoric, the current US president has managed to shape public narrative in his campaigns and decisions, often going through borders and impacting international policies, including business relations with countries such as China and Russia.
José Álvares, based on his direct experience with the “Trump” world, intends to offer a critical and at the same time strategic view of President Trump's skills as a communicator, as well as his leadership qualities and the impact of his policies globally. The main focus will be the analysis of the different communication strategies adopted by Trump, which often stand out for the controversy and provocation, but also reveal an ability to influence public and international political opinions, according to Álvares. Among the topics that will be addressed are the consequences of commercial tariffs, especially in the main theme of great relevance, their relationship with China, as well as the possible opportunities that these dynamics can open to Macao and to Portuguese-speaking countries, who seek to adapt to new global economic realities.
Álvares, who currently practices Advocacy in Macao and has a vast experience in entrepreneurship and marketing, has decided to deepen his analysis in this controversial figure. He recently completed an MBA executive in China Europe International Business School (CEIBS) in Shanghai, a formation that allowed him to consolidate knowledge about global communication and leadership strategies. In his opinion, Macau has the potential to enjoy this international “turbulence”, positioning himself as a neutral diplomatic center.
In his intervention, Álvares intends to explore concrete examples of Trump's strategies, such as the controversial statement about the Panama channel and the rhetoric in Gaza, which aim to influence foreign policy and public opinion. According to the lawyer, Macau, nicknamed “Switzerland of Asia”, can act as a diplomatic bridge, using his geographical position and his historical ties with the Portuguese -speaking world to promote more neutral and strategic diplomacy.
“The world is witnessing a unique change,” says Álvares in a statement. “We live a time of profound changes. Therefore, I invite everyone to understand the person behind this global phenomenon. Each day passing, I realize more nuances, which is both scary and fascinating,” he said.
The initiative is seen as an opportunity for professionals from various areas of Macao and the region to reflect on leadership, influence and communication techniques used by figures such as Trump, at a time when the world faces unprecedented economic and political challenges. For IAA Macau President Rebecca Choi, the event is especially relevant because it offers a unique perspective on the global effects of political and business communication strategies. "This debate will not only explore the intricacies of effective communication and leadership, but will also highlight the opportunities that arise from global economic dynamics, including Macao and Portuguese -speaking countries," said Choi.
Talk at Sunset has been consolidating itself as a networking and learning platform, bringing together marketing, communication and business professionals in an informal atmosphere that promotes the exchange of ideas and good practices. Since its inception, IAA has sought to reinforce the connection between Macao and international trends, promoting events that foster creativity, innovation and social responsibility.
Founded in 1938, IAA is one of the oldest and most influential networks in the region, with presence in several countries and a vast network of institutional partners, including the United Nations. The Macao branch, created a few years ago, acts as a link between local professionals and the rest of the world, offering specialized training, access to international events and career development opportunities.
The prominent event is held today, at 18:30, at Vasco Bar, located at Artyzen Grand Lapa, and has free admission to members of IAA Macao. For guests and non -associated participants, the registration values ​​are 100 patacas for partner and non -members, and 150 patacas for the general public.</description><pubDate>2025-05-28 06:46:54</pubDate></item><item><title>Chelsea tries to justify early winner epithet in the final with Betis</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/05/28/chelsea-tenta-justificar-epiteto-de-vencedor-antecipado-na-final-com-o-betis/</link><description>Chelsea, holding an enviable Palmarés in football Europe, seeks to confirm today the condition of uncomfortable favorite to win the 2024/25 Conference League, in the final with Betis, which pursues the first continental title.
 
The Londrina team won on Sunday “The Most Important Game”, the expression used by Italian coach Enzo Maresca to define the clash with Nottingham Forest, trained by Portuguese Nuno Espírito Santo, who the blues won 1-0, ensuring their presence in the Champions League next season.
If the triumph at the meeting of the last day of the English League allowed Chelsea to finish fourth and promoted the return to the most important European club race -which won in 2011/12 and 2020/21 in Porto -today in Wroclaw, Poland, worth the winning of another title.
Admittedly, this is the third European division, but the team in which the Portuguese international Pedro Neto will not stop trying to join the trophy to those he has already won at Champions, in the Europa League (in 2012/13, in a final against Benfica, and 2018/19) and the extinct cup of cups (1970/71 and 1997/98).
On the other side will be a very motivated team of Betis with the possibility of lifting a European trophy for the first time, which eliminated Vitória de Guimarães in the round of 16 and has been seven seasons for the Portuguese international pendular William Carvalho.
Seville's formation, sixth classified from the Spanish League, will face an arduous task, as the English won 11 of the 12 games they played in the Conference League, having lost a single, with Legia Warsaw (2-1), trained by Portuguese Gonçalo Feio, when they already had the qualification for the semi-finals in their pockets.
Chelsea's superiority in this edition of the Conference League was notorious since the new phase of League, which the English won with the 'full' of six triumphs and a overwhelming balance between scored and conceded goals (26-5), which began to be built by two Portuguese players.
The defense Renato Veiga, later borrowed to Juventus, inaugurated the marker in the debut game, with the Gent, that the Londons won 4-2 and in which Pedro Neto scored the second goal, the only striker in the race, in which it has not been regular choice of Italian coach Enzo Maresca.
The extreme is even the least earned from the three Portuguese who represented Chelsea this time, since Renato Veiga returned to earn from Astana and striker João Félix twice, with Panathinaikos and Noah, before being borrowed to AC Milan, all during the immaculate alloy phase.
The triumphs in the phase to be eliminated, before Copenhagen ('eighth'), Legia Warsaw ('rooms') and Djurgarden (semi-finals) were not so bulky, but still, Chelsea did enough to win all games except for the second-hand match with the Poles.
Betis's route was less categorical and the Spanish club had to go through the play-off of the round of 16, which pushed the Gent away after finishing the League phase in 15th place.
The tie at the reception to Guimarães, in the first game of the eighth, opened good perspectives to Victorians, but Seville's team thrashed 4-0 in Portugal and continued in race, eliminating in the 'rooms' the Jagiellonia Biarystok and the 'socks' to Fiorentina, finalist won in the last two editions.
The story plays in favor of the blues, who beat the Spaniards twice in the quarterfinals of the extinct Cup Cup in 1997/98, in the walk to win the trophy, having won one game and lost another in 2005/06, in the Champions League group stage.
Chelsea and Betis compete on Wednesday the 2024/25 Conference League final, the fourth edition of the race, which takes place at the Wroclaw Arena in Poland.

"Regardless of all legal, constitutional legal considerations, there is a question that all countries in the world observe, the national interest," the head of state, at a press conference at the Presidency Palace in Dili. "The national interest is what imposes, is that it determines and, in this case, does not interest someone this nature, to prevent Timor-Leste from becoming paradise for all who commit crime in the region," said José Ramos-Horta.
The Timor-Leste Appeal Court ruled in March not to extradition of Deputy Arnolfo Teves Jr. for the Philippines.
The Philippine was arrested last year in Dili by the Scientific Police of Criminal Investigation of Timor-Leste, following an Interpol capture warrant, issued at the request of Manila's authorities.
Arnolfo “Arnie” A. Teves Jr., a politician and former deputy Filipino, is accused by the Philippine authorities of being responsible for the murder of 10 people, but the politician denies any involvement and criticizes opponents for the accusations.
In May 2023, Timor-Leste rejected the request for political asylum to Arnolfo Teves Jr. for considering that he did not fulfill the requirements, giving him five days to leave the country. "The case of non -extradition is outdated, the Lord is not eligible for political asylum. If it is not eligible for asylum, if there is a warrant of Interpol, if there is a request from the Philippine Authorities to execute the mandate of Interpol, it would be a serious irresponsibility of this country not to fulfill the request of Interpol and the Philippine Authorities," said the head of state. "I want to see today what justice and agencies that have to support justice will do," added the Timorese President, without further details.
The relations of the Philippines with Timor-Leste have recorded some tension in recent times, after the Timorese Appeal Court has refused to carry out the former deputy Filipino.
In March, the Secretary of Filipino Justice, Jesus Crispin Rella, told the press that the refusal of extradition could endanger Timor-Leste's candidacy to the Association of Southeast Asia Nations (Asean), noting that the Philippines are a founding member of the organization.
Last Thursday, the Philippines officially expressed support for the full adhesion of Timor-Leste to Asean. At the summit of heads of state of the organization, held Monday in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, it was agreed that the full adherence of Timor-Leste to the organization will be realized in October.</description><pubDate>2025-05-28 06:50:20</pubDate></item><item><title>Governor of the bank of Japan drives rise from yen by signaling an increase in interest rate</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/05/28/governador-do-banco-do-japao-impulsiona-subida-do-iene-ao-sinalizar-aumento-da-taxa-de-juro/</link><description>Banco do Japan governor (Boj), Kazuo Ueda, gave yesterday a boost to yen by clearly indicating his intention to continue to increase the reference interest rate if the economy is improved as expected.
 
“We will adjust the degree of monetary flexibility as needed,” to ensure that the bank reaches its sustainable pricing objective if new data gives the authorities more confident that economic expectations will be met, Ueda said in a speech yesterday at an international conference organized by Boj in Tokyo.
Following the comments of the governor of the Japanese Central Bank, the yen immediately rose to 142.28 against the dollar.
Notwithstanding Trump's tariff policies continue to disturb global financial markets, Ueda's comments indicate that Boj continues to face as next step another increase in the reference interest rate this year, a measure that market opinions also anticipate. "In the light of the growing uncertainties, in particular those related to trade policy, we recently reviewed our economic and inflation perspectives," Ueda said. "However, we continue to expect underlying inflation to gradually approach 2% throughout the second half of our forecast horizon," he said, adding that Japan is now closer to its inflation goal than at any other time in the last three years.
Data released last Friday showed that consumer inflation, excluding fresh foods, accelerated in April to 3.5%, staying inside or above the goal of Boj for three full years. On the other hand, it is expected that the numbers to be presented this week will indicate that the trend will remain in May.
Ueda stated that, unlike Europe and the United States, Japan is suffering a second shock of supply, due to increased inflation of food products, which justifies special attention.
"We are now facing a new round of supply shocks in the form of price increases in food products. Our basic point of view is that the effects of food price inflation should decrease. However, since underlying inflation is closer to 2% than a few years ago, we have to be careful with the impact that food price inflation will have underlying inflation," he said.
Although price increases are widespread, rice prices have become a special concern, after having almost doubled, increasing pressure on families to make expenses.
The Japanese government plans to release more from its rice reserves, in an effort to cool the market, and is also launching energy subsidies, including gasoline, natural gas and electricity.
BOJ has halved its growth projection for this fiscal year at its policy meeting later this month, and has postponed for one year the expected deadline to achieve the inflation goal.
Ueda attended a meeting of the Ministers of Finance and Central Banks of G7 in Banff, Canada last week, where she said her colleagues recognized the new challenges arising from the increased uncertainty. "To be honest, I was slightly excluded, although not for the first time, because here in Japan we are still facing the longtime challenge of reaching our 2% inflation goal sustainably, taking into account the implications of the zero lower interest rates," said Ueda.

The opening to the public is scheduled for 4 pm, and the show will be available until the end of June.
In a route that now reaches a quarter of decade, ArtM intends with the new exhibition to publicize the work of its residents and the efforts of the institution in recent years.

The exhibition “Ageing Gracefully” aims to publicize the artwork done by these individuals, while promoting greater public understanding of the processes of recovery and social reintegration. In addition to valuing the expressiveness of the participants, the show aims to sensitize the community to the difficulties faced by these people and the transformative potential of art in the recovery process.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Monção brings rain, thunder and descent of temperatures from today</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/05/28/moncao-traz-chuva-trovoada-e-descida-das-temperaturas-a-partir-de-hoje/</link><description>A southwest monsoon will today hit Macao with “a large flow of hot and humid air” that will result in strong winds, intense rainfall and thunderstorms. Time again stabilizes early next week, with thermometers reaching 31 degrees Celsius.
 
The territory of Macao will be affected by a southwest monsoon, characterized by wind, heavy rains and thunderstorms. The weather situation should improve next week with the return of high temperatures.
The beginning of this week was marked by the influence of an east quadrant air stream, which motivated interspersed periods of very cloudy and discovered sky and a descent of temperature, especially in the morning and evening. According to information published on the Meteorological and Geophysical Services page (SMG), time will change from today with the arrival of “a large flow of hot and humid air” from the Gulf of Bengal, the Indochinese Peninsula and the Southern Sea of ​​China.
At the same time, SMG forecasts also point to the approach of a depression valley that will carry “a large amount of hot and humid air” to the southern coast of China. Between today and tomorrow, frequent showers are expected, “sometimes intense” rains and the possibility of thunderstorms. In reverse to the percentage of moisture, which can reach 98% in these two days, temperatures will lower slightly, oscillating between 24 and 28 degrees Celsius today and 23 and 26 degrees Celsius tomorrow.
The state of time will be changed on Saturday, May 31, with the gradual removal of the depressionary valley and the influence of a new air stream from the East Quadrant. Although it is foreseen that the heavens remain cloudy, the “relatively strong” wind will maintain stable temperatures between 24 and 28 degrees Celsius. “Subsequently, the weather will improve, predicting that it is very hot early next week,” reads the informative page created on the meteorological phenomena of the coming days. On Monday, temperatures rise to a minimum of 26 degrees Celsius and a maximum of 31 degrees Celsius.
Given the atmospheric changes of the spring station, SMG appeals to the population to remain attentive to the information issued by the authorities and to adopt preventive measures, planning their travels in advance.
In addition to Macao, most of the Guangdong regions - especially those in the north and west of the province - have been affected by adverse atmospheric conditions since the beginning of the rain season. Still, the total precipitation registered in Macao until May 25 was only 95.2 millimeters, a substantial decrease of about 75.4% compared to the amounts recorded in the same month last year.
In a statement issued last March, the SMG stipulated that the rainy season this year would comprise the period between April and September, and the “extreme” phenomena of Swordsman is likely. Authorities' predictions also indicated that this year should pass through Macau between five to eight tropical storms between June and October, with some of them reaching the level of severe typhoon or super typhoon.

Most of the captured paintings are teachers and researchers.
 
Among the 2,079 applications received in the two phases of the qualified framework program, 575 candidates were included in the range of qualified capture, indicated the direction of services for Labor Affairs (DSSA) in response to Ron Lam written interpellation.
The authorities detailed that 122 of the selected candidates were highly qualified tables and 431 advanced level professionals, related to the four main priority development industries. In addition, Dsal stressed that, as for antiquity of work, the average highly qualified paintings is 14.3 years, while that of advanced level professionals is 12.1 years. Regarding the professional profile of the frames, the majority (39.1%) consists of teachers and researchers.
In questioning, Ron Lam said that the qualified frame capture program was also including newly ordered “without experience”, “which is not in line with the initial intention of the government, which intended to attract experienced talents from abroad to Macau to promote the development of local industries and form local talents”.
In response to the deputy, the government said that “many of these qualified teachers and researchers, who will be in Macau to perform academic and training functions, play a guiding role of avant -garde and leadership in the formation of local qualified staff, materializing solid interconnection between the 'introduction' and 'formation' links.
The Development of Qualified Table Development (CDQQ) is now to finalize the work of elaborating the third phase of this qualified framework program, “alarming and constantly collecting the opinions and suggestions of the various sectors of society, optimizing the policies related to qualified frameworks and their work, striving to attract them, in various areas, to promote the development of the proper diversification of the economy of the economy Macao ”.

The North Korea Ministry of Foreign Affairs stressed in a statement that this defense system “is a very dangerous threatening action that aims to threaten the strategic security of countries with nuclear weapons,” according to state news agency KCNA.
North Korean diplomacy issued the note “To inform the international community” about the dangers of this system, it can be read.
Trump announced last week that the United States will have by 2029 a new anti -lone defense system, which dubbed the "golden summit."
The US president added that Canada will join the project, which will be operational at the end of his term in 2029, and will cost a total of "approximately $ 175 billion when completed."
According to Trump, the system will be able to intercep missiles "even if they are launched from space."
The "golden summit" is inspired by the Israeli anti -lit defense system "Iron Summit", resulting in the name adopted by Trump.
The “Iron Summit” has interceived thousands of rockets and drones since its entry into operation in 2011, with an interception rate of about 90%, according to the Israeli military company Rafael, involved in its conception.
Israel began by developing the system after the 2006 Lebanon War, and later the United States involved in the project, contributing technology and thousands of millions of dollars of financial support.
Trump had already mentioned this anti -lone shield project during his campaign, although not consensual among experts, some of which point out that these systems were initially designed to respond to short and medium range attacks and not to intercept intercontinental reach that could reach the United States.
Trump signed at the end of January an executive order to develop an “American Iron Summit,” which the White House described as an anti-seissile defense shield to protect the entire US territory.
At the time, Russia and China criticized the announcement, with Moscow considered that it was a plan “comparable to the Star War,” supported by Ronald Reagan during the Cold War.
The US already has many anti -meal defense capabilities, such as Patriot missile batteries that provided Ukraine, as well as a series of orbiting satellites to detect missile launches. Some of these existing systems will be incorporated into the “golden summit”.
China and Russia have placed offensive weapons in space, such as satellites capable of disabled critical American satellites, which can make the US vulnerable to attacks.
The Pentagon has warned in recent years that the latest missiles developed by China and Russia are so advanced that it is necessary to update the defenses.

On the sidelines of a regular CLC meeting, Vong Kok Seng, chairman of the commission, revealed that the Macao Electricity Company (CEM) plans to advance with the replacement of aged equipment in some buildings in Macao, and that during the project will be implemented interruptions of electricity supply. He admitted, however, that the project should face “certain challenges” due to difficulties in coordinating units owners about electricity cutting time.
Vong Kok Seng, quoted by the newspaper or Mun, explained that commercial facilities prefer interruptions during non -commercial hours, ie at night hours after work, but family aggregates always request that interruptions are made during the day. "It will be difficult to reach a consensus although CEM communicates with the stakeholders and requests consent before the works," he said.
According to Vong, CEM has ensured that it will try to shorten the duration of interruptions and explore alternative energy options to reduce the impact on residents' lives. The hundred said that, at this stage, the works will only be carried out in certain buildings, neighborhoods or individual units, instead of the whole city.
The hundred, moreover, has ensured that it is “well prepared” in the face of possible high temperatures and increased demand for electricity this year. "Currently, Macao adopts a triple, energy acquisition, photovoltaic supplementation and self-gear of electricity, to ensure that its capacity for energy production and distribution is sufficient to cope with the peak energy consumption," he said. The company added that the preparatory work on the stable supply of electricity in zone A of the new landfills was completed, where the arrival of residents in the second half of this year is expected.

The Lisbon Book Fair will receive the release of the book “The Red Pencil - The Censorship of the Estado Novo to the Macao press”, by journalist Andreia Sofia da Silva, on June 7, at 18:00. The work results from a research work developed by the author for five years, in the context of a master's dissertation in contemporary history, and is over the effects of the censorship of the Estado Novo on overseas territories, with a special focus on the press of Macao.
The launching session will be attended by Pedro Aires de Oliveira, historian and professor at the Faculty of Social and Human Sciences of the New University of Lisbon (FCSH/Unl) who guided the dissertation, and Carlos Pieira, an anthropologist associated with the Higher Institute of Social Sciences and Police of the University of Lisbon (ISCSP) that also occupies the position of president of the House of Macao in the Portuguese capital.
Andreia Sofia da Silva's book proposes to analyze the operation of the press censorship committee in the Portuguese colonies-then considered an extension of the country. If, in Portugal, the press was one of the main targets of the famous “blue pencil”, with the imposition of partial or total cuts on content considered political or socially inconvenient, the molds of censorship in Macau were quite different.
Although there is evidence of the occasional action of the committee's “red pencil” in the years before the 1960s, the launch of the On Mun newspaper - the official journal of the Chinese Communist Party - exposed the weaknesses of Portuguese sovereignty in Macao and the inability to make local communication bodies to accept the laws of Portuguese censorship.
In a statement sent to the newsrooms, the author stresses that the “difficulties in dealing with the Chinese press” originated a “duality of criteria” in different territories: while the Portuguese press was the target of processes of suspension and fines and members of the Portuguese Communist Party (PCP) silenced by the regime, the commission performed much more leniently in the Asian region, “even allowing the publication of the press Communist nature in Macau ”.
Among the other Chinese journals published over the four decades of Estado Novo, Andreia Sofia da Silva states that “the newspaper or Mun was the only one that was hardly subjected to any decision of the censorship committee”, although it was one of the most targeted by the authorities. The permissiveness of the commission against this act of disobedience shows “the concern” of the Portuguese regime “not compromising complex relations with the Popular Republic of China (RPC), the local Chinese community and its representatives”, also safeguarding the “survival of Portuguese administration”.
"It still lasts in the academy the debate around if the Portuguese will have, in fact, some sovereignty in Macao. We understand that the study of the censorship of the Estado No Estado in the territory comes us to give another response in this regard, being a sign that Portuguese colonialism in Macao came practically to the end in 1967, as noted by several authors," says the author, in the conclusion of the book.
Andreia Sofia da Silva has a degree in Journalism from the Faculty of Letters of the University of Coimbra, having exercised most of her professional career in Macau. Currently, he is a correspondent of the newspaper “Today Macao”.
The 95th edition of the Lisbon Book Fair will take place between 4 and 22 June at Park Eduardo VII. The schedule is now available for consultation on the official event page.

The Global Times newspaper said that Chinese trade minister Wang Wenta will meet with the European Commissioner for Economic Trade and Security, Slovaco Maros Sefcovic, as part of a World Trade Organization (WTO) ministerial summit in Paris.
After Sefcovic's visit to China in late March, the two commercial representatives “have been in close communication, maintaining extensive and in -depth discussions on issues related to economic and commercial cooperation between China and EU”, according to Global Times. And, in a videochamada held in early April, the two parties agreed to start consultations on market access issues and immediately start negotiations on Brussels imposed on electric cars imported from China.
An expert quoted by Global Times framed the increased contacts between Beijing and Brussels in a context of “growing protectionism and unilateralism of some Western countries”, in a clear reference to the United States.
The EU Chamber of Commerce in China recently revealed that the Chinese government has extended the “red carpet” to European companies operating in the country, although they continue to complain about inequalities in market access and also the favorable treatment Beijing gives their state companies.
The news of the meeting comes after US President Donald Trump has agreed to extend the deadline for negotiating a trade agreement with the EU until July 9, to avoid 50%rates.
Since mid -month, the US and China have been in a 90 -day truce that reduced additional rates that had applied to each other during the tariff of previous weeks.</description><pubDate>2025-05-28 06:45:58</pubDate></item><item><title>Japan loses status as a larger creditor after 34 years and is overtaken by Germany</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/05/28/japao-perde-estatuto-de-maior-credor-apos-34-anos-e-e-ultrapassado-por-alemanha/</link><description>Japan lost to Germany, after 34 years, the statute of the world's largest creditor, although its liquid external assets reached a record in 2024, in part due to the depreciation of the yen, yesterday announced the Japanese authorities.
Japan's net international investment position increased last year 12.9%, in annual terms, to 533.05 bilions of yen (3.28 billion euros), for the first time above 500 billion yen (3.08 billion of euros), but below the value of Germany's external assets, which rose to 3.5 billions of euros at the end of 2024, according to the end of 2024, according to German Central Bank data.
IENE depreciation has increased the value of the assets in foreign currency in Japan, including shares, obligations and other investments, once converted to local currency, but in fact reducing the amount of liquid assets, said Japanese government spokesman Yoshimasa Hayashi at a press conference.
Iene weakening contributed to the increase of both active and external liabilities, but assets grew at a faster pace, driven in part for the expansion of Japanese business abroad.
Generally speaking, data reflect broader trends in foreign direct investment. In 2024, Japanese companies kept a strong appetite for foreign direct investment, particularly in the US and the United Kingdom, according to the ministry.
Sectors such as finance, insurance and flap attracted significant capital of Japanese investors, according to the ministry.
Germany also benefited from a high surplus of the current transactions balance last year, of 248.7 billion euros.
The surplus of the Tokyo current transactions balance ascended to 29.26 billion of yen (180.22 billion euros) in the same period.
Hayashi minimized the importance of this value, noting that Japan's position in this area remains strong: "Net assets are increasing despite the world's classification, as Japan's [economic] situation has not changed," he said.
Germany destroyed China as the second largest creditor in the world in 2015, when the Asian country made a heavy investment to contain Yuan's fall.
In 2023, the European country relegated Japan to the fourth largest economy in the world.
The report of the Japanese Ministry of Finance, released yesterday, on the country's credit capacity also shows that net external credit increased by 2024 for the seventh year, rising 11.4%, in annual terms, in total assets to 1,659.02 billion yen (10.23 billion of euros), driven by direct investment in the United States by financial institutions and commercial houses.
External liabilities increased by 10.7% to 1,125.97 yen billion (6.94 billion euros). The yen was quoted at 157.89 compared to the US dollar at the end of 2024, 11.7% lower in annual terms.
Looking to the future, the trajectory of foreign investment will depend on Japanese companies continue to expand their investments abroad, especially in the United States.
With US President Donald Trump's tariff policies, some companies may be encouraged to move production or transfer assets to the United States to mitigate trade-related risks.</description><pubDate>2025-05-28 06:50:21</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
