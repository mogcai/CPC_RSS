The company also announced pricing plans for next year, which include discounts designed specifically for different layers of customers.

The Macau Telecommunications Company (CTM) announced that it will develop an Artificial Intelligence (AI) language model in Portuguese, with the ability to translate audio and video, generate reports and perform customer service functions. The information was released yesterday at a press conference, in connection with the celebration of CTM's 44th anniversary.
The event, entitled “Continuous Dedication to the Service of Macau: Revealing the New Vision «IA Macau»”, aimed to present the vision and future plans for the company's development, as well as the price plan for next year. As the title of the conference suggests, AI and its potential were the main theme of the afternoon, continuing the efforts already made since last year to strengthen Macau's capabilities as a smart city.
Thomas Ng, vice president of Network Services at CTM, began by presenting plans for network expansion and optimization of 5.5G (5G-A), 50G PON and AI technologies. The official recalled that, following the launch of programs such as “10 Gigabit Macau Neighborhood”, developed in cooperation with The One Oasis, CTM also recently presented in France the “Dual-Gigabit Sports Pavilion”, capable of guaranteeing 10 Gigabit network technology in sports venues.
Ebel Cham, vice-president of the company's Commercial Area, said that this technology will be used to promote Macau's digital transformation in various sectors, while strengthening the capabilities of 'big data' and local computing. It is in this context that the Portuguese language model emerges, an opportunity for Macau to continue to cement its role as a bridge for economic cooperation between China and Portuguese-speaking countries. In the area of ​​transport, new technologies will also allow real-time monitoring of traffic and the issuance of dynamic alert systems, contributing to “the enrichment of the tourist experience” in Macau.
The projection of Macau within the Greater Bay Area is another of the CTM's main objectives. In addition to the creation of a decentralized database for companies in the Greater Bay Area, the launch of the “Macau Certified Shop” electronic platform is also planned, aimed at supporting small and medium-sized companies in Macau in expanding their sales channels to this wider market.

NEW PRICING PLAN WITH DISCOUNTS

Regarding the prices of communications services, CTM announced an extraordinary plan aimed at all layers of customers – including individual customers, small and medium-sized companies, large corporations and government departments.
Small and medium-sized companies that use the operator's broadband services will benefit from a 20% discount on the net monthly fee for internet services during the first month of each quarter of the year. For residential customers using home broadband services, the discount is 10%.
In turn, business customers will see a reduction of up to 44% in the monthly fixed telephone fee, which from January will cost MOP 140 – or MOP 112, if customers also subscribe to the broadband service.
Between January and July next year, large companies and government departments will receive a 20% discount on monthly fees for business broadband services, in addition to a 10% reduction in the cost of Direct Internet Access (DIA) services and local and international private connections.
Also from next year, the cost of additional mobile data will drop from the current 13 patacas per GB to just 8, which represents a decrease of approximately 38.5%.
It is recalled that the Government extended the concession contract with CTM for another two years, now valid until September 30, 2027. In a statement released on the occasion, the Government said it had required the company to implement a tariff reduction plan aimed at the general population and small and medium-sized companies.</description><pubDate>2025-10-20 23:13:02</pubDate></item><item><title>Chief of Executive says that Macao SAR enjoys judicial independence</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/10/20/chefe-do-executivo-diz-que-raem-goza-de-independencia-judiciaria/</link><description>Sam Hou Fai defended yesterday, at the opening ceremony of the Conference of the Forum of Presidents of the Supreme Courts of Justice of Portuguese-speaking Countries and Territories, that the Macao SAR has safeguarded judicial independence and enjoys “independent judicial power”.

The opening ceremony of the XIII Conference of the Forum of Presidents of the Supreme Courts of Justice of Portuguese-speaking Countries and Territories took place yesterday morning. On the occasion, the Chief Executive defended that the role of “active promoter” of the initiative that the Macao SAR now has reflects “the firm safeguard of judicial independence under the principle of ‘one country, two systems'”.
“According to the Basic Law, the Macao SAR enjoys independent judicial power”, added the Chief Executive, stating that this allows it to consolidate “the Rule of Law” with the “unique advantages of Sino-Portuguese bilingualism”, transforming Macau into a “bridge between China and the Portuguese-speaking world”.
The arrival of representatives from other Portuguese-speaking countries to Macau for this conference “represents the high recognition of the progress of the Rule of Law in Macau”, and in addition, it provides the Macao SAR “a strong stimulus to continue writing new chapters of ‘Macau based on the Rule of Law'”, said Sam Hou Fai in his speech.
Sam Hou Fai recalled that, 22 years ago, also in Macau, the 5th Conference of Presidents of the Supreme Courts of Justice of Portuguese-speaking Countries and Territories was held, the opening ceremony of which was presided precisely by him, at the time in the role of president of the Court of Final Instance.
"I witnessed the establishment of the Forum's Statute and witnessed the creation of its permanent secretariat and periodic meeting regime. Thus, the beginning of the cooperation of the 'great Portuguese-speaking judicial family' was officially institutionalized", highlighted Sam.
For Sam, the return of the conference to Macau “generates hope for the future”. “Over these 22 years, this intercontinental judicial bridge, the work of the union of our efforts, has grown from six seeds and has become a giant tree that covers four continents”, he said, noting that this forum has addressed topics “increasingly deepened in experience, from the ‘need for judicial reform’ to the ‘administrative and financial autonomy of the Court Services as a guarantor of judicial independence’, the ‘role of the Judiciary in the face of globalization’ to the ‘judiciary and new technologies’, demonstrating the constant elevation of our awareness of the value of the Rule of Law”.
Sam Hou Fai argued that “Law not only establishes the rules that define who has rights and obligations to resolve conflicts, but, more importantly, it is the art of 'guiding the people and realizing the ideal of justice and peace'”. For the Chief, “justice is not only a mirror of social development, but also a dynamic force that drives it”.
"In the face of great changes, unprecedented in the last 100 years, what the world needs is dialogue and not confrontation, cooperation and not division. More than at any time in the past, we need to use legal certainty to counter the 'varieties of the world', to use the impartiality of the judicial system to provide guarantees for socioeconomic development, and to use the open character of the Rule of Law to bring nations and countries closer together", he stated.
Finally, the Chief Executive highlighted that “Macau strives for the defense of ‘one country’ and takes advantage of the advantages of the second system, with its characteristics provided by the fusion of Chinese and Western cultures”, being “fully capable of delivering quality performance and promoting ‘legal interconnection, mutual trust at the judicial level and mutual benefits for the rule of law’ with clear laws that increase investor confidence, efficient justice that guarantees the fulfillment of contracts, alternative dispute resolution mechanisms that reduce transaction costs, justice and impartiality that consolidate the connection between our people”.
“The Rule of Law is the civilization and common language of Humanity”, he highlighted, adding that “cooperation is the eternal theme of development”. "Over 20 years ago, we planted seeds of cooperation, exchange and mutual learning in Macau that have now flourished. Today, we will take advantage of this Conference as a new starting point and promote Law as a link for harmony between peoples and an engine for economic development", he concluded.</description><pubDate>2025-10-20 23:13:58</pubDate></item><item><title>Black-faced Spoonbill is no longer listed as an “endangered” species</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/10/20/colhereiro-de-cara-preta-deixa-de-ser-listado-como-especie-em-perigo-de-extincao/</link><description>The black-faced spoonbill was recently assessed as a “vulnerable” species, leaving the classification “in danger of extinction”, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, praising successful conservation actions over the last three decades. The International Census conducted by the Hong Kong Bird Watching Society revealed that it had identified 7,081 black-faced spoonbills in the world, but warns of the need for greater protection of the species in Macau, where the number of this seabird has been declining.

The number of black-faced spoonbills has made a “remarkable” recovery, rising from around 400 in 1995 to around 7,000 last year, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).
According to the most up-to-date assessment of the IUCN Red List of threatened species, the black-faced spoonbill is now classified as a “vulnerable” species, no longer being listed as an “endangered” species since 2000, after having remained “in critical danger of extinction” since 1994.
The IUCN noted that the increase in the global population of black-faced spoonbills was the result of “successful conservation actions” over the last thirty years, with the current population trend being “stable” in general, with an estimate of 3,000 to 5,100 adult birds.
In the analysis, the IUCN, however, left a warning about threats faced by the black-faced spoonbill, a seabird that is found only in Asia and breeds on the Korean Peninsula, spending the winter along the southern coast of China – including Macau – and other regions of East Asia and Southeast Asia. "The population now appears to have approximately stabilized and, in some places, is in decline. Threats remain serious across much of the species' range, particularly habitat loss, and the species is expected to decline in the near future," he warned. The IUCN believes that, as these threats intensify, the number of black-faced spoonbills will begin to decline over the next one to two generations, until 2050, and the population decline will exceed 30% over the next three generations. “Given that the population size continues to be small, the species is expected to have a high risk of extinction”, concluded the organization, citing data analysis from the International Census of the Black-faced Spoonbill coordinated by the “Hong Kong Bird Watching Society” (HKBWS), released earlier this month.

ALERT FOR MACAU
 
The HKBWS International Census for 2025 revealed that it had identified a total of 7,081 black-faced spoonbills, a number that represents an increase of 1.3% compared to the previous winter's count of 6,988, breaking the record since this census was recorded. The report noted that the black-faced spoonbill's largest wintering site remains Tainan, Taiwan, with 2,439 birds counted.
HKBWS said the conservation outlook is "better" than in the past, "but certain areas, such as Macau, require more attention and resources to deal with ongoing or long-term declines in numbers. Understanding the habitat requirements of this species in these locations is crucial to its conservation," it warned.
According to census statistics, a total of 16 Black-faced Spoonbills spent the winter in Macau, which represents just 0.2% of the global total.
In Macau, the main areas of research and observation were the Ecological Zones in COTAI, designated for the conservation of wildlife and wetlands. The intertidal plain adjacent to these areas and any suitable coastal habitats were also included in the census.
“Although the number has registered a small increase of three birds, these habitats may no longer be as attractive as they were in the past”, highlighted the HKBWS.
The report noted that 184 black-faced spoonbills were found in nearby locations in Zhuhai and Jiangmen during this census, an increase of 4% from last year, indicating that these nearby areas may be more attractive than Macau.
"Macau, a traditional place where black-faced spoonbills spend the winter, has seen a huge decline [of this species] in recent years. Despite an increase of three this year to 16, it remains the second lowest recorded in the last 25 years. The future of this traditional place remains uncertain", he warned.
Remember that Macau's tourism mascot, “Mak Mak”, is a black-faced spoonbill inspired by the Guia Lighthouse.
According to censuses carried out by HKBWS in recent years, the identified number of black-faced spoonbills was 53 in 2019; 40 in 2020; 45 in 2021; but then drastically decreased to 22 in 2022 and 21 in 2023.
The association, regarding the conservation of the black-faced spoonbill, called on the public to provide more support to address existing threats, such as the fact that coastal wetlands continue to suffer the impacts of urbanization, land reclamation, pollution and human disturbance. HKBWS added that renewable energy installations such as wind and solar farms are encroaching on their habitats and threats from avian diseases and climate change are also intensifying.</description><pubDate>2025-10-20 23:15:21</pubDate></item><item><title>Japanese parties form coalition to resolve political crisis</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/10/20/partidos-japoneses-formam-coligacao-para-resolver-crise-politica/</link><description>The Liberal Democratic Party (PLD) of Japan yesterday signed a coalition agreement with the Innovation Party of Japan (Ishin), putting an end to the political crisis that had lasted for weeks. PLD leader Sanae Takaichi, 64, formalized the agreement with Hirofumi Yoshimura, co-president of Ishin, during a ceremony in Tokyo, paving the way for her appointment as the first woman to head the Japanese Government. “I look forward to working with you to strengthen the Japanese economy and make Japan a responsible country for future generations,” said Takaichi, quoted by the Kyodo agency.
The PLD – a dominant force in Japanese politics since 1955 – had been going through a crisis since the collapse of its traditional coalition with the centrist Komeito party, on October 10, after 26 years of alliance. The political impasse threatened the formation of a Government after the departure of Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, involved in a financial scandal and penalized by persistent inflation. With 196 seats in the lower house of Parliament and the support of Ishin's 35 deputies, the new center-right coalition guarantees Takaichi enough majority to be confirmed prime minister in the parliamentary vote scheduled for Tuesday. The two parties agreed on economic and fiscal reform measures, including reducing the tax on food consumption from 10% to zero and reducing the number of seats in Parliament – ​​priorities defended by Yoshimura. “We believe that we share the same objective of taking Japan forward”, explained the Ishin leader, describing the agreement as “a reformist and patriotic commitment”.
The confirmation of the coalition caused a 3% rise on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, with the Nikkei index reaching a new historic high, driven by expectations of expansionary fiscal policies. Former drummer of a heavy metal band during her student days, Sanae Takaichi is an ultra-conservative politician who is inspired by Margaret Thatcher, former British Prime Minister. In office, Takaichi will face complex challenges, such as an aging population, record public debt, persistent inflation and the need to revitalize the economy through tax incentives. Tuesday's parliamentary vote comes ahead of US President Donald Trump's official visit, scheduled for the end of October, during which customs duties and bilateral trade relations will be at the center of discussions.</description><pubDate>2025-10-20 22:56:13</pubDate></item><item><title>Job fair will provide 1,500 offers</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/10/20/feira-de-emprego-vai-proporcionar-1-500-ofertas/</link><description>A job and professional development fair will be held on the 10th and 11th of November, organized by the Directorate of Labor Affairs Services (DSAL) and the Federation of Workers' Associations of Macau (FAOM).

The 11th edition of the event takes place this weekend, on the 25th and 26th, and is once again organized by CAC – Círculo dos Amigos da Cultura de Macau. All activities are free.
This year's event builds on the “Ghost Party” theme to create a series of themed activities inclusive of all age groups, such as the “Spiders Tunnel” or the “Cockroach Haunted House” challenge. At dusk, the space will begin to prepare visitors for a horrifying night of zombies, vampires and witches with free makeup booths – and photo sessions to immortalize the costume.
Between 3pm and 6pm, it's time to take to the streets and play “trick or treat” in the São Lázaro district. Children between the ages of five and 12 are invited to “embark on an exciting adventure” through the streets and alleys of Macau, as described by the CAC, and use a map to look for hidden treasures, identify “mysterious patterns” and receive “delicious sweets” as a reward. The activity requires prior registration, as well as the children being accompanied by an adult.
The usual “Albergue SCM Halloween Mask Contest” will also take place again from the 25th to the 28th of October. Those interested must take a photo of their best Halloween costumes and share it in a specific post on CAC's Facebook with the comment “Watch me go into spooky mode!”, with the photo with the most “likes” winning a prize.
“Halloween is not only a festival that celebrates the autumn harvest, but also a platform for global cultural exchange”, indicates the CAC in a statement, in reference to the celebration of the date on an international level. “In order to allow citizens to experience community care, cultural aesthetics and the unique human landscape of our region in a festive environment, CAC and Albergue SCM held ten large-scale Halloween celebrations from 2013 to 2024, which were well received by the public”, recalls the association, promising another “joyful and creative festival” for this 11th edition.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Gross gaming revenues are expected to grow 8.3% this year</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/10/20/receitas-brutas-de-jogo-deverao-crescer-83-este-ano/</link><description>Casinos are expected to earn 8.3% more this year compared to 2024, says a Seaport report. If the forecast is confirmed, this means that gross gaming revenues could exceed MOP245 billion in 2025.

Gross gaming revenues are expected to exceed MOP245 billion this year, according to accounts from consultancy Seaport Research Partners. If confirmed, this figure means an increase of 8.3% compared to the total for 2024.
The report, cited by the GGRAsia portal, also speaks of a slight slowdown in the last quarter of the year. Seaport says that “the recent slowdown in September – due to the disruption caused by the typhoon – and a weaker start in October – due to several specific factors – do not change our growth thesis for the rest of 2025 and in the long term”.
Last week, JP Morgan had already stated that gross gaming revenues during October's Golden Week period fell short of expectations. The broker indicated that the results were not very encouraging, with a decrease of 5% compared to the same period last year. It is worth remembering that Macau welcomed 1.14 million tourists over the eight days of October's Golden Week, an increase of 16.5% compared to last year's numbers. Even so, the total number of visitors fell short of the expectations of the Tourism Services Directorate (DST).
The consultancy continues to see potential for long-term growth in 2025, with an increase of 13% in the third quarter and 12% in the fourth quarter, and an annual increase of 7% in 2026 and 2027. Seaport also says that operator profits are expected to grow by more than 9%.
Seaport also did the math on market shares and anticipated that Sands and Galaxy could increase their shares, while the remaining concessionaires would suffer share losses.
According to the Gaming Inspection and Coordination Directorate (DICJ), in the month of September, gaming revenues were 18.3 billion patacas, 17.5% less compared to the previous month of August, when casinos earned 22.15 billion patacas and broke the post-pandemic record.
In terms of accumulated revenue, between January and September this year the casinos raised around 181.34 billion patacas, that is, 7.1% more compared to what they had raised in the same period last year.
The basic budget prepared by the previous Macao SAR Government for 2025 estimated that gaming revenue this year would reach 240 billion patacas. After a start to the year that fell short of expectations, the current Government presented a revised budget with a forecast of 228 billion patacas. Therefore, if Seaport's projections are confirmed, gross gaming revenues will even exceed the first estimates made by the Government.</description><pubDate>2025-10-20 23:12:11</pubDate></item><item><title>More than a thousand isolated young people with Internet addiction have been monitored in the last ten years</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/10/20/mais-de-mil-jovens-isolados-e-com-vicio-da-internet-foram-acompanhados-nos-ultimos-dez-anos/</link><description>More than a thousand young people in Macau have received support related to Internet addiction and social isolation over the last decade. The Sheng Kung Hui Macau Social Services Coordinating Office warns of the lack of initiative on the part of families in submitting requests for help, which makes intervention services difficult.

Over the last ten years, the Sheng Kung Hui Macau Social Services Coordinating Office has monitored a total of 1,059 young people who had problems with Internet addiction and social isolation, having also assisted 605 parents from the families involved.
According to the report of the “We-Connect’ Hidden and Internet Addiction Youth Service Project” program, launched by Sheng Kung Hui and subsidized by the Institute of Social Action, until June this year, 746 young people with Internet addiction and 313 isolated young people were detected.
Sheng Kung Hui, speaking to the Cheng Pou newspaper, highlighted that the lack of initiative to ask for help and the change in lifestyle habits among young people are posing increasingly greater challenges to monitoring cases.
The association's analysis showed that many families were slow to ask for help, making intervention in cases take much longer. “Families only sought help after discovering serious problems of isolation and their children's Internet addiction, which had already caused the deterioration of family relationships and the dysfunction of family dynamics”, he explained.
Furthermore, according to Sheng Kung Hui, students in Macau often owned personal cell phones “too early” and “without effective parental guidance”, and sought help only when academic performance was seriously affected.
“In these cases, young people present emotional distress and even their own parents express a great need for emotional support,” noted Sheng Kung Hui, adding that young people can also develop resistance to advice from others and experience conflicts with their family, thus showing the urgency of intervention services.
Internet culture is also profoundly influencing the life aspirations, consumption patterns and family concepts of the new generation of young people, the Sheng Kung Hui analysis argued.
He added that the Internet is closely linked to the daily lives of young people in Macau, and due to the widespread use of mobile devices, young people's entertainment and socialization patterns have shifted from the tradition of “going out to socialize” to “staying at home and interacting online”.
The organization found that the lack of socialization and strong adherence to the Internet are also related to changes in the societal environment, including “changes in the youth labor market and worldview, such as the growing development of emerging professional areas, where interests in the digital world can be converted into economic rewards, such as in the professions of influencers, YouTubers and video game players”, he highlighted.
In this sense, Sheng Kung Hui intends to develop more youth-centered services, planning to increase the frequency of organizing outdoor and sports activities, to strengthen emotional bonds with young people through their participation in activities.
The association revealed that it will also expand support for parents, including increasing channels for disseminating knowledge and advice on Internet addiction and young people's isolation.
Sheng Kung Hui also appeals to those in need to take the initiative to seek help. According to the association's program, the recipients of the service are children and adolescents in Macau, aged between 10 and 24, and their families.
In this case, according to Sheng Kung Hui, young people with Internet addiction are young people who “spend a lot of time involved in online activities, affecting their personal emotions, their studies or work and their family relationships”. Isolated young people refer to young people who “often stay at home for at least a month, or do not participate or interrupt social activities, or have a lack of communication with society”.</description><pubDate>2025-10-20 23:14:45</pubDate></item><item><title>Delegation from the Macanese Young People's Association visited Ningxia</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/10/20/delegacao-da-associacao-dos-jovens-macaenses-visitou-ningxia/</link><description>A delegation from the Association of Young Macanese (AJM) visited the Chinese autonomous region of Ningxia last week, between the 13th and 19th of October. The group was made up of more than 20 members and partners of the association, including António Monteiro, president of the AJM steering committee, José Sales Marques and Miguel de Senna Fernandes.
During the seven-day trip, the young Macanese had the opportunity to visit some of the most well-known and characteristic places in Ningxia and experience local culture in a “unique experience for the delegation”, as can be seen in a press release sent by the association. The program was “rich” and diverse, covering dimensions such as historical, cultural and even gastronomic.
In the first aspect, AJM highlights visits to the Museum and Tombs of the Western Xia Dynasty, the best preserved funerary site of this dynasty; the Helan Mountain National Nature Reserve, home to tens of thousands of cave paintings with more than 10,000 years of history; or the Shapotou National Ecological Reserve, focused on protecting the natural desert landscape.
As for cultural activities and immersion in the cultural community, there are visits to places such as the Zhenbeibao Western Film Studio, known for recreating ancient Chinese scenes for the film industry; Tonghu Grassland, where the group walked in the desert and watched a bonfire show; and visits to the cities of Wuzhou and Minning Village, examples of coexistence between ethnicities and China's success in eliminating poverty, respectively. There was also space in the program to visit the wine region of Chateau Yuanshi, which presented the group with a sample of the “best wines in China”.
AJM also says it has established “important contacts” with authorities in the region, such as the deputy director of the Department of United Affairs of the Ningxia Autonomous Region, Ding Wei, “thus allowing the promotion of Macanese culture” and the discussion of “the latest developments in the MSAR as a Sino-Lusophone platform and the exchange of possible exchange relations between Macau and Ningxia in the future”.
The association gives a positive assessment of the trip to Ningxia, while expressing the intention to “return with a next trip in 2026”. In addition to reinforcing “knowledge of developments in this region”, the statement notes that participants were able to “boost the presence, knowledge and integration of the young Macanese community in the Greater Bay Area, also promoting its cultural legacy and its role as an intermediary between China and Portuguese-speaking countries”.</description><pubDate>2025-10-20 23:09:24</pubDate></item><item><title>C-PLPEX with a record number of Portuguese-speaking exhibitors and Pelé’s “iconic shirt” on display</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/10/20/c-plpex-com-recorde-de-expositores-lusofonos-e-iconica-camisola-de-pele-em-exibicao/</link><description>The China-Portuguese-Speaking Countries Economic and Commercial Exhibition (C-PLPEX) kicks off tomorrow in Macau, with 320 Portuguese-speaking exhibitors and, in a “sporting touch”, the exhibition of the iconic shirt worn by Pelé in the 1962 World Cup. In the second edition of C-PLPEX, Deep Robotics, a Chinese innovation company founded in 2017, will present two robot dogs. These are “very mature products”, which can, for example, be sent to assess the situation in a fire scenario, a representative of the BPS Global Group, Deep Robotics agent in Australia, Hong Kong and Macau, explained to journalists. With its participation in C-PLPEX, highlighted Wong, the company has “Macau as a priority”, but doors can open to other latitudes. “We need to know if Portuguese-speaking countries are interested and if the parent company has any projects to expand and to which Portuguese-speaking countries”, added the person in charge, during a visit by journalists to the fair site, which runs until Saturday.
Deep Robotics will occupy one of the almost 500 exhibitors from China and Portuguese-speaking countries present this year at C-PLPEX. There were 320 exhibitors in the Portuguese-speaking world alone, which represents “a 23% increase compared to the first edition”, announced yesterday, at a press conference, the president of the Macau Trade and Investment Promotion Institute (IPIM). “A third are from Brazil, a third from Portugal and the rest are from [other] Portuguese-speaking countries”, added Che Weng Keong. The stands, according to Che, are focused on “the priority areas of Sino-Lusophone cooperation”, such as “cross-border electronic commerce, new energies, agricultural industry, food and beverages, professional services and the blue economy”. In parallel, this year, for the first time, the China-Portuguese Speaking Countries International Agricultural Expo will take place. Brazil, considered the person responsible for IPIM, weighed in on the decision to launch this new exhibition. "Brazil is a very large country, linked to food production, agricultural production and, taking this into consideration, we decided to hold this exhibition. In the interior of China, this [agricultural] area is very advanced and can have a good relationship with Portuguese-speaking countries", explained the president of IPIM.
The second edition of C-PLPEX will take place simultaneously with the 30th Macau International Fair (MIF) and the Macau 2025 Franchise Exhibition. Together, the three events occupy an area of ​​almost 30 thousand square meters and bring together more than 1,100 exhibitors.</description><pubDate>2025-10-20 22:52:32</pubDate></item><item><title>Taiwanese leader says peace with China cannot be achieved with a simple agreement</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/10/20/lider-taiwanes-diz-que-a-paz-com-a-china-nao-se-alcanca-com-um-simples-acordo/</link><description>Peace between mainland China and Taiwan cannot be achieved “with a simple agreement”, Taiwanese leader William Lai said yesterday, after the election of a new leader in the Kuomintang opposition party, which is in favor of dialogue with Beijing.

"Peace cannot be achieved through a simple agreement. Nor can peace be achieved by accepting China's proposals, such as the so-called '1992 Consensus' or the 'one China' principle", he declared, referring to the tacit understanding between the KMT and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), according to which both recognize the existence of "one China", albeit with different interpretations.
Lai recalled that during the term of the last KMT president, Ma Ying-jeou (2008–2016), the island's defense budget was reduced, while China's “grew at double digits, expanding its arsenal of missiles, ships and aircraft carriers, without there being any 'peace dividend'”.
In this context, he announced that Taiwan's Defense budget will increase from 2.5% to 3.32% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2026, with the aim of reaching 5% “before 2030”. “This not only reinforces security, but also boosts industry and the economy through defense autonomy”, pointed out the government leader, adding that, thanks to the “solid industrial fabric”, Taiwan is “well positioned” to become “a key part of the future global defense ecosystem”.
The statements come two days after the election of Cheng Li-wun as the new president of the KMT. Former Government Spokesperson (2012–2014) and former deputy, Cheng won the party's primaries with 50.15% of the vote, against 35.85% for former Taipei mayor Hau Lung-bin.
The new president of the Kuomintang (KMT), the main opposition party in Taiwan, said she was available to meet with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, aiming to resolve differences and promote cooperation between Taiwan and mainland China.
Cheng Li-wun won the KMT's internal elections on Saturday with 50.15% of the vote, far surpassing his main opponent, former Taipei mayor Hau Lung-bin, who obtained 35.85%.
In statements on the radio, cited by the state agency CNA, Cheng assured that the KMT will go from being “a flock of sheep to a herd of lions” under his leadership, and stressed that peace between Taipei and Beijing is “the most important issue” for the party.
The new leader also considered that the strategy of “using opposition to China as a political weapon” has lost its effectiveness in Taiwanese society, defending the need to “gather the greatest possible consensus within Taiwan” so that the party has “more legitimate representation on the other side of the strait”.
Cheng did not rule out the possibility of visiting mainland China or meeting Xi Jinping: “I am willing to do any work and meet with anyone necessary”, he declared, rejecting, however, that the KMT would adopt a pro-reunification position under his leadership. "All the candidates in these primaries claimed to be Chinese. My position on cross-strait relations has always been coherent and resists any scrutiny. It is, moreover, the historical position of the Kuomintang", said the leader, whose party's official name in Mandarin is "Chinese Nationalist Party".
After Cheng's victory in the primaries, Xi Jinping sent him a congratulatory message, in which he expressed the hope that the KMT and the Chinese Communist Party will “strengthen their common political foundation” and unite “the vast majority of the Taiwanese people to deepen exchanges and cooperation, boost joint development and move towards national reunification”. In the message, released by the official Xinhua news agency, Xi also called for safeguarding the “common home of the Chinese nation” and the “fundamental interests of the people on both sides of the strait”.
Cheng, in turn, responded that the inhabitants of mainland China and Taiwan “are part of the same Chinese nation” and argued that the two parties should strengthen exchanges and cooperation to “promote peace and stability”, according to the same source.
The KMT leader will take office on November 1, during the party's national congress.

The fourth plenary session of the Central Committee, which is expected to last four days, will serve to finalize the 2026-2030 five-year plan, a document that guides the country's strategy until the end of the decade. The meeting takes place in a context of trade tensions with the USA and ahead of a possible meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and his North American counterpart, Donald Trump, on the sidelines of a regional summit.
With around 370 members, the Central Committee normally meets seven times per five-year cycle. These sessions aim to reinforce internal cohesion around the party's agenda, and may also include personnel changes, although details will only be released later.
The full content of the plan will only be announced in March 2026, during the annual session of the National People's Assembly, but analysts do not anticipate profound changes compared to previous plans. According to Lynn Song, economist at ING Bank, “there is no reason to expect a radical disruption”.
The Chinese economy is expected to grow 4.8% this year, close to the official target. The housing crisis, industrial overcapacity and the trade war with the US continue to weigh on performance.
Priorities include stimulating consumption and private investment, controlling excess production and technological leadership in areas such as artificial intelligence. The commitment to self-sufficiency, particularly in the production of semiconductors, is expected to accelerate as Washington strengthens export controls. According to Ning Zhang, an economist at investment bank UBS, this will imply more Chinese investment in advanced technology.
Another key point is whether there will be more ambitious changes to the consumption stimulus policy. So far, Beijing has adopted gradual measures such as child subsidies, consumer credits and incentives for the renewal of household appliances and vehicles. Zhang considers that “stimulating consumption is more important today than ever”, but remembers that consumer confidence continues to be weakened by the collapse of the real estate sector.
Cases such as the price war in the automobile sector illustrate the risks of excessive competition. At the same time, the increase in Chinese exports to countries in Southeast Asia and Africa has generated new trade frictions with the US and other partners.
Since the Covid-19 pandemic, China has faced difficulties in recovering more robust growth. The housing crisis led to layoffs and reduced family consumption. According to professor Wendy Leutert, from Indiana University, the country continues to invest little in areas such as health, education or child and elderly care, which could stimulate domestic consumption. “Chinese leaders appear willing to accept economic costs in the name of self-sufficiency and technological leadership,” he wrote.
Demographics are another challenge: the population has started to decline and is aging more quickly. The youth unemployment rate is around 19%, according to official data, limiting the contribution of new generations to the economy.
Beijing wants to double the size of the economy between 2020 and 2035. “Like any other government, China still cares about growth and wants to continue to get rich,” said Zhang, who considers maintaining growth between 4% and 5% per decade “challenging, but essential” to sustain the party’s legitimacy. "What matters to the Chinese leadership? Stability, legitimacy and continued support", he concluded.

The guarantee was given to PONTO FINAL in response to complaints from some traders who lamented that there was insufficient time to vacate stores in the area. Shopkeepers therefore requested help and coordination from the Government.
In the reply, the DSF highlighted that, under current legal provisions, in the context of the return of pier no. 16, the land concessionaire is responsible for removing materials and infrastructure placed on the portion of land in question before it is returned, as well as vacating the building, removing people and materials from its interior.
Sociedade Ponte 16, the concessionaire in this case, is monitoring the progress of the vacancy, as well as the concrete organization given the situation of certain stores. “The competent departments will constantly monitor the respective work, depending on the actual progress of the return of the aforementioned parcel of land”, highlighted the DSF.
It is recalled that, last week, two store owners complained about the “confusion” and the lack of time to complete the move of four of their stores in Ponte-cais nº 16. The store owners said they had received notifications at the end of September to vacate the stores within a week.
Despite an extension of the deadline, they were unable to find new spaces for the move, as it is difficult to find an appropriate space to store their goods, including religious objects, such as statues of Kun Iam, they explained.
Ponte-pier nº 16, in Porto Interior, will be returned to the Government after a review of the land concession contract between the Government and Sociedade Ponte 16 – Desenvolvimento Predial S.A., which renounced the land, according to an order from the Secretary for Transport and Public Works in November last year. The plot is part of the revitalization plan for Piers No. 12A, 14 and 16 of Porto Interior, which will be advanced jointly by the Government and SJM Resorts, S.A..
Stores in the area were able to remain operational until the end of last month and many are now closed and even sealed.</description><pubDate>2025-10-20 23:10:09</pubDate></item><item><title>Seoul prepares to formally arrest more than 50 South Koreans for online fraud</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/10/20/seul-prepara-se-para-deter-formalmente-mais-de-50-sul-coreanos-por-fraudes-online/</link><description>Seoul is preparing to formally detain most of the 64 South Koreans repatriated from Cambodia for allegedly working for internet scam organizations in that country, South Korean police said yesterday.

The 64 South Koreans were detained in Cambodia in recent months and were repatriated to South Korea on a charter flight last Saturday. Upon arriving in Seoul, they were detained and the police are now investigating whether these people voluntarily joined coup organizations in Cambodia or were forced to work in them.
Online fraud schemes, many of which are based in Southeast Asian countries, have increased dramatically since the Covid-19 pandemic and have produced two types of victims: the tens of thousands of people who were forced to work in these schemes under threat of violence and the targets of the respective frauds.
Groups monitoring these activities claim that online fraud schemes yield billions of dollars annually to international criminal gangs.
South Korean prosecutors asked local courts to issue arrest warrants for 58 of the 64 returnees at the request of police, the Korean National Police Agency said in a statement.
Police added that the people expected to be detained are accused of engaging in online fraudulent activities, such as romance scams, fake investment proposals or voice phishing, apparently targeting fellow South Koreans in the country. Courts are expected to determine whether to approve the detentions in the coming days.
The police agency reported that five people had been released, but refused to disclose the reasons for their release, saying investigations were still ongoing.
South Korean police said four of the 64 returnees told investigators they were beaten while being held against their will by criminal organizations in Cambodia.
South Korea faces public calls to take stronger measures to protect its citizens from being forced to work in online fraud centers abroad, after one of its citizens was found dead in Cambodia in August.
The young South Korean was lured by a friend to travel to Cambodia, and there he was forced to provide his bank account details, which were used by a fraudulent organization. Cambodian authorities said the 22-year-old university student was tortured.
Estimates from the UN and other international agencies indicate that at least 100,000 people were trafficked to fraud centers in Cambodia, many more to Myanmar and tens of thousands more to other countries.
Authorities in Seoul estimate that around 1,000 South Koreans are in scam centers in Cambodia, and last week, South Korean authorities imposed a travel ban on parts of Cambodia, while also sending a government delegation to discuss joint measures.
Online scam centers were previously concentrated in Southeast Asian countries, including Cambodia and Myanmar, with the majority of trafficked workers coming from this region and other Asian countries.
An Interpol report released in June, however, revealed that over the past three years, victims have been trafficked to Southeast Asia from distant regions, including South America, Western Europe and East Africa, and that new centers have been identified in the Middle East, West Africa and Central America.

Toyota confirmed its fifth consecutive title in the constructors' world championship.


 


Everything is open for the last two races of the World Rally Championship in a fight for the title that will most certainly be between three Toyota men: Kalle Rovanperä, Elfyn Evans and Sébastien Ogier.


Rovanperä, sailed by Jonne Halttunen, dominated the Central European Rally, having benefited from the violent accident, on Saturday, of teammate Sébastien Ogier. They were both playing a game of cat and mouse when Ogier left the road and hit a tree, at a time when the asphalt conditions were highly treacherous due to the slippery surface. The Frenchman crashed violently, breaking the steering of the Toyota GR Yaris Rally1 and would only return the following day, to minimize damage on 'Super Sunday'.


It was the third victory of the season for Rovanperä, following triumphs in the Canary Islands and Finland. Toyota sealed its ninth world constructors' title. The Japanese manufacturer surpassed Citroën's eight and is just one behind Lancia. The Italian brand, which recently announced its return to the WRC with a Rally2, is still an isolated record holder.


"This return to asphalt was great. I think Séb and I had much better progress than the competition", said Rovanperä. The 31 points achieved over the weekend (compared to Evans's 25 and Ogier's 10) allowed him to regain ground in the world cup rankings. The Finn now has 234 points, the same as Ogier, with Evans remaining in first place in the standings with 247 points.


"It won't be easy to achieve victory in the championship, but at least we increased our chances with this result. We will try to replicate the performance in Japan", promised Rovanperä, who days before had announced that he will abandon the WRC to try to reach Formula 1. The young two-time world champion will begin this adventure in 2026 in the Súper Formula single-seater championship, in Japan.


The fight for the drivers' title will be three-way, taking into account that there are only two races left until the end of the championship (Japan and Saudi Arabia). Only a catastrophe for Toyota's top three in the world will give Ott Tänak a glimmer of hope. The Estonian from Hyundai finished in the last place on the podium in the rally that covered the asphalt of three countries (Germany, Austria and Czechia) and now has 197 points.


Elfyn Evans minimized the damage, as he never showed the pace to compete in the race with Rovanperä and Ogier. The Welshman, driven by Scott Martin, finished the rally 43.7 seconds behind Rovanperä, but collected good points that allowed him to regain the championship lead. Evans benefited from a slip by Ott Tänak in stage 17, precisely on the same bridge that put world champion Thierry Neuville out of the race – a strong crash that forced the driver and co-driver to go to the medical station, but without major consequences.


Ogier, who arrived at the Central European Rally leading the world championship, made up for Saturday's abandonment on Super Sunday. He was the fastest and also added 5 extra points from the ‘Wolf Power Stage’.


Highlight also goes to Takamoto Katsuta. The Japanese driver from Toyota finished fourth, followed by Frenchman Adrien Fourmaux (Hyundai), Finnish Sami Pajari (Toyota) and Irishman Joshua McErlean (Ford).


Luxembourger Grégoire Munster, the other M-Sport Ford regular, once again had a troubled rally. It went off the road on Friday, having broken the rear suspension of the Ford Puma Rally1.


 


Solberg doesn't slow down


 


Oliver Solberg was fastest in Rally2. The Swede from Toyota arrived at the Central European Rally already with the title of champion in the WRC2 category. Even so, he didn't take his foot off the accelerator and was the fastest among the Rally2 drivers. He finished the race in eighth place overall.


Solberg was not signed up to score points in WRC2, it was a kind of asphalt test for Rally Japan.


The winner of the category was the Czech Jan Cerny driving a Skoda Fabia RS Rally2. Compatriot Filip Mares (Toyota GR Yaris Rally2) was second while Italian Roberto Daprà (Skoda Fábia RS Rally2) was third.


The World Rally Championship now heads to the Asian continent with what promises to be the biggest battle for the drivers' title in the modern history of the WRC. The Japan Rally takes to the road between November 6th and 9th. The final round of the championship will take place in Saudi Arabia at the end of November. It will be the debut of the WRC in the Middle East, which promises double uncertainty for drivers and machines, taking into account the sandy terrain.


The race will feature the already announced return of Latvian Martins Sesks and the possible presence, driving one of M-Sport's Pumas, of Qatari Nasser Al-Attiyah, the legendary off-road driver, five-time winner of the Dakar Rally.</description><pubDate>2025-10-20 23:00:52</pubDate></item><item><title>Heritage as a language of peace</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/10/20/o-patrimonio-como-linguagem-de-paz/</link><description>Architect Maria José de Freitas participated in the general assembly of the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS), which took place this year in Lumbini, Nepal. The meeting sought to encourage participants to reflect together on the future, using heritage as a “language of peace”.

The annual meeting of the general assembly of the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) took place between the 11th and 19th of October. This year's meeting took place in Lumbini, Nepal, the city where Buddha was born. Maria José de Freitas was present at the meeting and told PONTO FINAL that the main message of the event was to place heritage at the service of peace, using it as a “vector of rapprochement between peoples”.
“A joint reflection was carried out that led us to think more positively about the future”, recalled the architect, noting that “heritage and culture can contribute” to this end.
Maria José de Freitas took advantage of the Lumbini meeting to talk about Macau, recalling that the territory has a “built heritage influenced by the Portuguese, Chinese and other peoples – and all of this is a stage that in its historic area is a world heritage site”. In Macau “you also feel and live with this cultural mix that is inscribed in stone”.
This, he argued, “is an important language to be transmitted in a period like the one we live in now, in which there is so much confrontation and in which there is so much cultural interference and the need to subjugate and dominate others; all of this must be the subject of reflection”.
ICOMOS was founded in 1965 following the publication of the Venice Charter in 1964. The general assembly also celebrated the 60th anniversary of the organization's founding in Lumbini. This year also marks the 20th anniversary of the inclusion of the Historic Center of Macau on the world heritage list.
This edition had the general theme “Perceptions of Heritage and Resilience”, with the subtheme “Risk Reduction and Preparation”. The meeting had several topics, from conflict negotiation, resistance to the forces of nature and elevation of heritage in order to be recognized as an important element in the context of world peace.
According to Maria José de Freitas, the communications shared on the occasion were based on the fact that they took place in Lumbini, a sacred place for Buddhists. Confessing that she is still "digesting" the message, the architect highlighted the "incredible symbolism" of choosing the location: "You can feel the magnetism of the place. Visiting the various temples, even if you are not a practitioner of Buddhism, you can feel the peace." “The deep truth is there and it is perceptible,” he said.
Lumbini is considered "one of the most sacred places in the world" and ICOMOS highlights: "Over many centuries, people have developed views of the place where Gautama Buddha was born. There are certain attributes and characteristics that are part of the common understanding of Lumbini. However, people have different perceptions, expectations and visions of Lumbini. They are all fragments of the overall picture of Lumbini. Bringing them together provides a more complete picture comprehensive view of the sacred site.”
Next year, the meeting will be in Malaysia. "We all know the cultural reminiscences related to Malacca. Malacca will be an issue to be addressed as it is synonymous with a shared heritage", he said.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Loss of control of cargo Boeing 747-481 investigated when landing in Hong Kong</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/10/20/investigada-perda-de-controlo-de-boeing-747-481-de-carga-ao-aterrar-em-hong-kong/</link><description>Hong Kong authorities are investigating the causes of an accident that occurred yesterday at the international airport, when a Boeing 747 cargo plane from Dubai left the runway and partially fell into the sea, causing two deaths.
According to Man Ka-chai, head of investigation at the Air Accidents Investigation Authority (AAIA), Emirates SkyCargo flight EK9788, operated by Turkish Air ACT Cargo, was authorized to land normally, but did not emit any emergency signal before losing control and crossing the railing into the sea.
The plane, coming from Al Maktoum Airport (DWC), touched the north runway (07L/25R) at around 03:50 local time, where it collided with a patrol vehicle with two workers before crashing. Both were rescued minutes later, but one died at the scene and the other at North Lantau Hospital. The four crew members of the freighter were unharmed and were removed through the emergency slide.
The Airport Authority's director of operations, Steven Yiu, assured that the vehicle “was in the authorized patrol zone” and that the weather and runway conditions were “excellent” at the time of the accident. According to Yiu, the two victims had more than a decade of experience in airport operations.
Data from the Flightradar24 portal indicate that the plane was traveling at around 167 kilometers per hour when it deviated towards the breakwater and at 91 kilometers per hour at the time of impact with the sea, which destroyed the front part of the aircraft.
AAIA opened an investigation to determine whether the accident resulted from technical failure, human error or an unforeseen operational factor. The police also do not exclude a possible criminal investigation.
The north lane will remain temporarily closed, with operations concentrated on the central and south lanes.
The Department of Civil Aviation and the Secretariat of Transport and Logistics expressed condolences for the death of the workers, stressing that “air safety is a Government priority”.
The incident is similar to the accident of China Airlines flight CA605 in November 1993, when a Boeing 747-400 left the runway at the old Kai Tak airport during a landing in crosswinds and heavy rain, ending with its nose submerged in Vitória Bay, with no casualties.</description><pubDate>2025-10-20 23:03:38</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
