The deputy argues that Macau has a “special duty of leadership and commitment to the global youth agenda”.

The International Youth Day, which was celebrated on August 12, in Kenya, was the focus of a written interpellation presented yesterday by Pereira Coutinho. The deputy argues that "the historical uniqueness of this date - whose origin dates back to the World Conference of Ministers responsible for youth, held in Lisbon, Portugal, in 1998 - gives Macau a special duty of leadership and commitment to the global youth agenda."
This year's celebrations gathered international youthful leaders, local authorities, responsible for formulating educational policies, UN delegates and youth development specialists. This meeting in Nairobi aimed to “foster the exchange of innovative solutions and good practices to reinforce international cooperation in the sustainable local development, enabling young people as architects of their own future,” said Coutinho.
"Considering the added responsibility that falls on Macau as territory linked to the Portuguese origin of this ephemeris, it is necessary to assess the concrete commitment of the masters" in this context, said the president of the Macao Public Function Workers Association (ATFPM).
Coutinho reports a study published in 2024 by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), which demonstrated that about 70% of young people inquired, claim greater access to sustainability training courses, quality employment opportunities, inclusive education and accessible health, and robust social protection mechanisms. Thus, the deputy asks the government what are the operational conclusions extracted by the Government of MSAR in the face of this international diagnosis and may be implemented in the short and medium term. “What specific and calendar measures will be implemented, in the short and medium term, to respond to these aspirations of Macanese youth, aligning Macao with the global standards of excellence in youth policy?”, He interrogates.
Recognizing the “central role of local celebrations in the sensitization and mobilization of young Macaenses”, Pereira Coutinho also asks which “structuring initiatives” that are being planned by the Government of MSAR, in partnership with civil society, to mark International Youth Day at the local level.
Coutinho suggests that the date be marked in Macao through “public debates and awareness campaigns on gender equality, mental health, climate justice and other critical topics for youth, activities in secondary schools and higher education institutions” or “sports events open to the community” and “cultural manifestations”.</description><pubDate>2025-08-19 03:31:55</pubDate></item><item><title>Licenses for airlines will cost a million patacas</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/08/19/licencas-para-companhias-aereas-vao-custar-um-milhao-de-patacas/</link><description>The government will charge one million rates of fee for future licensing and renewal of local airlines. In addition, passenger air transport operators must also pay an activity fee annually corresponding to 2% of net profits of the previous year. Companies will also be subject to a deposit of 15 million patacas.

Future airlines based in Macao will have to pay one million patacas to the government in the context of assignment of the commercial passenger air transport license. License renewal will cost the same amount.
The information is contained in an order published yesterday in an official bulletin, signed by the Chief Executive, Sam Hou Fai, who has the aforementioned rates pursuant to the new Civil Aviation Activity Law.
License assignment and renewal fees are paid to the Directorate of Finance Services (DSF), according to Estubado, within 30 days of receiving the notification for this purpose.
In this order is also defined the annual activity rate for future airlines in Macao, which will have to pay a fee annually that corresponds to 2% of net profits ascerted to June 30 of each year.
It is recalled that the Civil Aviation Activity Act was passed in June by the Legislative Assembly and will take effect on February 1 next year. With the legislation, the government expects to open “gradually” the Macao Civil Aviation Market, by providing the license assignment by public tender, ending the current direct and exclusive concession of the Air Macau Air Public Transport Service, since 1995. In the future, the activity license has been valid for a maximum period of 20 years and may be renewed.
The authorities, in this sense, intend to have more airlines in the territory in the future, which will enable the launch of more air routes between Macau and the abroad.
The government published yesterday three orders that regulate a set of amounts related to commercial air transport operations. However, it has not yet advanced further details about future public tenders for licensing, such as the date, process and number of licenses available.
In addition to licensing expenses, licensed companies are also required to provide a security in favor of the civil aviation authority, in the amount of 15 million Patacas, to guarantee the fulfillment of the obligations assumed and the fines that may be due under the license.
Already the revocation of the license of activity due to the licensed company provides for the full loss of the security provided, in accordance with the legislation.
The Government also determines the minimum amount of capital to obtain the air operator certificate, which is 600 million patacas for commercial passenger air transport operations. In the case of helicopter passenger commercial air transport operations or executive aviation operations will be 200 million patacas. The amount is set at 400 million Patacas regarding commercial load air transport operations on cargo aircraft.
The Air Transport Company Air Macau entered into with the government in March 1995, the contract for the granting of passengers, luggage, cargo, mail, and postal and macao or 25 -year -old postal orders, with the date of entry into service of Macao International Airport. It was an exclusive concession and Air Macau has since been the only local society licensed to operate at Macau airport.
In 2018, the government notified Air Macao that its exclusive rights would not be extended after 2020. However, due to the pandemic, it decided to extend the Air Macao concession agreement to ensure the continuity of air services to residents and visitors.
According to the Civil Aviation Authority, after the new law is entry into force, Air Macaucontinuates to provide flight services in the territory with the operating license.</description><pubDate>2025-08-19 03:34:37</pubDate></item><item><title>China accuses Germany of regional “exaggerating tensions” in Asia</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/08/19/china-acusa-alemanha-de-exagerar-tensoes-regionais-na-asia/</link><description>Beijing criticized Germany for allegedly being exaggerating tensions in Asia. At question are statements by the German Foreign Minister who said China is “increasingly aggressive” in the Asia Pacific region.

China yesterday criticized Germany who accused “exaggerating tensions” between Beijing and neighboring countries, after the statements of the chief of German diplomacy who considered Beijing “increasingly aggressive” in Asia Pacific.
A spokeswoman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs declared during a regular press conference that the situation in the seas of China from East and South "remains globally stable."
"We exhort the parties involved to respect countries in the region, solve problems through dialogue and consultation, and to preserve the common interests of peace and stability rather than provoking confrontations and exaggerating tensions," Mao Ning told a Chinese government reaction to the German statement.
"Taiwan's issue is part of China's internal affairs," he said.
During a visit to Japan, German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said the Asian giant threatened to "unilaterally change the status quo and change his borders to his advantage."
Wadephul cited, in particular, Beijing's actions in the Taiwan Strait and the Southern Sea of China and the East China Sea, where the country has sovereignty disputes with Japan and the Philippines, among other nations.
"Any climbing in this sensitive niggic center of international trade would have serious consequences for the world's safety and economy," Wadephul added at the end of a meeting with Japanese counterparts, Takeshi Iwaya.
In a statement published on Sunday, before the visit to Japan, Wadephul indicated that China "increasingly states regional supremacy and, in doing so, also questions the principles of international law."
"China's increasingly aggressive behavior (…) also has implications for us in Europe: the fundamental principles of our global coexistence are at stake here," he added, according to the same note.
Johann Wadephul also criticized “China's support to the Russian war machine” in Ukraine.
"Without this support, the war of aggression against Ukraine would not be possible. China is the largest supplier of double -use goods in Russia and the best client of oil and gas," he said.
Wadephul considered, before negotiations between US presidents Donald Trump, Ukrainian, Volodymyr Zelensky, and European leaders, that Kiev security guarantees were "crucial."
Friday's summit between Trump and Russian homologous Vladimir Putin in Alaska "clearly showed that for just and lasting peace, Moscow has to act finally. Until that happens, the pressure on Russia must be reinforced, namely through greater help to Ukraine," Wadephul noted.

Beijing Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said yesterday at a press conference that the Popular Republic of China expects all parties to reach a fair and lasting peace agreement as soon as possible.
At the summit held on Friday in Alaska between US President Donald Trump and Russian head of state Vladimir Putin, no agreement was reached for a ceasefire.
Asked about the meeting between Trump and Putin, Beijing's diplomatic spokesman stated that the Popular Republic of China supports all efforts aimed at a peaceful resolution for the crisis.
Mao Ning added that the Popular Republic of China "is pleased to see Russia and the United States" to maintain contact, improve relationships, and promote a political solution to the "Ukrainian crisis."
However, US head of state, Donald Trump, said that the Ukrainian counterpart could end "the war with Russia almost immediately."
In a declaration widespread through social networks, Trump dismissed Kiev's possibility to resume control of the Crimea Peninsula, annexed by Moscow in 2014, as he cannot integrate the Atlantic Alliance.
The Ukrainian President gather today with Donald Trump in Washington. After the bilateral meeting, a meeting with the various European leaders who will accompany the president of Ukraine is planned.
In addition to Zelensky, the French president, Emmanuel Macron; German Chancellor Friedrich Merz; The Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni; British Prime Minister Keir Stmerer and Nato leader Mark Rutte.</description><pubDate>2025-08-19 03:25:37</pubDate></item><item><title>South Korea and the United States initiate an annual miliar exercise joint</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/08/19/coreia-do-sul-e-estados-unidos-iniciam-exercicio-miliar-anual-conjunto/</link><description>South Korea and the United States began yesterday the large -scale annual military exercise to better deal with North Korea threats, which warned that the exercises would deepen regional tensions.

Ulchi Freedom Shield, which will last 11 days, is the second of two large-scale exercises performed annually in South Korea, after another set of maneuvers in March, and involves 21,000 soldiers, including 18,000 South Koreans, in computer-simulated command post operations and field training.
The exercises, which allies describe as defensive, can trigger a response from North Korea, which has long portrayed these military maneuvers as invasion tests and often uses them as a pretext for weapon demonstrations and tests, often associated with their nuclear program.
In a statement last week, the North Korean Defense Minister at Kwang Chol said the exercises show the posture of the allies of "military confrontation" with the north and stated that their forces would be ready to neutralize "any provocation that exceeded the border line."
Ulchi Freedom Shield comes at an important moment for the new president of South Korea, Lee Jae Myung, a few days old by the summit with US counterpart Donald Trump in Washington, scheduled for August 25.
Trump has raised concerns about Seoul that he can decide to make his decades' alliance, demanding higher payments for the presence of American troops in South Korea and eventually reduced it as Washington changes its focus to China.
Since his first term, Trump has been regularly asked for South Korea to pay more for the 28,500 American soldiers parked in its territory.
Public comments from Trump Administration officials, including Under -Secretary of Defense Elfge Colby, suggested a boost to restructure the alliance, which, according to some experts, could affect the size and role of US forces in South Korea.
In a recent meeting with journalists, General Xavier Brunson, commander of the United States forces in Korea, stressed the need for the alliance to “modernize” to face the evolution of the safety environment, including North Korean nuclear ambitions, their increasingly narrow alignment with Russia and what the military has designated as Chinese threats to an “free and open”.
Relations between the two Koreas remain tense, with the North ignoring various attempts to rapproche the new leadership in Seoul.
In his last message Pyongyang on Friday, Lee, who took office in June, said he will seek to restore the 2018 Intercorean Military Agreement, intended to reduce tensions at the border, and appealed to North Korea to respond to Southern efforts to rebuild confidence and reactivate negotiations.
The 2018 Military Agreement, achieved during a brief period of diplomacy between Korea, created buffer zones on land and sea and air exclusion zones above the border to avoid confrontations.

From tropical storms to high temperatures, data from Meteorological and Geophysical Services (SMG) indicate that the territory has been witnessing extreme meteorological phenomena with increasing frequency and intensity.
August 14, last Thursday, was the second most rainy day in the territory since there are records, according to data provided by meteorological and geophysical services (SMG) and analyzed by the end point. The record continues to reassemble on June 1, 2021, when monitoring stations in Macau registered 288 mm of precipitation-more 22.6 mm compared to 265.4 mm verified on Thursday.
The bad weather that was slaughtered over the territory led to the emission of this year's second black sign of rain, which remained in force for three hours and 48 minutes. This was the longest black signal since the implementation of the heavy rain signal system in Macao on September 1, 2020, divided into three impact levels: yellow, red and black. According to this classification, the black signal represents intense rain of about 80 mm, registered “over an hour in a vast area of the sinhers”, with the risk of landslides or very serious floods.
This was the case on Thursday afternoon, when torrential rains caused flooding in various areas of Macao, forcing the closing of roads, tunnels and roundabouts and motivating 55 requests for help to the authorities. The convergence of the peripheral circulation of the Typhoon Podul and a southwest air flow, associated with other factors, resulted in a rainfall “stagnant over the Cotai area for a long time,” the SMG explain.
Signs of tropical storm and intense rain signs were canceled on the same day at 6:35 pm. The typhoon's progressive removal and the influence of a high-altitude anticyclone slowed the rain over the weekend, but for a short time: earlier this week, a tropical depression originating in the Southern Sea of China again in Macao time and forced the no. 3 of storm.
According to SMG precipitation records, dating back to 1952, the rainy day in Macao occurred on June 1, 2021. In the period of higher precipitation, around 5 am, the SMGs issued the black rain signal from the new classification system the previous year.
Increasingly frequent extreme phenomena
 
SMG data suggest that extreme meteorological phenomena - such as heavy rainfall, high temperatures, and tuft passages - have been increasingly frequent and intense in the territory, especially from 2008.
On July 20, Typhoon Wipah forced the signal of sign 10 of Tropical Storm from 12:30 pm to 5 pm on Sunday, a day after signal No. 1 was lifted on Saturday. According to the authorities, never before the maximum warning sign had been issued anytime soon: before Wipah, the signal no. 10 more anticipated dated July 24, 1991, when the Brendon Typhoon pass.
Since there was a record, the maximum intensity tufts have passed through Macau: Hope, in 1979; Ellen, in 1983; Brendon, in 1991; York, in 1999; Hato, in 2017; Mangkhut, in 2018; Higos, in 2020. Wipah thus becomes the ninth tropical cyclone to require signaling of signal No. 10 since 1968 (when the creation of the Tupfiles Committee) and the fifth since 2017, pointing to increased maximum levels on the alert scale.
Considering the raising statistics of tropical storm signals published on the SMG page, it appears that extreme meteorological phenomena have been observed in recent years-especially since 2008, the year in which four signal tropical storms have been accounted for No. 8. km/h and 217km/h, respectively). The following year of 2018 broke a new record, when signal 8 remained raised for an unprecedented period of 138 hours.
In parallel, the dates of the first and last signs of tuft signals have been widening, starting soon and ending later. In 2008, the first sign of tropical storm was released on April 17, and by 2022 the alert period was extended until almost the end of the year on December 20.
Also the temperatures recorded in the region have been increasingly high. The year 2024 was the hottest since there are records, along with 2019, reached an average temperature of 23.6 degrees Celsius. The weather balance of the authorities also indicates that there were 42 days considered “hot” in 2024 (ie, with temperatures above 33 degrees Celsius), more 10.7 than the average.
The phenomenon seems to continue to apply to 2025, considering the data on July. Among the 31 days of the month, 18 were considered hot - an increase of 9.6 days compared to climate average values and eight days compared to last year's same period. There were also six hot nights, 1.2 more than the average.</description><pubDate>2025-08-19 03:35:39</pubDate></item><item><title>Dispute between siblings at the origin of alleged case of homicide-social</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/08/19/disputa-entre-irmaos-na-origem-de-alegado-caso-de-homicidio-suicidio/</link><description>A 60 -year -old resident was found dead yesterday after allegedly killed his younger brother due to a longstanding financial dispute. According to the Judiciary Police, the man got his brother's corpse at home for more than 48 hours and jumped from the porch when the agents entered his house to investigate the case.

A residential fraction at Fai Chi Kei was the place of a tragedy between two brothers-a middle-aged resident was killed by his older brother, who later committed suicide throwing himself from the balcony. According to the Judicial Police (PJ), the case of alleged murder involved a longtime financial dispute.
The younger brother's corpse was found at the alleged aggressor's home, and it is estimated that he died at least 48 hours ago.
Police investigation followed a request for help from the suspect's son, who accompanied his father home after an appointment at the Health Center, then prevented from entering the house by his father. The son, at that time, waved inside the house and saw a body in the living room, with bloodstains.
Around noon of yesterday, several police and firefighters were moved to the scene to be aware of the situation. When they open the door of the residence, they saw the suspect, resident in the 60s, jumping from the balcony of the house, on the 24th floor. The man was declared dead at the scene.
Authorities activated the mechanism for investigating serious cases and conducted a home search. According to the information advanced by the PJ at a press conference, after the investigation, no "evident signs" were found that indicate signs of fighting on the site.
The PJ said there was a "large amount" of blood coagulated on the floor of the living room, and the walls were covered with blood splashes. It was also found a metal pipe, 85 centimeters long and 3 centimeters in diameter, with one end of blood.
The autopsy verifies that the victim of the alleged murder had multiple fractures exposed in the left posterior part of the skull, and injuries are probably caused by “multiple aggressions” with a stiff object.
"The face and bone of the nose also suffered fractures, but in the limbs and body no injuries of evident resistance were verified. It is estimated that death was caused by bruise with striking object," noted the PJ.
The PJ spokesman added that, according to the information collected so far, the suicide lived only in a house on the street of Commander João Belo. The younger brother went to his apartment alone on Friday afternoon and never left. The suspect returned home the same day around 6 pm.
The PJ stated that the corpse was in a state of decomposition, so it will be subject to forensic examinations, and the authorities will still continue to investigate details on the financial dispute between the two.</description><pubDate>2025-08-19 03:33:42</pubDate></item><item><title>Sam Hou Fai challenges Shanghai technological companies to invest in Macau</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/08/19/sam-hou-fai-desafia-empresas-tecnologicas-de-xangai-a-investirem-em-macau/</link><description>The Chief Executive visited Shanghai yesterday, where he met with representatives of scientific and technological companies of that city. At the time, Sam Hou Fai invited these companies to bet on Macau.

Sam Hou Fai began a five -day visit to the interior of China on Saturday. After being in Zhejiang province, the chief executive went to Shanghai, where he had meetings with representatives of various scientific and technological companies in that city. At meetings, the boss took the opportunity to invite Shanghai companies to invest in Macau.
The boss was at Zhangjiang Science City in Shanghai, where he heard the presentation about the process of transforming that city into a "scientific and innovative center, the effectiveness of the reform and the great results obtained in science and technology." Quoted in a press release released by the government, Sam pointed out that “the conjuncture of the development of industries in Shanghai, the experiences of innovations, the creation of an integrated system of internationalization and industry-university-investigation, may serve as a reference to Macao in the development of the science and technology industry and the construction of the industrial park of research and development of science and technology”.
In meetings with representatives of Shanghai scientific and technological companies, Sam presented the “integrated advantages of the economy of Macau and its general planning”, including the “highly internationalized business environment”, the “Macau+Hengqin” model, the position as “a center, a platform, a base” and industrial park for science and technology development and technology, which is being prepared.
MSAR, according to the Chief Executive, "will also promote the development of singular industries to form with wingspan, providing entrepreneurs and entrepreneurs for developmental development tools." On the other hand, “Macao is boosting the diverse and adequate development plan of the‘ 1+4 ’economy, with the main aspect in the development of the five major industries, striving to uninterruptedly form new economic growth points, through the multifaceted approach and focused efforts on policies, human resources and financial capacity, and the top-of-the-art science and technology industry,” said Sam Hou Fai.
The mashed government statement says that “Sam Hou Fai enhanced the narrow, solid and potential relationship of cooperation between the two regions and, at the same time, the strong market awareness and advanced pioneering spirit of Shanghai entrepreneurs, being convinced that they will take advantage of Macao's new development opportunities.” "The Government of MSar welcomes scientific and innovative companies and qualified staff to invest and develop in Macao, creating opportunities for cooperation together," reiterate the MSAR authorities.</description><pubDate>2025-08-19 03:32:46</pubDate></item><item><title>“Zape with flavors” fair received 25,000 visitors in just two days</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/08/19/feira-zape-com-sabores-recebeu-25-mil-visitantes-em-apenas-dois-dias/</link><description>The “Zape with Flavors” gastronomic fair received 25,000 visitors between Friday and Saturday, the first two days of the event. The daily average of about 12,500 people far exceeds the projections of the Tourism Services Directorate (STD), which at the opening of the event pointed to four thousand daily visitors. The figures were advanced yesterday by STD subdirector Cheng Wai Tong in statements to the newspaper or Mun.
The fair initially had the scheduled duration of ten days, from Friday until 24th. However, the emission of the tropical storm signal No. 3 forced the temporary closure of space on Sunday, as a precaution to the intense winds that were felt in the region. Echoing the latest predictions of Macao Meteorological Services (SMG), which point to a week of heavy rainfall, Cheng Wai Tong does not rule out the hypothesis that the initiative will be prolonged.
However, the official recalls that the alteration of the event dates depends on multiple factors, such as “negotiations” with the co-organizer, the General Association of Macao Overseas Chinese (Agcum), and budget adjustments. It is recalled that the original budget for the initiative involved 3.6 million PATACA injected by STD and one million Patacas from Agcum.
Also according to the newspaper or Mun, the Zape gastronomic fair has as its main objective to “test” the possible problems, aspects to be in attention and ways of using space, determining whether or not it is suitable for the holding of outdoor events. The “preliminary observations” are positive, guarantees the newspaper, citing the “pedestrian zones” of Rua de Cantão and Rua de Xangai and the familiarization of residents with “night activities in the area” as the main advantages.
“Zape with Flavors” was inaugurated last Friday in the outer port landfills (Zape), with an opening time to the public from 3:30 pm to 10 pm. Subordinate to the theme “Flavors of Street Food in Food Truck”, the fair offers six rulots and 33 tents that, in addition to a “great local gastronomic variety and Southeast Asian specialties”, also sell handcrafted cafes, cocktails and wine. At the same time, the audience can enjoy the various interactive games and shows of music, dance and theater planned for the rest of the week.
The enclosure is divided into several sections, with a maximum capacity dining zone for a hundred people and facilities designed to take photographs. Participants who spend a minimum of 100 Patacas at the fair are also entitled to play for free on a claw machine, qualifying for prizes that include hotel discount coupons or “cultural and creative products” offers.</description><pubDate>2025-08-19 03:30:59</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
