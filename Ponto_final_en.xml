The city of Suzhou stated that Zhou Jiasheng, 52, stabbed the three victims because he was indebted and did not want to continue living, Japanese government secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi told journalists in Tokyo. The case was one of two knife attacks against Japanese children in China last year, which raised concerns about the increase of feeling against Japan in the country. Tokyo asked Beijing to guarantee the safety of his citizens in China. Hayashi stated that the court's ruling made no reference to Japan. "We believe the crime that killed and injured innocent people, including a child, was absolutely unforgivable and we made the decision seriously," Hayashi said. Employees of the Japan Consulate in Shanghai were present at the trial, he said.
The stabbing occurred at a bus stop at a Japanese school in Suzhou, on June 24. The bus waitress, Hu Youping, who tried to prevent the attack, died days later from her injuries. The Japanese mother and child were not seriously injured. In September, a 10-year-old Japanese student died after being stabbed near his school in the southern city of Shenzhen. Other knife attacks involving foreigners last year were isolated incidents, according to the Chinese government. In June, a Chinese man stabbed four American university professors in a public park in Jilin, in the northeast of the country, as well as a Chinese citizen who tried to intervene. In May, a knife attack at a hospital in southwestern China killed two people and injured 21 others.</description><pubDate>2025-01-24T01:06:06+08:00</pubDate></item><item><title /><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/01/24/flora-macanensis-une-culturas-em-exposicao-na-polonia/</link><description>The exhibition “Flora Macanensis”, by artists Cheong Kin Man and Marta Stanisława Sala, highlights the cultural exchange between Macau and Poland, revisiting the 1990 “Operation Dragão”, which legalized thousands of immigrants in Macau. Presented at the Katowice Municipal Library, the exhibition includes works that connect Polish historical figures with personal narratives, as well as interactive pieces and an experimental video.
 
Artists Marta Stanisława Sala and Cheong Kin Man recently presented their first joint exhibition in Poland, entitled “Flora Macanensis”. The exhibition was inaugurated on January 7, at the Katowice Municipal Library (MBPK), located in Bogucice, and included a one -hour conversation between the artists and the public, centered on Macao culture.
During the conversation, Sala and Cheong shared details about their collaboration with Lam Sio Man at the 2023 Macao Biennial. Lam, who was previously curator at the Macao Pavilion at the 2019 Venice Biennial, brought a third perspective to the work presented.
Among the exhibited works, there was a new work. A series of seven posters, also called “Flora Macanensis”. This series, manually printed and incorporating elements of the room family textile archive, tells the story of Flora, Cheong's mother, who fled the post-revolutionary boat China to the then Portuguese colony of Macao, where she was welcomed by refugees Vietnamese.
Additionally, another work by the artists, consisting of three textile pieces, combines the risky journey of Cheong's father, who was looking for a better life in Macau, with references to the Polish travelers, including the Jesuit Michał Boym and the adventurer Maurice Benyowsky, who was in Macao in 1771.
This textile series was first presented in the spring of 2024, during the duo's debut in Germany, Krakauer Haus, the only cultural mission of Krakow in foreign territory, in collaboration with the Nuremberg City Council and with the support of the Oriente Foundation .
The exhibition also includes a mini-book of science fiction art, called “Apocalypses”, written entirely in a fictional language with a translation into Polish, and commissioned for the Macau Biennale two years ago. Furthermore, an experimental video entitled “Pomnik do Noszenia” (“The Ready-to-Wear Monument”) was shown, where Portuguese navigator António de Abreu Freire shares an account of a brief meeting with the future president of Poland, Lech Wałęsa , in the early 1980s.
In addition, “Flora Macanensis” addresses the theme of the 1990 “Dragon Operation”, during which more than 50,000 illegal immigrants, including Cheong's mother, Flora, was entitled to Macao residence.
Furthermore, the exhibition highlights the connections between Macau and Poland, through the stories of explorers and other adventures. The duo of artists dates back to the publication of “Flora Sinensis”, a work by Michał Boim, published in 1656, which serves as the title and inspiration for the exhibition.
The seven -poster series and the three -piece textile series, titled “The Compass of Utopia”, are just some of the works that are part of the exhibition. Other pieces, such as “Ghost Money”, complement the show and highlight the rich cultural diversity that unites Macau and Poland.
“Flora Macanensis” will be available to visit at the Bogucice Library (Wajdy 21, in the city of Katowice) until February 28th, providing an opportunity to explore themes of identity, migration and cultural relations between Poland and Macau.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title /><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/01/24/hennessy-lanca-edicao-limitada-inspirada-na-designer-shuting-qiu/</link><description>Hennessy has launched a new collaboration for the Chinese New Year, the year of the serpent, with a limited collection inspired by Chinese fashion designer Shuting Qiu. In a fusion of fashion and luxury, the collection, called “Reimagion”, “is a tribute to the serpent, which represents the renewal and positive transformation, leaving behind the past and embracing new beginnings,” says a statement from Hennessy.
“Vibrant and abstract interpretations of a serpent circle in the designs of the bottles, using color and stamped splashes, such as the old patterns of Chinese brocades, to reflect the texture and scales of the serpent's body,” the company adds.
Shuting Qiu, originating from Hangzhou and currently living in Shanghai, was inspired by his cultural heritage. Based on the 'jacquard' fabric, the Chinese brocades and the embroidery traditionally used in the clothing and textiles of his hometown, Qiu reimagined the symbolic floral motifs and the abstract patterns of snake scales to adorn to brandy bottles V.S.O.P, X.O and Hennessy paradis. “With red -base colors, each bottle tells a unique story and, like a nod to Hennessy's inheritance, the swing's movements through the standards evoke the Charner River in Cognac,” says Hennessy.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Japan records record of exports in 2024 with commercial deficit to fall 44%</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/01/24/japao-regista-recorde-de-exportacoes-em-2024-com-defice-comercial-a-cair-44/</link><description>Japan registered an export record in 2024, with its commercial deficit decreased by 44% over the previous year, the Ministry of Japanese Finance said yesterday.
The commercial deficit, which measures the value of exports less imports, fell to 5.3 billion of yen (32 billion euros), according to government data, rewarding the value of imports increased due to the increase in costs of energy and increasing inflation around the world.
Exports of the third largest economy in the world totaled 107.9 billion of yen (663.9 billion euros), surpassing the mark of 100 billion yen for the second year in a row, and the highest amount recorded in comparable data, reassembling the 1979, the ministry said.
Some companies may have accelerated exports in anticipation of potential tariffs that new US President Donald Trump promised to impose. Trump said he hopes to put 25% tariffs over Canada and Mexico from February 1.
During the campaign, the new North American President threatened to impose tariffs on imports from China, although details about this eventual decision remain unclear.
In December, Japanese exports increased by 2.8% over the same month of 2023, while imports increased by 1.8%. Exports grew to Asian and European countries while fell slightly to the United States.
Imports from India, Hong Kong and Iran were the fastest growing. Vehicles, semiconductors and other machinery were the champions of the exports of Japan.
The weakening of the yen, another recent trend, has the effect of inflating the value of imports.
In the last year, the US dollar has been around 150 yen, sometimes exceeding 160 yen, while a year ago fluctuated around the reference of the 140 yen.
Japan has run a trade deficit for four consecutive years, but last year's deficit was considerably smaller than the 9.5 trillion yen deficit in 2023.</description><pubDate>2025-01-24T01:06:14+08:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Hotel occupancy grew almost five percentage points last year</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/01/24/ocupacao-hoteleira-cresceu-quase-cinco-pontos-percentuais-no-ano-passado/</link><description>The occupancy rate of Macau hotels was 86.4% in 2024, 4.9 percentage points more than in 2023, reported the Statistics and Census Service. Over the past year, hotels welcomed more than 14.4 million guests.
 
Last year, Macau hotels welcomed a total of more than 14.4 million guests, 6.4% more than in 2023, and the hotel room occupancy rate stood at 86.4%, 4% more .9 percentage points than in the previous year, indicated yesterday the Directorate of Statistics and Census Services (DSEC). The organization also indicated that the average length of stay for guests remained at 1.7 nights.
DSEC confirms that the number of visitors from visitors who arrived on excursions to Macau corresponded to about 2.1 million, ie, 63.8%, compared to 2023. Of the total, 1.8 million were visitors in triggers from coming from the interior of China, noting an increase of 57.1%. About 200,000 were international visitors in excursions, with an exponential increase of 157%. DSEC stresses that the number of visitors in South Korea excursions (91,000) and India (24,000) rose 226.4% and 302.2%, respectively.
Over last year, the number of Macao residents who acquired travel agencies to travel abroad reached 583,000, 39.1%, in relation to 2023. From these residents, 215,000 traveled on excursions - plus 87 %, compared to 2023-, 193,000 of which moved to the interior of China.
In December of last year, the number of visitors from visitors who arrived on excursions to Macao equivalent to 189,000 - another 13.1%, in annual terms - of which 163,000 were visitors from the interior of China - China - excursions - Another 9.5% - and 22,000 were international visitors in excursions - plus 50%. DSEC points out that the number of visitors in South Korea (11,000) and Thailand (3,000) excursions ascended 86.5% and 83.4%, respectively. For its part, the number of Macao residents who acquired travel agencies to travel abroad was 59,000 - plus 10.4%, in annual terms - 23,000 of which traveled on excursions - plus 4.8%.
DSEC also says that at the end of 2024 there were 146 hotel establishments that provided accommodation services to the public, four more compared to the end of 2023, providing a total of 43 thousand guest rooms, 7.8% less. During 2024, the average occupancy rate for guest rooms stood at 86.4%, 4.9 percentage points more than in 2023. It should be noted that the occupancy rate for 5-star hotels (88.6 %), that of 4-star hotels (82.3%) and that of 3-star hotels (83.8%) increased by 6.1; 3.1 and 3 percentage points, respectively.
In December 2024 the average occupancy rate of hotel stations was 89.9%, plus 4.2 percentage points, in annual terms.

Dinis also determined that all official documentation of the kingdom, previously written in Latin, if he started writing in Portuguese. One of the purposes of this measure was to remove almost total control over writing, especially official documents, from the hands of clerics. Few knew Latin, which meant that the administration of the kingdom, and beyond, could not be carried out without the intervention of members of the clergy who in this way extended their tentacles to practically all aspects of public life. Until the middle of the thirteenth century, notarial activity was almost exclusively in the hands of members of the clergy.
This does not mean that before 1290 it was not written in Portuguese. The oldest document written entirely in Portuguese, the 'will of D. Afonso II' (in the image accompanying this article), dates from 1214; It was written in Coimbra and there were thirteen copies of which two came to us.
Even before this document written entirely in Portuguese, there were documents where Portuguese words or phrases appeared in the middle of the Latin text, as is the case with the 'Notícia de Fiadores' of 1175. Some of these 'hybrid' texts are often difficult to classify , 'are they in Latin?, are they in Portuguese?' Such is the case of the 'Pact of the Pais brothers', an undated private document, which academics believe to also be from around 1175. It was recently suggested by a Galician linguist that this was the oldest document written in Portuguese, arguing that the Latin words and expressions in the document would be read ‘Romanesque’. To give an example of what this means, where the document says ‘homines’ in Latin, it would read ‘mens’ in Portuguese. This argument is not without merit, since many Portuguese words would be difficult to write, thanks to the evolution and appearance of new sounds that Latin spelling did not include. In the text in question, for example, the word ‘today’ appears written in Latin ‘hodie’. In the vernacular of the time, 'hoje' would be pronounced 'odje' and the transcription of the sound 'dj' for someone with little experience in writing vernacular could be somewhat complicated, so the hypothesis that the Galician researcher raises is not completely unreasonable . However, if the hybrid language in which this text is written results from an attempt to write Latin by someone who did not know Latin or from an attempt to write Portuguese by someone who had no experience in doing so, as the Galician researcher claims, in the past almost a thousand years, it is difficult, if not impossible, to determine the initial intention of the amanuensis of the text. Furthermore, the hypothesis that it was a draft to later be written in Latin cannot be ruled out.
This type of documents is normally classified as being written in 'barbarian Latin', an ungrammatical Latin full of Latinized vernacular words used by those who did not know Latin well, but had to write in Latin because documents in the vernacular at the time were not valid. official. The ‘Pact’ could also represent an extreme case of barbaric Latin. It is interesting to note, however, that this document already has completely Portuguese verb forms such as, for example, ‘helping us’, with the respective assimilation of the verb ending to the reflex pronoun ( helping ourselves → helping ourselves).
More or less on the same way is the 'news of Tordedo', a private document in Galician-Portuguese, full of Latin words and expressions that some believe was a draft to be converted later to an official Latin document; It has no date, but it is believed that it will be between 1211 and 1216.
Also from the same period will be the oldest poem of Galician-Portuguese troubadour poetry, the song of mockery and curse ‘Ora faz host’o Senhor de Navarra’ by João Soares de Paiva. This song, obviously, is not dated, but as the events to which it appears to allude, namely the invasion of Aragon by King Sancho VII of Navarre (1194-1234), suggest that it was written between 1204 and 1213, period of conflict between the king of Navarre and Pedro II (1177-1213) the Catholic, king of Aragon and count of Barcelona, ​​at a time of intense attempts to the unification of the Christian kingdoms of the Iberian Peninsula.
Galician-Portuguese troubadour poetry, which consists of the famous songs of friend, love and scorn-and-curse, spanned a period from the mid-twelfth century to the mid-fourteenth century. To this poetry with a profane theme must also be added the poetry with a religious theme compiled by Afonso X (1221–1284), the Wise, king of Castile, under the aegis of ‘Cantigas de Santa Maria’. The songs of troubadour poetry are the first literary monuments in the Portuguese language.
 
The beginnings of Portuguese spelling
Textual classification problems such as the 'pact's pact' are nothing more than the reflection of the difficulties that the authors of the old Portuguese texts felt when they had to write them. At the time, for those who wrote in Latin, there was a well-established spelling norm, while they tried to write in vernacular, especially words that, given the evolution of the language, became far from the Latin word in its origin, the task of writing vernacular became a challenge.
In this first phase of writing of Portuguese what imposed was the principle of phonetics, that is, words wrote as they sounded. The fact that Portuguese derived from Latin and that the relationship between the two languages ​​was to some extent noticeable, especially in older language phases, makes the application of the Latin orthographic norms to the vernacular if it had been charged with a significant part of the representation of the sounds of the new language. However, new words and new sounds whose relationship with Latin may be harder to glimpse, in these cases the person who writes has to exercise his judgment to be able to write the sounds that Latin does not contemplate. Still it is to Latin that Portuguese will seek, not only the writing system, that is, the letters, for the transcription of its sounds but also the writing rules of the same sounds; For example, the initial 's' is simple, but within the word it has to double ‘-ss-’, if you want to maintain your quality deaf consonant.
The vowels, for example, maintain the value they had in late Latin. The biggest difference that Romance languages ​​have in relation to Latin, with regard to the vocal system, is that the 'vocal amount', that is, the distinction between brief and long vowels, was replaced by 'quality', ie, ie, The distinction between open and closed vowels, an evolution that had already begun to have an effect on the late period of the colloquial Latin itself. In fact, the Romance languages ​​inherit from the late colloquial Latin of their respective regions their almost intact vowel systems (exception to the French).
The evolution of the consonant system, this yes susceptible to profound changes, led to some more changes to the vocal system, but nothing that caused the need to create new spellings.
One of the great features that distinguishes Galician-Portuguese from the other Romance languages ​​of Iberia, and of Romania in general, is the 'loss of the nasal and simple lateral in intervocalic position', that is, Latin words that had an -n- or an -l- between two vowels, in its evolution into Galician-Portuguese, they lost this -n- and this -l-, a loss that brought with it several consequences of a different nature, including changes in the syllable structure. This is too complex and technical a subject to be discussed here, so two or three examples will suffice to illustrate the point. The drop of simple -n- and -l- into intervocalic position led to the meeting of vowels that were previously separated by a consonant. Depending on the vowels in question, a diphthong could develop, such was the case of the verbal form ‘sai’, from the Latin ‘sali(t)’, which appears with the Spanish ‘sale’. But in most cases, the loss of intervocalic -n- and -l- caused the development of a hiatus. Gaps are phonetically uncomfortable and the language tends to resolve them in some way. This is, in fact, the explanation for the pronunciation of ‘aiágua’, instead of ‘water’, which is sometimes heard in popular language. One of the ways to solve these hiatuses was contraction when the quality of the vowels in hiatus was the same. Thus, the Latin word ‘panatariu-’ gives the medieval Portuguese ‘paadeiro’, which finally gives ‘baker’; the ‘a’ of the first syllable is open despite being in an unstressed position as it derives from the crasis of the two ‘a’s. The word ‘paadeiro’ also shows another typical characteristic of Galician-Portuguese vocalism, that is, the maintenance of the diphthong -ei- of secondary origin, compare the Portuguese ‘padeiro’ with the Spanish ‘panadero’.
The loss of the intervocalic nasal also led to the creation of nasal vowels and diphthongs. Medieval Portuguese unified three different Latin endings in the -ão ending. In the plural, however, this ending reacquires its three different Latin origins; the endings -ãos, -ães, -ões derive from the Latin -anos, -anes and -ones, respectively. Although these plurals can be described as irregular, from an etymological point of view, it is the singular -ão that is irregular and corresponds to the uniformization of two different medieval endings, namely '-on' and '-an'. Here we see how the tilde is the only ‘thing’ we need to add to the vowels inherited from Latin to denote the evolution of Portuguese.
 
New Consonant Sounds
Despite all the evolutions of the Portuguese (Galician-) Portuguese structure, the vowels inherited from Latin were enough to denote the results achieved. Already within the consonants, linguistic evolution gave rise to new sounds that did not exist in Latin and for which it was necessary to find spellings to represent them. The menu of consonant innovations is much wider than those of vowels and as such as much more complex and technical, let's see only a pair of examples.
The initial consonant groups pl-, cl- or fl- in Latin evolved into the tch- sound in (Galician-) Portuguese, for which it was necessary to find a spelling. Thus, the Latin words 'pluvia-', 'clave-' and 'flamma-' gave rise to the Portuguese 'chuva', 'chave' and 'chama', written with ch-, which was then pronounced tch-. The spelling ‘ch’ already existed in Latin but not to denote the sound ‘tch’.
Another example, which is still related to the loss of the simple intervocalic nasal, is the development of the palatal nasal - palatal nasal is that in the last syllable of the word 'spider'. When the Latin word ‘vinu-‘ loses its intervocalic, the previous one acquires the nasality of the lost and develops a palatal nasal; Thus comes the Portuguese word 'wine'. It was then necessary to find a spelling for the sound represented here by the letters -nh-. The various Romance languages ​​that developed this sound adopted different spellings to denote it; Medieval and Castilian Portuguese used the -ñ-, the French -GN- The Catalan -other hypotheses were to double the -NN- or, in the case of Portuguese, also the use of agá in -nh-, which Finally it was the solution that took revenge on Portuguese, despite the fact that, at first, this spelling was of very restricted use.
Although it will, for example, from Lisbon to Coimbra then probably take a good couple of travel days, the network that had existed among the various parts of the Roman Empire, remained at least partially after the fall on the side Western Empire. It existed like this, despite long distances and difficulties in traveling, a certain 'connection' between the nations that were part of the Empire and now spoke Romance languages. Religion and, in the case of southern Europe, the common struggle against the Sarracene enemy help to explain this “international” connection between different peoples and nations that emerged in post-imperial Europe. This also had influence on writing and many Romanesque languages ​​shared not only certain orthographic options but also the same oscillations in the representation of some sounds as their respective languages ​​have developed.
In the 'Cancioneiro da Ajuda', a parchment manuscript from the end of the 13th century, which contains a collection of 310 songs in Galician-Portuguese, there are for the sounds that are today denoted in Portuguese with the digraphs -nh- and -lh-, the alternative spellings -ñ-/-ll-, typical of Castilian, -ni-/-li-, typical of Provençal and Catalan, -gn-/-gl- typical of French and the spelling -nn-, inherited from Latin. All these spellings to denote the same sounds coexist in the same manuscript.
These are just a few examples of the many spellings that Galician-Portuguese had to adapt to accommodate developments from late colloquial Latin to Portuguese. In this first phase of the history of Portuguese spelling, the great concern was to represent in the written text the sounds of the language spoken on the streets. However, the stability that the orthography of any language requires would only be achieved in classical Portuguese.
 
Classical Portuguese Spelling
Around the sixteenth century, after the fall of Constantinople, the Renaissance and the Reformation, the invention of printing using movable characters, the discovery of the Americas and the road to India, episodes that mark the end of the Middle Ages and the beginning of the Middle Ages. Modern, the Portuguese language had already acquired the features it has today; Camões' language is basically the same as the one we use today. This does not mean that since Camões the Portuguese language has remained static, but the major changes that transformed the late colloquial Latin of the Iberian West into Portuguese had already finished their work.
The questions of how to represent the sounds of Portuguese were all, more or less, resolved and variations in writing derived mainly from variations inherent to the language itself, such as regional variations, pronunciation variations, etc., and sometimes variations in style or influences of other languages, such as, for example, Spanish or Italian through literature.
The Twilight of the Middle Ages brings with it the opening of academic education to non-clerics and the rebirth of classical studies. With the increase in the number of people who know how to write and the most liberalized access to classical culture appears a new concern, that of 'writing well'. Around this time, the Portuguese language, like the other Romance languages, suffers an influx of new Latin words, some of which come to coexist with old forms, such as the case of the old Portuguese word 'palace' that It becomes coexist with the new word 'palace', both derived from the Latin 'palatiu-'.
It is difficult to establish to what extent and since when people became aware of the etymological relationship between Portuguese words and their etymological origin, but from classical Portuguese onwards, 'writing well' meant using as many tone words as possible. classic and write Portuguese words as close as possible to the Latin etymology.
Just as in the Middle Ages, in the modern and contemporary ages, there was no fixed orthographic standard for the Portuguese language, the difference was that in classical Portuguese the representation of the sounds of the language was already well established. In the Middle Ages, for example, 'paço' and 'passo' were written with two different spellings because the two words were heterophones, whereas, in the classical period, the two words, which had already become homophones, continued to be written differently, not for reasons of a phonetic nature, but for semantic and etymological reasons and also because, in the meantime, a certain orthographic tradition had begun to impose itself.
With the development of modern society, the school, the university, the state institutions and the editorial houses were imprinting on the Portuguese language written a certain orthographic tradition. Thus, Portuguese spelling was finding its norm naturally based, above all, on the best practices of writers, such as Eça or Camilo, or the influence of institutions, such as the University of Coimbra. This orthographic tradition was mainly characterized by respect for the phonetics of Portuguese and respect, whenever possible, of the etymological origin of words. Thus, a word like 'grammar', which in the Middle Ages would be phonetically writing as 'grammatics', from the sixteenth century, the etymologizing spelling 'grammatic' becomes considered 'correct'. This is how the First Republic found Portuguese spelling when in 1911 decided to impose a spelling through the law.</description><pubDate>2025-01-24T01:06:04+08:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Tourism registers “positive trend”</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/01/24/turismo-regista-tendencia-positiva/</link><description>The Tourism Services Department (DST) yesterday presented an overview of the work carried out over the past year, highlighting that “the development of Macau's tourism industry has been registering a positive trend”.
In a statement, DST recalls that Macau registered more than 34.9 million visitors in 2024, an annual increase of 23.8%, with the number of visitors returning to 88.6% of 2019 figures, before the pandemic. The number of international visitors increased by 66%, reaching 2.42 million, recovering to 79% of 2019 levels. On the other hand, hotel establishments recorded an annual increase in the average occupancy rate by 4.9 percentage points, reaching 86. 4%.
The organization highlights the series of promotional activities nationally and abroad to attract visitors. For example, “tourism +” elements were promoted in the “Macao Week in Xi'an‧Shaanxi”, as well as the Central Government's support measures for Macau, and street promotions were carried out in several cities recently added to the “individual visa” program, along with promotions on the main social media platforms on the continent, launch of special marketing activities in cooperation with e-commerce platforms, among others. In the Greater Bay Area, in particular, multi-destination itineraries and tourist products on the islands were boosted.
Targeting international markets, several special offers projects were launched, and also organized street promotions and promotion seminars for tourist operators in various markets abroad, participated in important international tourism fairs, among others, promoting tourism de Macao in various forms, in conjunction with online platforms.
STD currently has 9.23 million followers in its 28 promotional accounts on social networks around the world. Last year, seven roadshows were held in Hong Kong and several international markets, which attracted more than 1.27 million visitors to the places.
DST also encouraged associations to organize diverse tourist activities in community neighborhoods on a monthly basis. Last year, 41 activities were financed and, according to data up to January 15th, they attracted more than 1.34 million participants, and the direct involvement of more than 2,100 commercial establishments, effectively attracting visitors to community areas, boosting consumption and the development of tourism in community neighborhoods.
The body also pointed out that the International Gastronomy Cities Festival attracted 107,000 participants and the Grand Prix Museum was visited by over 156,000 people, for example.</description><pubDate>2025-01-24T01:06:10+08:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Investigators ask South Korean MP to charge deposed leader with insurrection</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/01/24/investigadores-pedem-ao-mp-sul-coreano-que-acuse-de-insurreicao-lider-deposto/</link><description>South Korean authorities want the deposed president, Yoon Suk-Youol, to be accused of rebellion and abuse of power by declaring martial law in December. If Yoon is considered guilty of leading an insurrection, a crime for which a president has no immunity in the country, he may be sentenced to life imprisonment or the death penalty.
 
The South Korean anti-corruption office recommended yesterday to the prosecutor that the president, Yoon Suk-Youol, to be accused of rebellion and abuse of power by declaring martial law in December.
The Senior Officials Corruption Investigation Office (CIO) announced that it has transferred the case to the Public Prosecutor's Office, which has the power to formally charge a South Korean head of state.
Cio considers that Yoon conspired with then-national minister Kim Yong-Hyun and other military officers to start a riot, declaring martial law on the night of December 3.
It argues, moreover, that Yoon abused power by sending troops to the National Assembly (Parliament) to prevent deputies from revoking martial law. The Public Prosecution Service now has 11 days to decide whether or not to start the requested process.
If Yoon is found guilty of leading an insurrection, a crime for which a president does not have immunity in the country, he could be sentenced to life in prison or the death penalty.
Yoon is in custody at the Seoul Detention Center in Uiwang, south of Seoul, since January 15.
The Constitutional Court is simultaneously made a judgment to determine whether or not to ratify the dismissal approved by parliamentarians on December 14.
If South Korea's highest court confirms the impeachment, early presidential elections must be called within 60 days of the court's decision. Yoon, who refuses to testify in the investigation into the alleged crime of rebellion.

On the way to Goa, where he will mark the 30 years of activity of the East Foundation Indian delegation, Carlos Monjardino made a point of coming to Macao. The chairman of the East Foundation's Board of Directors will meet the new head of the Social Affairs and Culture portfolio, LAM, to try to promote greater cultural exchange between the Government of Masters and the Macao delegation of the Oriente Foundation, Bem how to highlight the importance of IPOR in the region. In an interview with the final point, he was optimistic about Sam Hou Fai and said the new chief executive seems to be "more accessible to projects with Portugal." Still, Monjardino stated that Macau "has not fully fulfilled the role of sino-illusophone platform." About the next 25 years of Macao's transition period, he anticipated a growing influence of Beijing in the region.
 
In these days in Macau, will you meet with members of the Macao SAR Government?
I'm going, with the secretary for Social Affairs and Culture.
 
What do you want to discuss?
There are always some things that are pending. I would also like to say something about IPOR [Fundação Oriente has a 40% stake in IPOR's activities]. Regarding the Foundation, I wanted to try to bring more things here to Casa Garden, some cultural events, and find out if we can work more together with Macau entities, particularly with it, which is responsible for the cultural sector.
 
Regarding IPOR, what will be discussed with the MSAR entities?
I want, once again, to draw attention to the importance that IPOR has for teaching Portuguese, which will greatly benefit Chinese students.
 
In November 2023, he said, in an interview with PONTO FINAL, that he would like the Foundation to have a more prominent role in the social aspect in Macau…
I also said that I realized that, after 1999, the local government wanted to have this responsibility before anyone else, so our responsibility in this area was reduced.
 
The margin of maneuver has diminished, but will there be something that can be done on the social aspect?
There is, there, but they are punctual and relatively small or poorly important things. For example, we help an association that deals with minors who has the responsibility of welcoming minors who have problems or cannot live within the family context and will live there and we, every month, support this institution.
 
In 2023 he also said that the Fundação Oriente would have to reduce its expenses. Has this had an impact on the Foundation’s work?
It's obvious that it always has an impact. In a cultural institution, the problem is not finding things to do, it is finding money to be able to do those things. Sometimes, those responsible for the Foundation's cultural area – as in all foundations – don't do much math. They want to carry out the actions, but they don't see what is necessary to be able to carry out these actions to a successful conclusion.
 
Any particular project that you would have liked to have carried out but were unable to do so due to these cost constraints?
No, I don't let projects advance too much, die in the shell.
 
In Macao, this spending containment was also noted?
Not here. The budget remains more or less the same thing. Sometimes delegates pull a lot to have more actions without thinking much "with what the bananas are bought."
 
Here in Macau too?
Here's all right.
 
Now aren't you going to meet the new Chief Executive of Macau, Sam Hou Fai?
No. I tried, but he has a complicated schedule and I will also be here for a few days.
 
Did you try because there was a topic you wanted to discuss with him?
No, it was just to greet it, since I don't know him.
 
Not knowing him, from what you have seen and what you have read, what is your impression of him?
It made me a good impression. I think it is more open to thinking about projects with Portugal, because it has a strong Portuguese base for having been in Portugal and studied at the University of Coimbra. It gives me the impression that you are a more sensitive person to projects with Portugal.
 
The new head of the Executive of MSA has said that it gives great importance to the Portuguese community in Macau. Do you think you can resolve the issue of restrictions on new requests for residence for Portuguese?
I hope so. Do anything for it, yes; Solving the problem completely can be difficult.
 
What makes the situation difficult?
I have no idea. There is a clear protection so that Chinese citizens can reach higher positions and this is certainly a concern that anyone in the position in which he would have.
 
There is also the issue of qualified staff that the Government wants to bring to Macau…
Yes, but they really have to be qualified staff. Before, everyone came, qualified or unqualified. In my time it was a case of whatever it was. Now, they make that selection and I completely understand why they do so.
 
Did you follow President Xi Jinping's recent visit here to Macau?
Yes.
 
The Chinese president talked about the role of Macao in the opening strategy of China, namely through the functions of Sino-Lusophone platform. Macau has fulfilled this role?
If you want it to respond diplomatically, I say the answer is, "Yes, Lord." If you want it to respond without being diplomatically, I say that it has not fully fulfilled the role of Sino-Misophone platform.
 
What does this be?
No materialized results appear, always fall short of what I expected. Namely business, Portuguese investment here. The important investment is not made through Macau, is made directly between China and Portugal and does not pass through Macau, and should pass. The government could do more in this regard.
 
How do you expect the Macao SAR to develop in the second half of the transition period, until 2049? How do you imagine Macau in 2049?
I hope that progressively China will occupy Macao in terms of influence, which is no longer little. The president of China will want, within his term, to reunite the homeland, that is, with Taiwan.
 
Does this have consequences for Macau?
For sure.
 
Imagine a more diluted macao on the Chinese continent and, consequently, with fewer characteristics of its own?
Yes. But it is natural that this happens, it is not a criticism. It's something I think will happen naturally.
 
But wasn't it supposed until 2049 didn't change much?
It was supposed not to change much. It may not change much, but it will change something.
 
How do you look at this trajectory? Do you agree that it may be, or would you prefer Macau to maintain all its distinctive elements until 2049?
I would prefer Macau to maintain its own characteristics for as long as possible.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>New cross-border trafficking patterns from Thailand to Myanmar</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/01/24/novos-padroes-de-trafico-transfronteirico-da-tailandia-para-myanmar/</link><description>The recent revelation and rescue of mainland actor Wang victims and took them to work in inhumane conditions on fraudulent farms in Myanmar. New patterns of cross-border trafficking of people from mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and even Macau have been identified.
Firstly, the victims were deceived through social networks and the internet, where elements of organized crime promised them jobs in Thailand, Thaiwan or Japan, but as soon as they arrived in Thailand, they were kidnapped and transferred to work on agricultural exploits Fraudulent in the eastern part of Myanmar, where his family members were contacted and intimidated with redemptions. Some cases revealed that the victims were released after the payment of large redemptions. However, the payment of redemptions does not necessarily guarantee your return on security.
Secondly, as the economy of mainland China and even Hong Kong has recently entered a decline in the post-Covid era, some victims, who have fallen into the clutches of cross-border trafficking syndicates in Thailand and Myanmar, naively believed that they could find employment in Thailand, where their geographic proximity to eastern Myanmar via land and sea routes meant they could be kidnapped with relative ease.
Thirdly, organized crime elements deceived targets in Hong Kong, even paying for their plane tickets to Thailand. When the targets arrived in Thailand, they were kidnapped and transferred to work on fraudulent farms. It has been reported that trafficking syndicates consider Hong Kong victims to be more educated and that they deploy them to work in more advanced activities, such as those related to information technology.
Fourth, although the trafficking of mainland Chinese into Myanmar is not new, what is new is the cross-border trafficking into eastern Myanmar following the crackdown on local warlords by the Myanmar military in northern Myanmar, where a large number of mainland Chinese were abducted, exploited and eventually released and returned to the mainland in 2024. In other words, the location of the fraudulent exploitations has shifted from the northern areas to the eastern regions, where Chinese police find it impossible to cross the border and penetrate criminal syndicates, unlike what happens in northern Myanmar.
The 22 -year -old Wang Xing's case revealed the functioning of transf by (The Guardian, January 14, 2025). He communicated with people at Wechat and was fooled to work in a large Thia entertainment company. A Chinese "employee" from this company received him at Suvarnabhumi airport in Bangcoque, where he drove him for five hundred kilometers to Mae Sot in western Thailand. Mae Sot is located at the Thai border with Myanmar, across the Burmese city called Myawaddy, which is a famous place for telecommunications frauds and on the internet.
Wang Xing's situation was lucky, as his girlfriend used social media in mainland China to draw attention to his disappearance. His messages were shared and circulated by mainland Chinese celebrities, alerting Chinese consular officials in Thailand and demanding Thai police intervention to quickly rescue him. Wang revealed that the working environment in Myawaddy was extremely dangerous as he was unable to sleep or urinate. Myawaddy is a convenient location for human trafficking and fraudulent exploitation. Geographically, it is linked to Bangkok by land and sea routes, thus facilitating the process of human trafficking and concealment.
Following the Wang case, police cooperation between China and Thailand led to the rescue and release of twelve mainland Chinese, including a mainland Chinese male model who lost contact for more than 20 days (Sing Tao Daily, January 18 2025).
The Wang Xing case also exposed twenty -eight cases of people from Hong Kong whose family members requested the assistance of the Hong Kong government (Oriental Daily, January 16, 2025). These people were also victims of human trafficking for Myanmar. The Hong Kong government stated that from August 2024 to January 2025, sixteen from twenty -eight cases were released, but eleven people are still in Myanmar and a case in Cambodia. Two women who were released told Hong Kong police that they knew a woman in Hong Kong and who offered them free plane tickets to participate in a Thailand tour in late December. But after arriving in Thailand, they were sent to a fifth fraudulent after 10 hours of land and maritime transport. The family members of the two kidnapped women paid a ransom for their eventual release. Hong Kong's police authorities arrested a woman from Hong Kong for allegedly deceived two other women to go to Thailand.
According to the Macau police, between September and December 2024, five people from Macau were kidnapped to work in the fraudulent exploitation of Myanmar. Four of them were rescued and one escaped the fraud syndicate and managed to return to Macau. The Macau Police appealed to Macau citizens not to trust comments from strangers on the Internet, especially those who appeal to Macau citizens to work in foreign countries (San Wa Ou Newspaper, January 13, 2025).
A delegation headed by Deputy Secretary for Security, Michael Cheuk, along with police and immigration services, went to Thailand on January 14 to discuss with the Thai police the cases of victims of Hong Kong. After a 25 -year -old Hong Kong was rescued and returned to Hong Kong, Security Secretary Chris Tang expressed his gratitude to the Thai government for his assistance. Hong Kong's victim told police that they had promised him $ 120,000 from Hong Kong if he could bring Thai jewelry to Thaiwan, but had been kidnapped to a fifth fraudulent in Myanmar as soon as he arrived in Thailand (Wen Wei Po, 17 January 2025).
On January 16, 2025, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with ten ambassadors from Asean countries in Beijing and appealed to Southeast Asia countries to worry more about the phenomenon of Chinese transionic trafficking. He hoped the countries concerned to assume the responsibility to adopt strict measures to combat the burla in line, to protect the lives of ordinary people, and to protect interests not only from Chinese citizens, but also from citizens of other countries.
On January 16, it was reported that the Karen Border Guard Force announced a crackdown on fraudulent operations following a meeting with the Karen Democratic Benevolent Army and local Chinese businesspeople. The leader of the Karen Border Guard Force, Colonel Saw Chit Thu, has close relations with the Myanmar military. He promised to end human trafficking and other criminal activities (see: Revelation of the founder of the Yatai city of Myawaddy: The two-faced life of She Zhijiang poisons Chinese “piglets” – China – 點新聞-dotdotnews). It appears that Myanmar authorities have told Colonel Saw to crack down on the fraudulent parks that have victimized many Chinese.
On January 17, the Global Times reported that following the Wang Xing case, public security authorities are now investigating a human trafficking criminal syndicate based in Myawaddy. This union has been attracting Chinese people to work at the site since December 2024.
A rapt but later released Taiwanese victim revealed that the ups responsible for the Myawaddy criminal organization are Chinese from the continent (Eastern Daily, January 18, 2025). In fact, it has been reported that the founder of Myawaddy Yatai City, who has a large complex of scams, is She Zhijiang, a continental Chinese born in Hunan, who obtained Cambodian nationality in 2017 and was detained in Thailand in August 2022 on suspicion of illegal exploitation of transfronical meal games. The city of Yatai has become a place where gambling persists, burles and other illicit activities persist. She Zhijiang has been criticized as one of the possible mentors of the so -called “park kk”, which has been involved in human and even organ trafficking (see: revelation of the founder of the city Yatai de Myawaddy: The Life of two faces of She Zhijiang Poison Chinese “piglets”-China-點新聞 -Dotdotnews). It has been reported that in the city of Yatai, there are over 20,000 Chinese continental "piglets", which refer to people who have fallen into the hands of scam and fraud factories.
Although She Zhijiang had already been detained by Thai authorities, his remnants and followers may have revitalized the scam parks, thus victimizing many Chinese who were smuggled to work as slaves.
Overall, the Wang Xing case exposed many other cases of cross-border trafficking of Chinese nationals to work in Myanmar's fraudulent parks through their visits to Thailand. It is urgent that the Thai authorities resolve the problem of organized crime elements who have kidnapped Chinese visitors to work on the fraudulent Myawaddy farms. Hong Kong singer Eason Chan canceled his concert in Bangkok in February, followed by many Chinese canceling their visits and tours to Thailand – a huge blow to Thai tourism immediately. If Thailand's image as a tourist hub has been damaged by the cross-border trafficking scandal, the Thai government and police must accelerate the process of combating organized crime elements involved in trafficking Chinese visitors, including those from mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. Furthermore, Myanmar authorities must crack down on the notorious Myawaddy scam parks, which have become the main source of cross-border trafficking. On the other hand, in addition to cross-border police cooperation, authorities in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan must, more than ever, educate their citizens about the need to guard against the possibility of being easily deceived. by strangers through social media and connections. These multiple strategies from Thailand, Myanmar and the Greater China regions must be adopted to more effectively combat cross-border trafficking and transnational online scams.</description><pubDate>2025-01-24T01:06:04+08:00</pubDate></item><item><title>China and Brazil highlight “growing consensus” to find a political solution</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/01/24/china-e-brasil-destacam-consenso-crescente-para-encontrar-solucao-politica/</link><description>The head of Chinese diplomacy, Wang Yi, yesterday highlighted the “growing consensus of all parties to promote a political solution” to the war in Ukraine, during a telephone conversation with Brazilian special advisor Celso Amorim.

Wang also expressed his hope to “work with Brazil to defend genuine multilateralism”.
Amorim called for efforts to “build a community of common destiny between Brazil and China for a fairer world and a more sustainable planet”. “Brazil and China, as emerging powers, can further strengthen cooperation and play a greater role in maintaining world peace and combating climate change,” stated the special advisor to the Brazilian Presidency.

The Chinese market was the destination of 30% of Brazilian exports in 2023, when sales to the Asian country totaled $ 104 billion (100 billion euros), consisting mostly of food and raw materials.
China, in turn, maintains investments in Brazil of around 40 billion dollars (38.4 billion euros), which in recent years have been invested in the energy sector.</description><pubDate>2025-01-24T01:06:06+08:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Xia Baolong met with Raymond Tam in Beijing</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/01/24/xia-baolong-reuniu-se-com-raymond-tam-em-pequim/</link><description>A delegation led by the Secretary for Transport and Public Works, Raymond Tam, was in Beijing and held a meeting yesterday with Xia Baolong, director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office of the State Council.

In addition, three fire engines will also provide cross-border relief services in Guangdong. Firefighters also revealed that, last year, fire exits increased by 5.5% to 882 cases.
 
Following the launch of the Hong Kong Transfrontic Ambulance Service, Macau is now working with China's interior authorities to make a relief services between the Territory and Guangdong province in the future.
The Fire Department (CB) already has three ambulances to be used in the Experimental Transpassy Transport Plan in Ambulance between Hong Kong and Macau. The body has revealed that it plans five more ambulances, as well as three fire brigade vehicles, to perform the transionic relief tasks in the future between Guangdong and Macau, “in order to realize a two -place relief team in the future and establish a base for the feasibility of transfronical support ”.
Leong Iok Sam, commander of the CB, recalled that the Governments of Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau signed in June last year the Framework Agreement on Cooperation on Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Emergency Management and Greater Bay Area Emergency Rescue Actions .
"We have performed a transfrontic transportation exercise of patients in an ambulance between Hong Kong and Macau, with the border passage elapsed without problems," said Leong Iok Sam at a press conference held yesterday. The official added that the province of Guangdong and Macau prepared five ambulances with double enrollment. “There are no problems for vehicle circulation between both sides, but we have to cooperate with the work of the medical team, which involves various departments. We are actively working on the subject, ”he said.
It is recalled that the cross-border ambulance pilot plan between Hong Kong and Macau was inaugurated at the end of November last year, lasting one year. According to the Executive's presentation, patients with specific needs and whose clinical conditions are considered adequate can be transferred directly between certain hospitals in the Macau and Hong Kong regions. If there is no need to transfer from one ambulance to another at the border post, it will be possible to reduce the risks that may occur during the transfer.
 
Fire and ambulance exits continue to rise
 
On the occasion of a lecture with the media, the firefighters also released the data of last year's operational activities. The total number of all events over 2024 had 54,133 cases, which represented a rise of 1,448 cases (2.75%) compared to those recorded in the previous year.
The total exit of fire from CB last year was 882 cases, an increase of 5.5% compared to the year 2023. The reasons for the fire are essentially forgetting to turn off the stove, short circuit of the electrical installations, burning of incense and candles/votive papers, non -fully extinguished flames and mechanical/equipment failures, “with 586 cases, which presented 66.44% of the total number of fire exit”, analyzed the CB.
The cases of ambulance exits in 2024 accounted for 45,236 occurrences, equivalent to an increase of 2,177 cases compared to the previous year, ie a rise of 5.06%. Authorities pointed out that the reason for the climb was mainly due to the increase in cases of indisposition with dizziness and headache.
Rescue work resulted in 1,792 cases, 30 fewer incidents year-on-year, with a decrease of 1.65%. Rescue tasks were mainly helping to open doors and helping to treat the injured. Furthermore, the removal of fallen objects and cleaning of floors/oil residue dominated the output of special fire services, which accounted for 6,223 cases, a significant reduction of 745 cases compared to 2023.</description><pubDate>2025-01-24T01:03:01+08:00</pubDate></item><item><title>China orders funds to buy more shares to streamline markets</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/01/24/china-ordena-fundos-a-comprar-mais-accoes-para-dinamizar-mercados/</link><description>The Chinese government announced yesterday that it will order the funds of pension and investment to buy more actions of Chinese companies, to stimulate the country's financial squares after years of doldrums.
 
Authorities said that starting this year, mutual funds must increase their holdings in domestic shares, called A shares, by at least 10% per year for the next three years.
Commercial insurance funds will have to invest 30% of their new annual premiums in equity markets from this year, they added. “This means that at least several hundred billion yuan of long-term funds will be added [to the stock market] every year,” said Wu Qing, chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission. “Implementation of the various measures in the plan will further increase the capital allocation capacity of medium and long-term funds, constantly expand the scale of investment, improve the supply and structure of funds in the capital market and consolidate good conditions for the recovery of the capital market”, he explained.
The Chinese Communist Party announced this measure just before China's biggest holiday of the year, Lunar New Year, which begins on Wednesday, January 29. This is a time when families tend to increase spending on meals, travel and cash gifts for children and young adults.
Hong Kong and Shanghai markets rose after the announcement, with the Shanghai Index composite initially winning about 1.5%, although in the middle of the session it was rising 0.8%. Hang Seng Kong's Hang Seng Index lost its first gains and remained virtually unchanged.
Chinese stock markets reached their peak value before the Asian financial crisis and have since remained well below that level. The lack of appreciation in stock prices, coupled with falling property prices, has diminished investor confidence, raising deflationary risks in the world's second largest economy.
To date, the Chinese government's efforts to get people to spend more and save less have had limited success. An initiative to promote the purchase of energy-efficient vehicles and appliances by paying subsidies to consumers who deliver older versions of these items increased sales. But share prices have stalled after a brief recovery late last year.
Wu stated that pension funds will be required to reformulate the way they evaluate their performance and that companies will be encouraged to perform more action repurchase and pay higher dividends to provide better income to shareholders. “This is a very important institutional advance for the entry of medium and long term funds in the market. It can be said that it solves a problem that has been solved for many years, ”he added. "Sales of the main shareholders and the high market volatility have damaged Chinese financial squares," said Law Meng, Chinese action analyst at UBS Securities, in a comment widespread yesterday. "The willingness of long -term investors to participate in the scholarship market has decreased," he added. "The proposal of reform of market value management directly addresses this issue, because it is directly related to the sense of gain of investors," he said.
 
Beijing says customs rates do not benefit China, USA or the world
 
The Chinese Ministry of Commerce stated yesterday that the United States' imposition of customs duties on Chinese goods "did not benefit China, the United States or the world", in the face of threats from US leader Donald Trump. Ministry spokesman He Yadong said at a press conference that his country “has always maintained a consistent position” on increasing rates. "China is willing to work with the US to put economic and trade relations between the two countries in a stable, healthy and sustainable direction," he said. Asked whether his ministry has already communicated with the new US administration's commercial team, He said that China “always maintains contact with the competent authorities” in the United States. Chinese diplomats assured on Wednesday that “there are no winners in a trade war”, after Trump said he was considering imposing 10% duties on Chinese imports in retaliation for the flow of fentanyl. “We're talking about a 10% rate based on the fact that they're shipping fentanyl to Mexico and Canada,” Trump told reporters at the White House on Tuesday. The Republican leader said that he spoke “the other day” with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, and that he told him that he did not want that “crap” in the country. Last year, around 70,000 deaths were recorded in the United States due to the consumption of that synthetic opioid. Members of Trump's team on Monday included China, along with Canada and Mexico, among the countries whose trade relationship with the US would be reviewed by the Republican, who launched a trade war against the Asian nation during his first term ( 2017-2021).</description><pubDate>2025-01-24T01:06:08+08:00</pubDate></item><item><title>China supports Cape Verde with 26.3 million to finance projects in several areas</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/01/24/china-apoia-cabo-verde-com-263-milhoes-para-financiar-projectos-em-varias-areas/</link><description>China has signed an agreement with Cape Verde to support the archipelago with 26.3 million euros for security projects, renewable energy, digital economy, tourism and infrastructure, reinforcing bilateral cooperation between the two countries.
 
“We provide this support to Cape Verde”, to finance projects in the “domains of renewable energy, blue economy, digital, tourism and to help” the country to “achieve its objectives in priority areas”, stated the Embassy’s charge d’affaires of China in Cape Verde, Shi Leike, at the agreement signing ceremony, in the city of Praia.
The agreement was signed by the charge d'affaires and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs of Cape Verde, Myrian Vieira. Shi Leike considered that Cape Verde is “worldwide recognized as a country of good governance” and recalled its long-standing friendship with China. “Last year, bilateral relations between China and Cape Verde were elevated to a strategic partnership during the visit of the Prime Minister, Ulisses Correia e Silva, to China,” he said.
The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs considered that this agreement translates the "excellence of bilateral relations between the two countries." “This is also the implementation of commitments agreed last September at the Africa-China Cooperation Forum”, where the support of 26.3 million euros in Cape Verde was announced, he said.
Myrian Vieira stated that the amount will support the continuity of the third phase of the “safe city” project, which is a priority for Cape Verde, as it aims to reinforce the country's internal security, with the update and expansion of the video surveillance system in seven cities: Praia , Mindelo, Sal Rei, Santa Maria, Tarrafal, Assomada and Porto Novo.
The project will also reinforce the training of technicians to operate this equipment and maintain surveillance command centers.
Furthermore, other projects in the field of education, health and other infrastructure of vital importance for the development of Cape Verde will be discussed with the Chinese side. “China has contributed to the development of Cape Verde over these 49 years of bilateral cooperation, being an important strategic partner in the fields of education, health, agriculture, new information and communication technologies and renewable energy. We really want to take these relationships to increasingly higher levels of excellence”, he concluded.
In May last year, the two countries signed a protocol for six years (2024-2029) in the area of ​​health that continues cooperation and support for the sector with medical teams traveling to the archipelago.
China is the largest commercial partner on the African continent, with bilateral trade reaching $ 167.8 billion (151.8 billion euros) in the first half of 2024, according to the Chinese official press.

Trump took an oath for the second time to serve as president of the United States, the first president to serve two non-consecutive terms of Grover Cleveland in the late nineteenth century. Whatever my personal feelings, Trump got the biggest political turnaround in US history. Trump has pledged to declare a national emergency that allows him to close the border, use US troops to conduct these operations and scan in American cities to arrest without document. Trump has pledged to arm the Justice Department and to use the agency to process its political enemies, including generals, old and current holders of public office, former presidents and their families, journalists and anyone else he claims to have him “Crossed” during his ten -year political career.  Making a little case of the word “hostages”, Trump forgave or switched about 1500 people who participated in the January 6 riots, including those who assaulted police officers and those who were convicted of trying to overthrow the government. Trump promised to redo America, and I believe he will try to do it. We will see whether or not it will be successful in the conversion of a constitutional republic into an authoritarian electoral autocracy.
The effects of Trump's seizure of power began to reverberate around the world.  Some of his supporters claim that Donald Trump's victory guaranteed a ceasefire in Gaza that allowed the return of 33 Israeli hostages and the release of around 90 Palestinian prisoners.  After 15 months, the guns are silent. However, other observers note that the terms of this ceasefire are almost identical to those that the Israeli government rejected last May. They accuse Netanyahu of having rejected these terms to prevent Biden and Harris from a hard-won victory that could help them in the 2024 US elections. Instead, Netanyahu waited until Trump was elected to give him credit for the ceasefire that everyone wanted. If these allegations are true, they illustrate the absolute selfishness and cynicism of Netanyahu and Trump. Since May, thousands of Palestinians and hundreds of Israelis have been killed or injured, along with the destruction of their homes and belongings. And for what? To keep Netanyahu out of prison and to give Trump his electoral victory? Historians will debate this question for decades, just as they debated the Paris Agreement to end the Vietnam War in the fall of 1968; or the negotiations to free the American embassy hostages held by the new Iranian revolutionary government.
Despite being unstable, the ceasefire remains in effect in Gaza and the Middle East.  Thousands of kilometers away, to the North, war rages in Ukraine and Russia. Trump had promised that he would end this war on “Day One”. This feat did not happen. Quite the opposite. Last week, European leaders affirmed their support for Ukraine and its president Volodymyr Zelensky. French President Emmanuel Macron warned that the war against Ukraine would not end “tomorrow or the day after tomorrow”. The third anniversary of Russia's war against Ukraine is celebrated next month. Macron also urged Europe to “wake up” and spend more on defense to reduce its alliance with the US. Macron's reaction is that Trump's inauguration is an “opportunity for a European strategic wake-up call”. Macron stated that Europe must “fully play its role” in Ukraine’s rearmament.
In a similar speech, Prime Minister Keir Strmer of Britain, on his first visit to Kiev, pledged to provide Ukraine a new air defense system called Sevehawk. Britain and Denmark have developed this anti-meal defense to allow Ukrainians to shoot down aerial threats using Reequipped AR-Ar missiles released from the ground. Norway promised Ukraine six F-16 of American manufacture, while France promised Mirage 2000-5. The Ukrainian forces used terrestrial drones equipped with machine guns and mines to carry out the first terrestrial attack with documented machines only in their war against Russia.  Ukraine states that Russia suffered 434,000 casualties in 2024 alone and that about 819,000 Russian soldiers were killed, captured or injured since the beginning of the war in February 2022. Ukraine did not communicate its own casualties, but estimates Westerners point to about 300 000 Ukrainian casualties, along with at least 600 000 Russian casualties.  Ukraine stated that last week, in one day, Russia lost more than 2200 soldiers.
However, despite these heavy losses, Russia has used its superiority in terms of population and resources to slowly and progressively conquer Ukrainian territory.  For a year now, Russia has been carrying out daily human wave attacks along the 3000 km eastern front. Moscow reported capturing several villages and towns in its attempt to capture the once-bustling city of Pokrovsk.  Capturing the ruined city would open the rest of Donetsk Province to Russian capture. Russia has used thousands of North Korean forces in its attempt to retake areas of Kursk province that Ukraine seized last summer. However, these malnourished and poorly trained North Korean troops suffered heavy casualties and, for the first time, the Ukrainians captured and are currently interrogating two North Korean soldiers. Russia has launched a combined drone and missile attack against several Ukrainian cities, including one in central Kiev. During a visit to Moscow on January 17, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian signed a vast cooperation pact that deepens their partnership. Russia's ties with Iran grew closer after Putin sent troops to Ukraine. Ukraine and the West have accused Tehran of providing Moscow with hundreds of drones to be used to attack Ukraine. Pezeshkian declared: “We are witnessing a new chapter of strategic relations.” Yesterday, Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Putin spoke on the phone about Ukraine, Donald Trump's inauguration and the Middle East. It is not yet known what was said.
Ukraine fears this day since Donald Trump was elected on November 6. Trump blames Ukraine and its president because they caused the circumstances that allowed their first dismissal in 2019. For Trump, the unprecedented request for Zelensky to find "rotten" about the Biden was a "perfect decision." In contrast, Trump has had good personal ties with Russian autocratic president Vladimir Putin, ties reaffirmed at his meeting in Helsinchy during Trump's first term. Trump said several times that he believes that Ukraine was partially responsible for the Russian invasion, due to his will, supported by the West, to join the NATO. Ukraine was only able to keep Russia in a military draw thanks to the influx of western military aid, especially American, and the blood of the Ukrainian people who resisted the invasion.
Ukraine fears that Putin and Trump will meet alone in some “neutral” European capital and make a deal, an agreement to give Russia the two eastern provinces of Donetsk and Lukhansk, Crimea and the coast of the Sea of ​​Azov.  It fears that Ukraine will not receive military security guarantees, such as membership of NATO or the EU. Finally, he fears that Zelensky will be forced to resign and be replaced by a pro-Russian Ukrainian politician. If that happens, Ukraine and most Western nations believe the country will cease to exist within a year, as Russia will absorb the state as Germany absorbed all of Czechoslovakia six months after the Munich Conference. Europe knows that Donald Trump's inauguration means that the responsibility for maintaining Ukraine's freedom falls on its shoulders and that the United States can no longer be counted on to militarily defend Europe from external aggression. Soon, the world will witness whether we are witnessing the dismantling of the entire 1945 Peace Agreement, based on a rules-based order, territorial integrity, the sovereignty of all nations and multilateral decision-making and actions. Donald Trump's inauguration portends that the world has entered perilous times, perhaps recalling the eras that preceded the First and Second World Wars.</description><pubDate>2025-01-24T01:06:05+08:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Chinese companies have released updates to generative AI models in recent days</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/01/24/empresas-chinesas-lancaram-actualizacoes-dos-modelos-de-ia-generativa-nos-ultimos-dias/</link><description>Several Chinese technology companies such as Bytedance, MONSHOT AI and Deepseek presented this week updates from their Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, highlighting their advances in complex tasks such as mathematics and programming.
 
ByteDance, known internationally for creating the short video social network TikTok, unveiled its real-time voice model, called Doubao, designed to act as an English teacher or narrator for users, according to the news portal Yicai location.
DeepSeek, in turn, presented the DeepSeek-R1 model, which the company assured is comparable to the OpenAI o1 model in tasks such as mathematical problem solving, programming and natural language inference. OpenAI is the creator of the famous ChatGPT that accelerated the development of the generative AI market.
Moonshot AI, however, presented the Kimi K1.5 model, which is capable of offering performance similar to OpenAI o1 in mathematics, programming and multimodal reasoning.
The Chinese Tencent also presented the open source Hunyuan3D 2.0 model, designed to convert 2D images into 3D images, with applications planned for the development of video games, advertising in e-commerce and industrial production.
In total, more than 200 large-scale language models (LLM – Large Language Model) were launched on the Chinese market.
Among the registered models are some developed by Chinese technological giants such as Jiutian, China Mobile, Baidu Wenxin Yiyan, Tongyin Qianwen, Alibaba, Pangu, Huawei Cloud, Andpo, and Lanxin, Vivo.
In July 2023, China approved provisional regulations to regulate Generative ChatgPT artificial intelligence services, which will be subject to “current information on information security, personal data protection, intellectual property and scientific and technological progress”.
Furthermore, they must respect “fundamental socialist values”, “social morals and professional ethics” and are prohibited from “generating content that undermines national security, territorial unity, social stability or the rights and legitimate interests of others people". Given this, questions have arisen about the application of this type of technology in China due to the strong censorship imposed by the authorities.
