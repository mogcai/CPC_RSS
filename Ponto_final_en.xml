The exhibition, which marks the 12th anniversary of the “Belt And Road” initiative, is organized in four thematic chapters and promises an immersive experience that combines both tangible and intangible heritage, as well as technology and live performances.
Organized in four thematic chapters, entitled “Through Sand and Wind”, “Golden Threads”, “The Golden Branch” and “Way to the Future”, the exhibition tells the story of material and spiritual exchange along the earth's and sea routes that connected Asia to Europe for centuries.
Among the highlighted artifacts include the “Bronze Carriage and Cavalry Choir”, provided by the Gansu Provincial Museum. Another highlighted object is the “octagonal blue glass vase of the Yongzheng period” of the Beijing Palace Museum. In the international part, a Hirayama Ikuo Silk Road Museum of Japan's Buddha de Gandhara and a white and white ceramic vase of the National Damascus Museum in Syria.
The exhibition goes beyond traditional museology, integrating meticulously reconstructed ancient musical instruments, such as Konghou with the head of Fenix ​​and the five -string kite, thanks to the work of the recognized Chinese composer Tan Dun. These instruments will be accompanied by modern symphonic arrangements, reliving the “silk route sounds” to a current audience.
Another highlight is the recreation of Dunhuang murals, produced by four generations of Chinese artists and cultural heirs, and integrated with digital art projections that give these millennial works a new life.
In addition to the visual component, the exhibition will include immersive night visits, where live performances and historical stagings merge with the display of artifacts, on a multisensory trip over time.
The exhibition “Rotas da Silk Beyond Borders” will be evident at the Poly MGM Museum from October 1 to March 31, 2026, daily from 10h00 to 18:30. Tickets are available at 150 patacas, with discounts for residents, students and groups.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>597 suspects of illegal money exchange since the entry into force of the new law</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/09/15/detidos-597-suspeitos-de-troca-ilegal-de-dinheiro-desde-a-entrada-em-vigor-da-nova-lei/</link><description>The law to combat illicit game crimes, which criminalizes the illegal exchange of money, came into force at the end of October last year. Since then, the Judiciary Police (PJ) has already detained 597 individuals involved in cases of this kind. Authorities seized more than $ 56 million from Hong Kong in cash and 15 million more in play cards.

The law on the fight against illicit gaming crimes came into force on October 29, 2024, and since then the Judicial Police (PJ) has detained 597 individuals involved in 387 cases of illegal money exchange, having seized more than $ 56 million from Hong Kong in cash and more than 15 million players. The information was shared by Wong Sio Chak, Secretary for Security, in a message posted on his office's official page.
Nesta mensagem, o secretário começa por assinalar que, nos últimos anos, houve um aumento do número de turistas e, consequentemente, um aumento do número de indivíduos que fazem troca ilegal de dinheiro nos casinos de Macau e nas suas proximidades, “o que não só perturba a ordem pública, como também contribui para a prática de crimes graves, tais como o furto, o roubo, a ofensa à integridade física ou até o homicídio, afectando gravemente a segurança e a stability of society ”.
This is why last year the executive prepared the law to combat illicit gaming crimes, which criminalizes the exploitation of illicit exchange rate. Through this law, “PJ has achieved considerable results, reducing the margin of illegal money exchange crimes as much as possible,” says Wong Sio Chak in the message.
Wong Sio Chak assumed that, despite police commitment to combat the illegal exchange of money, "the effectiveness of the law was limited before the entry into force of the illicit-playing crimes." This was due, for example, to the punishment frame and the lack of specific legislation, noted the ruler. Before the law, the illegal exchange of money was only an administrative offense, and it is "difficult to grasp the capital involved, due to insufficient punitive measures, which limited the deterrent effect."
Thus, "from 2023, the security area proactively promoted the criminalization of the illegal money exchange activity, made analyzes, presented directed proposals and articulated with the competent services in performing legislative work," recalled the secretary, stressing that "the launch of the law contributed to resolve the chaotic situation of individuals dedicated to the illegal exchange of money."
With the new law, the exploitation of illicit exchange rate for game is punished with prison up to five years and the police can conduct investigations and detention of infrastructors, "which contributed to significantly reinforcing the determination effect." On the other hand, the police may apprehend illicit funds, "which intensified the deterrent impact on the capital chain from the illegal exchange of money and the black and gray industries associated with it."
In the message, Wong also highlights cooperation with the interior authorities of China, which resulted in the dismantling of several clandestine banks and transionous criminal groups involved in this type of crime. The “ant removal” operation, for example, resulted in the referral of 13 individuals involved in illegal exchange of money to the judicial bodies. In addition, this year, PJ returned to cooperate with the interior police of China, and two joint operations were carried out that culminated in the dismantling of three criminal groups associated with this type of crime. "The law of execution of the law proved effective," says the secretary.
"Due to strict crime -fighting actions, the illegal money exchange performance space has been lower in recent months," wins Wong Sio Chak, stressing that "it is predictable that the fight against illegal money exchange activities will remain as a long -term challenge, with no space for incuria."</description><pubDate>2025-09-15 23:49:07</pubDate></item><item><title>Increase was the third lowest ever. Null and blank votes rose</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/09/15/afluencia-foi-a-terceira-mais-baixa-de-sempre-votos-nulos-e-em-branco-subiram-a-pique/</link><description>The rate of participation in the direct suffrage of legislative elections was 53.35%. Compared to the influx to the 2021 elections, there was an increase of 11 percentage points. Still, this is the third lower participation rate in Legislative Elections in MSAR, despite strong appeals to participation - not only of the lists, but also of the government and private entities. After counting, there was also an exponential increase in blank and null votes.

Authorities' efforts to reduce abstention in legislative elections culminated at a 53.35% participation rate in direct suffrage. Compared to the 2021 elections, participation recorded an increase of 11 percentage points. However, and despite the authorities' efforts to lower the abstention, the participation rate was the third lowest among the seven legislative elections that have been held in the MSAR since 2001.
Regarding the total number of voters in direct suffrage, there was a record: 175,272 voters went to the polls in a universe of 328,506 voters. This is explained by the fact that the number of registered voters increases significantly between each scrutiny, which consequently leads to the gradual increase in the number of voters. For example, in 2021, there were 323,907 census voters, of which 137,279 were actually voting. In the 2017 election, the number of voters was 305,615, and the number of voters was 174,872.
In the case of indirect suffrage, the participation rate was 88.12% - 6,645 voters in a universe of 7,541 accredited voters. In 2021, participation in indirect suffrage was 87.33%.
Last night, at the press conference that served to publicize the data of this year's legislative elections, Seng Ioi Man, chairman of the Legislative Assembly Electoral Affairs Committee (Caeal), thanked those who went to vote: “In fact it was a little hot day, yet we thank you for gone to voting assemblies, but also all workers who helped.” The official also said that the electoral act took place in an orderly manner, refusing to comment on the participation in these elections. “[Before commenting] we have to know the situation in concrete, do studies and analysis,” he said.

Efforts to make abstention

This year, the election campaign period was marked by the insistence of the authorities for voters to go to the polls. The chief executive even sent a letter to all civil servants asking them to vote. Sam Hou Fai referred to the revision of the Public Administration Workers Statute, which will only come into force on November 1 this year, stating that the document stipulates that civil servants must defend the basic law and be faithful to MSAR. Given this, Sam Hou Fai said that "the fact that the workers of public services and entities elect representatives in the legislative body through their vote is precisely a relevant demonstration of the defense of basic law and faithfulness to masters."
Sam also held a meeting with civil service leaders asking them to assume a “connecting role between superiors and subordinates”, namely through the promotion of vote, facilitating the travels of employees and cooperation between different services and public entities. The fulfillment of these measures is, it argued, "a basic requirement for the ethical and moral principles of civil service" and an essential step to ensure that the electoral process takes place in a "legal, fair, impartial and righteous environment."
The Lusa agency reported that MSar entities and public services questioned employees about whether they intended to vote in the elections, demanding justifications to those who said they would not participate in the electoral act. The end point knows that the same happened in private companies, namely at game dealers.
These efforts to drop the abstention intended to counteract the trend in the last legislative elections, where the participation rate was the lowest ever in the field (42.4%). In 2021, for the first time, the authorities disqualified candidates because they were not faithful to sashes or not defending the basic law, the vast majority of the Democratic wing.
This year also disqualified 12 candidates from two different lists, justifying that the elements are not faithful to MSAR or not defend the basic law. One of the disqualified this year was former deputy Ron Lam. This year's direct suffrage was the least crowded ever. Only six lists advanced with applications.

Whites and nulls fired

The counting of the votes, which only ended around 1 am, also showed an exponential increase in the number of blank and null votes. This time there were 5,987 blank votes and 7,077 null votes. In the 2021 elections, the number of blank and null votes had been 3,141 and 2,067, respectively. In the 2017 elections, the number of voters who had decided to leave the blank vote was only 944 and the null votes were 1,300.
At the CAEAL press conference after counting the votes, Seng Ioi Man declined to explain this exponential increase in the number of blank votes and null votes. "[In each election] there are always numbers to go up and down, there are many reasons; so Caeal will not comment," said the president of the body.
This was the first election under the new electoral law for the Legislative Assembly, which criminalizes appeals to abstention, null or blank vote. In addition, it also provides for the removal of candidates who, under the authorities, do not advocate the basic law and are not faithful to MSAR.
It is recalled that, in addition to the 14 places in the hemiciclo for deputies elected by direct suffrage, that is, by all registered residents -about 328 thousand -there are also 12 places in AL to deputies elected by indirect route, that is, by a restricted number of associative leaders linked to certain sectors. In addition to these, there is still place for seven deputies appointed by the Chief Executive, who will be announced later.</description><pubDate>2025-09-15 02:24:45</pubDate></item><item><title>Curb announces new bicycle tours through Ilha Verde</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/09/15/curb-anuncia-novos-passeios-de-bicicleta-pela-ilha-verde/</link><description>The event "On The Move" is back for the seventh edition, taking place on September 27th. This time, participants will be able to choose between two different routes, both centered on the neighborhoods of the North Zone of Macao, with the starting point of the University of São José. Registration is now open, with a limit of ten participants for each session.

Curb - Center for Architecture and Urbanism will again organize bike rides through various areas of Green Island on September 27th. This is the seventh time that the Association organizes the event “On the Move”, a project that brings together bicycle tours, the production of a documentary and the interaction among members of the community of Macao.
Unlike the last editions, which had as its starting point the 9 Bridge, this year the itinerary begins in the courtyard of the University of São José and will “explore a new area of ​​Macao”, as the press release of the organization. The highlighted zone is that of Ilha Verde, which will be discovered through two different paths - with two sessions, each - commented in English by curator and architect Nuno Soares, president of Curb.
The route that passes through the Fai Chi Kei neighborhood takes place from 10am to 11am and is repeated from 16h to 17h. In turn, the toi San neighborhood route has a session from 11:30 am to 12:30 pm and another from 2:30 pm to 3:30 pm. Each session has a maximum limit of ten participants, who can apply for the initiative through a link available on Curb's social networks. As unique requirements, participants should be 18 years old and more than bike riding. All material necessary for experience - such as helmets, reflective vests and audio receivers - will be provided by the organization.
Throughout the trip, sounds and images will be collected that will then contribute to the “artistic creation of“ a video art and a documentary to be displayed in a parallel projection in a place and date yet to be announced ”.
The sixth edition took place on November 9 last year, dividing between the “North City Wall” path (which passed through the Monte Fortress, the Patane Zone and the San Kio neighborhood) and the “Inner Harbor Boundary Wall” route (which included the passage through the Church of Santo António, Rua dos Mercadores, Rua da Alfândega and Ponte and Horta Square). The subsequent documentary was shown on the Terrace of Ponte 9 on November 30, at 6.30 pm.
Curb settled in Macao in 2014 and aims to “promote research, education, production and dissemination of knowledge in the domains of architecture, urbanism, design and urban culture”. It is a platform of exchange between academic, civil society, professional practice and government institutions, serving “the interests of the general community” with the frequent organization of research, workshops, conferences, exhibitions, competitions and other initiatives.</description><pubDate>2025-09-15 23:46:29</pubDate></item><item><title>China accuses the USA of “threatening regional peace and security” in Caribbean</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/09/15/china-acusa-eua-de-ameacar-a-paz-e-a-seguranca-regionais-nas-caraibas/</link><description>China yesterday accused the United States of “threatening regional peace and security” in the Caribbean, after Venezuela denounces that an American fresher “approached” and occupied a Venezuelan fishing boat for eight hours.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian stated at a press conference that US behavior "seriously violates sovereignty, security and legitimate rights and interests in other countries, as well as violating international law."
Lin exhorted the US to "not use the struggle against drug trafficking as an excuse to undermine the economic security of all countries and the freedoms and rights they enjoy under international law." "China firmly supports the strengthening of international cooperation to combat transfronic crime, opposes unilateral and excessive use of force and opposes external interference in the internal affairs of Venezuela under any pretext," the spokesman added.
The government of Venezuela assured on Saturday that a United States Freemaker approached illegally and occupied for eight hours a Venezuelan boat with "nine fishermen" that were-underlined-in waters of the South American country, all, according to Caracas, with the intention of justifying "a war climbing" in the Caribbean.
The occupants, according to the Venezuelan authorities, were "humble tuna fishermen, navigating 48 nautical miles from La Blanquilla Island, in waters belonging to the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEE) Venezuelan."
For Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro's executive, this incident “reflects the shameful conduct of political sectors in Washington that, irresponsibly, compromise very high cost military resources and trained soldiers as instruments for making pretexts for war adventures”.
The United States holds out of the Venezuelan coast of eight military ships with missiles and a nuclear propulsion submarine and ordered the sending of ten F-35 fighters to an air base in Puerto Rico, which Venezuela accuses of being an attempt to promote an "regime change."
The government of US President Donald Trump accuses Maduro of leading the so-called US cartel pointed out as a terrorist organization linked to drug trafficking.</description><pubDate>2025-09-15 23:43:10</pubDate></item><item><title>New government of Nepal resumes essential services in burnt infrastructure</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/09/15/novo-governo-do-nepal-retoma-servicos-essenciais-em-infra-estruturas-queimadas/</link><description>Nepal's interim government began to resume essential services after last week's social disruptions, with many burnt government infrastructures, while the interim first minister, Sushila Karki, assumes the country's leadership. "A lot of infrastructure has been destroyed. It will take time to evaluate the damage," said chief secretary Eknarayan Aryal, quoted by The Kathmandu Post, which indicated that in the coming days the evaluation will begin and a reconstruction plan will be prepared after the fires, framed in the protests.
Some of the most important institutions destroyed began to function with provisional means. The Supreme Court, burned down during the protests, now works from tents to issue postponement notifications.
The Ministry of Finance, which suffered minor damages, has resumed the collection of revenues and the Treasury Payments, while folders such as Education or Health seek temporary headquarters after the destruction of their facilities.
Protests set fire to key key infrastructures such as Parliament, the Presidency, the Supreme Court or several ministries, as well as headquarters of political parties and private residences of former governants and important political figures of the Nepal.
In several districts outside the capital, customs, courts and local administrations have reopened in makeshift spaces, with furniture and borrowed basic systems.
Schools and colleges also resumed classes, gradually, in different parts of the country, although some institutions remain closed due to damage to the facilities.
The social revolt, led by the “generation Z” youth movement, left at least 72 dead and more than two hundred serious injuries, according to the last official balance. Among the victims, there are 59 protesters, three police and ten prisoners, who tried to escape during the riots.
The anti-corruption protests, fed by a veto on social networks that came into force on September 4, forced the resignation of former Prime Minister, K.P. Sharma Oli, and the formation of an interim government, led by Sushila Kark, former president of the Supreme Court and symbol of the fight against corruption in the country.
Organized mainly through the Discord platform, young activists have launched "online" appeals to choose representatives and negotiate with the Army and the Presidency, until they reached a consensus, which resulted in the appointment of the new Prime Minister last Friday.
Nepal's interim government, led by Karki, will be responsible for the management of the country until the formation of a new executive resulting from legislative elections, scheduled for March 5, 2026.</description><pubDate>2025-09-15 23:42:08</pubDate></item><item><title>Coutinho marks victory “surprise” and “tasty” of the elections</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/09/15/coutinho-assinala-vitoria-surpresa-e-saborosa-das-eleicoes/</link><description>José Pereira Coutinho was very pleased with the results that his team obtained in the present legislative elections. With over 43,000 votes, the deputy confessed that it was a surprise and a tasty victory for the list to be able to elect three deputies. For the other list that also has three seats in Hemiciclo, Song Pek Kei highlighted the population's recognition of the team's work.

It was a “surprise”, but also a “tasty” victory for José Pereira Coutinho about the results of Sunday's legislative elections, in which his new hope was the big winner in the direct electoral race with obtaining more than 43,000 votes, 26.73% of the total. The list has won three places in the hemiciclo, ie the best performance on the list in legislatures to date.
José Pereira Coutinho, deputy to the Legislative Assembly since 2005, confessed that he was surprised by the number of votes achieved and “fully conscious” of the great responsibility entrusted to him. He thanked the citizens of Macau for their support and confidence, and indicated that the results of the elections were also a recognition of the team's work over the years.
Speaking to the Chinese channel of TDM Macau, José Pereira Coutinho said to attribute great importance to work for the next four years. "We promise that we will make all efforts to reflect the opinions of the population to the government in order to improve the situation of all aspects of the territory," he said.

In addition, the deputy said he will still fight for the increase in the pension to the elderly, reducing the pressure of civil servants, as well as a new consumer card round.
Che Sa Sai Wang, who managed to keep his seat in Hemiciclo being the number three on the list, said the team already predicts that the work is more intense in the future and is prepared to help residents. The rookie in the Hemiciclo Chan Hao Weng said he will address his future function with an open mind, giving priority to reducing the number of non-resident workers and economic stimulus.
In turn, Song Pek Kei, who leads the Macao United Citizens Association, a list that also guarantees three places, was pleased by the results for obtaining more votes compared to previous elections.
The deputy considers that the increase in votes demonstrates the public recognition of the team's work. The list linked to the Fujian community raised 29,459 votes, with a percentage of 18.16% of the total.
Nick Law, the current current parliamentary, assumed that in the new legislative session he will strive to implement resident employment measures, hoping to obtain greater support and confidence from the public in the future. Chan Lai Kei, who makes his debut in the Hemiciclo, has committed to fight for the expansion of the paid maternity leave to 90 days.
On the other hand, Ella Law and Leong Sun Iok, who will be able to stay in the Legislative Assembly for another four years, said they will continue to prioritize their efforts to resolve employment issues, especially the departure of non-resident workers in large companies.
Also the reelected Leong Hong Sai and Ngan Iek Hang said the result of the elections was satisfactory with the increase of votes to meet expectations. The two deputies, as a function, pointed out that they will work to improve the economy and employment.

Toyota now has more wins than Citroen in the WRC. Oliver Solberg is champion at WRC2.


 


Sébastien Ogier (Toyota) completed a virtually perfect weekend that earned him overtaking to teammate Elfyn Evans in the world championship. The French pilot, eight times world champion, beat Chile's rally convincingly. And it was still the fastest in the accounts of 'Super Sunday' and 'Wolf Power Stage', having added a maximum of 35 points in dispute during the three days of race.


Ogier, navigated by compatriot Vincent Landais, handed to Toyota winning the number 103 at the World Cup, thus becoming the builder with the most triumphs in the WRC, surpassing Citroen. I wanted the irony of fate that it was a Frenchman to dethrone the mark of the Gaul builder.


“I am very happy. I think they are well deserved points after those we lost in Paraguay due to the climacteric conditions. And reaching the leadership of the World Cup when only three events are also very positive,” confessed Sébastien Ogier, he who started the time in 'part-time'. The Frenchman still failed three rally during the time (Sweden, Kenya and Estonia), but the progress has been so incredible that at a certain time he was 'thanks' to fulfill the calendar to try to reach the ninth world title. Ogier has participated in only 8 of the 11 rally played so far. He got five wins and three podiums. It was Ogier's sixty -sixth Triunfo in the WRC, in a rally in which he signaled 200 appearances in the main category.


At the entrance to the last day, he was still anticipated a struggle lit for victory in Chile between Ogier and Evans, but the Frenchman did not give the slightest margin of maneuver, having expanded his advantage from the day before. The two ended the test separated for 11 seconds.


"I have mixed feelings. We always want to win. But the positive factor is that after we suffered a lot in Paraguay, we can now show some speed. It is true that we paid a price because we were the first on Friday, but we did solid work," said Welsh of Toyota, who has co-pilot Scott Martin.


In World Cup accounts, Ogier now has 224 points against Evans's 222, anticipating an electrical time ending between the two teammates, with Kalle Rovanperä (203 points) also at the lurking. The Finn the Finn on Friday, having wasted a lot of time.


"We needed a good result, but that bad luck stole the aspirations. We have to win the next rally to have the chance to fight for the championship," Rovanperä, who went beyond sixth place.


Among the men of Hyundai, highlight for Adrien Fourmaux. The Frenchman added another podium and showed that he had a progress to fight the Toyota. "I am happy with the podium, after we failed this goal in Paraguay. We finished Friday in the lead and were able to keep the pace on Saturday morning. But then the terrain was more favorable to the Toyota," said Foumax, who this year changed the M-Sport Ford for the South Korean builder.


Thierry Neuville (Hyundai), navigated by Martijn Wydaeghe, ended in fourth position. The current world champion revealed many difficulties in putting the tuning of his i20 n rally1 in 'candy point'. The Belgian has not yet won any tests this year. "Of course there are things we have to improve. But I am confident that we will be able to show a strong progress in the next events," he suggested.


Sami Pajari took a good test. Toyota's young talent, with co-pilot Marko Salminen, placed his gr Yaris Rally1 in fifth position. He has even won a special and showed that the adaptation to the Rally1 is fruitful. Two other men from Toyota, Rovanperä and Japanese Takamoto Katsuta were followed. The first of the M-Sport Ford, Luxembourg Gégoire Munster, ended eighth.


Disappointment to Ott Tänak that went beyond the thirty -fourth place. Estonium was left out of engine in your Hyundai in the last special of Friday. He still returned with a strong penalty to try to score points in Super Sunday, but only one, very little for those who arrived in Chile with aspirations to fight for a second world title. It will now be very difficult for Tänak to go around the situation, as Ogier and Evans are already over 40 points.


 


Solberg Champion in WRC2


 


Oliver Solberg (Toyota Gr Yaris Rally2) finished the rally of Chile in the ninth position of the overall standings, but in the first place among the WRC2. The Swedish, son of Peter Solberg (champion in 2003), dominated the proof from beginning to end. Ironically it had been in this rally that Solberg lost the advantage he had last year. He led Chile's rally when he drove, then lost the championship for only three points. This time the Swedish did not register major problems, ending with a comfortable advantage for Nikolay Gryazin (Skoda Fabia RS Rally2).


Solberg already has five wins in the seven rally played so far, in a season where he has not given a maneuver margin to the competition. And remember that in the middle, it still won the rally of the stony behind the wheel of a rally1!


"It's unbelievable, I don't even know what I'm feeling. It's a great relief, after all the bad luck last year. I'm very happy," the 23 -year -old confessed, who is expected to jump to the main category next year.


Solberg's aspirations were facilitated by the early abandonment of Frenchman Yohan Rossel (Citroen C3 Rally2) and Briton Gus Greensmith (Skoda Fabia RS Rally2). And Gryazin never threatened the Swedish. Spaniard Jan Solans (Toyota Gr Yaris Rally2) completed the podium.


The WRC is returning to the road between October 16 and 19 with the Central European Rally, which runs through the asphalt of three countries: Germany, Austria and Chéquia.

In an interview with the final point, the leader of this organism, Rui Lourido, also states that the Macau Forum can do more, helping companies in presenting their candidates, preventing so many projects from getting in the way.
The mission of the China Observatory in Portugal is to combat misinformation. Is it being fulfilled?
The mission is to bring knowledge about Chinese civilization to Europe.
Since 2005, the year of founding the Observatory, so far, has the perspective in Portugal in relation to China changed?
The perspective of Europe, and naturally from Portugal, is very linked to geopolitics, the interests that each country has. Portugal's interests regarding China are different from the interests of Europe - from the point of view of the interests of the Portuguese economy, it is not the interests that the European Union has, which is most dominated by a Russophobic, synophobic, Eurocentric view, and refuses that today the world has changed. And it has changed radically because there is no longer a single power to dictate the rules, managing to dominate with its perspective the rest of the world. We have to be aware that Asia and China, in particular, is a civilization with 5000 years of existence, at the level of history. In the very previous prehistory, two great civilizations formatted our world-Sumerian (Iraq) and China. André Gunder Frank, a great Canadian-American economist, said that if the world economy, from the 5th to the nineteenth century, could be compared to a train, the front carriage would be China, the second would be India and, at the end of a multitude of carriages, would come the European economy, which at the time had no projection. Until the nineteenth century it was possible for China to play a central role, although from the 16th century to the front, to Europeans, due to the navigation capacity, it was allowed to begin to build the narrative of European rule and the discovery of others - it would be better to say the meeting of others, because others already existed in their territories. Europe, for example, with the Dutch - replacing Portuguese rule in these seas - and England manages to produce opium in India, selling clandestinely because it was forbidden to sell opium in China that was not from the medical point of view. They found that, selling opium, created dependence and dependence created loyal customers. If the ships coming from China arrived in conditions to Europe, the profits were 100 or 200 percent and therefore there was a great ability to hang. In England, finding that changing the products you are interested in buying, which is silk, porcelains and everyone else, by opium, stops paying silver and this creates a huge cherishing and it is this entertainment that will boost the industrial revolution in Europe, and this industrial revolution will allow to create the steam machine and, with the steam machine, can make the china a drug. which was prohibited and even imposed a war. China is divided by the empires of the height: the British, Prussia, the United States and France have territories within China, and this breakup leads to losing this ability to influence the world, as so far. Europe goes, for 150 years, to dominate. But since the implementation of the Popular Republic of China, China has even to today have an economic recovery development that leads to the current situation. Therefore, Portuguese interests are different from Europeans, because we have Macao and Macau is fundamental for Portugal for Lusophone countries.
Is Macau crucial for Portugal?
From the perspective of the China Observatory, Lusophony is fundamental and Portugal should privilege its relations with Lusophone countries and, essentially, with Brazil, Angola and Mozambique, the Lusophony-tips in the world. Angola will be, in 20 or 30 years, the main country of Lusophone language, because it will surpass Brazil itself and the 18 -year -old population is immeasurable, Mozambique the same. The young population will promote these countries and these countries are aware that they have a lot to gain from China, so they have, for the first time, infrastructures that have not had the 500 years of Portuguese colonization. Our industry and commercial fabric in Portugal are essentially small and medium -sized and these companies have the full benefit of trade with large markets, such as Lusophone markets, but also the Chinese.
Does the territory continue to play this connecting role between China and Lusophone countries?
Of course, large companies do not need Macao to negotiate, they directly go to Beijing. Medium and small businesses have a key point in Macau for their penetration in China, because they have the same legal body: Portuguese.  Macao's identity is an identity that has to do with Portuguese, Portuguese, because it makes Macau a much more important point for China. The Macao Forum was created specifically for Macau so that Macao will continue to have this identity point that needs to reinforce. Macao is a territory with one fifth of the world's population and has to account for their own population. It cannot offer money to other countries, as if it were a country with no need inside. But negotiating in this perspective of win-win, Macau has managed to enjoy funds that encourage companies with responsibility, that is, which have the ability to develop projects. The Macao Forum was very important to Macau, for its internal administration, for the population of Macao and the Portuguese who are now more than again than after the return of Macau to Mother Patria. There is, however, another intelligent thing from the Chinese government to privilege Macau. England left Hong Kong a series of Hong Kong's Chinese Hong Kong Administration - Hong Kong's curricula were decided exclusively by British administration universities and had nothing to do with China's history. On the contrary, Macau had the intelligence of gradually accepting that Macao schools and Portuguese schools also had China's history. Over the years, the central government offers Macau the possibility of developing sectors that had never had, gives it the possibility of using the mountain island, the possibility of making a tunnel under the sea to reach directly to the population that is of Portuguese origin or that is Chinese Macao, without passport, but gives more. Created Hengqin Island and all that area of ​​Zhuhai has the possibility of European direct investment by Macao. Hengqin is the possibility of Macao being autonomous of the game. For Portugal, companies are interested: we have Portuguese pharmaceutical companies in Macau, which are interested in entering China to trade.
Over the years, the Macao Forum has suffered some criticism for playing a little active role. Are they grounded?
Yes and no. The Macao Forum is a young institution and is an experience of a territory that is an administrative region and the bottom is Chinese. The Macau Forum itself is a Chinese institution based in Macau to privilege Macau and has a permanent executive secretary who is from the Macanese administration. The economic capacity of Portuguese-speaking countries is really reduced and their indebtedness is immense and if we want to do win-win, there must be a counterpart of Chinese investment and projects have to be sustainable. In Portugal, we have a great institution of small and medium merchants directed by Y Ping Chow, the Portugal-China PME Chamber of Commerce, which takes delegations to many provinces, and we have the Luso-Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which is extremely active. Hengqin gives possibilities to our industrial fabric. The forum has these difficulties and the countries themselves have delegates at the Macao Forum, but may have a much more pronounced development and will have an obligation to have it. However, it is necessary to create the structures within the Forum itself, which help the countries. It is so complex and bureaucratic that it takes so long to organize the projects to be subjected, and only those who have this ability to realize the Chinese investment are approved, but can be faster and more vast.

How?
The forum receives “n” demands from Portuguese -speaking countries and many companies. Should support these companies to build the candidacy to pass.
From all that has just said, do you remove that, even if the results are quite favorable, Portuguese perception of China remains not the most positive?
It's not just not being perceived, this is a fact. But there is the US Congress, which approves US $ 2023 million for advertising only on China. This is feeding the entire misinformation machine on China. If there is anything about China, the European average feed an advertising machine. For example, Europe did not allow China to enter the European aerospace complex for the International Space Station, because the United States said no, and China developed its own. Today is China that has the most developed station than ours and we are sending Europeans to be aware of what is going on there and to develop experiences there - Europeans and around the world.
But there are questions, such as human rights, which traditionally oppose the West to China. Are they circumventable points?
They are, because it all depends on the elites. When youth, which is in universities, come to power or those who are in the current parties, but with another vision, realize that no one can have social services if they have no taxes - if the state is not rich. Our economic advance depends on Portugal's largest economic relationship with Brazil, with China, with India, with Russia, with the United States, but we cannot, as Germany is, to harm the economy, in which it has greatly reduced its ability to export its car vehicles to China and therefore decayed.
 
Considering the international context of wars and conflicts, China has been a neutral element. Are you trying to redesign your role within the international relationship?
China will not interfere militarily in any country, this is not its mission. Governments change and China wants to have peaceful relationships with the whole world, but have power and will only have power if you have an army that demonstrates the ability to impose respect, because if not, they are invented: either because it is not a democracy or has nuclear weapons.
China will not put the army against Israel and what it is doing in Gaza. It is not for you, it is not your mission. It is up to you to press and say that this is not the form. China, demonstrating to its allies that it has nuclear capacity, which has the effective capacity of its army, its Navy and its Air Force, gives confidence to its partners to be more demanding in international diplomacy, that is, they do not accept that one country imposes itself on others, as has happened on the United States, with Israel compared to Palestine and the whole world Arabic. This genocide war of Israel has been strongly criticized by China. From Ukraine, Ukraine's invasion option is not supported by China, but acknowledges that a country's safety cannot be done at the expense of another country's safety. These principles allow a healthier international environment.
There is a whole European narrative that is anti-chinese, but there is also a narrative of universities and institutes that is favorable to the Chinese perspective of a multipolar world.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Coutinho list was the most voted in the legislatures with more than 40 thousand votes</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/09/15/lista-de-coutinho-foi-a-mais-votada-nas-legislativas-com-mais-de-40-mil-votos/</link><description>Deputies are elected, by direct and indirect way, to the VIII Legislative Assembly of Macao. The New Hope, a list headed by José Pereira Coutinho, was the big winner of the night, having obtained the biggest vote and electing three deputies. The list led by Song Pek Kei also elected three deputies, while the remaining four lists each placed two deputies in the Hemiciclo.

In yesterday's elections, for the first time, all lists elected at least one deputy to the Legislative Assembly (AL). Of the six lists by direct suffrage, 14 deputies were chosen yesterday and, in this case, two lists were able to occupy three seats, respectively, in the hemiciclo, and each of the other four with two deputies.
The great electoral victory was attributed to the new hope list, which elected three deputies - José Pereira Coutinho, Chan Hao Weng and Che Sa Wang.
The list linked to the Macao Public Function Workers Association (ATFPM) replaced this year the Macao United Citizens Association, linked to the Fujian community, becoming the most voted, with a total of 43,361 votes, ie a percentage 26.73%. The number of votes was thus much higher compared to the 2021 elections, when it obtained 18,232 votes (13.8%).
It is recalled that José Pereira Coutinho, a Macaense politician, has been a deputy since 2005, and is also president of the ATFPM Board; Chan Hao Weng, who debuts at Al, is a civil servant, and Che Sai Wang has been holding a deputy since he was elected in the 2021 elections.
It should be noted that, with the number of lower competing lists ever in the history of MSAR, after registering fewer candidacies and the disqualification of two lists due to lack of patriotism, along with the fact that more people have gone to vote, the number of votes obtained from each list found a climb compared to the last 2021 elections.
The vote clearance ended around 1 am.
The celebrations also marked the night of the Macao United Citizens Association list, which raised 29,459 votes (18.16%), due to the reelection of Song Pek Kei and Nick Law, as well as the number 3 debut, Chan Lai Kei.
The list, which had been the most voted, had managed to elect three deputies in 2021, raising more than 20% of the total votes. However, the former leader of the list, Deputy Si Ka Lon, appealed and was elected this year for the indirect suffrage.
Song Pek Kei has been a deputy since 2013, being a member of the Executive Council and executive chairman of the General Association of Fukien of Macao. Nick Lei entered the AL in 2021, was a member of the Advisory Board for Municipal Affairs, and Chan Lai Kei presented himself as a education professional.

Equitable distribution
 
In turn, the Union for Development, linked to the Federation of Workers' Associations (Faom), was the third most voted in these elections, having collected 27,431 votes (16.91%) to reelect Ella Law and Leong Sun IOK. The two have been deputies since 2013 and 2017, respectively, holding the positions of vice president of the Faom Directorate.
Deputies Leong Hong Sai and Ngan Iek Hang also managed to stay in AL, thanks to 21,745 votes obtained by the Promoting Union for Progress, a list associated with the General Union of Macao Residents Associations. The two entered the Hemiciclo in 2021, after Ho Ion Sang moved to the indirect election races.
Already the union of Macau-Guangdong, after Zheng Anting and Lo Choi in not sought reelection, the list linked to the community of Jiangmen got two seats, with 21,461 votes (13.23%), making Joey Lao return to the hemiciclo.
The deputy appointed between 2017 and 2021, Joey Lao, is director of the University of Macao Strategy and Planning Office and also president of the Macao Economic Association. Newcomer Lee Koi Ian, second on the list, is head of the Seng Fung jewelry chain.
Among the six lists, the Good Home Alliance, linked to the General Association of Women, was the least voted and the only one with less than 20,000 votes. The list led by Wong Kit Cheng ended up collecting 18,751 votes (11.56%), electing two candidates. In addition to Wong Kit Cheng, deputy since 2013, nurse at Kiang Wu Hospital and member of the Chinese people's political advisory conference, was elected Loi I Weng, a new face to Al, being deputy director of the Macao General Association School.

Four new faces in AL by the Indirect Way
 
In addition to the 14 deputies elected by direct suffrage, another 12 hemiciclo members were chosen yesterday by the indirect way. Among them, eight were already deputies and four are new guys in al.
Of the five electoral colleges, only the work sector counted on these elections with more than one list. Of the two applications were elected Leong Pou U and Lam Lon Wai, both vice presidents of the Macao Workers' Associations Federation.
In the industrial, commercial and financial sectors, after the departure of the Kou Hoi In electoral race, President Al, José Chui Sai Peng and IP Sio Kai keep in positions, while Si Ka Lon, who is still currently elected deputy elected by Via Direct, and Kevin Ho, will be in the hemicicle over the next four years.
By the professional sector were chosen Iau Teng Pio, Vong Hou Piu and Wong Chon Kit, who replace Chui Sa Cheong, Vong Hin Fai and Chan Iek Lap.
Ho Ion Sang continues his career in hemiciclo through the sector of social and educational services. Already Angela Leong and MA Chi Seng will represent the cultural and sports sectors, after the departure of Chan Chak Mo. To these deputies, seven will then join the appointment by the Chief Executive.
According to the chronology of elections of the VIII Legislature, the General Assembly will disclose the results of the general calculation tomorrow, and then elaborates two copies of the minutes to be sent to Caeal, so that it gives one to the Chief Executive and the other to the Court of the last Instance (TUI). TUI will proclaim the elected members and make the decision on the results of the election, which will be published in an official bulletin on September 29.

This year's campaign has performances by multiple Portuguese artists, such as Cuca Roseta, and artists from Macao who will make known to the Portuguese public the traditional dances of Leão and Dragon.
The tourist campaign “Feel Macau” returns to Lisbon from September 17 to 21. As in the last edition, held in 2023, the new initiative is intended to promote Macao's tourist and cultural resources and to expand the markets of international visitors-more specifically, those of European and Lusophone origin.
The opening ceremony starts at the Commerce Square at the end of the 17th, with fire-to-art shows and drones to illuminate the night sky and a performance of Portuguese fado singer Cuca Roseta. The Directorate of Tourism Services (STD), the event's organizer, promises “light drones shows” every night, in an explosion of colors and shapes that “will show the coexistence of various cultures and the urban vitality of Macao” through an “immersive audiovisual show”.
According to STD in a statement, the event will be divided into three thematic exhibition areas: a main stage and a show zone, a multimedia display and the “window to the large guide event” exhibition zone. In the latter, the public of Portugal will be introduced to “the rich tourist, cultural, sports, economic, commercial and entertainment of Macao”. There will also be an exhibitor dedicated to the deepened cooperation zone between Guangdong and Macau in Hengqin, in order to “promote natural and tourist resources and promote joint tourism” between the two regions.
The Macao Tourist Campaign is part of the program of “Festas na Rua”, an event promoted annually by the Lisbon City Council. On the page of the Cultural Equipment and Animation Management Company (EGEAC), it is possible to read that Márcio Furtado, Born to Fail, Don Fran, Inês Coito (these last two, winners of the “Young Bairro Talents” initiative of Gebalis) and several fado musicians will pass the stage installed by Beira Tagus. Coming from Macao, young artists will be present with traditional Lion and Dragon dances and a musical sequence adapted from the show “Macau 2049”, in which robots will participate in the Chinese company Unite Robotics.
“From dance to music, through technology, cultural richness and diversity of two geographically distant territories are celebrated, but united by history, exchange and dialogue,” writes EGEAC, responsible for promoting major cultural events in the Portuguese capital.
STD ensures that it will visit “Portuguese Tourist Enterprises” within the tourist campaign and will maintain meetings with the Portuguese Association of Travel and Tourism Agencies (APAVT) and EGEAC, “with a view to further developing the role of Macau as a bridge between China and Portugal interior and reinforcing cooperation with Portuguese -speaking countries”. The full event schedule can be consulted on the theme page available on STD 'website.</description><pubDate>2025-09-15 23:47:07</pubDate></item><item><title>More than 48,000 individuals identified under the thunderstorm</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/09/15/mais-de-48-mil-individuos-identificados-no-ambito-da-operacao-trovoada/</link><description>This year's thunderstorm operation, which sought to combat transfronted organized crime between August 4 and September 6, resulted in the identification of 48,155 individuals, of which 1,393 were taken to the squad.

"We decided together, the three benches, and understood to ask the National Parliament to annul the whole process concerning the acquisition of vehicles for the deputies," the three-bank spokesman, Deputy Patrocínio Fernandes do CNRT, party led by Prime Minister Xanana Gusmão, told reporters.
Students from four Timorese universities and civil society elements yesterday made a protest in front of Parliament against the country's 65 deputies, including the recent decision to acquire new vehicles for a value of over $ 3 million.
The demonstration was eventually scattered with tear gas and rubber bullets, after the students launched stones and other objects against the parliament building.
Although they were scattered, protesters reunited again in protest in the same place, but without registration of more incidents. The deputy explained that the decision is not to buy cars for the deputies during the present legislature.
Patrocínio Fernandes stressed that the measure does not result from external pressure, but from the internal analysis of the concerns expressed by the deputies themselves, who, however, also recognize the sensitivity of public opinion.
The press conference was also attended by the president of the PD (Coalition Party in the Government), Armando dos Santos Lopes, and the president of the Khunto bench, in opposition, António Verdeal.
Patrocínio Fernandes recalled that the intention to acquire the vehicles was based on the statute of the deputies, which provides for the availability of adequate conditions for the exercise of the parliamentary mandate, including transportation.
According to the deputy, the concerns had arisen due to the poor condition of the current fleet, the high maintenance costs and the difficulties of the parliamentary secretariat in efficiently managing the vehicles attributed to the deputies.
Following further analysis of the situation, CNRT, PD and Khunto countertops have now decided to suspend the execution of the funds of 3.5 million euros to purchase vehicles, registered in the state budget for this year. "CNRT, PD and Khunto benches [representing most deputies] are aware that the decision to buy vehicles does not correspond to public concerns," added Patrocínio Fernandes.
The Timorese Parliament Hemiciclo also includes the benches of the Revolutionary Independent Timor-Leste Front (Fretilin) ​​and the Popular Liberation Party (PLP).
Timorese opposition leader Mari Alkatiri appealed last week to the government to urgently solve social and political problems in the country, to avoid scenarios similar to what are occurring in neighboring countries. "I always say that the situation in our country today may seem better, but we all know that the problems accumulate. We can say that we are entering a 'time bomb' situation," said the secretary general of the Revolutionary Independent Timor-Leste Front (Fretilin) ​​last Thursday, expressly referring to college students.
Young college students and civil society had been protesting for some time against the acquisition of new vehicles for the deputies. "If we do not do good management of this situation, we can face, in a short time, many social, political and even conflict problems," the Fretilin secretary general warned.

According to the authorities, the fall was due to a decrease in social support and subsidies. According to the direction of finance services, Macau spent 57.5 billion patacas until August.

Macau's public expense fell 1.8% in the first eight months, compared to the same period of 2024, was announced yesterday, due to a decrease in social support and subsidies. According to published data online by the Directorate Directorate of Finance Services (DSF), Macau spent 57.5 billion Patacas until August.
Public expense has decreased mainly due to a drop of 4.4%, in annual terms, in spending on support and social subsidies, which were close to 31 billion patacas.
This although, in early July, the Legislative Assembly approved a government proposal to increase by 2.86 billion of Patacas in budget expenses, to reinforce social support.
The review includes the creation of a subsidy, totaling 54,000 patacas, for children up to 3 years, to raise the lowest birth in the world.
Also spending on the administration's investment and expenses plan fell 2.4%, to less than 11 billion patacas. On the contrary, personnel expenses increased 3.4%, reaching 3.14 billion patacas.
Instead of the expense, Macau's current revenue rose 3.4% in the first eight months of the year to almost 72 billion patacas.
The main reason for the increase was an increase of 5.3%, to 61.9 billion patacas, in tax revenues - which represent 86% of the total.
The six game operators in the city pay a 35% direct tax on the game's revenues, 2.4% for the Macao Social Security Fund and urban and tourist development, and 1.6% delivered to the Macao Foundation for cultural, educational, scientific, academics and philanthropic purposes.
Total revenues from Macao casinos exceeded 163 billion patacas in the first eight months of the year, more 7.2% than in the same period as 2024.
On April 15, the region's government leader Sam Hou Fai admitted to fear a budgetary deficit in 2025, due to a slowdown in the recovery of the game's revenues, still below the levels reached before the Covid-19 pandemic. Still, Macao ended August with a surplus in public accounts of 14.9 billion patacas, more 30.4% than in the same period last year. This value is more than double the government's initial forecast for the entire year 2025: 6.83 billion patacas.
Macao closed 2024 with an surplus of 15.8 billion patacas, more than twice the one recorded the previous year.

According to police investigation, there are at least four victims in this case.
The situation was exhibited following an investigation in early July on a case of online children pornography, in which PJ identified the suspect who resorted to social networks to make friends with smaller local students, convincing them to take pornographic photographs.
Cited by the newspaper or Mun, the PJ later identified the first victim, who met the suspect through an application of meetings. The smallest initially refused to take explicit photographs, but the suspect later managed to stretch him to take pictures of his legs with an 850 patacas payment and offer a tennis bag worth hundreds of patacas.
The student told police that he refused to take photographs for not receiving any payment, while the third injured person received 400 patacas for selling the individual from a pair of used tennis and sports socks.
The authorities also found that the suspect made a transaction with the fourth victim this month, in a public bathroom in the Nape area. The investigation pointed out that the man used a mobile phone to film this meeting and paid 650 patacas to the smallest.
The suspect was arrested last Friday at his workplace in the Nape area and was referred to the prosecutor on Saturday for children's sexual abuse crimes, minor pornography and resort to minor prostitution.
According to the PJ, the suspect has a “particular predilection” by underage male students and looks for targets with “weak self -protection” through social networking platforms such as Instagram, X and Douyin, committing crimes by using material incentives such as money and goods to entice minors.
The PJ believes that man has been conducting these criminal practices since last year, not involving any female students. PJ does not exclude the possibility of other potential victims, alerting young people to be cautious as they get involved in online meetings and should not accept invitations from strangers from the internet.

It is evident from today, in the Articulate Gallery of the Macao Tower, the exhibition “Coffee Tea”, by renowned artist Victor Marreiros. With 59 works of digital art, the exhibition is an intimate journey through the Macanese cultural identity, crossing Portuguese and Chinese references with a delicate irony and a nostalgia of images. The exhibition will be open to the public until January 26, 2026.
The official opening took place yesterday afternoon, September 15, but from today the public can visit one of the most personal and symbolically dense shows of the local artistic scene. Victor Hugo Marreiros's “Coffee Tea” at Galeria Articulate at the Macao Tower Convention and Entertainment Center.
Curated by Wilson Chi-Yan Lam, the exhibition brings together 59 works that act as a visual diary of over three decades of career. Marreiros, one of the most influential names of graphic design in Macau, uses digital techniques, namely the expressive use of Photoshop, in constant dialogue with the tradition of China's ink, creating a hybrid style that mirrors the city's own history.
The title “Coffee Tea”, or “coffee tea” in Portuguese, is not arbitrary, translating itself in another way of “slightly” what the West and the East represents. This duality runs through the entire exposure. On the one hand, figures such as Camilo Pessanha, Amália Rodrigues or Infante D. Henrique; On the other, references to Chinese history and founding episodes of Macao, such as the battle against the Dutch 1622.
There is also space for a subtle irony and a critical look on contemporary themes, from pandemic confinements to global crises, always treated with what the curator describes as a "graphic delicacy."
“I grew up in Macao, surrounded by the aromas of coffee and tea. I have always been attracted to what I see, and mix Chinese paint with the Photoshop brush, the irony with longing, and serving everything in a cup that sometimes burns, sometimes smiling…”, reflects marreiros, at the entrance of the show that serves as a guiding thread.
In addition to being a retrospective of his career, which also includes the creation of posters for “June, Portugal's month” for over 30 years, “Coffee Tea” also presents recent works, such as the series of miniatures created for the Tuga Restaurant in Taiwan and Singapore, and a collection dedicated to Camilo Pessanha.
In conversation with the final point, the artist illustrates the exhibition as one that covers more old paintings and where the most themes in China appear. “I made paintings with Portuguese themes and just continued to make the collection [Camilo, Tuga], but in miniature. It has loose themes thematic, with more Chinese and Macao themes,” describes Marreiros.
Victor Hugo Marreiros is a key figure of Macau's visual culture. One of the founders of the Amagao Gallery, was also artistic director of TDM in the 1980s, led the Graphic Department of the Cultural Institute and was distinguished by the Macao government with the professional merit medal in 1999, the year with Ung Vai Meng, the exhibition “Two Men from Macau” in Osaka, one of the first international exhibitions of macanese designers.
The “Coffee Tea” exhibition is open every day from 10h00 to 18:30, until January 26, 2026. The entrance is free.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Chinese industrial production again slowing again to 5.2% in homologous terms</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/09/15/producao-industrial-chinesa-volta-a-abrandar-em-agosto-para-52-em-termos-homologos/</link><description>Industrial production in China registered a homologous growth of 5.2% in August, which marks the third consecutive month of slowdown. The number was below the expectations of analysts, who predicted that the data would recover from the 5.7% interanual recorded in July to about 5.8%.

Industrial production in China registered a homologous growth of 5.2% in August, which marks the third consecutive month of slowdown, according to official data released yesterday by the National Institute of Statistics (INE) of the Asian country.
The number of the eighth month of the year was below the expectations of analysts, which predicted that the data would recover from the 5.7% interanual recorded in July (a significant drop from 6.8% from June) to about 5.8%.
Of the three large sectors in which IA divides the indicator, what increased production in August was the transforming industry (+5.7%), surpassing the mining sector (5.1%) and the production and supply of electricity, heating, gas and water (+2.4%).
The data also indicate that Chinese industrial production accumulated a growth of 6.2 % between January and August 2025.
INE also released other statistical data from July, such as retail sales, a key indicator to measure the state of consumption, which followed the same trend, slowing from 3.7 %to 3.4 %, while analysts expected a slight recovery to 3.8 %. "Production and demand grew in a sustained manner, employment and prices were stable in general, and new growth engines were cultivated and expanded. The national economy maintained a generally stable inertia, with firm progress," the institution said. In turn, the official unemployment rate in urban areas stood by 5.3%, a value of over 5.2% of the previous month.
However, the growth in investment in fixed assets was 0.5%in the first eight months of the year, a significantly lower than July, which had been 1.6%, or until June (2.8%).
In this case, experts predicted a descent, but at a much slower pace than it turned out, up to 1.4%.
In sectors analysis, the investment destined to transforming industry grew 5.1% and 2% infrastructure, while the one intended for real estate promotion fell 12.9% in the context of the prolonged crisis that the sector is going through.
On this last point, INE indicated that commercial real estate sales measured by land area fell 4.7% in homologous terms until August.
The body also published yesterday the report on real estate prices, which points to a decrease of 0.3% between July and August in new housing in 70 selected cities, marking the 27th consecutive month of descents.

At the end, António Trindade said that it was a “100% positive, of total mutual interest, and with good development prospects” meeting in which various issues on initiatives that the company intends to promote “for some time” and that, in the person responsible, “are important to Macau for the big bay, and especially for Portugal”. "We have talked about other things we are trying to develop, we talked about transferring technologies from China to Portugal and Europe, in agriculture, and vice versa," Trindade added.
The president of Cesl Asia pointed out that development “is not just investment”, and it is necessary to create conditions to import and develop technologies, products and solutions. "The platform has much greater economic value than the game for Macau. Take the dimension of large bay, wants import, export, and perspective the relationship of the great bay with Africa and emerging countries, and Macau has no participation, and this is the platform. If there is interest [of the governments of Macao and Portugal], it has to be established," said Trindade.
The company's statement also states that, during the “friendly and productive audience”, the parties discussed the potential of a contribution of high value from Portugal in the development of global logistics and industrial infrastructure, as well as innovative and sustainable solutions for renewable energy and agriculture in Portugal.
The end of this month is scheduled to be a new meeting in Lisbon, "to discuss the development of such projects, in coordination with other relevant entities."
The meeting was also attended by Roland Schoorl, CESL Asia COO, Philòmene Dias, director of AICEP, the Portuguese Agency of Trade and Foreign Investment, Nuno Lima Leite and Bernardo Pinho, heads of AICEP representation in Beijing and Macau.</description><pubDate>2025-09-15 02:06:30</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
