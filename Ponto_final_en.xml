According to the local press, Lukas Ho Cheuk-wai, 41, considered the mastermind of the attacks, having made the site available and purchased the materials needed to manufacture explosives, was sentenced to 18 years in prison. The same court of first instance sentenced Lee Ka-pan, 31, and Cheung Ka-chun, 35, to 16 years and eight months in prison.
In handing down the sentence, Judge Johnny Chan Jong-herng recalled that the trio had successfully carried out two initial attacks without causing any casualties, and said that the accused had shown little remorse during the trial.
The judge described the defendants' acts as a declaration of war against society and said that the sentence must be heavy enough to deter further similar acts.
In early September, a jury, made up of seven women and two men, found the defendants guilty of “conspiracy to cause an explosion of a nature likely to endanger life or cause serious damage to property”.
The three defendants could have been sentenced to a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, according to a law approved in colonial times.
At the end of the trial, which lasted almost half a year, all seven defendants had been acquitted of involvement in terrorist activities, a charge that could carry a sentence of life in prison.
According to the indictment, the group attempted to manufacture explosives to plant bombs, between November 2019 and March 2020, in several locations in the city, including a medical center and a metro station.
In July 2021, police said the defendants planned to use the material to bomb courts, tunnels, railways and blow up rubbish bins in the street, “to maximize the damage caused to society”. Police said the group planned to leave Hong Kong and sabotage the city before leaving.</description><pubDate>2025-10-27 22:56:28</pubDate></item><item><title>Chinese industry profits accelerate 3.2% year-on-year until September</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/10/27/lucros-da-industria-chinesa-aceleram-32-em-termos-homologos-ate-setembro/</link><description>The profits of China's main industrial companies increased 3.2% year-on-year in the first nine months of 2025, accelerating compared to the 0.9% growth recorded until August, the Chinese Government reported yesterday.
According to data released by the National Statistics Office (GNE), the indicator registered a growth of 21.6% in the month of September alone, compared to the same period of the previous year.
If the trend continues, Chinese industrial companies could finally reverse the negative cycle of the last three years, in which profits fell by 2% in 2022, 2.3% in 2023 and 3.3% in 2024.
Between January and September, the profits of the companies analyzed totaled 5.37 billion yuan, according to the GNE.
The GNE only considers industrial enterprises to be those that have an annual turnover of more than 20 million yuan.
GNE statistician Yu Weining attributed the recovery to Beijing's implementation of economic support policies and the boost of so-called “new quality productivity” in sectors such as the aerospace industry, the production of smart consumer devices, specialized electronics and precision instruments. Yu stressed, however, that “complex changes in the external environment” and “continuous pressures on economic development” persist, calling for increased efforts to stimulate domestic demand.</description><pubDate>2025-10-27 22:55:58</pubDate></item><item><title>Emperor Palace and Waldo casinos close this week</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/10/27/casinos-emperor-palace-e-waldo-encerram-esta-semana/</link><description>The Emperor Palace and Waldo casinos will close this week, announced the gaming operators to which these satellite casinos are linked. The closures will affect a total of 182 workers – 71 at Emperor Palace and 111 at Waldo. The Gaming Inspection and Coordination Department (DICJ) guarantees that it is attentive to the closure procedures of the two satellite casinos.

SJM Resorts announced yesterday that the Emperor Palace satellite casino will officially close at 11:59 pm this Thursday. At the same time, Galaxy reported that Waldo will end operations at 11:59 pm on Friday.
Last June, remember, SJM, Melco and Galaxy announced that, by the end of the year, they would stop operating satellite casinos. The basis for these decisions by gaming operators is the review of the gaming law carried out in 2022, which stipulates that, after the end of a transitional period of three years – which ends on December 31, 2025 –, if the concessionaires intend to continue operating satellite casinos, this exploration can only be done by hiring a management company. In this case, the concessionaire could only pay the management company the remuneration related to management, and could not share casino revenues with it, or pay commissions.
In the press release sent to the newsrooms, SJM says that all tables and gaming machines currently in operation at the Emperor Palace casino, at the Grand Emperor hotel, will be transferred to other casinos in the group. On the other hand, customers who have accumulated chips, deposits or cash discounts at this casino that have not been redeemed after its closure will be able to visit other casinos operated by SJM Resorts from October 31st for follow-up measures. SJM ensures that all customer rights will be duly respected.
“SJM Resorts places great importance on protecting local employment,” reads the concessionaire’s press release, ensuring that “all local employees employed by SJM Resorts will remain employed and will be transferred to other company casinos to assume gaming-related roles, according to operational needs.” Local employees who work at Emperor Palace and who are not employed by SJM will be “invited to apply for related vacancies within the group, with priority in hiring on equal terms, and will receive the necessary support, depending on the actual situation, to facilitate a smooth transition”, says SJM.
Galaxy also says that Waldo's gaming tables at ZAPE will be transferred to other casinos in the group. Galaxy also emphasizes that Waldo casino workers will be transferred to other casinos or functions unrelated to gambling, under the group's responsibility, with all terms of employment remaining unchanged. In addition, Galaxy “will provide them with a series of professional training programs to support their transition to new work environments and ensure continued job stability”, the press release reads.
Regarding the redemption of Waldo casino chips, Galaxy says it will ensure “customers' interests and appropriate treatment”: from November 1st, valid chips with the Galaxy Waldo logo can be redeemed at designated counters at Galaxy Casino Macau or StarWorld Casino.

DICJ ATTENTIVE

After the announcement of the operators, the Gaming Inspection and Coordination Directorate (DICJ) guaranteed, in a statement, that “it will strictly supervise the closure procedures of the aforementioned casinos, in order to ensure that they proceed in a stable and orderly manner and that all legal procedures are being duly complied with”.
The DICJ also says that it will appoint employees to supervise the formal closure process, “in this way ensuring compliance of the procedures with the respective closure proposals for Casino Emperor Palace and Casino Waldo defined by SJM and Galaxy and presented to the Government, particularly with regard to the appropriate treatment of cash and game chips stored in the treasury, any cash coupons not used, the exchange of game chips, the cake of prizes accumulated in gaming machines, cash tickets from gaming machines that have not been exchanged, among other procedures”.
According to the DICJ, the closures will affect a total of 182 workers – 71 at Emperor Palace and 111 at Waldo. “The DICJ will continue to maintain close communication with the Directorate of Services for Labor Affairs, in order to ensure strict compliance with the commitments assumed by SJM and Galaxy, namely the proposal presented previously, with regard to the relocation of the same workers, as well as effective guarantees regarding their remuneration, benefits and working conditions, providing them with opportunities to change jobs, with a view to guaranteeing their employment. continuous”, emphasize the authorities.</description><pubDate>2025-10-27 23:08:35</pubDate></item><item><title>Vanessa da Mata performs in Macau on November 15th</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/10/27/vanessa-da-mata-actua-em-macau-no-dia-15-de-novembro/</link><description>Vanessa da Mata will perform in Macau, in the large auditorium of the Macau Cultural Center, on November 15th at 8pm. The Brazilian singer will perform with the Macau Chinese Orchestra in a show included in the 7th edition of the “Encounter in Macau – Festival of Arts and Culture between China and Portuguese-speaking Countries”. Tickets are on sale to the public from today at the Enjoy Macao Ticket Office.

"I am appalled by the deplorable situation in Burma [former name of Myanmar]. The 2021 military coup piled calamity upon calamity. Villages bombed or burned. Thousands dead. Millions displaced. Regional stability is at risk," warned Guterres, adding that "atrocities and the cycle of impunity must end."
Calling for an immediate end to the violence, the UN leader stated that there must be “a genuine commitment to inclusive dialogue” and a return to civilian government, “starting with the rapid release of all those who have been arbitrarily detained”.
The military junta that has held power in Myanmar since the February 2021 coup announced last July that it would hold elections in December, but the lack of real opposition, with many pro-democracy politicians in exile or in prison, including Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi, means that much of the international community considers that the vote will be a sham.
Since the military coup against the democratically elected government led by Aung San Suu Kyi, Myanmar has been immersed in turmoil, with an armed rebellion taking control of large areas of the territory. “The path forward must lead to the restoration of democratic institutions anchored in the rule of law and human rights”, considered Guterres, admitting that he believes that “no one thinks that these elections will be free and fair”.
The United Nations secretary-general supported a peace plan drawn up in 2021 by ASEAN to end hostilities and begin dialogue, which the military government has ignored. “It is time to open humanitarian channels, end the violence and facilitate a comprehensive political solution,” he said. “The people of Myanmar count on our collective support,” he added.
The UN Secretary General's statements were made during a press conference in the capital of Malaysia, where the summit of leaders of ASEAN and allied countries began on Sunday.
The summit will end today and will be attended, in addition to the leaders of countries in the region, by the President of the USA, Donald Trump, the Brazilian Prime Minister, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, and the Canadian Prime Minister, Mark Carney, among others.
For Guterres, Southeast Asia “offers a vision of hope” in a “turbulent world”, although “some of the global challenges weigh heavily” on the region, among which he named deepening inequalities and rising temperatures.

The regulation was published yesterday in the Official Bulletin.

The purchase of support products and household equipment for people with disabilities will receive a Government contribution of up to 75%, stipulates the regulation published yesterday in the Official Bulletin. The Executive emphasizes that the support for each piece of equipment cannot exceed 15 thousand patacas and the maximum cumulative financial support is 30 thousand patacas.
The regulation, signed by O Lam, Secretary for Social Affairs and Culture, explains that this support aims to “provide support to people with disabilities with limited economic resources, contributing to the costs of purchasing support products and special household equipment”.
The Government details that supported support products can be canes, crutches, walkers, wheelchairs, shower or toilet chairs, anti-bedsore pillows or mattresses, prostheses, therapeutic footwear, hearing aids, screen reading software, glasses and articulated beds, for example.
Beneficiaries must have a Macao SAR resident card, have resided in the territory uninterruptedly for the last 18 months – unless exempted from doing so by the Institute of Social Action (IAS) –, hold a valid disability assessment registration card, have passed the assessment of the household's economic situation.
To be approved in the assessment of the household's economic situation, the applicant's household must have a total monthly income of no more than 16,100 patacas. On the other hand, the total amount of bank deposits, cash and securities portfolio values ​​held by the household cannot exceed 130,500 patacas if the household only has one member, 239,700 if the household has two members or 330,600 patacas if it has three members, for example. Furthermore, the total number of properties, inside or outside the Macao SAR, owned by household members cannot exceed one property intended for housing and one parking space.
Requests for the granting of the monetary allowance must be submitted to the IAS before the acquisition of the equipment in question. With the request, the support equipment to be purchased must be indicated and the price quote must be attached.
From 2019 until now, the Government has been providing this support in the form of a pilot plan. Until now, after the application was successfully made, the applicant received a subsidy of 50% of the acquisition cost of each auxiliary equipment, with each applicant being entitled to three financings during the plan implementation period, with the value of each financing not being able to exceed 10 thousand patacas.</description><pubDate>2025-10-27 23:09:21</pubDate></item><item><title>Che Sai Wang suggests that students have more vacation periods</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/10/27/che-sai-wang-sugere-que-alunos-tenham-mais-periodos-de-ferias/</link><description>Deputy Che Sai Wang proposes, in a written interpellation, the reduction of students' teaching load and the addition of more vacation periods throughout the year. “If short-term holidays are established in Spring and Autumn, students will not only be able to have adequate physical and mental rest, but they will also be able to increase learning efficiency and improve their mental health”, says the deputy.

Che Sai Wang argues that students should have more vacation periods throughout the academic year, in order to rest properly and improve their mental health. In a written question sent to the Government, the deputy suggests another vacation period in the Spring and another in the Autumn.
The parliamentarian linked to the Association of Public Service Workers of Macau (ATFPM) says that “in the middle and before the end of the school period, students feel mentally exhausted, lose concentration and learning pace, and some even suffer from excessive psychological pressure, which affects their physical and mental development”.
Che Sai Wang warns that winter and summer holidays alone are insufficient to “adjust the pace of learning”. “The holidays are too concentrated and there is no break in the middle of the period for rest and adjustments”, he says, remembering that, recently, some regions in the interior of China began to implement spring and autumn holidays. Other countries and regions, including Hong Kong, have established schemes such as “mid-term holidays” or “Easter holidays”, “the results of which are generally recognised”, says Che.
“Some young people even face problems such as anxiety and lack of sleep, due to the pressure of studies and exams”, he highlights, proposing that, “if short-term holidays are established in Spring and Autumn, students will not only be able to have adequate physical and mental rest, but they will also be able to increase learning efficiency and improve their mental health”.
Furthermore, “spring and autumn holidays can also allow schools to create new forms of education, for example, organizing study trips and social practices, so that students can have contact with society outside of schools, broaden their horizons and achieve integral development at a moral, intellectual, physical, social, aesthetic and work level”.
Che Sai Wang notes that “many parents complain that when their children have a lot of school pressure over a long period of time, it is easy for the family environment to become tense and communication between parents and children to be lacking.” “If it is possible to establish spring and autumn holidays, with flexible coordination in labor policies, it will be possible to provide more time for parents and children to spend time together, mitigate family conflicts and increase the feeling of family happiness”, reads the written interpellation.
The deputy warns that, “if there are no support policies, there could be a situation in which students have holidays, but their guardians do not have time to accompany them, which affects the original intention of the holiday policy”.
In the interpellation, Che Sai Wang also asks the Government about the results of the measures to reduce the teaching load of students, reiterating that the Executive should consider the implementation of vacation periods in the Spring and Autumn.</description><pubDate>2025-10-27 23:10:06</pubDate></item><item><title>China calls on ASEAN to reject “all forms of protectionism”</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/10/27/china-apela-a-asean-para-rejeitar-todas-as-formas-de-protecionismo/</link><description>Chinese Premier Li Qiang yesterday called on the countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to oppose “protectionism”, at a time marked by the escalation of the trade war with Washington.

In a speech during the summit of leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), taking place in Kuala Lumpur, Chinese Premier Li Qiang urged member countries to remain “committed to resolving differences through dialogue and consultation”.
The statements come at a time when the President of the United States, Donald Trump, has already abandoned the meeting to continue an Asian tour that will take him to Japan and then to South Korea, where he is expected to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum (APEC) summit.
The two leaders are expected to hold their first face-to-face meeting since 2019, after their teams negotiate, this weekend in Kuala Lumpur, a preliminary understanding to mitigate the trade dispute between the world's two largest economies.
During his speech, Li Qiang also stated that China is willing to launch new practical initiatives to “jointly achieve new successes in the development of Southeast Asia”, and promised to “strengthen strategic alignment with all parties”.

“More mature and stable” relationship with Australia

The Australian Prime Minister met with his Chinese counterpart yesterday, on the sidelines of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit, with both expressing their desire to promote a “more mature, stable and constructive” relationship.
During the opening speech, Anthony Albanese recalled his recent visit to Beijing, Shanghai and Chengdu, and reiterated Australia's commitment to stabilizing relations with China, highlighting “common interests” in the areas of trade and climate change, as well as the importance of maintaining a “direct dialogue” between Canberra and Beijing.
The head of the Australian Government also made an implicit reference to the differences between the two countries, stating that the region must be governed by a “system based on transparency and respect for the rules”.
The meeting between Albanese and Li Qiang took place in Kuala Lumpur, a few days after the Australian Air Force reported that a Chinese fighter launched dangerous flares near an Australian surveillance aircraft in the South China Sea. In response, the Chinese Ministry of Defense accused Australia of spreading “distorted propaganda”. It is not known whether the incident was addressed during the remaining meeting between Albanese and Li Qiang, which took place behind closed doors.

Over the past 30 years, he has worked in diverse areas, such as video, TV ads, 2D/3D animation, Virtual Reality, drone filming and documentation. And, more recently, he has worked with high-resolution photography, drones and timelapse, producing some of the most unique and spectacular images of the city.
Ten years ago, he embarked on an ambitious project to capture never-before-seen views of Macau using drone photography. "At that time, almost no one was using drones. And then I had this concept of viewing Macau from the air, but looking at the coast from above the water, so the idea was to allow people to see the land and coast from the perspective of the water", he said.
The project, titled Macau Aerial, took around two years to complete, but was never publicly displayed. However, it was presented to some audiences as a limited showing on the 12K high-resolution screens at the MGM cinema in Cotai. "Most of the projects I'm involved in take about two years. Macau Aerial took a while to film, mainly due to changing weather conditions. And one thing I've learned is that when you're working with something with a resolution as high as 12K, you can't take shortcuts."
A decade later, and with the rapid development of technology and the city's skyline, Pedro would like to revisit the project, “this time with better equipment”.
However, while drone video/photography techniques have improved dramatically, official regulations have also come into effect. "Officially, now it is not possible to fly drones above 30 meters, but 10 years ago, to obtain these panoramic photos, I flew at an altitude of 200 meters. Furthermore, it is not possible to use drones above 7 kg, which is very small, and it is not possible to fly at night."

Doing things in ways that have never been done before is basically Pedro's standard philosophy when creating new projects. "I don't do what others do. I always try to push the limits and stay a little ahead. If I just do what others are doing, I don't know anyone, so I do what others don't do", he says.
Pedro’s productions often employ a technique known as High Dynamic Range (HDR), multi-camera ‘timelapse’ panoramic photography, using high-resolution cameras to capture thousands of images over a long period of time, which are then “stitched” together to create a stunning visual experience.
For one of these projects, overlooking Macau's Inner Harbor from the top of one of NAPE's buildings, Pedro explains that he used four 8K cameras. Taking photos at 5-second intervals over around 10 hours generated around 3.4TB of RAW data, which had to be meticulously worked on in post-production to create the final timelapse visuals. In total, it took four workstations operating 24/7 for two months to process the impressive 93,924 photographs, and a few more months to finally combine 23,481 photographs into a single 30K panoramic image. "I have six powerful workstations, connected to 600 TB of storage. I need all of this because there is no other way to process so much data at 30K resolution. I don't think anyone else is doing this", he explains.
Pedro is currently working on post-production on an even more complex HDR timelapse panoramic video overlooking Sai Wan Lake. Set to the haunting soundtrack of a traditional Chinese Erhu, the final 40K resolution video will showcase what is known as the “Holy Grail” of timelapse photography, a seamless and harmonious transition from a day view to a night view. "It's called the 'Holy Grail' technique because it's very difficult to achieve. So far, my footage of Sai Wan Lake is around 20 TB. And I'm still working on the daytime sequence."
Interestingly, Pedro was not always a multimedia artist by profession. He studied analogue and digital electrical engineering at the University of Coimbra, in Portugal. Arriving in Macau in the early 1990s, he began working as a programming analyst at the Department of Health. There, he oversaw a technological revolution at the time, migrating the computing systems of several important departments from mainframes to PCs. From 1993 to 1996, he worked at the Macau Polytechnic University, setting up Macau's first multimedia laboratory. “Then I opened my own company in 1997 and never looked back.”
During the entire time he lived in Macau, Pedro resided in Coloane and today he still considers the village his home. "I'm a resident of the village. Every time, even when I work with the government, I sign as Pedro, the resident of Coloane", he laughs.
More recently, Pedro was involved in another two-year project, Macau Cartography – 500-year-old exhibition, and has also been experimenting with 360-degree videos. Previously, I had recorded 360-degree timelapse videos with multiple cameras working in sync from the top of the Macau Tower, and I would really like to try using VR technology again.
"My biggest dream is to install a complete VR system on top of the Macau Tower over a long period of time, with several cameras recording Macau's development over 10 or 20 years. I've had projects for five years, so it's just a matter of budget."
Pedro's most recent idea is on a slightly smaller scale, but equally creative. It hopes to present the ancient Kunyu Wanguo Quantu, a 1602 world map drawn by the famous Jesuit missionary to China, Matteo Ricci – currently located in Beijing, in six pieces, each 1.5 meters long – in an immersive installation for the public to experience. Another idea he's working on is installing a large panoramic map view on the Tap-Seac. “That's what I love most about my job, I always have a blank page, a blank canvas, and I can just wake up one day and decide to do something that's never been done before.”

The young people interviewed point to the insufficient coverage of the transport network and the limitation of payment methods as factors that affect their willingness to use the Light Rail, transport that the Government sees as a solution to urban traffic problems.

Few local young people choose to use the Light Rail for everyday trips, while their preferred means of transport continues to be the public bus. A survey revealed that only 1.5% of young people interviewed depend on the Light Rail for everyday travel, and the low frequency of use is due to insufficient coverage of the territory by the Light Rail.
The survey was carried out in June by the New Chinese Youth Association of Macau among 647 young residents aged between 18 and 44, with a view to investigating the function and effectiveness of the Light Rail for the youth generation.
The results indicate that traditional road transport dominates daily travel among the group, with more than a third (36.6%) of respondents prioritizing buses when traveling. Around 32% choose to drive, either motorcycles or cars, while walking is also a significant means of transport, representing 26.3%.
Among those interviewed, almost six in ten young people traveled on the Light Rail in the last 12 months, the frequency of use of which, however, is generally low, with the majority being infrequent users. Almost 70% said they traveled on the Light Rail once every three months or less.
The analysis further suggests that the Light Rail's current appeal to young people stems mainly from its “newness”, rather than its transport functionality. Young people used the Light Rail “purely for the experience” (33.9%), followed by “traveling to border posts” (22.1%) and “visiting integrated resorts” (21.3%).
In this sense, the role of the Light Rail in young people's daily travel “is limited”, with its transport function not yet being fully realized, stated the team responsible for the survey.

INCONVENIENCE OF SERVICES

With regard to satisfaction with Light Rail services, the survey revealed that young people gave a relatively positive rating to the “reasonableness of fares”, with an average score of 3.52 in a school out of five points. “Station amenities” and “service frequency” obtained an evaluation of 3.52 points and 3.4 points, respectively. “Station coverage” received the lowest average score of 2.67 points. Almost 42% of respondents gave low ratings of 1 or 2 points.
“Insufficient network coverage is the main reason why young people in Macau choose not to use the Light Rail”, he highlighted. The research team stated that, according to the reports of young people interviewed who did not use this means of transport in the last 12 months, the reason is mainly the limited network.
According to the analysis, the three main reasons cited were “stations located too far from home” (46.1%), “insufficient network coverage” (35.6%) and “inability to reach the destination directly” (33.3%).
Furthermore, more than 60% of young people indicate that the impossibility of making payments with a QR code at turnstiles on the Light Rail reduces their willingness to use the service. A total of 64% of respondents expect the Light Rail company to develop a mobile phone application dedicated to real-time information about transport frequencies.
The survey also investigated young people's opinions on the Government's public transport policy, which intends for “Light Metro to play the main role and buses to play a complementary role”. According to the report, young people who expressed disagreement (37.2%) slightly outnumbered those who supported (33.9%), in other words, society has doubts about the implementation of this policy”, he noted.
However, more than 70% of young people consider that the Light Rail project “should be further developed” after the completion of the East Line with, for example, the construction of the future West Line.</description><pubDate>2025-10-27 23:10:47</pubDate></item><item><title>Timor-Leste’s partners highlight the country’s “great achievement” with membership in ASEAN</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/10/27/parceiros-de-timor-leste-destacam-grande-conquista-do-pais-com-adesao-a-asean/</link><description>Several of Timor-Leste's partners highlighted the country's “great achievement” with its accession, on Sunday, to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which will allow it to strengthen its regional integration.

“Yesterday’s announcement [Sunday] in Malaysia is a monumental achievement and the result of many years of hard work on the part of the Government of Timor-Leste, ASEAN countries and their partners”, said the Australian embassy yesterday, in a post on social media.
Timor-Leste completed its accession to ASEAN on Sunday with the signing ceremony of the declaration of admission by the Timorese Prime Minister, Xanana Gusmão. The document was then delivered to the organization's secretary general, Kao Kim Hourn, by the head of the Government of Timor-Leste, accompanied by President José Ramos-Horta.
On Sunday, in a speech given at the ASEAN heads of state and government summit in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, the president of the European Council, António Costa, congratulated Timor-Leste on its accession, considering it an “important milestone to promote the country's economic and political interdependence” and to “strengthen regional integration”.
The European Union's representation at ASEAN also highlighted, on social media, the support given by the European organization to Timor-Leste through capacity building, trade support, institutional strengthening, among others. “Today, ASEAN is complete, geographically and politically, and Timor-Leste gains new opportunities for regional inclusion and deeper economic integration”, reads a post on social media.
The United States, through Secretary of State Mark Rubio, also congratulated Timor-Leste on its “historic” membership as the 11th member of ASEAN, highlighting that “it represents an important step in the ongoing search for regional integration and cooperation”. “The United States maintains its commitment to the centrality of ASEAN and supports Timor-Leste’s efforts in the integration process,” he added.

The leader of the Revolutionary Front of Independent Timor-Leste (Fretilin), Mari Alkatiri, stated yesterday that Timor-Leste must work together to give value to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and not just to take value from it. "Before, we won the fight because we were united. Now that we have entered ASEAN, we all have to be united. At this moment, we are not in confrontation, but the situation is difficult and demanding, because establishing partnerships and cooperation means meeting all the conditions to be a member that adds value to ASEAN, and not just takes value from ASEAN", said Mari Alkatiri.
Fretilin's secretary general spoke to journalists at Nicolau Lobato international airport, after returning from a work trip to Northern Ireland, England and Portugal. The opposition leader also highlighted that Timor-Leste's accession to ASEAN is an achievement for everyone. “We joined ASEAN, and this is a success for all the people”, praised Mari Alkatiri.
The Fretilin leader also called for national unity, arguing that everyone should work together and not in isolation. "If everyone works on their own, we won't be able to achieve anything. That's the big challenge," he said. "Before, when we started our fight, some said that we were a small country, a poor people, without higher education, that we would never win. But, in the end, we won because we were united and turned the fight into a common cause. That's what really matters", added Mari Alkatiri.
ASEAN was created in 1967 by Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia and the Philippines, and was later joined by Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Vietnam and since Sunday by Timor-Leste. With 676.6 million inhabitants, ASEAN is the third most populous region in the world, after India and China.

On the occasion, the Macau delegation drew attention to the results of prevention and treatment of hypertension.
Wong In, deputy head of the Department of Community Health Care, said, at the conference, that, “from 2023, the system of quality indicators for the management of chronic diseases in public medical institutions in Macau has been fully implemented”, and “the level of treatment and control of hypertension” has been raised “significantly”.
According to the doctor, currently, around 90% of patients with hypertension in public medical institutions in Macau receive timely treatment, and the proportion of blood pressure reaching the ideal level has increased from 48.5% in 2023 to 62.5% in 2024. “This increase of 14.1% is equivalent to better blood pressure control for around 11,500 patients with hypertension, which is important for prevent the occurrence of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases”, he said.
“The results obtained benefited from the implementation of the universal health coverage policy and the digital health management system, being a concrete practice of Macau in the implementation of the Healthy China 2030 Planning Guidelines”, said the Macau official, adding that, in the future, “we will continue to promote the exchange of experiences at an international level, contributing to the development of the cause of public health at a global level”.</description><pubDate>2025-10-27 23:07:51</pubDate></item><item><title>Smoking and alcohol prevention activity attracted more than 6,000 people</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/10/27/actividade-de-prevencao-do-tabagismo-e-do-alcool-atraiu-mais-de-6-000-pessoas/</link><description>Last weekend, the Health Services carried out a smoking and alcohol prevention activity that had a total of more than 6,000 participants, according to authorities.
This activity was carried out in ten locations in Macau, Taipa and Coloane. Consultation tents, interactive games and explanations about health were set up, residents were shown the harm to their health from tobacco and alcohol consumption, and the provisions of the Tobacco Control Law and the Alcohol Consumption Control Law were publicized. At the activity location, health professionals from collaborating associations provided professional smoking cessation counseling services.
Taking into account that Macau is responsible for organizing some divisions of the 15th edition of the National Games, this activity also took advantage of the opportunity to publicize the health benefits of physical activity.
Workers encouraged residents to instill good physical exercise habits in order to prepare for the 15th edition of the National Games with physical well-being, thus jointly creating a social sports atmosphere for everyone.
Furthermore, the activity simultaneously promoted the “Chronic Disease Screening Program”, encouraging residents to take advantage of health vouchers to regularly carry out health screening and management of chronic diseases, focusing on prevention to maintain good health.</description><pubDate>2025-10-27 23:07:16</pubDate></item><item><title>Beijing calls for end to trade wars before Xi-Trump meeting</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/10/27/pequim-pede-fim-das-guerras-comerciais-antes-de-encontro-entre-xi-e-trump/</link><description>Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said yesterday that the world is moving towards a “multipolar order” and called for an end to trade wars, days before the meeting between Xi Jinping and Donald Trump.

During a forum held in Beijing, Wang criticized “the politicization of economic and trade issues, the artificial fragmentation of global markets and the use of trade wars and tariff battles”, in a veiled reference to United States protectionism.
“The direction of History cannot be reversed and a multipolar world is emerging”, stated the diplomat, who also warned against the “frequent withdrawal of agreements, the reversal of commitments and the enthusiastic formation of blocs and alliances”, actions that, according to him, place multilateralism under “unprecedented challenges”.
The statements come on the eve of the arrival of North American leader, Donald Trump, in South Korea, where a meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, is scheduled for Thursday on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in the city of Gyeongju.
On Sunday, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that the two leaders should validate a commitment regarding Chinese exports of rare earths and Beijing's purchase of North American soybeans.
The Chinese representative for International Trade, Li Chenggang, guaranteed that the two countries had reached a “preliminary consensus”. A tariff truce is currently in force between the two sides, which expires on November 10th.

US President wants to make a good deal with China

The President of the United States, Donald Trump, stated yesterday that he hopes to “reach a good agreement” during the next meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, including a pact related to the TikTok platform, according to the international press.
Trump declared, aboard Air Force One, that TikTok will be one of the topics he will discuss with Xi during the meeting, scheduled for this Thursday, on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit, which will take place in the South Korean city of Gyeongju, according to the EFE news agency. According to the US President, the agreement, signed between Washington and the parent company of the popular video platform, the Chinese ByteDance, already has Xi's “provisional approval”.
In September, the United States reached an agreement with Beijing-backed ByteDance to allow TikTok to continue operating on North American soil, after the US Congress established in 2024 that the application should be deactivated due to the risk it posed to the country's national security.
The pact establishes the creation of a mostly North American joint venture, with an operation sufficiently separate from its Chinese parent company — which will maintain a 20% stake —, especially with regard to the Chinese Government's access to servers that store user data.
The face-to-face meeting between the two leaders will provide an opportunity for both powers to ease tensions following Beijing's announcement of restrictions on the sale of its rare earths and to discuss a possible comprehensive trade agreement after months of tariff tensions.

According to law enforcement data, Customs seized, between January and August this year, a total of 140 units of electronic cigarette devices and more than 60 thousand bottles and units of oils or cartridges for electronic cigarettes.
Legislation that prohibits the possession of electronic cigarettes in Macau is being prepared by the Executive. The Health Services say they will review the smoking prevention and control regime, with a view to protecting the health of young people and avoiding their contact with and the use of electronic cigarettes.
The Health Services admit to moving forward with the definition of sanctions for the administration of electronic cigarettes in this amendment to the law, in addition to proposing the expansion of outdoor areas where smoking is prohibited, the ban on new types of tobacco, imitation tobacco products and the prevalence of tobacco.
In response to a question from Congresswoman Wong Kit Cheng, Alvis Lo, director of Health Services, states that he is maintaining active communication with the competent services and continues to listen to society's opinions, in order to begin the process of reviewing the law as quickly as possible.
The official recalled that, under current electronic cigarette regulations, the manufacture, distribution, sale, import, export and transport of electronic cigarettes in and out of the Macao SAR is prohibited.
Alvis Lo, in this context, revealed that, between January and August of this year, a total of 140 units of electronic cigarette devices and 60,871 bottles or units of electronic cigarette oil or electronic cigarette cartridges were seized.
“The Customs Services continue to reinforce not only risk control relating to imported postal objects, but also customs inspection at border posts, as well as coordination and communication with the logistics sector”, he reiterated.
The director added that, when postal items from abroad arrive in Macau, the competent authorities will determine whether the inspection requires the use of X-ray equipment. And, if electronic cigarettes are detected inside postal items, they will be handed over to Customs for due processing, which will be treated in accordance with established procedures or returned to the postal service of origin, with notification that such items are of Import prohibited in Macau.
According to the monitoring and evaluation report of the Smoking Prevention and Control Regime 2021-2023, released by the Health Services in May, the rate of consumption of electronic cigarettes by secondary school students aged between 13 and 15 years old increased from 2.6% in 2015 to 4.0% in 2021, representing an increase of approximately 53.8%, being higher than the consumption rate of cigarettes (2.1%).
Remember that the authorities had announced that the total ban on possession of electronic cigarettes has already concluded internal consultations within the Government, and a public consultation will be held later. In this case, if there is consensus for legislation, it is anticipated that the legislative process could begin next year. Furthermore, the Government plans to expand the smoking ban zone in outdoor areas, having selected the vicinity of four schools and kindergartens as pilot areas for the smoking ban, which should be implemented by the end of this year.
Alvis Lo, in response to the question, promised to promote the construction of a tobacco-free environment in Macau, mainly through the review and enforcement of laws, awareness raising and dissemination, and encouraging smoking cessation.
Regarding health awareness and education, Alvis Lo stressed that the Executive has been disseminating information about the harm associated with tobacco consumption, through advertisements and exhibitions, 'roadshows' with companies and higher education institutions, as well as lectures and interactive theater shows in schools.</description><pubDate>2025-10-27 23:11:37</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
