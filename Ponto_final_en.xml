The case was diagnosed with a 57 -year -old woman resident of Macao, who had recently traveled to Vietname. This case led health authorities to reinforce disease prevention and control work.
According to health services, after returning from Vietname, the woman had high fever, dry cough, generalized muscle and joint aches. On Monday, he developed a rash throughout his body and went the day after the Conde de São Januário hospital for medical treatment. On Wednesday, his blood sample was confirmed by the public health laboratory of health services, with a positive reaction to dengue fever, type I. The current clinical condition of the patient is considered stable.
Dengue fever is transmitted to people through the bite of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes infected with the virus. If a vector mosquito chops a patient with dengue fever, this mosquito becomes infected and can transmit the virus to other people through the bite.
Health services warn that Macau is still at the time of risk of dissemination of mosquitoes and, during inspections, there was already a situation of proliferation of larvae in containers with stagnant water in households, such as vessels and vessel bases.
In response to dengue cases, the Institute for Municipal Affairs (AMI) intensified the inspection work of proliferation sources and chemical elimination of mosquitoes in risk zones. On the other hand, health services have increased, since March, the frequency of oily larvicide application to twice a month to more than 25,000 public places with stagnant water, such as fade and drainage channels on the streets throughout the territory. Authorities also warn that, due to warm and rainy climate, containers and outdoor places can accumulate water, providing ideal conditions for mosquito proliferation, so it appeals to the population to eliminate stagnant waters in the workplaces or home, prevent mosquitoes from entering spaces and protecting themselves against outdoor bites.</description><pubDate>2025-07-11 01:36:16</pubDate></item><item><title>Palestine III - The Palestinians</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/07/11/palestina-iii-os-palestinianos/</link><description>The dispute for the land, which is, at the end and to the cable, what feeds all the violence we assist in Palestine is an unfair and unequal dispute between two peoples; On the one hand are the Palestinians, so -called Arabs, Muslims, mostly, but also some of Christian faith, the native people of the region in which they have been inhabited for more than two thousand years, devoid of any means of defense, and the other are the Jews, foreign invaders, who claim a dubious historical right of religious basis, it is to say, of mythological basis, but are supported by the great militar powers of the West.
 
The land
The word Palestinian which we get used to listening so often lately is the name of a region of the Middle-Earient. In Arabic it is said to be Fililastin (فِلَسْطِينُ), but this region has had several names throughout history.
At the Bronze Age (3000-1200 BC), when he was under Egyptian rule, Palestine was known as the land of Canaan, a term that appears in the Bible, and was inhabited primarily by the Canaanian tribes.
Around the beginning of the Iron Age (1200-500 a. C.), the southern coastal zone of Palestine, where Gaza is today, was inhabited by the Philistines, hence that this portion of land came to be known as Philistia-in Portuguese, Philistine-which reflects the original semitic name, plustim, which could also be pronounced FLIÃITIM, depending on the phonetic context. From the first form of this toponym, the Greeks derived παλαιστίνη ‘Palaistíne’, from which the Romans took their Palastina. This is the origin of the Palestinian toponymic term.
How did this word be called the entire territory to which we call Palestine today? This is mainly due to the Romans. [In this article, when I refer to Palestine as the Middle-Orient Region, I refer to the geographical extension covered by the territory of the British Protective of Palestine, from 1920 to 1946, and that it was supposed to have been divided between Jews and Arabs in 1948.] In the period covered by the biblical narrative, the region of Modern Palestine was called Israel, to the north, and the South, and other small states that Always according to the biblical text, they were incorporated into the great empire of Solomon, an empire we know today never existed. The biblical narrative, as we have had the opportunity to mention, from a historical point of view is not reliable.
In the classic period, that is, since the Roman conquest in 63 BC, the Roman province that occupied part of what today is the Palestine called Judea, for it resulted from the conquest of the Hasmoneu Kingdom of Judah, established in 140 BC by the Macabees.
In 135 of our era, after the third Jewish-Roman war, the Jews, that is, the practitioners of Jewish religion and not the inhabitants of Judea, are expelled from the region and Judea becomes part of the Roman province of Syria Maior, being called Syria Palastina. Since then the name of Palestine has been to this day as the name of that portion of land in the midfielder. The Province of Great Syrian has maintained practically the same geographical format from the Romans to the fall of the Ottoman Empire in 1918.
From the seventh century, with its conquest by Muslims, the region, then part of the Byzantine Empire, became an Arab Caliphate Administrative District under the name of Jund Fililastin (جُند فِلَسْطِين), which means Palestine Military District. This military district was still inserted in Greater Syria, now called Bilad al-Sham (بِلادُ الشَّامِ), ie Land of the Levant.
With the Ottoman conquest in 1517, the situation does not change, Palestine continues to be part of Greater Syria, being the Palestinian toponym used to specify a certain part of the southern territory of Syria.
After the fall of the Ottoman Empire, the great Syria was divided between Lebanon, Jordan, Palestine and the Modern State of Syria. At first, Syria do Sul was divided between the Palestine Cisjordana and the transjordan Palestine, that is, the portions of territory below and beyond the Jordan River. The latter, the transjordan Palestine, would constitute transjordan, which was finally renamed Jordan. After Jordan's independence, the term Palestine was reserved for the extension of land under the British Protective of 1920-1946. It was this extension of territory that the United Nations wanted to divide between the Jews and the Arabs in 1948. It is this same territory, which, by the way, the ancient kingdoms of Israel and Judah have never fully occupied, that Israel is now trying to attach completely as Prime Minister of Israel, the criminal of war, Benjamin Netanyahu, has already stated Israel to create a state. Independent Palestinian, as Israel had committed himself in 1993, when he signed the Treaty of Oslo, in which he pledged to adopt the so-called Two-State Solution.
 
The people
At the Bronze Age, when Palestine was under influence or even under Egyptian rule, it was populated by different Canaanite tribes, such as Jebusites, inhabitants of Jebus, who would later be known as Jerusalem, the Hivites, who inhabited the zones of Shem and Gibeão, the Amorites, who inhabited the region of the transjordan, the region that dispersed through the region Palestinian central, the west and the northern girgachites in the North Zone, where it is still the millennial Lebanese city of Sidão, which was totally destroyed by the Israelites in 1982.
Beyond the Hittites, which inhabited the North, and the Egyptians, especially the South, were also the Philistines, a people of egene origin who inhabited the area of ​​Gaza, Ascalão, Asdode, Echrom and Gate, and who were great enemies of the Israelites.
At the Iron Age, the demographic configuration of Palestine had been modified. Apart from the Canaanian tribes, which now focused on the large urban centers of Hatzor, Megued and Lack, in the northernmost zone of Palestine where the North Kingdom, to which the Bible calls Israel, was scattered faster the Arameans, the Moabites, the Edomites, and the Ammonites who had their own states, which, according to the biblical narrative, were all incorporated. In the mythical empire of Solomon, the empire that never existed.
The Philistines, in turn, remained in their zone known as Philistine, pity, which as we have seen, will give rise to the term Palestinian.
It is at the Bronze Age that the so -called Israelites or Hebrews appear in the land of Canaan, as the Bible calls it, or Palestine, as we call it today. According to the biblical narrative, the Israelites were not indigenous in the region, but would have come from the south and won the so -called Promised Land. All archaeological proofs disregard this ethnogenic theory of the Hebrew people, suggesting, on the contrary, that the Israelites will also have had a Canaanite origin - composition defended by archaeologists and historians as important as Israel Finkelstein, William Duty, and Carol Meyers - even because his tongue is a canaaanite dialect of the Western Semitic. Thus, the Israelites did not enter Palestine between 1,400 and 1,200 BC. As traditionally stipulated, assumption based on biblical tradition, now largely demystified by archaeological findings and historical research independent of religion.
Moreover, the inhabitants of the southern kingdom, or Judah, as the Bible calls it, were neither ethnically, culturally nor religiously homogeneous, as the very same Bible describes them. The biblical concept that the Israelites were a monotheistic people since their origin is denied by the archaeological findings that show a number of domestic deities - the so -called Terafim - small clay figures found in the homes of the people and proving the existence of the domestic worship of local deities, as well as regional altars and sanctuaries of worship of deities such as El, Baal, and Anate.
As we had the opportunity to mention two weeks ago, the biblical history of the Unified Kingdom of Israel and the two Jewish kingdoms, Israel and Judah, is a late religious construct that served to galvanize the nationalist fervor of the Jews against the various colonizing forces of the region.
 
The expulsion of the Jewish from Palestine
The Jews left Palestine as a result of three great revolts that became known as the three Judeo-Roman wars.
The First Jewish-Roman War (66–73 AD), also known as the great revolt, was the most significant and devastating of the three. It began with Jerusalem's taking by nationalist Jews in the year 66, which led to the full destruction of the city by Emperor Tito, in the year 70. The great revolt would only end in 73, with the famous episode of the massade, in which the Jews closed in the Fortress with the same name, seeing that they could not escape their destiny, all all over their destiny.
The second revolt (115–17 AD) known as War of Kitos occurred outside Judea, in Jewish communities of the diaspora, Egypt, Babylon and, above all, in Cyprus, where Jews attacked the Roman populations. This second Jewish-Roman war is often forgotten because it was not in Palestinian territory, yet it was extremely bloody.
The third revolt is the most famous and the most consequences had for the Jewish populations of Palestine. This revolt became known as the Kokhba Bar Revolt (132–136) for being led by Simão Bar Kokhba, who presented himself as the Messiah who came to free Israel from the Roman yoke.
What motivated this rebellion was, first of all, the construction by order of Emperor Adriano of a temple dedicated to Jupiter Capitolino where before the temple of Jerusalem, in the new pagan city, Aelia Capitolina, which had replaced the ancient Jerusalem, destroyed in the year 70. In addition, many Jewish religious practices, such as circumcision, animal sacrifice, etc. has been prohibited by the Roman authorities.
The same Emperor Adriano crushed Simão Bar Kokhba's revolt and followed by the Jewish defeat, in addition to the half million Jews who calculate themselves died during the revolt, the Jews were banned from entering Jerusalem.
After this revolt, the province of Judea was restructured to avoid further revolts and became part of the province of Greater Syria, or Syria Maior, in Latin. The old Judea was integrated into a larger sub-province, called Syria Palastina, which also encompassed the transjordan region. Since then, as we have already seen this region of the middle of the middle-of-one has been known as Palestine.
The prohibition of entering Jerusalem led the religious elite to emigrate to other parts of the Mediterranean world and the Middle East, such as Egypt, Rome itself, or Babylon, where Jewish communities of the diaspora were concentrated. The religion of the second temple, the religion that Jesus practiced, ceased to exist and gave way to rabbinic Judaism, especially from around 200, when the Rabbi Judah ha-nasi put the oral traditions of the second temple in the so-called Misena, which would become a central part of the Talmud. This led to a radical transformation of the Jewish religion that was no longer centered on the temple to be centered on written tradition and as such, this new religion could be practiced anywhere in the world.
However, not the entire population of Judea emigrated, not the entire Judea population was banned from Jerusalem or persecuted by the Romans. Much of the population continued to live in Judea, now renamed Palestinian, who had never been exclusive to the Jews. In addition to the Jews were Christians, Hellenized, Samaritans, people cultivating other religions of the surrounding areas, and in rural areas where the religion centered on Yahweh's worship, promoted by Hezekiah or Josiah, was not so successful, cluster of ancient native polytheism continued to exist. There were also the Romans themselves who had created roots in Palestine. Now, the current Palestinians are the descendants of these people who have never abandoned the territory of Palestine. Many, by the way, will indeed be the heirs of the Canaanian tribes, the Philistines and other peoples who have lived in the region since the Bronze Age. These people came to merge into what today we call the Palestinian people, the same people that the Jews found in Palestine when they, taken by Zionism, decided to immigrate to the region.
This cluster of culturally and ethnically diverse people who populated the territory of Palestine then, over time, was uniform and constituting a more or less homogeneous people, first under Roman rule. Over time, much of this population was adopted the new religion of the Empire, Christianity, which in 380, through the edict of Thessalonica becomes the official religion of the Empire.
Of course, not all the inhabitants of Palestine became Christians, many followed with their religions, including Judaism, which was then already minority in Palestine.
With the arrival of Islam the people who inhabited Palestine then had to convert to Islam or leave the territory. Still there were Christians, and even some Jews, because being people of the book, these communities enjoyed some protection from the authorities, although their daily lives were extremely difficult among the Moors people.
The truth of these facts is proven with DNA studies from local populations that, unlike Jews, which mostly have a Slavous or German DNA, the Palestinians, for the most part, are 100% Semitic.
 
The injustice
The Gaza Strip has an area of ​​approximately 365 km2, the equivalent of the Lisbon area and part of its suburban zone. In this small territorial range live 2,300,000 people, which makes Gaza one of the most population density zones on the planet.
Since the beginning of the Israeli offensive, according to the United Nations Secretariat for Humanitarian Affairs Coordination, 92% of housing buildings were destroyed, 80% of commercial buildings, 96% of school buildings - in the north of Gaza this number reaches 100% - and 81% of the entire road communication system. In the Gaza range there were eleven higher education institutions, they were all destroyed, even when they had been completely abandoned.
According to the United Nations and the World Health Organization, since May 2025, 94% of Gaza's hospitals and health centers were destroyed. Of the 36 hospitals that existed in Gaza, only 19 are still able to provide some more basic emergency services, but even those far below the minimum standards.
According to the Palestinian authorities, namely the Ministry of Health of Gaza, on July 9, the day this article began to be written, the number of deadly victims in Gaza is approximately 57,523. Independent international institutions consider this estimate incorrect, given the degraded state of Gaza Administrative Institutions, and point to a number of victims in the 84,000 region, which includes both deaths from direct attack by the Israeli military, and people who starved or lack of medical care.
Of these 84,000 deaths, it is estimated that 56.2%, or approximately 47,208 people killed by direct attack by the Jewish military forces are women, many of which pregnant, children and people; Of these, it is believed, that about 18,000 are from pre-adolescence children. There are no specific data on people with disabilities, but international agencies draw attention to the fact that, given their state of vulnerability, these are the most devoid of mobility and survival means.
In addition to all the others, at this time the Palestinians of Gaza see themselves in their arms with total fuel supply for more than four months, extreme restrictions on external humanitarian aid, collapse of victim distribution systems, and constant attacks on humanitarian aid fields and those who dare to address them. There is no electricity in Gaza because it is produced by fuel, and the little that exists, reserves to generate electricity for the most urgent cases, such as operations, in the few health centers that still work. As the success rate of these medical treatments would be expected to be very low despite the efforts of medical staff, much of it made up of foreign volunteers who put their lives at risk every day to try to save the lives of Palestinians. In fact, several foreigners have died in Israeli attacks, yet many refuse to leave the territory despite direct harassment from Israeli authorities who do not want foreign witnesses to the Jews' bloodthirsty over Palestinians.
It is estimated that more than a third of the population of Gaza suffers from malnutrition; More than 93% of Palestinian children are at serious risk of hunger and about 71,000 already suffer from severe malnutrition, including 14,000 babies are at risk of death in the next 48 hours of the day when this article is being written, according to the United Nations whose agents have to work in Gaza clandestinely as the Israeli government has prohibited their action in Palestine on the accusation that these are agents of these agents Hamas.
There is also the issue of missing people who are not accounted for because of the constant movement of the Palestinians who are obliged by the Israelite authorities to go south or north of the track. It is not known how many dead will be found under the destroyed buildings.
So far the Israelites have killed 322 agents of humanitarian institutions, this includes 233 from United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East), 33 Red Cross volunteers (which in Palestine is called Red Crescent) and 52 workers from various NGOs. All those who are killed by collateral fire - are accused of being Hamas collaborators or supporters.
It is not that Jews are very concerned about the image that all this projects in the world, since after all that we watched live on television and the internet, nothing happened to Israel, no retaliation, no embargo. Israel continues to receive weapons from the United States and international support. The other day, the president of the European Commission, Merkel-Indigited, Ursula Von Der Leyen, refused to suspend the cooperation agreement between Europe and Israel despite, she says, that there is evidence of violation of human rights in Gaza. Evidence?!?!
It is also not for fear that it is known what happens in Gaza that journalists are one of the favorite targets of the Israelites, but even though at least 185 journalists have died, including two Israelite journalists, 113 were seriously injured and two are still missing. At least 17 journalists and two cameramen were slaughtered directly by Israeli military forces in what the committee for the protection of journalists considered cold -blooded murders.
But as if all this was not enough, behold, but when the Israelites and their American compunks thought of a new way of making the slaughter even more efficient.
United Nations Humanitarian Bodies and the various NGOs working in Gaza were expelled and prohibited from operating on the accusation of being Hamas agents and now the only organism responsible for the distribution of humanitarian aid is the Humanitarian Foundation Gaza, or here, the Humanitarian Foundation of Gaza, an organization directed by Israel and the United States - how to make a fox to take over the chicken coop! This “Foundation” directs a series of Secure Distribution Sites ie safe distribution posts if it wasn't so tragic, you could laugh! It turns out that the Palestinians who move to these safe distribution posts often lead with shots on top. Peculiar security, this one! By June 2025, a month ago, 583 Palestinians had already been shot dead while waiting in the line of these food distribution centers. In addition to these dead, there are 4,186 injured people, some of bullets. Now the Humanitarian Foundation Gaza was only established in February 2025 and their Secure Distribution Sites, these safe distribution posts, only began operating in May 2025, ie these numbers refer to only two months of operations. Do you need to say more?
In the form of completion, I leave here a little reflection. Palestinians are the descendants of the peoples who since time immemorial inhabit that portion of land that we today call Palestine. Many forget, but a percentage of these Palestinians is Christian, and are living in the same land since the time of the Romans.
The people of ancient Palestine were polytheistic, others were pagans, some Jews, etc. The Romans and the Byzantines came, and these, for the most part, had to become Christians. Then came the Arabs, and they had to make themselves Muslims. Always the same people, but adopting different identities so that they can continue in the land of their ancestors.
I would like to remember here for those who believe, which is a truth of the Christian faith, that even Protestants believe that Jesus was true God and true man, dogmatic truth proclaimed in the Chalcedon Council (451). Now the flesh, the humanity of Jesus, he obtained her from his mother, Mary, and only her. Now Mary was also a Palestinian woman, just like so many that we see the children killed by the Jews. Perhaps it is because that poor people shared the same race of Jesus who also have, after two thousand years, to suffer in the hands of the same executioners.</description><pubDate>2025-07-11 01:36:21</pubDate></item><item><title>Hotel occupation can reach 90% on summer holidays</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/07/11/ocupacao-hoteleira-podera-atingir-os-90-nas-ferias-de-verao/</link><description>Cheung Kin Chung, president of the Macao Hotelers Association, foresees the hotel occupation to grow along summer holidays, with a global rate of 85%, and up to 90% on certain days. Also deputy highlighted, however, future challenges in the local tourism sector due to the economic impact and competition from neighboring regions.
 
The tourism industry points to a growth in the number of tourists and hotel guests in Macao during the summer holidays. The president of the Macao Hotelers Association, Cheung Kin Chung, estimates that the hotel occupancy rate for summer exceeds 85%, and in a few days could reach 90%.
"With the increase in visitors arrivals, and a favorable situation of supply and search hotel, it is expected that the total number of tourists will increase compared to the same period last year, with the month of August the highest time," he noted.
Cheung Kin Chung, in statements to Radio Macau in Chinese language, said that there was a “globally positive” recovery in the tourism market in the first half of this year, and growth is expected to extend in the second half of the year, and the industry is maintaining optimistic predictions.
It is recalled that Helena de Senna Fernandes, director of tourism services, expressed a “conservative and optimistic attitude” about travel reserves to Macau during summer holidays, as they can be affected by meteorological conditions such as typhoons.
According to data from the Directorate of Statistics and Census Services (DSEC), in July last year the occupancy rate in hotel establishments was 88.4% and in August rose to 91.3%. Macau received, between July 1 and August 31 last year, a total of 6.68 million visitors, an average of 108 thousand per day, which corresponded to a recovery of 93.4% of the same period of 2019.
Cheung Kin Chung also cited the most up -to -date statistics of DSEC for May this year, stressing that the average occupancy rate of guest rooms was 87.8%, plus 4.5 percentage points for the same time last year.
Official data revealed a 5 -star hotel occupancy rate (91.4%), 4 -star hotels (80.7%) and 3 -star hotels (84.2%) increased 6.5; 1 and 3.4 percentage points, respectively. Already the number of guests increased, in annual terms, 2.7%, to 1.2 million people, and the average period of permanence of guests remained at 1.7 nights. At the end of May of the year there were 147 hotel establishments that provided public accommodation services, providing a total of 45,000 guest rooms.
In this way, Cheung Kin Chung considers that Macau's tourist market has kept a strong demand. "The occupancy rate remains high, the average prices of the reasonable rooms and the stay of visitors has increased constantly, reflecting the growing attractiveness of Macao as an international tourist destination," said the board member for tourism development.
 
Greater competition
 
Also deputy to the Legislative Assembly also drew attention to the “increasing” challenges of the territory in the domain of local tourism, despite the improved performance recorded so far. "The impact of the external economic conjuncture, the alteration of visitors' consumption patterns and the intensification of competition from neighboring regions, all placed plus macao challenges," Cheung Kin Chung admitted, recognizing that the industry is necessary to continue to raise its quality of service and to explore new sources of visitors.
Cheung Kin Chung indicated that during the summer holidays, the sector will focus on the development of cultural tourism products, such as families' excursions and study visits.
Regarding tasks planned for the second half of the year, the official said the industry will try to expand the supply of tourist products and further enhance regional cooperation, as well as improve infrastructure for tourist purposes and increase international visits.</description><pubDate>2025-07-11 01:35:25</pubDate></item><item><title>Daily traffic on the Macau Bridge increased 24% until April</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/07/11/trafego-diario-na-ponte-macau-aumentou-24-ate-abril/</link><description>Services for Traffic Affairs (DSAT) ensure that the Macau Bridge has fulfilled its function of diverting road traffic in the immediate vicinity, citing an increase of about 24% in the average daily traffic volume between October and April. The data are contained in a response document to a written interpellation of José Pereira Coutinho, in which the deputy pointed to flaws in the "functionality" of the bridge.
 
The Macao Bridge's average daily traffic volume increased by about 24% between the opening period and last April, confirming a growing trend of use. The information was released by the Director of Services for Traffic Affairs (DSAT), Lam Hin San, in response to a written interpellation of José Pereira Coutinho.
The deputy's interpellation, divided into three points, began to emphasize that the bridges, in addition to "safe, durable, elegant and aesthetically pleasant, should be, above all, functional." The lack of cycle paths or pedestrian corridors on the Macau Bridge and the deficient coordination with the public transport network reveals, according to Coutinho, that the integration of the bridge into the region's infrastructure network “was not completely optimized”.
In addition to these embarrassment, car and motorcycle drivers also prevent the use of the bridge due to delay in travel and the controlled speed limit of 60 km/h, below the top speed of 80 km/h in the friendship bridges and Sa Van.
Given this issue, the DSAT director opposes that “the Macao Bridge has been progressively playing a traffic deviation role in adjacent areas”, revealing a growing trend of use since October 2024, the inauguration month. According to the data cited in the response document, the average daily traffic volume in the second half of October - that is, in the opening period of opening - was approximately 20,000 UVL (equivalent light vehicle units, or 'walknger car units'). Six months later, in April, this number rose to about 24,800 UVL, which translates into a 24%increase.
In addition to increasing cars flow, Lam Hin San ensures that "Shuttle" buses that connect between the siege doors and the Cotai zone have increasingly opted for this way. "With the orderly conclusion of the works in Zone A and the respective access roads, as well as with the growing familiarization of drivers with the surrounding road network and access to the bridge, it is expected that the flow of traffic will continue to evolve."
The second point of Coutinho's interpellation was the deficit coordination between the bridge and the various transport options available. The deputy specifically cites the slight meter, whose connection with the Macao bridge would allow an interconnection between colona, ​​mud and macau, as well as facilitating access to the large bay.
After consulting the opinion of the Directorate of Public Works (DSOP), DSAT clarifies that “the Government of the MSAR has opted for a project that foresees differentiated and appropriate traces and structures” for the Macao Bridge and the eastern line of the light meter. In addition to planning the bridge to privilege access to new urban landfills, its long and steep layout-with a longitudinal inclination of 4%-proves to be deceived for the construction of vehicles intended for vehicles without motor.
As for the need to build bike lanes on site, inserted in the government's “healthy mobility” objectives, DSAT only responds that by 2030, “cycle paths linked to coastal landscapes and new parks and gardens” will be created, without specifically referring to the bridge.
At the last point of the government's interpellation, José Pereira Coutinho questioned the planned measures to encourage the use of the bridge, in order to divert road traffic to this new circulation route. He also questioned the plans to adopt to ensure safer and more efficient circulation on the bridge Van, suggesting the permanent opening of the lower board.
In response to this last topic, DSAT recalls that exclusive corridors were created for motorcycles on Macao and Sai Van bridges, "in order to ensure driver safety and allow the public to choose routes according to their travel needs." Regarding the regular circulation of vehicles on the southern board of Ponte de Sai Van, the body explains that this possibility would imply “significant works of improvement” that are not currently in DSOP's plans.</description><pubDate>2025-07-11 01:39:20</pubDate></item><item><title>Retroactive social support that have been increased are paid this month</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/07/11/retroactivos-dos-apoios-sociais-que-foram-aumentados-sao-pagos-este-mes/</link><description>The government has increased this year the amounts of various social support. The difference in the amounts related to the installments from January to June this year will be paid this month, the Social Security Fund (FSS) said.
After the increase, the maximum amount of the pension to the elderly and the disability pension goes from 3,740 patacas to 3,900 patacas per month, the unemployment allowed to 157 patacas per day, the disease allowance with hospital hospitalization to 157 patacas per day, the sickness of disease without hospitalization increases to 119 patacas per day, the 6.500 allowance to 6,500.

This article compares and contrasts two layers of liability in Macau and Hong Kong: one at the level of the main responsible and one in the level of the high civil servants.
On July 3, the Macao government began a remodeling of leadership in some departments. The Public Administration and Public Service (SAFP) attended the inauguration ceremony of a new director, Leong Weng, and a deputy director, Chan Sok Cheng. Both are public career employees, with the first occupied the position of director of the Board of Legal Services (DSAJ) since May 2023 and the second assumed the position of SAFP Interim Assistant Director since February 2025.
However, another inauguration ceremony was held on July 2, when Che Weng Keong and U U Sang were president of the Institute for Commerce and Investment Promotion (IPIM) and Director of the Fund for Scientific and Technological Development (FDCT), respectively.
At the same time, Ines Chan Lou seemed to leave the position of head of the Government Information Office (GCS) after six years of service. However, according to government information, Chan was renamed for another term as a member of the Local broadcaster council TDM, and his mandate will last until August 31, 2026.
Perhaps a note worthy of note was the expectation, according to Macau Daily News, that Lam in San, head of the Department of Transport (DSAT), leave office after ten years of work, but he can be transferred to Macauport, given his previous experience in the Civil Aviation Department (The Macao News, July 3, 2025).
Macao media recently released an audit committee report, which criticized the transportation department for its failure to manage citizens' calls and demands for radio taxi services and their inability to solve the lack of taxi in Macao (The Macao News, July 3, 2025).
Overall, the remodeling of high civil servants in Macao seems to show that (1) their rotation is increasingly prominent, that (2) such a measure aims to improve government capacity and that (3) the internal responsibility of high civil servants is increasingly significant externally, especially in response to the conclusions of the internal audit report on whether they can effectively provide public services.
After all, the rotation of the positions of high civil servants has been described as a normal phenomenon to deal with their performance, making them much more comprehensive in terms of specialized knowledge, much deeper in terms of knowledge and more experienced in treating different folders (San WA Jornal, July 5, 2025).
In early July 2025, the Legislative Assembly of Macao discussed how to amend Law No. 15/2009, namely 'the basic provisions and rules of the leading and principal personnel' in the civil service. Changes aim to update the legislation in accordance with the requirements of the National Security Law. They include the need for senior civil servants to swear loyalty to the Rae de Macao Basic Law and the Rae of Macao of the Popular Republic of China. In addition, the leading and main staff, which refer to senior civil servants, will have to assume official positions in interim until the timely and appropriate time comes to be formally appointed to assume these positions. The most interesting change proposal to Law No. 15/2009 is that if members of the leadership team do not comply with the higher directives, if they do not reach the required objectives and to harm the image of the department in question and undermine the government's authority, their appointment may be and will be terminated by the supervisor authority.
In addition, if members of the leadership team violate the discipline, the supervision office legal staff will conduct investigations, after which investigation reports will be delivered to the supervisory authority for their final decision (see Permanent Commission No. 2 of the Legislative Assembly, document of opinion No. 3/VII/2025, in al.gov.mo/uploads/attachment/2025-06/626836862534fade8e.pdf, access date: July 5, 2025).
Coincidentally, Hong Kong's media reported that executive head John Lee has considered the question of how to introduce “a liability system for high civil servants” (hk01.com, July 3, 2025). It was reported that after Ombudsman revealed the lack of investigation by the Department of Buildings on 58 industrial accidents in ten years, Mr. Lee was dissatisfied with the inadequacy of the liable system for high employees (hk01.com, July 3, 2025). Specifically, Lee was described as dissatisfied with 'organizational culture' and 'inadequate efforts of governance' (hk01.com, July 3, 2025).
By mid-June, Chief Executive John Lee had already commented that the 'liable system for high civil servants' would be integrated into the' main employees' liability system '(POAS), introduced in July 2002. At that time, the first executive head, Tung Chee-Hwa, was committed to developing his own group of employees named, explaining and promoting government policies. POAS focuses on the accountability of the appointed and politically appointed employees, who were appointed by the Chief Executive and then approved and appointed by the Central Government in Beijing.
In the history of POAS, some Rae ministers of Hong Kong have apologized and even resigned after being criticized for making mistakes. A controversial case was the former financial secretary Anthony Leung, who resigned in July 2003 after being criticized for “avoiding” a tax on his new vehicle. A recent case involved Mr. Casper Tsui, former Secretary of Internal Affairs, who resigned after participating in a birthday party of a China National People's Congress delegate-an action that was suspected of “violating” Covid-19 social distance rules at the end of January 2022 (Hong Kong Free Press, February 1, 2022).
After the Hong Kong and Macao (HKMAO) affairs, under the direction of Xia Baolong, took a much more active role in Hong Kong and Macau governance than ever, including inspection visits to Hong Kong and Macau and meetings in Beijing with visiting authorities from both cities, two Hong Kong secretaries were dismissed in December 2024, to know, Former Secretary of Culture, Sport and Tourism Kevin Yeung and former Lam Sa-Hung Transport and Logistics Secretary. At the time, it was speculated that the performance of both employees could have been much better. However, the dedicated services of Yeung and Lam were recently recognized by the Hong Kong government, as both received the title of peace judges on the July 1, 2025 honors.
According to information, the Hong Kong government is studying the proposed content of the 'liability system for high civil servants', reinforcing its leadership and governance, clarifying its duties and responsibilities and considering a penalty mechanism that includes the suspension of salary increase. The conclusions of the provider's reports and the audit committee will probably play a crucial role in evaluating the performance of the high civil servants.
If so, there are several similarities and differences between the two layers of the Hong Kong and Macau liability system: one at the level of the main employees and one at the level of the high employees.
At the level of the main responsible, Hong Kong has much more responsible than Macao, including not only the main responsible but also Under -Secretaries and Political Assistants. Macau has only nine main employees (Secretary for Administration and Justice; Secretary for Economics and Finance, Secretary for Security; Secretary for Social Affairs and Culture; Secretary for Transport and Public Works, Commission against Corruption, Audit Commissioner, Commissioner General of the Unit Police Service, Director-General of Macau Customs Service) and a Macao Attorney General, November 30, 2024). Macao does not really have the layer of undersecretaries and political assistants, unlike Hong Kong, where there are 21 main employees appointed under the liability system. Without a larger group of politically appointed employees, the high civil servants in Macao seem to face more pressure to perform well in their government folders than their Hong Kong counterparts.
Secondly, while the Hong Kong Poas System has resigned from some ministers since July 1, 1997, Macau has not had any such incidents since December 20, 1999. But Macau witnessed the arrest of former Man Long Secretary of Transport and Public Works on suspicion of corruption in December 2006. Former Secretary of Transport and Public Works to Man Long, today (June 4) convicted by the High School of First Instance (CCAC.org.MO)]. Thus, although the sanctions applied to ministers who did not fulfill their duties were apparently different in the cases of Hong Kong and Macau, they were responsible not only externally before the citizens, but also internally before their superiors.
Thirdly, the recent trend of reinforcing the internal and external liability of the highest employees in Macau and Hong Kong indicated that under the new political systems of both cities, the high employees are expected to demonstrate their high performance patterns and be liable to their superiors. In both Hong Kong and Macao, the provider's reports (in Macao, the provider's work is integrated into the Anti -Corruption Agency) and the audit commission and their conclusions are, and will be increasingly important from the political point of view to reinforce the external and internal responsibility of the high civil servants.
In conclusion, it is an interesting coincidence that both Macau and Hong Kong have witnessed a tendency to reinforce the internal and external liability of the high civil servants. Although both cities have already established a group of high -appointed high -level employees at the highest level, the emphasis on the good and effective governance of both Macao and Hong Kong requires a corresponding increase in the internal and external liability of the high civil servants. Internally, high civil servants must be more responsible before their higher authorities, including major politically appointed employees for their performance. Externally, high civil servants have to perform well to ensure effective service to public members. The crucial connection that reinforces its external and internal liability is the work and the role of the audit and justice provider committee (or the corruption committee in Macao, since it combines double functions to combat corruption and publicity treatment), whose reports and conclusions are intended to have increasing political and administrative importance in the policy of external and internal liability, in both Hong Kong, where Two layers of accountability of the main politically appointed employees and the high civil servants are now increasingly interconnected and integrated.</description><pubDate>2025-07-11 01:36:20</pubDate></item><item><title>Open public tender to appoint a new milestone in the village of Taipa</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/07/11/aberto-concurso-publico-para-nomear-novo-marco-na-vila-da-taipa/</link><description>Taipa village receives a new architectural framework that aims to honor its market soul from the past, now inviting the city to baptize it. The two companies ahead of the initiative launched yesterday a public tender to name the project that mixes the Portuguese inheritance with touches of modernity, offering 10,000 patacas to the winner. This initiative, according to the organizers, symbolizes the transformation of the neighborhood into a vibrant cultural hub, far from the casinos, but deeply linked to the macanese identity.
 
Taipa Village Destination Limited, in partnership with Sniper Capital Limited, launched a public tender yesterday to baptize its latest development project in Vila da Taipa. With a 10,000 patacas prize for the winner, the initiative aims to involve the community in creating a “memorable and positive” name, which reflects the historical, architectural and cultural identity of this new milestone, whose construction is expected to finish later this year. The ideal name should be “timeless and aligned with the architectural style of the place”, ensuring long -term relevance.
The venture, which occupies about 2,800 square meters and includes a 50-meter façade on Travessa dos Mercadores, is part of a broader strategy of turning Taipa village into a distinct tourist hub, outside the dependence of casinos. Inspired by an old warehouse that once occupied the place, the five -story building combines elements of early twentieth -century Portuguese architecture with modern spaces for restoration and commerce, including large outdoor terraces. The design was designed by a team of architects that unites the two special administrative regions, headed by Daniel Lin, from Hong Kong, and Mimi Cheung, from Macao. It also recreates the historical structures that characterized the zone and its connection to the mercantile past of the mud.
This project is the latest in a series of Sniper Capital investments in the neighborhood, including five other developments announced in 2024, totaling 4,500 square meters of new commercial spaces. At the time, the company highlighted the objective of making the village of Taipa in a destination of leisure and culture, attracting tourists beyond the traditional Cotai circuit. The current “Name Macau’s Next Landmark” contest is published on the Taipa Village Macau official page and is open to participants from Macau and Hong Kong until August 15, 2025, accepting proposals in English, Chinese or bilingual versions, with the ability to include numbers. Each participant is entitled to appoint only one title to the project.
A panel of five independent juries will evaluate the applications based on originality, creativity and impact, being the winner announced on August 29 on social networks and the company's official page. Pamela Chan, Director-General of Taipa Village Destination, stressed that the initiative aims to “actively involve the community in the development of the neighborhood and strengthen its connection to this culturally vibrant fate and rich in heritage.”
With a growing offer of art, gastronomy and commerce, Vila da Taipa has been affirming itself as an alternative to tourists through recent developments. With a daily average of 50,000 visitors at festive seasons, the bet of Sniper Capital and Taipa Village Destination in heritage preservation, coupled with modern concepts, positions the neighborhood as one of the most dynamic destinations today, in line with the strategy of “Macao, creative city of UNESCO gastronomy” to diversify its tourist economy. The new projects, including this emblematic building in Travessa dos Mercadores, should be completed by the end of 2025.</description><pubDate>2025-07-11 01:36:18</pubDate></item><item><title>China and Asean prepare a new version of the free trade agreement by the end of the year</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/07/11/china-e-asean-preparam-nova-versao-do-acordo-de-livre-comercio-ate-final-do-ano/</link><description>Southeast Asian foreign ministers yesterday expressed, in Kuala Lumpur, the intention to reinforce economic cooperation with China and modernize the Beijing Free Trade Agreement, signed in 2010.
 
The bilateral meeting between the heads of diplomacy of the countries of the Southeast Asia Nations Association (Asean) and Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi took place on the sidelines of the Asean Regional Forum, which also has the presence of US Secretary of State Marco Rubio.
"Through the updating of this agreement, Asean and China will strengthen their economic cooperation and resilience during this difficult period and in the future," Malaysian Foreign Minister Mohamad Hasan said before the meeting with Wang Yi, marked by the context of the Commercial War with the United States. The new version of the treaty, known as “version 3.0”, should be completed by the end of the year.
The head of Malaysia Diplomacy, a country that holds this year's rotating presidency of Asean, also stressed that the regional bloc should “remain vigilant before threats to an open, fair and rules-based commercial system”, in an indirect allusion to the rates imposed by Washington.
China and United States diplomacy heads, Wang Yi and Marco Rubio, gathered yesterday in Kuala Lumpur with southeastern Asian counterparts in the middle of the trade war began by Washington. The meeting with the Chinese minister opened the meeting yesterday among the heads of diplomacy of the member countries of the Association of Southeast Asia (Asean) and the main partners, which runs until this Friday.
China, the main commercial partner of Southeast Asian countries, seeks to maintain influence in this exporting region, threatened by fees announced on Monday by US President Donald Trump, which for some Southeast Asian countries are higher than those set in April.
In April, Chinese President Xi Jinping conducted a tour of several countries in the region, including Malaysia - a country that hosts Asean's rotary presidency - to strengthen relations with Southeast Asia during which he signed dozens of commercial agreements.
Rubio, who holds the first trip to Asia in Malaysia since he took office in January, has maintained a meeting with Asean diplomacy heads, as well as representatives of countries such as Japan, South Korea, Canada and India. The US diplomat gathered on the sidelines of the meeting with Russian homologous, Sergey Lavrov, said Washington, at a time when the United States prepares to send more weapons to help Ukraine defend themselves from increasing Russia's air attacks.
Conversations, seconds this year, appear at a time when the United States has criticized the lack of progress in peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine.
It is expected that during the summit will emerge statements about the United States tariffs, with most economies in the region, including Indonesia and Thailand, still in negotiations with the US until the new period of 1 August.
The United States announced 32% rates for Indonesia and 36% for Thailand, the same rate applied to Cambodia. Myanmar and Laos received 40%.
On Wednesday, Washington announced 20% increases for the Philippines (compared to 17% previously announced) and 25% for Brunei (compared to the previous 24%). To date, Vietnam is the only country in the region that has been able to reach a deal with Washington to reduce 46% rates announced in April to 20%.
Other important topics at the meeting are the aggravated conflict in Myanmar after the 2021 coup d'état and tensions in the Southern Sea of ​​China, where Beijing disputes territories with various Asean countries.
Today it will be the turn of the multilateral session, with the East Asia Forum and the Asean Regional Forum, where Rubio, Wang, Lavrov and European diplomacy head Kaja Kallas will be.

The Han Kuang exercises, with royal fire, will take place for ten days - the longest edition to date - and include the use of new recently acquired armaments, from tanks to aquatic 'drones', in a context of growing tension in relation to Beijing and the Popular Liberation Army (ELP).
According to the Taipe Ministry of Defense, the exercises began with simulations of response to ships of the coastal guard and maritime militias. One of the scenarios in training is a possible attack disguised as sea harassment, including the fortification of ports and landing points in islands about 160 kilometers from the Chinese coast. The second phase of the exercises will be centered on antidebar maneuvers, with the participation of regular forces from all branches of the Armed Forces, supported by 22,000 reservists.
The Ministry of Defense stressed that training will take place 24 hours a day, under realistic conditions, aiming to counteract previous criticism that maneuvers would be more performative than operational.
The equipment used include the ABRASS M1A2T tanks and Himars rocket systems, provided by the United States, Taiwan's main defense partner, despite the absence of official diplomatic ties, by Beijing pressure. Authorities appealed to understanding the population for any disturbances in air or road traffic and warned of the circulation of misinformation on the exercises.
Beijing reacted hardly on the maneuvering announcement. "The Han Kuang exercise is just a misleading staging of the Progressive Democratic Party authorities [in power in Taipé], who try to drag the Taiwanese people to the path of separatism and harm Taiwan for a party's selfish interests," Chinese Ministry spokesman Colonel Jiang Bing said. Jiang has assured that "regardless of the performance or weapons used, [the Taiwanese military] will not be able to resist the ELP anti-independence sword and the historical tendency of the inevitable reunification of the homeland."
According to Taipei, Beijing will have even tried to disturb preparations for the exercises, with Chinese aircraft and ships to perform on Tuesday "harassment operations in the air and sea domains" under the pretext of a "jointly combat readiness." Taiwan's Armed Forces responded with “joint measures for recognition, surveillance and response,” including the mobilization of land -based missile aircraft, ships and missile systems.
However, China announced on Wednesday export controls on eight companies linked to the Taiwan defense industry, including groups Aerospace Industrial Development Corporation, Jingwei Aerospace Technology Co. and CSBC Corporation, the island's largest naval shipyard. According to the Chinese Ministry of Commerce, the new measure prohibits exports to these double -use products companies - with civil and military application.</description><pubDate>2025-07-11 01:36:23</pubDate></item><item><title>"We can not lose the notion of what we are here to do, which is to help people"</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/07/11/nao-podemos-perder-a-nocao-daquilo-que-estamos-aqui-a-fazer-que-e-ajudar-as-pessoas/</link><description>The Macao (ArtM) toxicodependent rehabilitation association has now been 25 years. Since then, I've received more than a thousand people in their therapeutic community. Augusto Nogueira, president of the Association, made a very positive balance of the work developed in the context of prevention and rehabilitation. In an interview with the final point, he again argued that consumers should not go to prison.

The Macao (ArtM) toxicodependent rehabilitation association celebrates 25 years. Augusto Nogueira recalled, in an interview with the final point, the foundation of the Association and made a positive balance of the work carried out since then. Over the past 25 years, the ArtM therapeutic community has supported more than a thousand people and the president of the ArtM said that, from now on, the goal is to maintain the quality of services. About the current situation in Macao, Augusto Nogueira argued that the prevention work must continue, although drug use in the region is stable. In the interview, the official argued that consumers should not go to prison.
 
The artm is now 25 years old. How do you remember the foundation of the association?
Before there was the artm, there was - East. My colleagues came here in 1993 to found the Association Ser - East, which in Portugal was the Association Ser. Then there was also a foundation in Hong Kong. When the transition, both in Hong Kong and Macao, was stamped, there was a stampede of my colleagues, who decided to return to Portugal. I also remember that we have this doubt, to stay or go, because, by the time, we had received no support from the Portuguese government or the prevention and treatment office, which existed at that time. There were many doubts and uncertainties. I was not yet responsible, but we decided to have a meeting with the Social Action Institute to try to know what the idea they had for us. We showed our availability to stay in Macau, but it all depended on what they had in mind to us, and the approach was very positive, because they told us that they had our work, but there was a problem that was the lack of subsidy at the time. We were soon guaranteed that we would make a cooperation agreement with the Institute of Social Action and receive a monthly subsidy so that we could continue to develop our work. At the time, the subsidy was below our expectations. There were 32,000 monthly patacas and only our income was 15 thousand and we had some ordinated to pay. There was no room for much. It was a very complicated year, because, besides, we were told that we could not raise the door to door funds. It was complicated and put our permanence into question, because we couldn't survive.
 
And then, how did they get to overcome this situation?
We had a conversation and said that either supported us differently, or we had to close doors. Immediately we were assured an increase, not very significant, which still gave us hope, with the promise that the following year would be improved. The following year things have improved sufficiently, also with the support of BNU and the Oriente Foundation, which allowed us to ensure continuity until a new IAS allowance came. From there, there was also the perception that we were here to continue. We just wanted to continue our work. We had no intentions to return. We were fulfilling our word. We wanted to stay and there is the result of having stayed here.
 
Do you do, then, a positive balance of artm work in these 25 years?
The balance is very positive. We had a very small space, with few conditions, we were adapting according to the needs and damage. IAS support has been amazing all these years that helped us not only to develop our spaces here in Macao, but also international. We have two departments in the black sand, the Department of Syringe Distribution and Collection, the 'Aftercare', where we follow the people who leave the prison and go out of the center, as well as people with alcoholism problems. We also have the Be Cool Project, where we do all the preventive work in schools, in communities. We were also given confidence to manage coffee and gallery. At the international level, the balance is quite positive. But the most positive of all, it's not just the structures we can develop, but all the people we can recover from toxicodependence and this is the most important for us and is what gives us the most satisfaction.
 
Apart from these, what were the biggest achievements of the artm?
I can not be here to individualize one or the other, I think they are all great achievements, but it was important to recognize our work through, for example, the medals of the Portuguese government and the Macao government, which were assigned to us. Also the change to these facilities was another achievement. It is all a proof of trust of our work at therapeutic level. We are nowadays in the direction of Vienna Ngo on Drugs is another achievement because it allows us to show the work that has been done in Macau. All achievements are great achievements.
 
On the contrary, what challenges have the association found?
The big challenge is to feel that we are doing a good job. Feeling that there is a hope in the person's recovery and that when he leaves, he is well referred to not fall. I think this is our main challenge. All other little challenges are everyday things.
 
What is the biggest difficulty in the operation of the Association in everyday life?
Nowadays we have a good support from IAS, we also have the support of the private sector that guarantees us that we can do everything we intend to do. Last year we wanted to make a conference and we were able to do it. We cannot say that we have difficulties, we have excellent support from the Institute of Social Action, which has been the great driver of our development.
 
Throughout these 25 years, how many people have been helped by the artm?
We received 1,008 people here in the therapeutic community. At the level of harm reduction, some of these people are sent here. Since we opened the Syringe Distribution Department, 400,000 syringes have been returned to us. About 60% of people who enter the community are referenced by our department reduction department, our department of distribution and syringes delivery. This shows the importance that harm reduction programs and syringe distribution programs have as a source of motivation to help people make a decision to seek treatment. When there is a more direct contact between our work team and the people who consume, the possibility of this person looking for help is much faster.
 
Does artm have any concrete objective for the future?
We also have to open other alcohol support facilities and toxicodependent community. I don't know when it will be, for the year or in two years. It will be a space for service to the public, is being treated.
 
Where is this space?
I can't say yet, but there is this possibility. Moreover, we want to maintain, firmly, the quality of our services, so that people when they come here can find affection, love and attention from the whole team. We also want to continue to work internationally, for us it is also important. At this moment there is a great divergence of perspectives on harm reduction, prevention and treatment, and we think that all these perspectives have to be worked together, all have their importance in a certain time. These disagreements make us feel that if you are wasting a lot of time with struggles that have no sense of being and those who are harmed are the people who really need help. On July 22 we will have a webinar organized by us where we invite people from various perspectives where we will discuss this common goal, which is how we can all be united by the same goal. It will be quite difficult, but it is something that gives us pleasure, having this dialogue and this online discussion to understand that we cannot lose the notion of what we are here to do, that is helping people.
 
The latest IAS data say that last year there were almost 25% of records in the central toxicodependent registration system compared to 2023. How is this increase explained?
These numbers do not portray reality, it was just a group of people who were caught consuming and, when they are caught consuming, the registration is done in the central record, but that does not mean that consumption has increased, we do not even know if, even though they are consuming, these people are dependent, it may have been the first time or occasional.
 
So is this increase not worrying?
It is not a significant increase. Apart from this group of people who have been caught, there is no increase in consumption, it is stable in 1% or 2%. This also has to do with the work that the police can do. Macao consumption is stable, but it is obvious that there has to continue to be prevention and this work that the police are doing. We also do prevention work in schools, we go to all Portuguese and English vehicle schools, and we also do huge work with minority communities, Vietnamese, Philippines, with associations, we do several prevention workshops and drug law, etc. There is a lot of work to be done on the preventive level to alert people to the dangers that drug use can bring.
 
It has been spoken of a new drug, the "spatial oil". Is it something that worries you?
People have to realize that this type of synthetic drugs are made with very dangerous health ingredients. It is not known very well what is there, what is inside this product. It is always a danger. They also cause problems at mental health. Usually cause irreversible damage. We saw this here many times in our residents, in the time of ketamine and methamphetamine. These people will never be the same. The drug was already being consumed in Macao before the law passed. We know there is there in the market, we know this, before it is illegal, we had some contacts with some families concerned that their families are consuming this drug. Of course all drugs worry us and in a while will be another that will appear.
 
Macao drug use is punished as a prison sentence up to one year. Is this approach effective to prevent?
We think it makes no sense to send a person to prison for consuming drugs. This is our position and it will always be our position. We accept that all those who are traffickers must suffer the consequences. But for consumers, we think there are other much healthier, much more successful and less expensive alternatives than going to prison. Perhaps this may be our challenge, we can get no consumer to go to prison, whether repeat offender or not. We think it is preferable to go to treatment and there are also people who do not need to enter a therapeutic community and may have more outpatient treatment. Attention must be paid so that the person does not go to prison for something they have consumed.
 
Could the decriminalization of light drugs be beneficial in the context of Macau?
At the level of the United Nations, there is no definition between light drugs and hard drugs. There are drugs. In the context that no one should go to prison for drug use, I think it makes sense to decriminalize, with alternatives. There has to be control, so there is no social chaos that exists in Portugal, where everyone consumes on the street, which is something even forbidden. There was a huge divestment in the level of prevention and treatment level, the bet was made exclusively in the reduction of harm, and today Portugal is almost for what happened in the 80s or 90s, if there is nothing very quickly happening. I agree with decriminalization, if then there is a referral of people for treatment and suggesting alternatives, not sending people to prison.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Authorities shorten waiting time for early treatment of children</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/07/11/autoridades-encurtam-tempo-de-espera-para-tratamento-precoce-das-criancas/</link><description>Health services say they have shortened the waiting time for early intervention services for children, and children can currently have their first evaluation consultation in three weeks. In response to an interpellation, the authorities guarantee dedication to the stabilization of human resources from early intervention equipment, and the tension in the supply of therapists was relieved. Until May, 34 professionals joined the early intervention team.
 
The waiting time for early consultations and treatment by the needy children found a “significant reduction”, ensuring health services, noting that several measures were adopted to accelerate minors access to related services, namely the recruitment of professionals.
According to the authorities, until May this year, the early intervention team for children currently integrates a total of 34 professionals, including 10 specialists, 2 physiotherapists, 5 psychotherapists, 8 occupational therapists and 9 speech therapists, aiming to “respond to children with different treatment needs”.
Alvis Lo, director of health services, revealed the numbers in response to a written interpellation of Deputy Zheng Anting about the optimization of the early intervention system for children with growth and child development disturbances.
The official admitted that there was a "tension in the offer of therapists in Macao", however, the authorities took "several measures to stabilize the treatment team of early intervention equipment." "In recent years, measures have been efficient and the human resources situation has been improved," he said.
According to the executive, for the needy children, the waiting time for the first consultation at the Pediatric Joint Evaluation Center is now about three weeks. The cases will be followed by a classification according to the evaluation results, in order to proceed, later, to occupational therapy and speech therapy at the Pediatric Rehabilitation Center.
Thus, “very urgent” cases do not lack waiting time, while “urgent cases and routine cases” will have to wait three to six weeks for occupational therapy, or five to six weeks for speech therapy. "These deadlines represent a significant reduction compared to the 12 to 18 months of waiting recorded before the creation of the [evaluation and rehabilitation] centers," he said.
Alvis Lo explained that in Macao, babies and children are subjected to periodic health care at health centers and, if there are suspicion of growth and development disorders during the exams, will be sent to the pediatric joint evaluation center for further evaluation.
In the same answer, the Institute of Social Action (IAS) added that it is preparing the creation of an early intervention center for children with developmental disorder in the North Zone, where services such as early education and training, professional treatments, consultation and counseling, family support and community dissemination will be provided. It is expected that the center is operating in the 4th quarter of this year, and the installation will introduce the appropriate technology equipment according to the needs of service and operation users, guaranteed the IAS.</description><pubDate>2025-07-11 01:38:19</pubDate></item><item><title>China is building 74% of all ongoing solar and wind projects</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/07/11/china-esta-a-construir-74-de-todos-os-projectos-solares-e-eolicos-em-curso/</link><description>Almost three quarters of all solar and wind power projects under construction are in China, according to a report yesterday, which highlights the rapid expansion of renewable sources in the Asian country.

The growth of clean energy in the country is crucial to combating climate change, given the dominant role of China in world industrial production. The country is responsible for about one third of global greenhouse gas emissions.
According to GEM, China should add at least 246.5gw of solar energy and 97.7gw of wind this year alone. By the end of March, the country already had 1.5 Terawatts of installed solar and wind power capacity.
In the first quarter of 2025, these sources accounted for 22.5% of total electricity consumption, according to the Chinese National Energy Administration.
Although it continues to develop new coal centrals - having started building the largest number of units of the last decade in 2024 - China has been strongly betting on renewables, both to reinforce energy safety and to reduce the dependence of imported fossil fuels.
According to GEM, about 28GW of the renewable capacity under construction come from the wind energy 'offshore', which can help decarbonize industrial centers and megacities in coastal regions. "Despite representing only a fraction of the country's total wind capacity, the 'offshore' wind energy is gaining strength as coastal provinces set ambitious decarbonization goals," the report said.
The expansion of electricity is also transforming the country's energy model. Increasing the use of cars and electrical trains means that a growing portion of the energy consumed is provided by electricity, leading some analysts to describe China as the first 'electrified state' in the world.
Beijing is expected to announce new climate commitments before the next United Nations Conference on Climate Change (COP30), which will take place in November in Belém, Brazil.

"Macau's NX862 flight to Tokyo was hit by a radius during a flight," Macao's teledifusion (TDM) said to Air Macao, noting that to ensure air connection safety was ordered to the plane to "return to inspection according to the procedures." The justification does not coincide with the one given by the airport management company to the station, which said it was a "engine problem" of the device that went to Narita Airport in Tokyo and has taken off at 09:40. Also on social networks, this was the version presented in the first account of the success.
At the Macau Buses and Public Transport Enthusiastic group (Macau bus enthusiasts) it is explained that shortly after the Air Macau plane raised flight while being near Taichung in downtown Taiwan, the device had to return to Macau, landing safely. According to TDM, the Chinese language publication identifies the plane as an Airbus A320neo, pointing out that the device would use a Pratt &amp; Whitney engine that was recently at the center of attention. In 2023, the aerospace supplier removed and inspected one of the motor lines built for the A320neo. The collection occurred after the company discovered a rare condition on the metal powder used to manufacture some pieces.</description><pubDate>2025-07-11 01:36:16</pubDate></item><item><title>Electronic payments in restaurants grow 3.2% in the first five months of the year</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/07/11/pagamentos-electronicos-em-restaurantes-crescem-32-nos-primeiros-cinco-meses-do-ano/</link><description>Electronic transactions in the restoration field accumulated 5.69 billion patacas until May, especially Western and Fast Food restaurants.

The two men were arrested for allegedly trying to convey to China documentation on the Neptune missiles of the Ukraine Armed Forces.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning has stated at a press conference that Chinese authorities are still “checking information” without providing further details.
The Ukraine Security Service (SBU) reported that the two citizens "tried to illegally export to China secret documentation" regarding the R-360 Neptuno systems, an anti-vintage cruise missile manufactured by the Ukrainian weaponry company Kiev's state design workshop, better known as "Luch".
The 24 -year -old man was a university student until 2023, the year he lost this statute due to his bad academic results, which did not prevent him from continuing to live in Kiev.
To obtain documentation about Neptune, the detainee tried to “recruit” a Ukrainian citizen involved in the development of this weapon, according to the SBU. "SBU counterinformation services discovered the spy in the early phase of his intelligence activity. He was arrested in the act while transferring secret documents," said Ukrainian security services.
According to information released by the Ukraine Attorney General's Office through his Telegram account, investigations have so far established that the young "maintains narrow ties with the security agencies and the China Staff."
His father was arrested on Wednesday "as part of a pre-judgment investigation," the Attorney's Office said. The parent lived in China, but regularly traveled to Kiev, a city where he arrived on Monday this week.
Since the large -scale invasion of Ukraine by Russia, Beijing has deepened his exchanges with Moscow, which aroused distrust in the West.
Chinese authorities maintained an ambiguous position on conflict, which they asked for “respect for the territorial integrity of all countries, including Ukraine” as well as listening to the “legitimate security concerns from all parts” in reference to Russia.
Several Western countries accused Beijing of supporting the Russian war effort in Ukraine, something repeatedly denied by China.</description><pubDate>2025-07-11 01:36:23</pubDate></item><item><title>Court issues a new arrest warrant against former President Yoon</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/07/11/tribunal-emite-novo-mandado-de-prisao-contra-ex-presidente-yoon/</link><description>A South Korea Court issued an arrest warrant against former presidential president Yoon Suk-Youol, due to the statement of martial law in December. The former ruler was formally deprived in April, due to imposed, on December 3, the martial law.
 
A South Korean court issued an arrest warrant yesterday against former presidential president Yoon Suk-Youol, due to the declaration of martial law in December, the Yonhap news agency said.
The judge of the Central District Court of Seoul Nam SE-Jin issued the warrant-for fear that the former leader could destroy evidence-, putting him in detention for the second time, according to Yonhap.
Yoon was the first acting South Korean head of state to be arrested in January before being released due to the annulment of the arrest warrant by another court.
The former ruler was formally deprived in April, due to imposed on December 3, the martial law, as well as the Army sent to Parliament.
Yoon Suk-Youol and the lawyers attended a hearing on Wednesday, having rejected all the charges, before the former leader was taken to the Seoul Detention Center, located in Uiwang, south of the capital, to wait for the court's decision, Yonhap said.
Following the issuance of the arrest warrant, Yoon, 64, was placed in an isolation cell of the institution, where it can be detained up to 20 days while prosecutors prepare to formally accuse it. "If Mr. Yoon is charged, it could remain detained up to six months after the charge," the France-Presse news agency Lawyers Association for Democratic Society, Yun Bok-Nam, told the France-Presse. "Theoretically, immediate release is possible, but in this case the Special Prosecutor argues that the risk of destruction of evidence remains high and that the accusations are already solidly substantiated," the lawyer said.
During Wednesday's hearing, the former president said he was fighting alone, according to local press. "The special prosecutor is now attacking even my lawyers," he said. "One after the other, they are giving up, and it may soon have to fight alone," he said.
Yoon was deprived by the deputies on December 14 and indicted on January 26, being accused of architecting an attempted rebellion. The accusations are punishable by death penalty or life imprisonment.
The former president also faces accusations of imposing martial law without following the required legal procedure and illegally mobilizing presidential security forces to block an initial attempt by Deter's authorities in early January.
Liberal rival and current president Lee Jae-Myung, who won the June early elections to replace him, approved, last month, legislation to carry out special investigations to the Marcial Declaration and other criminal allegations involving women and Yoon administration.

The show offers an intimate and sensitive record of Timor-Leste, the result of the photographer's experience in the country as a participant in Project C.A.F.E. - Learning Centers and School Training. The show features a set of images that capture the Timorese daily with particular sensitivity. Lacló, who worked as a trainer in this education system, brings in the lens the authenticity of his experiences with local communities. The photographs reveal not only landscapes, but above all the human pulse of a timor-eastern that the author knows inside. A country in educational transformation.
Project C.A.F.E., focused on the training of Timorenses teachers, is part of the educational cooperation between Portugal and Timor-Leste, which dates back to 2010 with the creation of Ruy Cinatti reference schools. Through successive protocols, this project has evolved into the current C.A.F.E. system, which today covers all 13 Timorese municipalities, serving about 9,500 students and involving more than 300 teachers. The model, which combines teaching in Portuguese with teacher education, represents one of the pillars of bilateral cooperation in the area of ​​education. The exhibition will be evident during the normal opening hours of the Portuguese Bookstore, inviting visitors to an immersion in Timorese reality.
The highlight will be on July 17, at 18h00, with a meeting that will be attended by the author. In this special session, in addition to the usual Finissage, a publication will be launched that complements the photographic show. Organized by the Portuguese Bookstore in collaboration with the photographer and the support of Somos - ACLP and the National Bank Overseas, among others, this exhibition reinforces the cultural bridge between Macau and the Lusófono Space. “What my eyes see” thus offers a double perspective: Lacló's artistic look and the testimony of a cooperation project that has profoundly marked the Timorese education system, revealing how international collaboration in education intertwines with the daily life of local communities.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Formal Timor-Leste adhesion The Asian organization scheduled for October 26</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/07/11/adesao-formal-de-timor-leste-a-organizacao-asiatica-marcada-para-26-de-outubro/</link><description>The formal adhesion of Timor-Leste to the Association of Southeast Asia Nations (Asean) will take place on October 26, during the heads of heads of states to be held in Malaysia, the Timorese diplomacy announced yesterday. “I want to inform you that on October 26 we will formally become members of ASEAN's full right,” said Foreign Minister Bendito Freitas, quoted in a Ministry publication on the Facebook social network, after attending the 58th Meeting of Foreign Ministers of the organization, which took place in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
The Timorese Minister also pointed out that the position of Myanmar, who expressed being against adhesion, because Timor-Leste “does not adhere to the principle of non-interference in internal affairs enshrined in the Asean letter”, will not block the process.
Following the coup d'état of February 1, 2021, Myanmar was sanctioned and does not participate in the summits of heads of state and government, nor in ministerial meetings.
ASEAN leaders approved in April 2021 a five -point consensus for the Military Junta in Power in Myanmar to apply, but to this day has not been implemented. “The Myanmar delegation has asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Timor-Leste cooperation to write a letter to his counterpart in Myanmar, in order to reinforce our cooperation and goodwill in joint work for a future partnership,” added Bendito Freitas.
The Member States of ASEAN arrived at an agreement of principle in November 2022 to integrate Timor-Leste in the regional organization, becoming the country to have the status of observer and being able to attend all meetings, including in the summits. In May, during the last summit of heads of state, it was announced that the full adhesion would be realized in October.
ASEAN was created in 1967 by Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia and Philippines and aims to promote cooperation between Member States to ensure peace, stability and economic, social and cultural development of the region. Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam are also part of ASEAN.</description><pubDate>2025-07-11 01:36:23</pubDate></item><item><title>Casino Games in Hong Kong - A matter of time?</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/07/11/jogos-de-casino-em-hong-kong-uma-questao-de-tempo/</link><description>Governments usually adopt a hybrid public policy approach when legalizing the game, balancing objectives such as revenue creation, economic development, consumer protection, social control and competition with illegal markets.
The expansion of legal sports bets in Hong Kong is currently being considered. The last one occurred in 2003, when the football bets were legalized. The Hong Kong government is now studying the legalization of basketball bets to effectively combat illegal bet activities. Advanced data by the Hong Kong Jockey Club (HKJC) estimate that the illicit market of sports bets-which includes horses, soccer, basketball, tennis and e-sports-was approximately HK $ 350 billion by 2023. Only 2024, it is estimated that the volume of basketball bets has reached between HK $ 70 and HK $ 90 billion.
Following a public consultation made in April, which received 1,063 contributions (from academics, youth and athletes organizations), of which 94% were supported by the proposal, 3.4% opposition and 2.6% neutrality, the Hong Kong government decided to advance with legislation to legalize bets on basketball, planning to change the Betting Duty Ordinance, in which it will replicate established in 2003 for football bets. Proposed changes include various restrictions, such as the fact that bets can only be made through authorized betting home - HKJC -, ban on credit card use for betting and ban on local teams or games in Hong Kong. In addition, a 50% tax on net revenues of bets, defined as the total bets less paid premiums is proposed.
Given the significant budgetary deficit of Hong Kong - HK $ 87.2 billion, after HK $ 122 billion deficits in 2022/23 and HK $ 101.6 billion in 2023/24 - the prospect of legalizing bets on basketball also represents an excellent opportunity to increase tax revenues. In 2023/24, HKJC, which is Hong Kong's largest tax taxpayer, paid HK $ 13.1 billion and HK $ 10.5 billion in taxes, respectively, on horsepower and soccer race bets. In addition, to increase short -term public revenues, HKJC has been obliged since 2023 for five years to pay an annual special tax on soccer bets in the amount of HK $ 2.4 billion.
In turn, Macao has allowed basketball bets since 2000, being exploited by SLOT under the concession for the exploitation of instant lottery. This concession includes, in addition to instant lottery (which have not seen it for years), also bets on football, and since 2024, through annual extensions. Under the Macao Game Law, basketball (and football) bets are a Tertius Genus regarding the four authorized game modalities. These are not fortune or unlucky in casino or interactive fortune games, they cannot be considered “operation offered to the public”, since the hope of gain does not reside exclusively in luck, and are not “mutual bet”, given the odds to be fixed.
Nevertheless, they remain a marginal modality. According to statistical data from the Game Inspection and Coordination Directorate, over 23 years (2002 to 2024), the total volume of bets was $ 37.4 billion (significantly half the most conservative value of illegal basketball bets, in 2024), generating, in this same period, a gross revenue of MOP $ 2.9 billion compared to the games Fortuna or unlucky in casino (which, only in 2024, reached a MOP $ 226.8 billion).
In terms of game, the Macao government has only focused on casino-gaming or unlucky games, probably due to the dependence on public coffers regarding the revenues derived from this industry. According to the region's budget for the year 2025, such revenues represent 81% of all current revenues registered there.
The tax gain allows Macau to thicken its financial reserve annually (with a value of over $ 600 billion). It also allows the government to launch plans for distributing budget surpluses by Macao residents, ending horsepower and gastro -racing concessions (although maintaining the importation of pork), receiving a thousand patacas for the exclusive Air Macau and build a new campus from the University of Macao in Henqing, outside the jurisdiction of Macau, to complement the (small!) Existing campus, with an existing campus Square kilometer of area.
Excessive revenue dependence on a specific sector is mostly in the so -called “economic monoculture”, which leads to the neglect of economic diversification and sub -coating in other sectors, leading to an unbalanced economy. Typical example-given the lack of public data-is the apparent and manifest lack of realization, and due monitoring of the investment commitment of MOP $ 142.6 billion in “non-game elements” that the concessionaires for the exploration of fortune games or casino disorder are contractually required to spend in the course of current concessions (2023-2032), which corresponds to around MOP $ 1.19 billion monthly.
While Macao seems to enjoy an inexhaustible “Patacas Tree”, Hong Kong faces persistent tax challenges, which makes the need and opportunity to benefit from the profitable casino gaming industry - particularly through a model such as HKJC, an unprofitable organization focused on continuous action for community -re -enhancing teaching attempts - in the past and take them to good port.
After all, being equally a special administrative region of the same country, which truly prevents Hong Kong from venturing into the exploitation of fortune or bad luck games?

There are numerous examples of Portuguese sidewalk around the world, and Macau is no exception.
The use of this type of floor as a urban project (Senate Largo) was introduced in Macao in the 1990s in order to materialize a Portuguese inheritance in the territory before the transition from Portugal's sovereignty to China. Similar to the standard that ornaments the famous Copacabana boardwalk in Rio de Janeiro, the waves star in the pedestrian route of Senate.
Although the Portuguese sidewalk is part of the identity of Portuguese culture in general and the identity of urbanism and landscaping of cities in particular, in Macau the cultural fusion movement is also reflected in this type of floor. Thus, taking into account the guidelines of the Feng Shui master, the patterns and motives that adorn the streets of the region present more rounded forms and figures associated with auspicious elements accepted in oriental culture: seahorses, fish, stars,…
Thus, on a walk through the poetic stalled streets of Macao, a challenge with each step I take the philosophical substantial unity of the body and soul; with the feet to the east and the soul to the West.</description><pubDate>2025-07-11 01:36:21</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
