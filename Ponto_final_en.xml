In the article, the author examines the way the Barcelos Rooster - originally associated with the union of the Portuguese people and the “rural and Catholic values” of the Estado Novo regime in Portugal - was the target of a recontextualization from the transfer of Macao sovereignty in 1999, then symbolizing the “hybrid identity” of the territory and the “processes of cultural adaptation and mercantilization” that occurred in it.
The investigation was made from “ethnographic field work between 2012 and 2024”, according to the introduction of the article, and “analyzes the evolution of the role of the rooster in the tourist image, while critically addressing the selective appropriation of colonial legacies” and how they are reconfigured in “postcolonial identity formations”. In the current context of Macao, the popularization of Rooster as one of the largest tourist figures in the region shows “its double goals of preserving colonial heritage and positioning itself as a cultural and economic bridge between China and the Lusophone world”, in a fusion between its past and its contemporary role as Chinese territory.
This is not the first time the Portuguese researcher has been overlooking the subject. Last year, the investigation “Crowing in Two Voices: The Cultural Transformation of the Portuguese Rooster in Postcolonial Macau” was published in the journal Nature, once again examining the metamorphosis of the Rooster from a symbol from Portuguese to cross -cultural icon in Macao.
In this previous work, the author notes that the adoption of the rooster as a tourist product originated a reinterpretation of it, which was associated with “estimated Chinese culture” qualities such as honesty, courage and prosperity, and became an example of the “intricate fusion of two distinct cultural narratives”.

Macao is currently under a yellow alert for high temperatures, valid for the next few days. In the forecast of seven days available on the SMG page, it is possible to find that between today and Wednesday, at least, the thermometers will reach the 33 degrees Celsius, while the minimum temperatures will reach 27 degrees Celsius. An anticyclone at high altitude ensures that wind in the region will remain weak, intensifying the thermal sensation of intense heat. The “very hot time” of the region may be accompanied by scattered sweeteners and very cloudy periods of sky.
On the day of the vote, in particular, the sky “will be unloved”, although there is the possibility of the occurrence of showers at the beginning of the day. On this day, the maxims can reach the 34 degrees Celsius, "it can be one to two degrees Celsius higher in urban areas." Authorities urges citizens to “actively participate in electoral activities and exercise their voting rights”, calling for some “meteorological tips to better prevent the heat” as a reference. These include the use of portable fans, the use of thin clothes of light colors and hat and the redoubled consumption of water.
In the same informative note, SMG explains that, "according to the current numerical models, the likelihood of formation of a tropical storm, equal to or greater than the Tropical Cyclone in the Southern Sea of ​​China or Northwest Pacific Ocean, and that may affect the Guangdong coast in the coming days, is relatively low." Still, the authorities guarantee that they will continue to follow the evolution of the situation and advise the population to remain attentive to updated weather information. The probability of forming a tropical storm in the rest of the month is higher, being between 40% and 50%.</description><pubDate>2025-09-11 23:12:35</pubDate></item><item><title>The military parade of China and its political implications</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/09/11/a-parada-militar-da-china-e-suas-implicacoes-politicas/</link><description>The large military parade held in Beijing on September 3, 2025 marked not only the close relationship between China and its friendly countries in the world, but also its rapid military modernization, with important internal and external implications.
First, twenty-six leaders from foreign countries participated in the observation of the military parade, including Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean President Kim Jong Un (see table below). The presence of the Pakistani Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif, while Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi participated in the summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization in Tianjin, but left China shortly before the start of the military arrest. It was reported that Modi did not participate in the military parade to avoid discontent from Japan. Another possibility was that Modi could avoid finding his Pakistani counterpart, given the recent four-day conflict between India and Pakistan in May 2025. Whatever the reason behind the absence of Modi, the military parade was attended by four leaders of socialist states, including Kim Jong Uniden, including Kim Jong Un. Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel, Vietnamese President Luong Cuong and Interim President of Myanmar, Min Aung Hliang-a clear sign of ideological and socialist solidarity among the five main socialist states, including China. None of the pro-us and western countries sent its leaders to watch the military parade-a reflection of a strong Cold War mindset that persists in the minds of developed pro--her and western countries.

US President Donald Trump referred to the military parade as a sign that China is "conspiring against the US with Putin and Kim." Although China's close friends embrace Russia and North Korea due to the persistence of its good neighborhood policy, the word "conspirated" pointed to an alliance, which is politically speaking a solid coalition in military and economic terms. However, there is no such economic alliance between the three countries - China, Russia and North Korea. The three states have cordial bilateral relations, especially between North Korea and Russia, as the first sent troops to fight for the second in the Russian-Ucranian war. Although China's relations with North Korea have historically remained harmonious and strong, as Kim Jong Un Visit this time was warmly received by President XI Jinping and greeted by his protected CAI Qi, there are no signs that there is a solid economic-military triple alliance between China, North Korea and Russia. No wonder Russian President Putin referred to Trump's "conspiracy" comment as "humorous". However, it can be said that China, Russia, and North Korea constitute an informal coalition of non-western and anti-hegemonic forces that see the US as the ordinary enemy and the most formidable adversary in the western world.
Secondly, a more detailed analysis of President Xi Jinping's speech reveals some prominent characteristics, avoiding any reference to countries such as Japan and Germany during World War II and avoiding any attempt to praise the allies of nationalist China, including the US. US President Trump commented that the US should have been mentioned in Xi's speech as his country played a crucial role in the Battle of China during World War II. In fact, US contributions to the Battle of China were politically and militarily significant, but the omission of the US discourse in the US discourse implied that China and its friendly countries, such as Russia and North Korea, are against the world's hegemonic countries without named the US and its allies. Thus, President XI's speech was quite moderate and skillfully elaborated, trying to avoid antagonizing Japan and the US. President XI said in his speech that China will never forget the countries that helped her in the anti -fascist war, thus insinuating, without naming, the US role in her resistance war against the Japanese aggressor from 1931 to 1945.
Another prominent feature of Xi's discourse was the frequency with which he used the word "peace" five times and the word "peaceful" twice, while the word "justice" or "right" or "just" appeared four times. The whole speech has been carefully written to emphasize that China follows the path of peaceful development, on the one hand, and that China is eager to imagine justice in the world, on the other. The release of 80,000 doves of peace at the end of the ceremony was the highlight, showing that peace was the main message amid the display of modern Chinese weaponry and military equipment.
Third, judging by the new weapons displayed in the military parade, they were very different and much more advanced than in the last parade of Victory Day 10 years ago, with the presence of high -tech weaponry such as drones, missiles and third generation fighters. It is worth remembering that during the 2008 earthquake in Sichuan, China, the Popular Liberation Army (PLA) did not even have drones and used heavy helicopters. In the 2025 military parade, however, the modernization of the plane showed impressive progress, including the first nuclear missile released from the JL-1 air, the intercontinental ballistic missile released from submarine JL-3, DF-61, DF-31BJ, DF-5C; and the display of the terrestrial, sea and air categories of strategic nuclear forces. Other impressive weapons included the Antinavo Hypersonic Ballistic Missile YJ-20, the Antinavio HipperSonic Cruise missile YJ-19 with SCRAMJET engine, the new Type 99b and Type 100 tanks, the aircraft-based fighters such as J-15 and J-35 series, wolf robots and Hongdu GJ-11 stealing air combat drones, Unsanger submersible and unmanned artillery systems, as well as high energy lasers and high-power microwave weapons. The military force composed of women soldiers was impressive, illustrating the preparation of the Chinese war machine. The content of the military parade has not only been demonstrating China's preparation for any conflict and war, including the possibility of southern China's sea conflict and other places, but also its eagerness to increase the sale and trade transactions of military weapons to their friendly countries around the world. From 2020 to 2024, China ranked fourth in global arms exports, according to Stockholm International Peace Research, behind the US, France and Russia (South China Morning Post, September 5, 2025). It can be anticipated that Chinese weapons exports to other countries will likely increase after the country has exhibited its military power during the September 3 parade. In addition, given the presence of many unmanned air weapons, the PLA seems to increase its ability to launch an effective attack on Taiwan's enemy targets, if any radical in Taiwan do something to provoke the political and military leaders of the continent. Although Taiwan was not mentioned in President XI's speech, the impressive Arsenal of Arms can alarm Taiwan's military leaders. No wonder a Taiwan security guard has met with US defense, Jed Royal in Anchorage, a week before the mainland China Military Parade (Reuters, September 5, 2025).
Fourthly, the presence of Chinese political leaders was noteworthy. Vice-President of the Central Military Commission (CMC), Zhang Youxia, sat in the front row alongside former vice-minister Zhang Gaoli, possibly indicating his increasingly important role in Chinese political leadership. Interestingly, the choice of Lieutenant General Han Shengyan as commander of the military parade deserved our attention. Han came from the central command. However, Central Command Commander General Wang Qiang did not appear, feeding speculation in the Chinese and English media abroad over the reason for his absence. Given the fact that many military generals were purged due to the persistent anti-corruption campaign, it was still unclear why a lieutenant general was chosen as commander of the military chart-perhaps a choice made by the increasingly important vice president of CMC, Zhang Youxia, according to some Chinese youtubers abroad. At the 2015 Military Parade, the commander was General Song Puxuan of the Beijing Military Command. At the 2019 Military Parade, the commander was General Yi Xiaoguang of the Central Command.
Another noteworthy presence at the military parade was that of the party's veterans, including former Prime Minister Wen Jiabao and former permanent committee of the Polytburo Wang Yang and Li Ruihuan committee, as well as former vice president Zeng Qinghong. Their presence indicated the importance, statute and persistent influence of the elderly and retirees of the Chinese Communist Party. Former 83-year-old Hu Jintao and 97-year-old former minister Zhu Rongji were absent due to their health and age respectively. Since the fourth plenary session of the Chinese Communist Party will be held soon in October and will discuss the five -year plan, external observers will be interested in any new faces of the Central Committee, which is now composed of 205 members and 171 alternate members. Since Chinese social networks abroad have many speculation about the developments of the Summer Meeting in Beidaihe, held in August, when the oldest leaders of the party were invited to share their ideas about national and party development, external observers are deeply interested in knowing if the fourth plenary session may show any guidance on personnel issues - a theme that can be influenced by some older party members and will probably point to planning. of the succession of China leadership in the coming years.
In fifth and last place, the China Military Parade managed to invite 26 leaders from friendly countries to participate, demonstrating the success of Chinese foreign policy to conquer the hearts and minds of their friends. From the point of view of united front policy, the China Military Parade has gained the support of many friends in developing countries, including those in Asia and Africa. Interestingly, Latin American countries have been absent, perhaps indicating the fact that they are under the sphere of US geopolitical and economic influence and that they are concerned about the US, under Trump's leadership, using tariffs to “punish” countries that participated in the Chinese military parade. The September 3 parade was skillfully programmed to take place shortly after the summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) in Tianjin, facilitating the participation of most SCO participants in the Beijing Military Parade. President XI also met with leaders and representatives of the 26 countries in Beijing, emphasizing China's global initiatives on security, development and civilization, trying to strengthen ties of solidarity between countries that are not part of the US -led alliance. From the point of view of the United Front, the SCO meeting in Tianjin and the military parade in Beijing were skillfully programmed to raise closer support for China's ideological friends in the developed and developing world in relation to the US -led Western world and EU. Clearly, ideologies remain the most important division in international politics.
In conclusion, the China Military Parade was significant both internally and externally. Internally, Chinese political leaders have been able to project a strong image of internal unity, using the military parade to stimulate a high degree of Chinese patriotism and nationalism in the Chinese people's psyche, including Chinese elites from Hong Kong and Macau, who sent their delegations led by Beijing -rulers. The presence of many party veterans in observing the military parade was politically significant, indicating its indispensable and influential role in defining China's national development policies and, perhaps, in the succession of leadership in the coming months and years. Externally, the military parade won the support not only of close friends and good neighbors from China, namely Russia and North Korea, but also from other friendly countries in Asia and Africa, using the SCO meeting in Tianjin as a mobilizing agent to facilitate the participation of friendly countries at the military parade. The presence of many Asian and African countries on the Chinese military parade has shown the US-led alliance and the EU that the non-Western world has totally different ideologies, namely anti-hegemonism and socio-economic and political development without dependence on the US and its allies. Most importantly, China's military modernization has advanced so quickly and impressively that the plane is militarily prepared to protect its national sovereignty and territorial integrity, sending a warning signal to any countries and places that continue or tries to provoke militarily. At the same time, the main point of President XI's speech was to emphasize the path of China for peaceful development; Chinese military modernization is defensive, not offensive, and is peaceful, not aggressive, as greetedly portrayed by some western media and politicians. Last but not least, the modernization of Chinese military weapons advanced stride, leading to countless opportunities for new business transactions.</description><pubDate>2025-09-11 23:03:22</pubDate></item><item><title>Andaz Macau celebrates birthday with the return of the gastronomic bazaar sino-priso</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/09/11/andaz-macau-celebra-aniversario-com-regresso-do-bazar-gastronomico-sino-luso/</link><description>Galaxy Entertainemnt Group reinforces Macau Statute as a creative city of UNESCO's cuisine with another event that joins the flavors of Portugal and China.

"This is not just a vague designation, an expression, it is a commitment to be able to go further in our cultural cooperation, economic level, at the level of the development of new relationship areas," Montenegro said at the end of the working meeting with dismissal Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba on the first day of the official visit to Japan.
The head of the government highlighted among the areas to develop for the future in the bilateral relationship of security and defense, new technologies, energy and the sharing of scientific knowledge between educational institutions. “This strategic partnership illustrates a common desire to work together, to converge and to deal with a positive and efficient and consequent purpose of our political, economic and cultural relationship,” he said.
At the beginning of the meeting, Montenegro had already thanked Prime Minister Ishiba for the words of solidarity that he transmitted to Portugal regarding the August fires and the recent accident with the Glory Elevator, which caused 16 deaths.
Montenegro was received in Kantei, the official residence of the Japanese Prime Minister, with a guard of honor, and, in the final statement, without questions (contrary to what was nominated on the program), Montenegro stressed the 480-year list of both countries, considering that his two-day visit to Japan "constitutes a friendship and an opportunity."
In the political domain, the prime minister stated that the joint statement that establishes the strategic partnership will mean “greater regularity” in the meetings between the two countries, noting that today the ministers of foreign affairs, Paulo Rangel, and the Minister of Economics and Territorial Cohesion, Manuel Castro Almeida, met with their counterparts.
In the economic plan, the prime minister pointed out that there are more than a thousand active Portuguese companies in the Japanese market, in areas as diverse such as agriculture, industry, medicines or energy, areas, to which they will be added with strategic partnership such as civil protection and security and defense. "We also want to preserve what has been a common heritage at the cultural and linguistic level. I highlight the circumstance that there are many Japanese to learn Portuguese and also, in Portugal, there is Japanese teaching," he said.
Montenegro also pointed out Osaka's exhibition, which will visit on Friday as “perfect testimony of this dimension of political, cultural and economic cooperation” and greeted the success of the event, noting that only the Portugal Pavilion “has been visited by over 1.4 million citizens”.
In the international level, he stressed with Japan “a great convergence” of positions, taking the opportunity to reiterate Russia's conviction “for the violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrality”, without referring, however, to the recent denunciation of Russian drones in the raid of Russian drones in its airspace.
Faced with the Japanese Prime Minister, Montenegro also condemned the North Korea nuclear and ballistic program. "I am absolutely convinced that this visit will mean a new phase in our relationship, the beginning of a strategic partnership that is effectively a new stage, which aims to bring more well-being and development to our countries," he said.
Previously, the Prime Minister of Japan, who is a dismissal following the defeat in July legislative elections, considered that cooperation between the two countries "is more important than ever," given the "challenging security environment" in the world.
Ishiba pointed out that about 120 Japanese companies operate in Portugal and that "business cooperation in the field of renewable energy and infrastructure continues to grow." "We expect even greater development of trade relations and investment between the two countries," he said, also expressing interest in "contributing to the economic and social development of Portuguese -speaking countries."</description><pubDate>2025-09-11 23:10:08</pubDate></item><item><title>Priority to improving the quality of life of residents</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/09/11/prioridade-a-melhoria-de-qualidade-de-vida-dos-residentes/</link><description>The Promoting Union's Political Program for Progress aims to raise the quality of life of Macao residents and highlights its hope of improving policies in areas such as housing, transport, education, social services and health. List number 3, represented by the current deputies Leong Hong Sai and Ngan Iek Hang, advocates the availability of more public housing, accelerate urban renewal and reinforce the defense of national security.

The well-being of the population and the quality of life were placed as the first proposals in the Political Program of the Promoting Union for Progress. Connecting to the general union of Macao residents' associations, the list is in the electoral race, represented again by the current deputies Leong Hong Sai and Ngan Iek Hang.
List number 3, emphasizing the goal of achieving “a happy macao”, emphasizes the importance of improving the lives of residents from various domains, including increasing the quality of social services, expanding social assistance measures and ensuring the health of residents.
With regard to housing and transport, the team states that it will urge the government to respond to housing needs by formulating short, medium and long term plans for the use of unused land. For the list, the government must establish a calendar and clearly fix the volumes of supply of different types of public housing and optimize the use of land reserves.
Its political program advocates the permanent implementation of social housing subsidy measures, the regular opening of public housing applications and the reduction of waiting times for housing.
The list assumes that it will also press for a rapid legislation that implements the middle class housing program, in order to respond to the housing needs of young people and the middle class.
In addition, the candidates promise to install the completed and quality conclusion of the existing projects of the Friendship Rotent Viaduct, promoting the study of the construction of the fifth passage between the Macao Peninsula and the mud, as well as an external circular between these two zones.
Accelerate the construction of light meter lines and improving the standards of the bus service are also on the list schedule on the list.
The group is attentive, at the same time, to the effectiveness of the executive's governing work, requesting better legislative coordination, promoting a fair and impartial society, as well as the reinforcement of the safeguard of national security.
Thus commit to fighting for “safeguarding the residents' legitimate rights and interests, reflecting their concerns to the government, overseeing the government's legal administration, advancing social progress, and realizing the vision of residents living and working in peace and satisfaction”, can read in the electoral program.
In addition, the list aims to ask the government to strive for urban renewal and revitalize old neighborhoods, formulating environmental policies and regulating vehicle repair workshops, as well as controlling pollution along the coast of the Macao Peninsula.
The list also points out the economy and employment issues, which concern residents, noting that the industrial structure of Macau is currently “in transition” from a single sector for industrial diversification.
However, according to the list, the development of emerging industries requires time and small and medium enterprises face numerous operational challenges, while residents face structural unemployment and low income groups fight with difficulty to support themselves.
The team, in this case, says they will focus on defending employment assistance measures, installing the government to increase game-related investments, promoting the revitalization of six old neighborhoods, encouraging tourism activities and creating new job opportunities.

Lasting 17 days, the festival starts on November 14 in Praça do Lago Sai Van and has a diverse cuisine offer, provided by about 150 stalls of food. As a way to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the initiative, there will still be two parallel events at the Galaxy Macao International Convention Center in late November.

The 25th Macao Gastronomy Festival will take place from November 14 to 30, at Praça do Lago Van, counting again on the organization of the associations of the owners of Macao Restoration and Beverage establishments. On the occasion of the festival's birthday, this year's edition will feature two news: the “International Championship of Chinese Kitchen Chefs” and the “International Exhibition of Intelligent Restoration Equipment”.
The space will host about 150 food stalls run by small and medium -sized local businesses, ten more than last year, according to statements made by the chairman of the organizing committee, Chan Chak Mo, to the newspaper or Mun. The day before yesterday, at 11am, the organizers promoted an informative session on the festival details at the Marriott Hotel, where the event program, the preparations and the registration process was presented.
Chan Chak Mo stressed that the festival's goal is to “establish an effective marketing platform for the restoration”, increase the notoriety of macao brands and promote their sustainable development through the encouragement of local consumption. In parallel, and as a way to mark the 25th anniversary of the festival, two events whose objective is to highlight the best of gastronomy at local and international level, facilitating the exchange between different gastronomic cultures.
The first event is the “International Culinary Competition for Chinese Kitchen Chefs”, lasting two days, between 26 and 27 November, at the Galaxy Macao International Convention Center. The competition is divided into three categories-team contest, hot dishes and 'dim sum'-and should count on the participation of teams representing more than 40 countries and regions.
The second takes place at the same place, from November 26 to 28, and consists of an “International Exhibition of Smart Restoration Equipment”. According to the newspaper or Mun, this event will cover the latest products, equipment and technologies within the restoration and hospitality sectors, thus facilitating the exchange and training of partnerships between professionals around the world.
Quoted by the same source, Chan Chak Mo said he hoped the simultaneous realization of the gastronomy festival with these two additional events contributes to the promotion of frequently interconnected sectors of restoration, tourism and conventions and exhibitions. The advantages extend to consumers, and all establishments participating in the festival are eligible for the current round of the “big consumption award”, scheduled for November 30.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Imports from China support 5.2 million jobs in Brazil</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/09/11/importacoes-da-china-sustentam-52-milhoes-de-empregos-no-brasil/</link><description>Imports from China supported 5.2 million jobs in Brazil in 2024, more than double export posts for the Asian country, according to a study released by the Brazil-China Business Council (CEBC).

The report, made with the Ministry of Development, Industry, Commerce and Services in Brazil, shows how bilateral trade has grown almost five times in two decades, affecting not only commercial flows, but also employment, wages and social dynamics.
Although export jobs pay higher wages, the impact of imports is more widespread among Brazilian companies and communities, the study points out.
In 2024, China was a destination of 28% of Brazilian exports and origin of 24% of imports. Over the past decade, Brazil has accumulated a surplus of $ 276 billion (235 billion euros) in exchanges with Beijing - 51% of its global commercial surplus. In contrast, exchanges with the United States and the European Union generated a joint deficit of $ 224 billion (191 billion euros).
This surplus, however, is focused on a few sectors and companies: 80% of exports by 2024 were soy, iron ore and oil, and less than 3,000 companies responded for these sales. “It doesn't matter if they are soy or machines. The problem is depending on few products and few markets,” warned Túlio Cariello, CEBC Research Director and study co -author in the report.
Cariello rejected the idea that the raw material sector is a sign of delay, underlining decades of innovation in tropical agriculture, deep water oil extraction and ore refining.
While exports remain concentrated, imports show greater diversity: over 40,000 Brazilian companies bought products from China by 2024-almost 15 times more than those that imported from other South American countries.
Imports include electronics, machines, fertilizers and industrial chemists - essentials for sectors such as agribusiness.
Camila Amigo, CEBC analyst, said that increased employment linked to imports does not reflect a strategic change, but dependence on foreign components. The challenge is to turn these jobs into support for the national industry, he said.
According to friend, Brazil can benefit from the reorganization of global chains as Chinese manufacturers invest abroad, positioning themselves as a regional industrial hub.
The study shows that Brazil exports to China with a much narrower business base than to other markets: less than 3,000 companies sold to the Asian country in 2024, compared to almost 10,000 for the US and more than 11,000 for Mercosur.
Although the number of exported categories increased from 673 in 1997 to 2,589 in 2024, the agenda remains dominated by primary products. Meats, pulp, coffee and some transformed products have begun to gain space.
In imports, Brazil bought 6,914 China product categories in 2024, almost all industrial ones: electronics, vehicles, textiles, pharmacists and components dominate the list.
Employment also reflects this imbalance: between 2008 and 2022, imports linked to imports grew by 55%, while those linked to exports increased by 62%, but from a smaller base.
To reduce dependence, Cariello defended reindustrialization with foreign direct investment. Friend highlighted, on the other hand, opportunities related to the energy transition, such as lithium, copper and manganese, as well as corn and fruits, which began to access the Chinese market.
The data from 2024 confirm the weight of China: 73% of soy, 67% of iron ore and 44% of oil exported by Brazil were destined for the Asian country, which also bought half of Brazilian beef and cotton meat.
The growing Chinese presence also generated pressure on Brazilian industry: some companies, such as steelmakers, ended up sold to Chinese groups - a sign of how trade and investment interconnect. "The point is to understand that parts of these productive chains make sense to Brazil and how to use them to support reindustrialization," concluded friend.

The list linked to the Fujian community, headed by the current deputies Song Pek Kei and Nick Lei, advocates the setting of a minimum limit of 85% of local workers in game concessionaires, the resuming of the investment and development fund, and 10% of revenues should be shared by residents, as well as consumer card relaunch.
 
Economic development and employment guarantee are always among the main commitments of candidates for legislative elections, and there is no exception to list number 1 - the Association of United Citizens of Macao for this year's legislatures.
Led by the current deputies Song Pek Kei and Nick Lei, the list presented the political program with eight key proposals, which include the resuming of the Fund for Development and Investment of MSAR, a project that the government had proposed in 2019. With the reactivation of the Fund with a universal nature, it suggested attributing 10% of its revenues as dividends to all residents, allowing residents to “share the new opportunities” of diversification of the diversification of the diversification of the diversification of the diversification of the diversification of industrial development.
The candidate list associated with the Fujian community says it is aware of the use of residents, advocates a “rigorous review” of the percentage of non-resident workers in large companies, in particular games operators, to ensure that local residents are at least 85% of game companies personnel. It also calls for priority to places in access to work in the financial sector and award of public services, including public works.
In addition, the group committed to the government for the government to launch an employment allowance worth 5,000 patacas for residents to relieve the financial pressures of undereased and unemployed workers.
The continuation of the consumer card is also found in the political program of list 1, which was implemented between 2020 and 2022, with two rounds of immediate discounts and consumer programs based on government subsidies. It also aims to make the reimbursement of a temporary policy for a permanent mechanism in order to “mitigate public difficulties and ensure long -term stability in social security”.
In the opinion of Song Pek Kei and Nick Law team, the government must study the creation of a universal health insurance system while ensuring that the elderly and children continue to benefit from existing free medical services. They say they expect community health systems and hospitals to complete the problem of long waiting times for medical appointments, high medical costs, and excessive pressure on specialist doctors, thus relieving pressure on the public health system.
Among the requests are also the increase in subsidy for the elderly to 15,000 patacas, reviewing the amount of the pension for the elderly to be higher than the value of social risk, which currently provide for 3,900 patacas and 4,350 patacas, respectively.
The low birth in Macao also concerns the list, which asks to extend the childhood assistance allowance for the age of six and to establish a progressive allowance for parents with second and third children, to encourage birth and alleviate the financial charges of child care.
As for the need for housing by residents, the list proposes the annual launch of application for economic housing. It also suggested measures to satisfy the search for housing among young people, assigning the units of public housing not sold as apartments for young people.
Finally, the group wants to promote the mechanism of accountability of civil servants, improving governance and administrative transparency, as well as optimizing the remuneration, promotion, training and professional development of civil servants, and reinforce the guarantee of retirement for basic public workers.

The current deputy Wong Kit Cheng again leads the team linked to the General Association of Women, proposing 90 days of paid maternity leave and 10 days of paternity leave. It also intends to increase various subsidies, including the birth and pensions for the elderly and disability.

The increase in maternity and paternity leave is highlighted among the key proposals of the Good Home Alliance for the next legislative elections. List number 6, led by the current deputy Wong Kit Cheng, is committed to fighting for the rights of women, children and other vulnerable groups, advocating the climb of various social benefits.
The Wong Kit Cheng and Loi I Weng list, linked to the General Association of Women, proposes measures to meet “urgent questions” such as the decline of birth rates and the aging of the population. In particular, it expects to extend the maternity leave to 90 days and the paternity license to 10 days, and increase the birth allowance to 20,000 patacas, whose value assigned is now set at 6,500 patacas.
In addition, he wants to extend the scope of beneficiaries of the childhood assistance subsidy plan, from children up to three years old up to six years old. It is also committed to working to increase holidays for children's care and to take prenatal examination, flexible working hours and tax exemption for mothers.
The group says it will ask for an improvement in the gynecology consultation service in Macao, extend the free medically assisted procreation service, increase day care vacancies and create more recreational spaces for children.
Regarding the elderly and vulnerable groups, the list requests an increase in the value of the pension for the elderly, the subsidy for the elderly, the disability pension and the subsidy for caregivers. It also assumes that the optimization of facilities without barriers, the creation of an inclusive environment, as well as the increase of resources, the government, for early treatment and special education services.
In the electoral program the list suggests, at the same time, that more vacancies are available in the elderly homes, create more complementary residence facilities for the elderly and review the benefit system of social assistance personnel in order to promote the professional development of this area.
The six key proposals on the list include measures intended for education and youth development, which the team is concerned due to the low birth rate. Its program advocates the increase in investment in education, optimization of teaching in small classes and the teacher-student proportion, and the implementation of a model of “three teachers in a class” in childhood gardens.
The candidate list understands that it is necessary to stabilize the teaching team and provide “high quality educational guarantees” for the growth and development of young people. In this case, it proposes to raise incentives to obtain certification to a maximum value of 10,000 patacas, in order to reinforce the vocational training of young workers.
On the other hand, the group states that the community economy in Macau is in “continuous weakness”, which can undermine the welfare of vulnerable families, employment and entrepreneurship of young people. Thus, the list expects to expand consumption incentive schemes to relieve the living costs of residents, while injecting capital into small and medium enterprises.
In concrete, it defends the continuation of the plans of the major consumer award and the pecuniary reimbursement, as well as the creation of community commercial districts to accelerate the revitalization of community neighborhoods.
The team indicates that it is also committed to satisfying the demand for housing by residents, by stabilizing the availability of public and private housing, and urging the government to launch housing policies inclined to young families and household aggregates with children or the elderly.

In the document, the European authorities warn of the erosion of autonomy, freedoms and fundamental rights of the citizens of Macao. It is also noted the disappearance of space for pluralistic voices in politics and society. The Government of the MSAR responded to the EU report by saying it includes "infractual and biased comments," as local authorities guarantee their residents "their rights and freedoms of expression, press, meeting and others."

The European Union (EU) warned the deterioration of freedoms and fundamental rights in Macao. The complaint was made in the annual report on the 2024 MSAR, recently published by Brussels.
"From a political point of view, autonomy and freedoms and fundamental rights, which should be protected by at least 2049, continued to deteriorate," read the EU report, which criticizes the change in the Electoral Law of the MSAR, in force since April last year, and which provides, for example, the exclusion of candidates to the Legislative Assembly considered insufficiently patriots by the National Security Commission.
For the elections that take place this Sunday, it is recalled, 12 candidates were disqualified, including former deputy Ron Lam. For the European authorities, this new legislation "further limits the space for pluralistic voices in both politics and society." In the document, the EU also says that, last year, “freedom of meeting remained under pressure”, such as freedom of the press and freedom of expression.

“Infactual” comments, says the government of the

The Government of MSAR responded to the report by saying that the EU makes “some infracted and biased comments on the region's political and social development”, including “unresolved accusations” regarding the review of the electoral law. Therefore, the authorities expressed “strong displeasure and firm opposition” to the document.
In the reaction, the Government of Masters says it has safeguarded residents "their rights and freedoms of expression, press, meeting and others." "The results obtained are remarkable, and widely recognized by the international community and with full and full agreement of MSAR residents," argues the local executive. The government also says that in the process of reviewing the electoral law, the opinions of the population of Macao and the interested personalities were wide.
On the other hand, "Macao's matters are internal matters of China," reads the response of local authorities, which adds that "the publication annually of the said report by the European Union is an interference in the internal affairs of China and MSAR, violating the fundamental principles of international law."
The spokesman for the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Popular Republic of China in Macao also reacted, saying that the report of the European authorities "ignores the facts, is muliously skewed and defamed the singular practice of" one country, two systems ". In addition, "unbridically attacks the rule of law and human rights of Macao and roughly interferes with China's internal affairs."
Beijing's organism says that the mashed democratic system "has been perfected and freedom of expression, press freedom and residents' work rights are fully protected by law." "This is a fact recognized by all impartial people."</description><pubDate>2025-09-11 23:18:49</pubDate></item><item><title>Hong Kong onpoint band will act at FMCC Solidarity Dinner</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/09/11/banda-de-hong-kong-onpoint-vai-actuar-no-jantar-solidario-da-fmcc/</link><description>The annual solidarity dinner of the France Chamber of Commerce Macau (FMCC), scheduled for September 19, will be attended by the Hong Kong Onpoint band.
"We are very pleased to receive the Onpoint in this year's gala," said Rutger Verschuren, president of FMCC, quoted in a group statement. "Your ability to captivate the audience and raise any event aligns perfectly with our vision for a celebration, connection and philanthropy night. Guests can wait for an uninterrupted entertainment night that will keep the dance floor excited."
The Onpoint are described as "Hong Kong's favorite live band," known for the energy fusion of 'pop', 'rock', jazz and 'funk' that has already made them a frequent presence in celebrations, corporate events, four Seasons or The Ritz-Carlton or even weddings. With over 35 years of experience, the group of musicians - "not just musicians, but also" Entertainers "," according to the statement - now promises to make the FMCC gala "unforgettable" with its "excellent music" and "surrounding energy".
The 17th edition of the Gala dinner will take place on the MGM Macau Grand Ballroom and will serve to raise funds for two associations: Zhuhai Autism Society and Macau Special Olympics. Earlier this month, Rutger Verschuren anticipated that the party had about 300 guests and promised "a great night, a lot of fun, with music and fantastic food." The usual draw of more than 20 gifts and the third edition of the delivery of ESG prizes, which distinguish best practices to environmental, social and governance, are also foreseen.
Last year, the FMCC dinner joined more than 300 guests and raised about 60,000 patacas for a recycling and paper initiative carried out by the Oxfam organization.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Focus on housing, employment and increased amount of the pecuniary check</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/09/11/foco-na-habitacao-emprego-e-aumento-do-montante-do-cheque-pecuniario/</link><description>The Nova Esperança list focuses on housing, employment for residents and “well-being of all”, including the increase in the amount of the pecuniary check to 15,000 patacas and the relaunch of the 10,000 patacas consumer card. List 2, led by Deputy José Pereira Coutinho, includes in his political program concerns related to health and education care.

List 2 competes for elections for the Legislative Assembly (AL) under the motto "serve communities, serve the citizen." The New Hope Political Program first puts the list of housing first on the list of housing, suggesting that public housing is anchored to the birth rate of MSAR, in order to reduce the price of economic housing.
The second point of the new Hope suggestion list, a list headed by Deputy José Pereira Coutinho, which has as 2 Chan Hao Weng, has to do with the situation of residents' use. The list proposes that permanent residents are given to employment at game concessionaires and that non-Local labor is reduced in leadership positions.
On the other hand, it is suggested that the pecuniary reimbursement check is permanent and has a base value of 15 thousand patacas. The list also calls for the electronic consumer card plan to be relaunched with a value of 10,000 patacas.
Coutinho's team also intends that the government guarantees universal and free primary health care for all residents. Still in the context of health care, New Hope wants the conversion of current benefits into multifunctional consumption valleys with the value of 1,000 patacas.
In the form of education, the group suggests the elimination of bribes in public universities for permanent MSAR residents and increasing scholarships and subsidies for students of higher education institutions.
Another proposals is the extension of the maternity leave in the private sector to 98 days, equating it to the current in the interior of China, and the increase of another 15 days of license for each baby from the second.
The elderly are not forgotten by the new hope. The political program of this list calls for the retroactive assignment of 21 thousand patacas regarding the central pension fund not mandatory to the elderly, as well as the increase in pensions to 4,500 patacas, with the payment going from quarterly to monthly. The increase in the subsidy for the elderly to 12 thousand patacas and the reduction of homes for elderly managed by the Institute of Social Action is also required.
When it comes to children, it is requested to increase the subsidy for children to 2,000 patacas per month for children up to 12 years of age and the significant widening of the public offer of day care for children from zero to 3 years.
List 2 does not forget the role of Sino-Lusophone Platform attributed to Macau and, in this context, says that there must be further realization of this purpose of Macao in economic, cultural and commercial cooperation between China and Portuguese-speaking countries, with greater participation of the population and entrepreneurs in particular.
The list linked to the Association of Macao Public Function Workers (ATFPM) also wants to increase subsidies for informal caregivers and single -time families for 8,000 monthly patacas and the guarantee of the right to cumulation of disability pension with the disabled citizens who meet legal requirements of both regimes.
To improve the future of young people, it is suggested to create paid internships in public services, concessionaires and public companies for newly educated young people, as well as the creation of specific plans for young people who make up family, with support in their own lease and housing and the assignment of a credit bonus of 4% to young people and families with financial difficulties to pay bank fees.

List 5, associated with the Macao Workers' Federation of Associations, is concerned about the difficulties of access to employment by residents, so it promises to work on the protection of labor rights and the departure of non -resident workers. It also asks for a consumer and support card for small and medium -sized companies.

The Union for Development presents a political program of candidacy for legislatures that aims to solve employment issues, the work and social security system, as well as the stimulus to the economy.
The current deputies Ella Law and Leong Sun Iok again lead the list linked to the Macao Workers' Federation, which states the dedication to job promotion, “expanding the space for high quality employment” to residents.
List number 5 highlights the unbalanced economic recovery in Macau after the pandemic and the difficulties that residents face to find work, so it ensures the struggle for the implementation of the priority of the use of residents, requiring the government to hire locations as much as possible during the award of public works and services, adhering to the departure mechanism of non-resident workers.
In particular, the list expects a policy that resains administrative and financial sector for residents, namely for young people, as well as requiring an increase in the proportion of local workers among management positions in large companies. It also suggested the introduction of employment subsidies for middle-aged workers and the elderly, and the reinforcement of residents' vocational training.
Its electoral program, in addition, confirms that it will urge the government to review the labor legal framework, in order to optimize work rules including annual vacation, maternity leave and mandatory holidays, but also improve unpaid salaries recovery mechanisms, work safety and health supervision and workers' reform guarantees.
The protection of the rights of gambling industry workers is also concerning the team due to the brief closure of the satellite casinos in Macao by the end of this year, which now have thousands of workers. The list urges the government to closely monitor the potential impact of this case, and assure employees on a “stable continuity” of their employment and that their benefits and remuneration are not affected.
Regarding the welfare of the population, the list requests an increase in the number of vacancies in homes for the elderly, rising the provision of pension to elderly and disability subsidies. It is necessary to improve transport infrastructures to alleviate the difficulties in the daily displacement of residents.
The group ensures that the government will require a new consumer card round to stimulate community economies and relieve the financial pressures of residents.
On the other hand, the development of young people is also part of the list's political program, which wants to reinforce patriotic education to “train young people from a new age” to Macau. For the team, the government must improve the mechanisms of young people participation in public affairs, creating public opinion channels to "increase the confidence and support of residents of the government."
Attention should be paid to the physical and mental well-being of young people, according to the list, by increasing resources attributed to mental health services.
The candidate team says they will still boost reforms in public administration and improve the effectiveness of governance, creating a “efficient and transparent” governance system.
The electoral program also emphasizes the importance of deepening legislative coordination and improving judicial efficiency, hoping to build a legal system “with macao characteristics”. Thus, it intends to reinforce legal awareness with residents, maintaining justice and legal impartiality.

The political program of the number 4 list, which is linked to the community of Jiangmen, is focused on streamlining the local economy and achieving greater integration in cooperation between Macao and Guangdong. The list also ensures support for job access by young people.

The Union of Macau-Guangdong, a candidate for legislative elections, is committed to the future work of streamlining the region's economy and improving the business environment.
With a new combination of elements, Macau-Guangdong Union list 4 is this time headed by Joey Lao, former deputy named Chui Sai On, and Lee Koi Ian, who replace the two current deputies Zheng Anting and Lo Choi In.
The team associated with the Jiangmen community underlines that the political program is “pragmatic”, covering five domains such as economic development, the well-being of the population, macau-Guangdong cooperation, social governance and youth development. According to the list, the electoral program "responds to the need for citizens of all ages" and aims to "make Macau happier."
In the political program, regarding the proposal of concrete measures on economic growth, the list leaves the guarantee of urging the government and large companies to increase the acquisition of products and services offered by small and medium -sized local companies.
The candidate group ensures promoting the transformation and modernization of businesses of traders who exploit activities in non-tourism zones, innovating business operations and increasing the competitiveness of local companies. It also expects to accelerate the diversification of the economy, the mission that the government says has been working over the last few years.
The economy list highlights that it will “comprehensively deepen” cooperation between Macau and Guangdong, reinforcing the links and the integration of the territory with the Chinese province. Thus, it wants Macau to coordinate with Guangdong to jointly attract investments from abroad through collaborative enterprises, encouraging companies in the interior of China to establish international headquarters in Macao to create more high quality job opportunities for young people.
Still on Guangdong, the group defends measures that facilitate residents living on the continent through the implementation of interconnection of government and community services between Macau and Guangdong for these residents.
Regarding employment, the list proposals include the creation of a subsidy regime for the use of young people, recommending the government to pay a monthly subsidy of 5,000 Patacas to the newly elected employers for 18 months for a “better growth and development of young people”.
The team also promises to promote government work, namely the “Working Group for the Coordination of Employment Promotion” to achieve the upward mobility of Macao residents. It is recalled that this working group was created by the present government of Sam Hou Fai and is coordinated by the Secretary for Economics and Finance, Tai Kin IP, with the aim of boosting the guarantee of employment of local residents.
On the other hand, the electoral program emphasizes the need for a comprehensive review of existing social benefits systems, hoping to introduce more resources to assist the elderly, children, disabled and other needy groups, especially increasing the pension of elderly and the subsidy for the elderly.
It considers indispensable to improve traffic networks, medical services, as well as family policies. The list stresses that it is also aware of the safeguarding the rights of civil servants, the protection of the rights of the gaming industry workers, the reinforcement of the capacity of governance and the effectiveness of interdepartal collaboration of public services.
