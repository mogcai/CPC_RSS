President Xi Jinping participated in the opening ceremony of the Meeting and delivered the keynote address entitled “Carrying Forward the Spirit of the Beijing World Conference on Women and Promoting the New and Accelerated Process for Women's All-Round Development”, in which he comprehensively and systematically demonstrated the achievements of Chinese modernization and the cause of women in New Era China, presented China's proposals for accelerating the new process of women's all-round development in light of global trends and announced China's solutions to further support the development of women's global cause. With successful practices and fruitful achievements, China has contributed to the whole world yet another vivid example of “Chinese governance”.
In China, the cause of women has always constituted an important part of the Chinese modernization process. Since its founding in 1921, the Communist Party of China has been committed to women's liberation and gender equality. After the establishment of the People's Republic of China, a series of laws and regulations were enacted that protected women's rights and interests, achieving historic improvements in women's status in terms of education, employment, political participation and marital autonomy. Entering the new era, the CPC Central Committee, with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, has emphasized safeguarding women's legitimate rights and interests, promoting gender equality and women's all-round development as integral components of Chinese modernization. A series of pioneering, general and long-term decisions and plans have been made, and the cause of China's women has made historic achievements and changes. We won the greatest battle against poverty in human history and thus brought moderate prosperity to 690 million women. We have reduced the maternal mortality rate by nearly 80% since 1995 and have joined leading upper-middle-income countries in key maternal and child health indicators. Currently, women represent more than 40% of China's total workforce and more than half of the country's internet startup entrepreneurs. In the new era, Chinese women, more confident and vibrant, participate in the entire governance process of the country and society. The cause of women in China has enjoyed wider development spaces and more promising prospects than ever before.
After his return to his homeland, Macau experienced a golden age in the development of women's causes. The educational level, labor market participation, industrial coverage, professional level and income of women in Macau have improved significantly. With great courage and enthusiasm, Women have made significant contributions in all spheres of life, supporting half the sky for the development of Macau. Since 2008, the Macau General Women's Association obtained special consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council, thus being officially qualified by the United Nations to assist in international affairs and, since then, it has participated in the sessions of the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) for 15 consecutive years. Macau has already become an indispensable force in telling the stories of China and Macau's successful practice of “one country, two systems” among the international community.
China has given firm support and active contribution to the development of the global cause of women. As President Xi Jinping has highlighted, women play an important role in the creation, promotion and development of human civilization, and the international community has a shared responsibility to advance the cause of women. China upholds the vision of building a community with a shared future for humanity and has transformed the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative, the Global Civilization Initiative and the Global Governance Initiative into concrete actions to promote the all-round development of women, so as to actively provide opportunities and support for the global cause of women through their development. China actively participates in global governance in the field of women, supports the United Nations in prioritizing women's work, creates the Prize for the Education of Girls and Women in partnership with UNESCO and has announced three donations of 10 million dollars to UN Women. In the face of global challenges, China has sent more than 1,200 female officers and military personnel to participate in UN peacekeeping operations, providing humanitarian assistance to women and children affected by conflicts and disasters. China has been deepening global exchanges and cooperation between women, maintaining friendly relations with women's organizations and institutions in more than 140 countries, implementing projects worth more than 40 million dollars in the women's sector in more than 20 countries, cultivating more than 200,000 female talents in more than 180 countries and regions, and providing assistance for women's employment in more than 100 countries. The development of women's cause in China has provided a referenceable Chinese solution to the global women's cause, which is widely recognized and praised by the international community.
Renewing our dedication to the purpose of the Beijing World Conference on Women and joining forces to create a better future for the advancement of the global cause of women. Globally, gender-based violence, digital inequality and the shadow of war and conflict still persist. Looking to the future, we must renew ourselves in support of the purpose of the Beijing World Conference on Women to build greater consensus, expand the paths forward and take more concrete measures, with the aim of accelerating the new process of women's integral development. President Xi Jinping, at the height of the progress of human civilization and the peaceful development of the world, with a global vision and sense of responsibility as the leader of a great country, proposed four suggestions for the global cause of women, which are: “jointly promote an environment conducive to the growth and development of women”, “jointly cultivate a vigorous drive for high-quality development of the cause of women”, “jointly build governance structures to protect the rights and interests of women” and “together write a new chapter in promoting global cooperation for women”. A series of new measures taken by China to support the development of the global women's cause were also announced. China is willing to work with all countries in the world to overcome global challenges with action-oriented vision, accelerate the new process of women's comprehensive development with unity, confidence, courage and practice, push forward the construction of a fairer and more reasonable global governance system, and join forces to move towards a community with a shared future for humanity.
With a shared destiny and hand in hand, women will move towards a promising future. As an active and firm supporter of global cooperation in the cause of women, China will continue to work with all countries to take accelerated actions to write a new chapter in the process of women's integral development!</description><pubDate>2025-10-22 22:54:13</pubDate></item><item><title>Timorese parties satisfied with membership of ASEAN, opposition warns about the economic sector</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/10/22/partidos-timorenses-satisfeitos-com-adesao-a-asean-oposicao-adverte-para-o-sector-economico/</link><description>The five Timorese parties with parliamentary seats expressed satisfaction with Timor-Leste's accession to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), a “national interest”, but the opposition warned of the need to continue strengthening the economic sector.

“Timor-Leste’s accession to ASEAN has been a national interest since the struggle for self-determination, between 1974 and 1975”, Lídia Norberta, deputy of the Revolutionary Front of Independent Timor-Leste (Fretilin), told Lusa.
The deputy highlighted that Fretilin has always supported the process through legislative discussions in parliament, but argued that it is necessary to take into account certain situations that require prudence, namely those of an economic nature and competitiveness in the market. “We hope that, even by joining ASEAN, the Government will create all the conditions, especially in the economic sector, so that our economy does not depend on the outside world”, stated Lídia Norberta.
For her part, Democratic Party (PD) deputy Maria Teresa Gusmão expressed her great satisfaction at the fact that the process had finally been completed and Timor-Leste had become a member of ASEAN. "It was a long and difficult struggle. The process of registration and accession to ASEAN was not at all easy, due to the existing legal and regulatory requirements", said the deputy from the Government bench.
Deputy Patrocínio Fernandes, from the National Congress for Timorese Reconstruction (CNRT, in power), highlighted that membership represents a major step forward for diplomacy and international and regional cooperation in Timor-Leste. “We think that this participation will bring new hopes to Timor-Leste, contributing to economic development and allowing for greater integration of the country into international markets”, declared the deputy.
On a political level, he added, membership “will strengthen Timor-Leste's diplomatic relations with many countries, especially with the large groups in Southeast Asia and ASEAN itself, allowing a better contribution to peace and unity in the region”.
The deputy of Klibur Halibur Nasional Timor Oan (KHUNTO), Luís Roberto, said that the expectation is that accession “will serve to consolidate political stability”, stressing that the “key to development is peace and stability”. "Becoming a full member of ASEAN will bring greater circulation of people and foreign capital, and a more dynamic economy. Therefore, we need to create appropriate laws that offer good protection", said Luís Roberto, adding that the success of membership belongs to everyone.
The vice-president of the Popular Liberation Party (PLP), Hélder Freitas, known as “Kamarudin”, stated that Timor-Leste must be united and must also “prepare the economy to compete with other countries”.
Timor-Leste will become the 11th member state of ASEAN on Sunday, during the summit of heads of state and government of this Southeast Asian organization, which will take place in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, 14 years after submitting its application for admission.
ASEAN was created in 1967 by Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia and the Philippines, and was later joined by Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam.

BNU and the architects at Impromptu Projects speak of a “point of pride for both institutions” and highlight the project’s commitment to “redefining the banking experience for the digital age”.

The headquarters building of Banco Nacional Ultramarino (BNU) was once again distinguished with international design awards, more than two years after the completion of the renovation project for the banking institution's central branch. The three new distinctions from the German Design Awards, the MUSE Design Awards and the Architizer Plus Awards thus join an honorable mention already awarded in 2023 by Architecture Masterprize, when the space reopens.
The BNU central agency, located on Avenida Almeida Ribeiro, has almost a hundred years of existence, history and architectural interest. The original two-story building, opened in 1926, was added in 1997 by the construction of a modern structure whose facade resembles the mast of a caravel, representing the Portuguese spirit and the bank's multicultural approach.
The “holistic renovation” completed in 2023 was driven by the need to create a wider, more dynamic and modern space, as BNU explains in a statement. “The world is changing, and so is the banking sector”, highlights the institution. “In today’s digital era, banks, like many other organizations, need to reinvent themselves.”
Still, the tradition and preservation of the bank’s history – and that of Macau – have not been forgotten. The renovation of the space, carried out in collaboration with Impromptu Projects, did not forget the symbolism of the caravel, “echoing the traditional wooden hulls through special white profiles that unify the entire design of the atrium”. The project was also designed to reflect a “hybrid experience” for customers, providing a fusion of digital technology typical of the banking sector with the “human skills” of employees.
According to the statement, another of the main objectives of the renovation project was to “maximize the amount of natural light in the building”, making use of the large windows on the facade, the skylight and the glass doors. Furthermore, “the project also improves the visual dialogue between private and public spaces”, creating an impression that “the bank’s energy flows with and for people”. The same concept is applied in geometric terms, in which the generator is based on the “center of the curved plan to generate concentric radiating lines that extend towards the outer limit of the facade”, visually and physically connecting the ‘back office’ with the customer service area.
The agency's reopening ceremony took place in April 2023, the same year in which the project received an honorable mention from the Architecture Masterprize. More than two years later, Impromptu Projects is once again installing a new awards panel at the BNU headquarters, made up of the most recent distinctions from the German Design Awards, the MUSE Design Awards and the Architizer Plus Awards.
BNU and Impromptu's architects recognize that “this milestone is a source of pride for both institutions” and an opportunity for the transformation of the headquarters to be presented to a wider audience. “These honors celebrate the project’s commitment to combining cultural heritage with innovative design, redefining the banking experience for the digital age.”
The German Design Awards awarded the BNU headquarters an award for “Excellent Architecture”, praising the combination between “the company's traditional character and modern aesthetics” and the “harmonious symbiosis between cultural heritage and progress, making the space dynamic and inviting”.
The MUSE Design Awards silver award in the “Conceptual Design – Banking” category describes BNU’s refreshed look as “a spectacular design that has proven to be a superlative symbol throughout the industry”. “We determined that [this] design is the best on the market, as its impeccable concepts and innovations are timeless in every aspect”, praised the panel of judges.
In turn, the Architizer Plus Awards highlighted BNU in the “Architecture + Branding” category, citing the “project’s ability to integrate the brand’s identity and strategic message into its architectural language” and to use design to “communicate values ​​in a powerful way and create memorable experiences for clients”.</description><pubDate>2025-10-22 22:56:25</pubDate></item><item><title>Pyongyang launches several missiles on the eve of Trump's visit to South Korea</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/10/22/pyongyang-lanca-varios-misseis-em-vesperas-de-visita-de-trump-a-coreia-do-sul/</link><description>North Korea yesterday launched several short-range ballistic missiles, in the first test since the inauguration of South Korean President Lee Jae-myung, and a week before the visit of North American President Donald Trump to South Korea. “The Army detected today, at around 08:10 local time, the launch of several short-range ballistic missiles from the Jungwha area, in the province of North Hwanghae,” South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) announced in a statement.
According to the same text, the missiles were launched to the northeast, apparently towards the Sea of ​​Japan, known as the East Sea in both Koreas, and South Korean and American authorities are carrying out an analysis of exact specifications. In previous information, the JCS had reported that at least one missile had been launched by the North Korean army yesterday.
The launch of these missiles takes place a week before Trump's scheduled visit to South Korea, as part of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum events.
Various reports indicate that the US President will visit the South Korean city of Gyeongju on Wednesday next week, where he may spend the night.
The possibility of Trump holding a summit with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, has also been put forward, which, if this takes place, will have as its context the strengthening of ties between Beijing and Pyongyang, marked by the presence of North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, in an important military parade in China in early September.
This was also the first missile test by North Korea since the inauguration of South Korea's new leader in early June.
Inter-Korean communication channels have remained cut off since 2022, and Pyongyang has repeatedly rejected calls from Lee Jae-myung's administration to reopen dialogue.
Pyongyang's last similar missile launch occurred in May, the month in which it launched a short-range ballistic missile on the 8th, and several cruise missiles on the 22nd, in both cases also over waters in the Sea of ​​Japan.</description><pubDate>2025-10-22 22:41:57</pubDate></item><item><title>China expects EU to “support free trade” and “oppose protectionism”</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/10/22/china-espera-que-ue-apoie-o-livre-comercio-e-se-oponha-ao-protecionismo/</link><description>China yesterday said it expected the European Union to “support free trade” and “oppose protectionism”, after Chinese Commerce Minister Wang Wentao and European Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic spoke by phone. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun declared, at a press conference, that “the essence of economic and trade relations between China and the EU lies in complementarity and mutual benefit”. Guo conveyed his wish that “the EU will fulfill its commitment to support free trade and oppose trade protectionism, and provide a fair, transparent and non-discriminatory business environment for companies in all countries”. According to the spokesperson, China expects the 27 “to adopt concrete measures to defend the market economy and the standards of the World Trade Organization [WTO]” and “persist in the adequate resolution of trade differences through dialogue”.
During the call, Sefcovic invited Chinese authorities to visit Brussels to seek “urgent solutions” to the export controls on rare earths imposed by Beijing, measures that the EU considers “unfair”. The European Trade Commissioner explained that the Chinese minister accepted the invitation from the community executive to address the issue in the “next few days” in the Belgian capital, a visit that has not yet been confirmed by the Chinese authorities. “After this morning’s conversation, we have no interest in escalation, but the situation casts a shadow on our relationship, so a quick resolution is essential,” said the European Commissioner. Sefcovic, who classified the discussion as “constructive”, recalled that Brussels considers that the increase in Chinese controls on exports since April is “unjustified and harmful” and damages the bilateral relationship between both parties, while at the same time going against attempts to achieve more stable and reliable trade. The European Commissioner discussed with Wang the ban on the company Nexperia from exporting semiconductors produced in its factory in China, following the decision by the Netherlands to intervene in the company to prevent the transfer of knowledge to China by the company, which was founded in the Netherlands, but in 2019 was acquired by a Chinese group. In this sense, he said that both parties have communicated to him their intention to “resolve the situation and work towards a practical agreement that restores supply chains, provides much-needed certainty and avoids global production stoppages”.</description><pubDate>2025-10-22 22:40:42</pubDate></item><item><title>Institute of European Studies celebrates 30 years</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/10/22/instituto-de-estudos-europeus-comemora-30-anos/</link><description>The Macau Institute of European Studies (IEEM) today celebrates 30 years since its founding with a hybrid event – ​​online and in-person – at its headquarters, on Calçada do Gaio.
The institute was created in 1995 with the aim of “facilitating knowledge, dialogue and understanding between Chinese and European cultures through various types of international conferences, activities and training programs”, recalls the IEEM in a press release released yesterday.
The organization and the University of Macau have jointly offered the master's program in European Studies since 1997, resulting in the graduation of more than four hundred graduates specialized in this area of ​​studies on the integration process in Europe. The Intellectual Property Law and International Trade and Investment Law Academy conferences have been held since 2000.
According to the organization, the Asia-Pacific Conference of the European Union Studies Association and the first edition of the Academy for Sustainable Development and Green Transitions were “successfully concluded” between June and December. In the press release, IEEM also says that the Macau European Union Model, started in 2013, will also launch its new edition on October 26, 2025.
In recent years, IEEM has also offered language courses, weekend lectures on the culture, history and architecture of Macau, as well as academic seminars and workshops on contemporary international issues related to China and Europe, such as the annual conferences on Multiple Modernities, held since 2016. “The institute also promotes publications and research projects on international relations, economics, law and other matters”, highlights the institute.
Finally, highlights the IEEM, Creative Macau “has served the local artistic and creative communities for 23 years, facilitating the development of Macau’s creative sector and its economic diversification”.</description><pubDate>2025-10-22 22:50:08</pubDate></item><item><title>Japan's new prime minister will create “economic program” to tackle inflation</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/10/22/nova-primeira-ministra-do-japao-vai-criar-programa-economico-para-enfrentar-inflacao/</link><description>The new Prime Minister of Japan, Sanae Takaichi, announced yesterday, in her first press conference after being appointed head of the Government, that she will develop an “economic program” to face rising prices.

Admitting that her mandate will be difficult, Sanae Takaichi stated that the Government's “priority” will be to help the Japanese people deal with inflation and called for political stability to mitigate the impact of rising prices. “The most urgent challenge will be to mitigate the impact of rising prices in a context of stagnation or real decline in wages”, which led citizens to reduce their standard of living, he argued.
Conservative and leader of the toughest ideological wing of the Liberal Democratic Party (PLD), Takaichi is considered the ideological heir of the assassinated former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, having always praised her mentor's economic options.
The economic policies advocated by Abe during his second term as prime minister (2012-2020) were based on aggressive monetary easing, fiscal stimulus and structural reforms.
Japan's economic situation presents increases in consumer prices above the 2% target predicted by the Bank of Japan, which is why the central bank has been increasing interest rates that were, for several years, close to or below zero. Low rates led the Japanese yen to remain devalued against the dollar, deepening inflation, since much of what Japan consumes is imported. On the other hand, Japanese salaries remain close to the level they were 30 years ago.
Repeating many of the promises made by his predecessors, Takaichi also promised to increase salaries, without, however, explaining how.
Japan's population has been declining and aging rapidly for years, leading to labor shortages and undermining the country's economic growth potential.
Although she is a staunch conservative on most social issues, Takaichi stated that she is in favor of granting tax incentives to companies that offer daycare centers to their employees and possible tax exemptions for family daycare expenses.
As for foreign policy, the new prime minister said she intends to take relations with the United States to “new heights” during her meeting with US President Donald Trump, scheduled for the beginning of next week.
Trump is expected to arrive in Tokyo next Monday for a three-day visit, during which Takaichi will discuss bilateral issues, as well as the situation in the Indo-Pacific, the war in Ukraine and tensions in the Middle East.
The prime minister did not specify, however, whether she will discuss with Trump the issue of US customs duties or the trade agreement with Washington, after declaring, following her election to head the ruling party in early October, that she would not rule out a review of the pact with the United States if it does not serve Japan's interests. “We will do our best to alleviate the impact of US tariffs,” she said. today Takaichi.
Tokyo and Washington reached a trade agreement in July, after months of negotiations, according to which the Asian country must pay tariffs of 15% and invest US$550 billion in the United States.
The conservative, who made history by becoming the first woman to head the Government of Japan, also confirmed that she will participate in the ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) summit, which will take place in Malaysia from October 26th to 28th, and in the APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) summit, from October 31st to November 1st, in South Korea.

The Chief Executive guaranteed that the Macao SAR Government “will continue to defend the impartiality of the judiciary”.

The XIII Conference of the Forum of Presidents of the Supreme Courts of Justice of Portuguese-speaking Countries and Territories, which this year took place in Macau, ended on Tuesday. The Chief Executive then met with those responsible for the participating delegations and took the opportunity to highlight the implementation of the “one country, two systems” principle in the Macao SAR.
According to a statement released yesterday by the Government, Sam Hou Fai stated that the Macao SAR “has consistently implemented the principle of ‘one country, two systems’, following the continental legal system and solidly promoting the development of the economy, well-being, social affairs and culture”.
In the opinion of the Chief Executive, “the successful implementation of ‘one country, two systems’ acts as a robust safeguard for judicial independence” and also guarantees that the Macao SAR Government “will continue to defend the impartiality of the judiciary, improve the judicial system, improve the facilities and human resources of judicial bodies, to increase their efficiency”.
The Chief also said that “Macau will continue to promote the development of adequate diversification of the economy, constantly boosting the stable growth of society”.
Sam also promised that “Macau will continue to take advantage of its advantages as a Sino-Portuguese-speaking platform to deepen ties and cooperation with the judicial bodies of Portuguese-speaking countries and territories, with which it will promote closer ties between people, safeguarding judicial independence and impartiality, in order to provide a strong guarantee in favor of socio-economic development and promote continuous progress in judicial work”.

LEGAL ORDER IS A “CATALYST FOR PROMOTING STABILITY”

During the conference, Song Man Lei, President of the Court of Final Appeal (TUI) stated that the legal order is “above all a vehicle, if not a catalyst for promoting stability, understanding, trust, peace and prosperity”. “The specificities and uniqueness of each of the legal systems of Portuguese-speaking countries and territories demonstrate that we always have so much to learn from each other’s experiences”, stated the president of the TUI, quoted in the Government note.
TUI judge José Maria Dias Azedo said, at the conference, that Law must “respond to global problems such as social transformations and poverty”, and “justice must have human rights and social inclusion as its core”.
Pedro Nazaré Pascoal, Judge of the Supreme Court of Justice of Angola, pointed out that his country is promoting judicial modernization, at the same time as it faces challenges, such as procedural slowness and the unequal distribution of regional judicial resources. The judge took advantage of the conference to call for the strengthening of regional legal cooperation and the training of qualified professionals.
Benfeito Mosso Ramos, President of the Supreme Court of Cape Verde, stressed that “law must be based on ethics and human dignity” in order to prevent it from becoming a “mere instrument of power”. “Law must serve as a bridge for intercultural dialogue, seeking a common understanding of universal values ​​and human rights in a diverse world”, he stressed.
Adelino Manuel Muchanga, President of the Supreme Court of Mozambique, stated that Justice should not be “confined by international borders”. At this conference, it was decided that the next edition will be organized precisely in Mozambique.
João Cura Mariano, President of the Supreme Court of Justice of Portugal, said that Law and Justice “arise not only as instruments of social regulation, but also as a common language to promote rapprochement between peoples and peace”. “Judges must be agents of rapprochement between different cultures, and judicial institutions must reinforce international cooperation, to jointly face the new challenges brought by globalization”, shared the Portuguese.
In turn, Edson Jordão da Silva, judge of the Court of First Instance of S. Tomé and Príncipe, pointed out that “Law is an essential instrument for achieving social justice and equal access to education, and inclusive development must be promoted through the teaching of Law and trust in institutions”.
Afonso Carmona, President of the Court of Appeal of Timor-Leste, argued that “Law is a shared language that goes beyond cultural and political differences, contributing decisively to rapprochement and fair development”. Finally, Herman Benjamin, President of the Superior Court of Justice of Brazil, was not in person in Macau, but, through video, highlighted the cooperation and training in the judicial area between Brazil and China.</description><pubDate>2025-10-22 23:00:04</pubDate></item><item><title>Alvin Chau Properties in NAPE Listed for Judicial Sale</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/10/22/propriedades-de-alvin-chau-no-nape-listadas-em-venda-judicial/</link><description>A total of 16 properties owned by former junket tycoon Alvin Chau have now been put up for judicial sale. All are offices in the NAPE area, in the China Civil Plaza building, whose total minimum sales value is set at 117 million patacas. This was not the first judicial sale of properties owned by Alvin Chau, who is currently in prison, following auctions of his properties in Taipa over the past two years.

More properties owned by Alvin Chau are listed in the judicial sale process. The former junk tycoon and founder of the now-defunct Suncity Group, who is serving a prison sentence in Coloane, now sees 16 of his properties ready for auction at the Base Judicial Court, with a combined sale price of around 117 million patacas.
The list of assets in the ordinary execution was published on the Macau courts' electronic portal, according to which the properties comprise 16 units located on the 12th floor of the China Civil Plaza building, in the NAPE area. The sale will be carried out using closed letter proposals.
The information released by the court shows that the properties are all autonomous units intended for office use, located between Avenida Sir Anders Ljungstedt, Rua Cidade de Coimbra, Rua Francisco H. Fernandes and Alameda Dr. Carlos D’ Assumpção, with the units representing the former headquarters of the Suncity Group. The base sale value of each property varies between 4.305 million patacas and 10.49 million patacas.
According to the process, the defendant, in addition to Alvin Chau, is also Companhia de Investimento e Desenvolvimento Chong Kai Limitada, while the defendant is the company Limpeza Solar Sociedade Unipessoal Limitada. The deadline for submitting proposals will be on November 6th, at 5:45 pm, and the sale will take place the following day on the 5th floor of Macau Square.
This is not the first time that Alvin Chau's assets have been put up for auction by the court. In July 2023, the real estate of Chau and Grupo Tai Tak Lei Limitada was up for auction, involving five commercial units and 31 parking spaces located in the César Fortune building, in Taipa, between Estrada Coronel Nicolau de Mesquita and Beco da Pérola. In this sale, the minimum accumulated value was approximately 600 million patacas.
The aforementioned judicial sale was unsuccessful, and the court repeated the process in February last year, with the same price. And, five months later, among the 36 properties, 34 were put up for sale again, but the auction price was lower than the previous one, with a total value of around 300 million patacas.
It is recalled that Alvin Chau was arrested in 2021 and sentenced to prison in 2023 for crimes of illicit gambling, side betting, telephone and online gambling. In July last year, the Court of Final Instance confirmed Chau's 18-year prison sentence, dismissing the appeals filed.
The businessman and eight others convicted in the same case were also ordered to pay the Macao SAR Government almost 24.87 billion Hong Kong dollars in compensation for having pocketed winnings from illegal gambling operations.</description><pubDate>2025-10-22 22:57:09</pubDate></item><item><title>The São Januário team performed three highly difficult scoliosis surgeries</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/10/22/equipa-do-sao-januario-realizou-tres-cirurgias-de-escoliose-de-alta-dificuldade/</link><description>A medical team from Centro Hospitalar Conde de São Januário (CHCSJ) carried out, in collaboration with specialists from Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, three highly difficult scoliosis surgeries on patients in Macau, the Health Services reported, adding that the patients' recovery is progressing stably.
“The three highly difficult scoliosis surgeries were completed successfully, which not only brought hope that patients and their families would return to a healthy life, but also helped CHCSJ to improve diagnostic techniques and surgical therapy for scoliosis”, say the Health Services in a press release shared yesterday, adding that, “in the future, the medical team at the Orthopedics Service will continue to deepen cooperation with hospitals in mainland China, with the aim of raising the level of specialized medical services.”
The authorities explain that, before the surgeries, the medical team from the Orthopedics Service, together with the anesthesiology, nursing and neural surveillance team, carried out a comprehensive assessment of three patients, and prepared a detailed surgery plan, including the precise measurement of the scoliosis angle, the correct surgical methods, the organization of subsequent nursing care and medical follow-up, among others. others. During surgeries, these medical teams used the neural function surveillance technique to progressively monitor the spinal cord. This can significantly improve the safety of surgeries. “After the surgeries, the patients’ scoliosis angles were significantly improved, and one of the patients had an increase in height of around five centimeters”, highlight the Health Services.
Scoliosis is considered the third most common disease among children and adolescents in rural China. Its typical characteristic is the deviation of the spine in relation to the midline, forming an S or C curvature, and often accompanied by vertebral rotation, resulting in an abnormal appearance, such as uneven shoulders, pelvic tilt and hunchback. In severe cases, this disease can affect the physical development and function of the heart and lungs.</description><pubDate>2025-10-22 22:53:28</pubDate></item><item><title>“The Prisons of North Burma”: Lu Nan’s work highlighted at Ocher Space</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/10/22/as-prisoes-do-norte-da-birmania-obra-de-lu-nan-em-destaque-na-ochre-space/</link><description>The work of Lu Nan, one of the greatest contemporary Chinese photographers, will be on display at the Lisbon gallery Ocher Space until November 29th. The opening is scheduled for today, starting at 6:30 pm, with free entry.
The exhibition presents 63 analogue photographs produced by the artist as part of the “Prisons of North Burma” project, from 2006, in which he captured the reality of prisons in northern Burma (currently known as Myanmar) and the suffering of inmates affected by drug trafficking in the region. “The images are harsh, but never cruel”, writes the exhibition’s curator and founder of the cultural space, João Miguel Barros, in a brochure about the exhibition. "[We see] men in chains, bodies marked by dependence, empty looks. But also moments of care, of sharing, of humanity."
In addition to Lu Nan's photographic work, visitors will also be able to watch a 28-minute video about the “Trilogy” project, dedicated to reflecting on the human condition. In addition to “Prisons of North Burma”, the trilogy also includes the chapters “The Forgotten People”, about patients in psychiatric hospitals in the interior of China, and “On The Road”, a study on the daily life and relationship with the spirituality of Tibetan peasants.
Lu Nan is one of the most prestigious Chinese photographers locally and internationally, with a portfolio marked by the representation of marginalized communities and an “uncomfortable, humanistic and aesthetically rigorous look at society”, as João Miguel Barros describes. "Lu Nan's work is, therefore, a rare synthesis between ethics, aesthetics and spirituality. He does not offer us images to consume – he offers us images to contemplate. To listen. To find. At a time when looking has become superficial and accelerated, Lu Nan invites us to see deeply. His photography is, ultimately, a spiritual practice – a way of being in the world with responsibility, with presence and with respect", reads the brochure.
The exhibition can be visited from Wednesday to Saturday, from 3pm to 6:30pm, until November 29th.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Lusofonia Festival starts tomorrow at Casas da Taipa</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/10/22/festival-da-lusofonia-arranca-amanha-nas-casas-da-taipa/</link><description>The new edition of the Lusofonia Festival is about to bring two more consecutive weekends of concerts, activities and cultural exchange to Macau.

Chan Tsz King also warned of the importance of integrity and self-discipline of the security team to avoid an impact on society's trust in the rule of law.
The authorities once again highlighted the defense of national security as a priority, considering that their work is “inseparable” from maintaining order and security in Macau. Chan Tsz King, Secretary for Security who took office a week ago, appealed to the team to dedicate themselves to safeguarding the essential values ​​of the security forces, including patriotism.
Chan Tsz King had his first working meeting with the management and leadership of the security department on Monday, where he “transmitted the concept of governance” and discussed the planning of future work, according to a note released by his office.
At the meeting, the secretary highlighted that the defense of national security is the “main mission” of the work and that “no margin for error is allowed”, justifying that the circumstances of national security have become complex and challenging in light of the international situation.
In this case, Chan Tsz King said that the team must review its initial objective of joining the security forces and strive to protect its essential values, such as “love for the country, love for Macau, loyalty, obedience, honesty and integrity”, as well as “cultivating a positive, disciplined institutional image that dares to take responsibility and deserves the trust of citizens”.
Chan Tsz King took the opportunity to also remind the team about the importance of integrity and self-discipline, warning leaders and managers to be clearly aware of their own powers in hand, to act in accordance with the law, in the interests of the population and in a prudent manner.
“The practice of criminal acts by law enforcers undermines public expectations about the legal order and seriously affects society’s confidence in the rule of law”, he warned. The secretary admitted the importance of creating a mechanism to prevent corruption, but added that it is essential for the team to always keep an awareness of integrity in mind, and that directors and managers must serve as an example in this matter.
It is recalled that the then Secretary for Security, Wong Sio Chak, who is the current Secretary for Administration and Justice, established the mechanism for publishing, on the office's electronic portal, cases of violations of the law and discipline by the security forces team. Since the beginning of this year, four cases of violation of the law by agents and employees of the Services have been detected, including cases of alleged falsification of attendance records, abuse of power, among others. Over the past year there were nine cases, six of which are still being monitored.
At the new secretary's meeting, Chan Tsz King asked directors and managers to be honest managers, in addition to always taking into account the general situation, as well as understanding the situation of subordinates. He said that managers and managers must take the initiative to communicate with frontline staff and carry out reviews of past guidelines and working models that are out of date. “When dealing with any matter, the rules must be clear and the standards must be unanimous,” he highlighted. Chan Tsz King also hopes that managers and managers will take advantage of all means to mobilize the initiative and enthusiasm of staff and listen to the situations faced by subordinates in their work to “bring together the collective will and strength of the team”.
Chan Tsz King, in this case, revealed that he will plan visits to all security services, in order to understand the concrete work situation of the teams.</description><pubDate>2025-10-22 22:59:25</pubDate></item><item><title>China reaffirms cooperation with Airbus</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/10/22/china-reafirma-cooperacao-com-a-airbus/</link><description>The Chinese Minister of Commerce met in Beijing with the executive president of Airbus to strengthen cooperation with the company and guarantee the stability of industrial chains. During the meeting, Wang Wentao called on Airbus to take advantage of the entry into operation of the second assembly line for the A320 model in Tianjin, in order to deepen cooperation and expand the supply of products and services in the country.

Chinese Commerce Minister Wang Wentao met in Beijing with the executive president of Airbus, Guillaume Faury, to strengthen cooperation with the company and ensure the stability of industrial chains, his ministry said yesterday.
During the meeting, held on Tuesday, Wang called on Airbus to take advantage of the entry into operation of the second assembly line for the A320 model in Tianjin, in northern China, in order to deepen cooperation with the Asian country and expand the offer of products and services in the country.
The government official assured that the ministry “will continue to promote the resolution of problems and concerns” that the company may face in local operations, and will work to “maintain the stability of global industrial and supply chains”.
Faury expressed “complete confidence” in the Chinese economy and the development of civil aviation in the country, stressing that the new unit in Tianjin “provides favorable conditions for deepening industrial collaboration”.
The meeting takes place in a context of rapprochement between Beijing and the main European economies, after several years of trade tensions.
Airbus has maintained a consolidated presence in China since 2008, when it opened the first single-aisle aircraft assembly line in Tianjin.
In 2024, the first global aircraft life cycle service center also opened in Chengdu, with an investment of 6 billion yuan.
After addressing operational and investment issues, Wang framed the meeting within China's economic opening strategy, stressing that the Chinese market “maintains constant expansion” and is currently the second largest in the world in terms of consumption and imports.
He added that the country will continue to promote a favorable environment for foreign companies and defend the stability of global supply chains in the face of increasing protectionism.
In recent months, the Chinese Government has reiterated its intention to attract foreign capital and reinforce industrial cooperation with Europe, especially in high-technology and civil aviation sectors, at a time when North American Boeing is trying to regain share in the Asian market after years of restrictions and vetoes.
Airbus is currently the main supplier of aircraft to China, which, in parallel, seeks to reduce its external dependence with the development of the C919 commercial aircraft, produced by the state-owned COMAC.

The Macao SAR Secretary for Economy and Finance highlighted the importance of the role attributed to Macau as a Sino-Lusophone platform and stated that the region has been raising the level of friendly relations between China and Portuguese-speaking countries to “new levels”.
 
The opening ceremony of the Round Table of SMEs from China and Portuguese-Speaking Countries took place yesterday, an event on the sidelines of the 2nd China–Portuguese-Speaking Countries Economic and Commercial Exhibition (Macau). Tai Kin Ip, Secretary for Economy and Finance, spoke at the event to highlight Macau's role as a Sino-Lusophone platform.
“Macau, as a ‘precision interlocutor’ between China and Portuguese-speaking countries, can play a fundamental role, in terms of precise connection between markets, companies and resources of the parties involved”, stated the official, adding that the region must “proactively” implement the Central Government’s guidelines and improve the functions of a Service Platform for Commercial Cooperation between China and Portuguese-speaking Countries.
Tai Kin Ip also pointed out that, through the organization of various forums, conferences and exchange activities in the Sino-Lusophone sphere, “Macau has been constantly promoting the raising of the level of friendly relations between China and Portuguese-speaking countries to new heights”.
This Round Table of SMEs from China and Portuguese-speaking Countries represents “a vivid demonstration of the role of ‘precision interlocutor’ that Macau plays”, he reiterated.
The secretary defended that small and medium-sized companies play “a fundamental role in promoting innovation and economic development”. “Over the years, mainland China, the Macao SAR and Portuguese-speaking countries have proactively promoted reinforced exchanges between SMEs, either through the holding of the Entrepreneurs' Meeting for Economic and Commercial Cooperation between China and Portuguese-speaking Countries in different Portuguese-speaking countries, or through the regular organization of various training courses in Macau”, he highlighted. These initiatives “allow participants to have a deeper understanding of investment opportunities within China, the needs of Portuguese-speaking markets and the unique advantages of Macau's role as a platform, contributing to continuously raising Sino-Lusophone economic and commercial cooperation to broader and deeper levels”, said Tai Kin Ip.
The secretary also guaranteed that the Government “will continue to enrich the content and reinforce the functions of the Sino-Lusophone platform”. In addition, it will take “proactive measures to support companies from Portuguese-speaking countries to take advantage of the great opportunities arising from the construction of the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area and the Guangdong-Macao In-depth Cooperation Zone in Hengqin”.
The Macau platform can “facilitate the entry of Portuguese-speaking companies into the mainland Chinese market, finding suitable partners and realizing complementarity of advantages”, and, on the other hand, “promote the joint internationalization of the mainland Chinese and Macau sectors, exploring foreign markets and realizing the sharing of resources”, explained Tai. The objective is to “provide solid support and new dynamism for comprehensive and mutually beneficial Sino-Lusophone cooperation”, he concluded.</description><pubDate>2025-10-22 22:57:56</pubDate></item><item><title>Entry of Portuguese agricultural products into China faces difficulties, says Secretary of State</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/10/22/entrada-de-produtos-agricolas-portugueses-na-china-enfrenta-dificuldades-diz-secretario-de-estado/</link><description>The Secretary of State for Agriculture indicated yesterday, in Macau, that Portugal has excellent products and a “very significant interest” in the Chinese market, although it faces adversities that limit entry into the Asian country.

“The difficulties are many, many times, in terms of diplomatic relations, exports, imports – some adjustments that need to be made”, admitted to journalists João Moura, who is in Macau representing the Government at the 30th Macau International Fair (MIF) and the 2nd China–Portuguese Speaking Countries Economic and Commercial Exhibition (C-PLPEX), which are taking place simultaneously.
In parallel, the China-Portuguese Speaking Countries International Agricultural Expo is organized for the first time. These events, the person responsible highlighted, are “a great window of opportunity” to smooth out “some rough edges”. “We are in an interpretation that is often differentiated between markets as different as Portugal and China, in which food analysis and control have their differences, have their valences and, therefore, there is nothing better than talking, sitting at the table to try to overcome some of these difficulties and adversities”, he added.
Portugal, said the Secretary of State, has “several ideas” and “several products with great potential”, namely dried fruits, pork, olive oil and wine. “We have a lot of opportunity for Portuguese products that are widely accepted in China,” he said. “We have products with great export capacity, with great worldwide acceptance and, therefore, the Chinese market is a market that is of very significant interest to us, he stated.
In the opposite direction, he declared that he felt in Macau “a great interest from China” in Portugal, not only in terms of exports, but also with regard to the “internationalization of some Chinese companies”.
Companies in the field of technology, machinery or equipment in the area of ​​agriculture, said João Moura, without providing additional details about these companies. “They are very interested in the development of some sectors of our agriculture and we welcome them with open arms”, he concluded.
In a speech given during the Round Table of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises in China and Portuguese-Speaking Countries, the Portuguese representative highlighted the “crucial role” of Macau as a connection platform, noting that the geographical and cultural position of the territory makes it “a point of convergence between East and West”, facilitating trade and investment. "In turn, Portugal has, in the global context, a strategic position that connects the Eastern world and the American continent, without forgetting the African continent. These more agile and integrative platforms encourage and provide commercial exchanges and the growth of new companies", he said.
A survey published in May this year by the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China concluded that European companies are cutting costs and reducing investment plans in the Asian country, as the economy slows down and fierce competition drives down prices. “Faced with a series of challenges – including the persistence of regulatory and market access barriers, increased geopolitical tensions, price deflation, low domestic consumption and reduced margins – Chamber members’ optimism regarding short and medium-term prospects is now at a historically low level”, reads the report accompanying the results of the survey.
