"The biggest positive factor for Macao would be if the Chinese economy grew and consumer confidence levels improve," said Vitaly Umnsky, analyst at the Seaport Research Partners consultancy company.
More than 70% of the people who visited the territory in 2024 came from mainland China, whose economic growth reached the 5% goal set by Beijing by 2024. But Nicholas Chen, Creditsights analyst, said the company of the Financial Notation Agency group Fitch expects a slowdown to 4.7% this year, in part due to poor private consumption.
The consumer confidence index in China fell in September to the lowest level in the last 34 years, highlighted Jeffrey Kiang, an analyst at consultancy CLSA. In other words, “if the outlook for Chinese consumers is not good, they may tighten their belts, reduce travel and consumption”, including in Macau, explained Nicholas Chen.
The Chinese Communist Party has launched a series of stimulus measures, including the reduction of interest rates and mandatory bank reserves and the anticipation of thousands of millions of its budget in 2025 to fund construction projects.
Beijing also widened a consumer goods exchange system and increased the salaries of millions of civil servants to revive internal demand. "The [Chinese] government has said it will launch more measures to stimulate the economy," said Vitaly Umansky, who expects mainly a recovery of the middle class confidence: "I think it will happen, it's just a matter of time."
Creditsights expects Chinese consumer confidence to rise in the second half of 2025, along with real estate price stabilization, which have been falling for 19 consecutive months.
The issue concerns a lot of Beijing, due to the implications for social stability, since housing is one of the main investment vehicles of families and the real estate sector - adding indirect factors - represents about 30% of the Chinese economy. "There will certainly be some side effect, because part of the measures that are adopted to boost domestic consumption may flow to the Macao game sector," said Nicholas Chen.
The analyst believes that China will also expand the list of cities whose residents can apply for 'individual visas' to visit Hong Kong and Macau, a method used by 35.2% of tourists who passed through Macau in 2024.
Vitaly Umansky has no opinion and recalls that since January 1, residents of the neighboring city of Zhuhai can visit Macau once a week and stay up to seven days.
On the other hand, analysts agree that casinos' revenues will be next year away from the maximum historical maximum of 303 billion Patacas recorded in 2018. "One thing is clear: the government aims to moderately growth in revenues in the future," said Jeffrey Kiang, remembering that authorities predict game revenues of 240 billion patacas by 2025, which would be a 5.8%increase. “When the Macao government publishes a forecast, it is usually very conservative and is based on a prior discussion with the Chinese central government's connection case in the city, Vitaly Umnsky said.
The analyst does not believe that Beijing has some measure to control the resuming of casinos, similar to the campaign that began with the detention of the leader of the largest company raising VIP in the world, in November 2021. “Much of the reprehensible behavior in Macau disappeared with the 'junkets'. As long as things like that don't happen again, I don't expect any kind of short -term campaign, ”said Umansky.

The consumer price index (CPI), the main indicator of inflation, continued to decelerate in December to 0.1% and the accumulated price rise in 2024 was just 0.2%, worsening deflationary pressures in the second largest economy in the world. world.
Deflation consists of a drop in prices over time, as opposed to a climb (inflation). The phenomenon reflects weakness in domestic consumption and investment and is particularly dangerous, as a drop in the price of assets, as a rule contracted with credit, generates an imbalance between the value of loans and bank guarantees.
Another effect is to lead to the postponement of consumption and investment decisions as a result of expectations of lower prices in the future, which can create a downward spiral in prices and demand that is difficult to reverse, affecting the entire economy.
The fall in prices began in 2022, with the devaluation of the most important asset in China: residential real estate. Since Beijing liberalized the sector in the 1990s, real estate has become the main investment vehicle for Chinese families, leading to a boom in construction that has transformed the Asian country's cities. This economic strategy now appears to have gone too far.
A train trip through China allows you to glimpse thousands of empty or unfinished towers. Different analysts are currently calculating enough empty properties to house more than 90 million people - about nine times the Portuguese population.
“There was a lot of fictitious growth in China”, observed Michael Pettis, professor of financial theory at the Guanghua School of Management, Peking University, to the Lusa agency. “Excess investment in all types of non-productive construction projects inflated growth for several years”, he described.
Now, the prospect of a long drop in real estate prices has led to the loss of confidence of consumers and investors and the escape to safer alternatives.
Products with guaranteed capital, such as time deposits, have become the preferred choice of savers, which led China's central bank to reduce interest rates, aiming to encourage the allocation of capital in the economy.
Term deposits in state banks currently pay 1.6% per year, compared to more than 4%, five years ago.
With few safe assets available, banks, insurance companies and fund managers have accumulated public debt securities, reducing their profitability. Ten-year Chinese government bonds now yield around 1.6%. “One of the factors is the expectation among investors that cuts in key rates [defined by the central bank] will be decided, given that the latest data on economic activity remains weak and the political measures announced so far seem to have failed to boost expectations. of growth,” wrote James Reilly, an analyst at Capital Economics, in a report released last week. “This helps explain why short-term yields also fell, with the two-year [bond] yield dropping to 1%,” he pointed out.
Finally, regarding real estate, the situation is particularly aggravated by the fact that the Chinese population has entered an accelerated process of decline.
The population shrank in 2024 for the third consecutive year and UN estimates predict that they fall to less than half of the current number until 2100. "Women are more aware," Zhao Hua, a 28 -year -old Chinese from Beijing, Lusa, told Lusa. "Gender inequality remains deep in China: men want a traditional family in which women take over their children and household chores," he added.
Several young Chinese women interviewed by Lusa highlighted the discrepancy between this type of mentality and the expectations of a society that has modernized and urbanized at a pace unparalleled in modern history.
According to the World Bank, in 1980, only 19.4% of the Chinese population lived in urban areas. In 2023, the rate rose to around 66%. Resorting to immigration to counter population decline and stimulate residential real estate appears to be excluded: China defines itself as a “non-immigration” country. Beijing does not recognize dual nationality. The granting of citizenship is based on the principle of “jus sanguinis” (right of blood), and can only be granted to those with Chinese ancestry.</description><pubDate>2025-01-27T06:49:01+08:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Pyongyang tests cruise missile and threatens US with “severe contracted”</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/01/27/pyongyang-testa-missil-de-cruzeiro-e-ameaca-eua-com-contramedidas-severas/</link><description>North Korea announced a launch of strategic cruise missiles, the first test since Donald Trump's return to the United States Presidency, and threatened Washington with “the most severe countermeasures”.
 
Under the supervision of leader Kim Jong-un, Pyongyang on Saturday tested guided cruise missiles to "increase the effectiveness of strategic measures against potential enemies" and in line with the "changing security environment", the North's official news agency said. –Korean KNCA.
In a statement cited by KCNA, the North Korean Foreign Ministry criticized the joint military exercises of the United States and South Korea, which described as "worrying provocations."
On Wednesday, the United States, South Korea and Japan performed a joint exercise, during which several US Air Force recognition planes flew over the Korean Peninsula. “Reality shows that DPRK [AMER AGE OF THE DEMOCRATIC POPULAR REPUBLIC OF Korea, the country's official name] should respond to the United States with the most severe contracted, from A to Z, while this country continues to reject its sovereignty and the Your security interests, and that this is the best option to deal with the United States, ”said North Korean diplomacy.
Pyongyang also accused the United States of wanting to “gain superiority of power through their incessant military expansion”, creating an “increasingly dangerous security environment” on the Korean peninsula and in the region.
According to KCNA, Kim Jong-un said that North Korea “will always make tireless efforts in a responsible manner” to “defend sustainable and lasting peace” through “a more powerful and developed military muscle.”
The cruise missiles tested by the North hit their targets after traveling elliptical trajectories of about 1,500 kilometers, Pyongyang said, adding that the test “had no impact on the security of neighboring countries.”
South Korea's army had announced on Saturday that it detected “multiple cruise missile releases” from the interior of North Korea towards the Japan Sea around 16:00.
North Korea's test came after Donald Trump said on Thursday that he was willing to meet in the future with Kim Jong-un, whom he described as "a smart guy."
In an interview with North American television Fox News three days after taking office, Trump promised that he would contact the North Korean leader, with whom the Republican led unsuccessful denuclearization negotiations in his first term (2017-2021).
After the first summit with Kim in 2018, Trump unilaterally announced the suspension of the usual military exercises with South Korea, considering them “very provocative” and “tremendously expensive”.

The case was forwarded to the Public Ministry (MP).
According to the MP, the defendant claimed to be responsible for a particular work in Macao and added that he could provide support to residents from the interior of China to get a job in Macao and deal with the necessary documents, inducing the offended to pay for the installment support. After investigating, it was found that the defendant was also involved in five other inquiries instituted by the MP from 2023, suspected of using the same modus operandi to circumvent more than 300 residents in the interior of China, involving a total value of more than more than 580 thousand patacas.
The MP says that, as there was evidence in the aforementioned investigations of the practice of the crime of fraud of a considerably high value, the Criminal Investigation Court, under the direction of the MP, applied the coercive measure of preventive detention to the defendant.
In a press release, the MP warns job seekers to be careful with job offer traps and carefully identify the veracity of recruitment advertisements. “Residents from the interior of China who are interested in working in Macau must resort to formal and legal procedures, ensuring that their own legal rights and interests are ensured”, advises the MP.</description><pubDate>2025-01-27T06:48:51+08:00</pubDate></item><item><title>South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol indicated by rebellion</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/01/27/presidente-sul-coreano-yoon-suk-yeol-indiciado-por-rebeliao/</link><description>The South Korean Attorney's Office indicated yesterday the deposed President Yoon Suk Yeol de Rebbelião for the imposition of martial law, local press reported a criminal accusation that could lead him to death or life imprisonment if convicted. The Yonhap news agency reported that the accusation to Yoon is related to the December 3 decree that plunged the country in a huge political turmoil. Other South Korean media published similar reports. Yoon was accused and arrested earlier because of the decree of martial law. The Constitutional Court is deliberating separately if it must formally dismiss Yoon as President or restore it. The magistrates accompanied yesterday's decision with an order to keep Yoon detained. The South Korean president was arrested last week in an operation at dawn.  Yoon, a conservative, firmly denied by the Central District Prosecutor's Office of any irregularity, considering that the imposition of martial law was a legitimate act of governance designed to increase public awareness of the risk of the National Assembly, controlled by liberals, obstruct your schedule and dismissal of high employees.
During the announcement of martial law, Yoon called Parliament “a den of criminals” and promised to eliminate “blatant followers of North Korea and anti-state forces.” After declaring martial law, Yoon sent troops and police to Parliament, but the deputies still managed to enter the plenary and vote unanimously to annul the decree, forcing his government to revoke it. The imposition of martial law, the first of its kind in South Korea in more than 40 years, lasted just six hours. However, it evoked painful memories of dictatorial regimes from the 1960s to 1980s, when military-backed leaders used martial law and emergency decrees to suppress opponents.</description><pubDate>2025-01-27T06:55:45+08:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Café “Majestic”, through the lens of Lúcia Lemos, on display at Galeria Hold On to Hope</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/01/27/cafe-majestic-pela-lente-de-lucia-lemos-em-exposicao-na-galeria-hold-on-to-hope/</link><description>The photographic exhibition “Encontro à Meia-Luz”, by Lúcia Lemos, opens next Saturday afternoon, at Galeria Hold On to Hope, in Aldeia de Nossa Senhora on Ká-Hó Estrada de Nossa Senhora de Ká-Hó.

The levels of air pollution in the Thai capital put it among the ten most polluted cities in the world.
The measure was announced through social networks by the governor of Bangcoque, Chardchart Sittipunt, who stated that 352 schools of the Metropolitan Administration of Bangkok were closed due to pollution.
The number is much higher than the approximately 200 schools that did not open the previous day in Bangkok, whose metropolitan area is home to more than 17 million people.
The city was classified Friday as the eighth most polluted city in the world, according to the IQAir portal, which measures air quality around the world, by measuring PM2.5 particle levels, registering 175 micrograms per meter. cubic (µg/m³), well above the limit of 25 µg/m³ recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The capital of Bangladesh, Daca, the Pakistani city of Lahore and the capital of Nepal, Katmandu, head the list with a concentration of more than 200 µg/m³.
WHO advises to avoid exposure for more than 24 hours to concentrations of PM2.5 over 25 mcg/m3, due to the risk of respiratory, cardiovascular and carcinogens associated with these particles, so small that they can pass directly to the bloodstream .
Thai Transport Minister Suriya Juangroongruangkit announced that electric trains and buses will be free in traffic-choked Bangkok for seven days from January 25 to 31, 2025, among some of the measures aimed at reducing pollution. atmospheric.
Meanwhile, the Thai Ministry of Agriculture has been trying to clear the sky by creating artificial clouds to increase the humidity level and reduce polluting particles floating in the atmosphere. Agricultural fires are also being controlled.
One of the main problems of atmospheric pollution in Thailand is the time of burning agricultural collus, which usually occurs between January and April, early in the plantation season, coinciding with the country's dry season. This burning, a cheaper method than the removal of plants by hand or with machines, is used by farmers in Thailand and neighboring countries, such as Cambodia, Burma and Laos.</description><pubDate>2025-01-27T06:55:47+08:00</pubDate></item><item><title>DSAL sees significant increase in job placements and candidate assistance</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/01/27/dsal-regista-aumento-significativo-nas-colocacoes-de-emprego-e-assistencia-a-candidatos/</link><description>In 2024, the Labor Affairs Services Directorate assisted around 14,700 people in their job search, marking a significant increase compared to the previous year.

This result, according to DSAL, is a reflection of the institution's commitment to articulating the Government's “1+4” economic diversification strategy, which includes the promotion of qualified staff and the creation of diversified employment opportunities.
Compared to 2023, where 13,835 people got employment through DSAL, this year recorded a significant increase in the placement rate, with 14,699 individuals to be hired, of which 648 belong to the construction sector. This increase of 864 places is a positive indicative of the measures implemented by DSAL to stabilize employment in the region for this year.

To this end, several plans were launched, including the “Qualified Personnel Training Plan for the Convention and Exhibition Sector”, which aim to enable workers to contemporary market challenges.
In addition to focusing on training and employment, DSAL has implemented health and occupational health inspection measures. With 1,513 inspections carried out in 2024, the institution sought to ensure safe working conditions, especially in high risk sectors such as construction, where severe measures are applied to contain unforeseen dangers.
In the future, DSAL intends to continue to be proactive, by continuing to hold matching sessions, job fairs and internship plans, constantly adapting to the evolution of the job market in Macau. Through an approach focused on training and certification, DSAL aims to expand employment opportunities and monitor the development of residents' skills, promoting the stability and economic growth of the territory, points out the organization.</description><pubDate>2025-01-27T06:49:58+08:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Lam went to Beijing to hear “guiding opinions”</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/01/27/o-lam-foi-a-pequim-ouvir-opinioes-orientadoras/</link><description>Lam, Secretary for Social Affairs and Culture, was recently in Beijing where she led a delegation from Macau that visited the ministries and commissions of the Central Government and relevant organizations, with a view to “exchanging views and listening to their guiding opinions”. .

In March, Macau tourism will be promoted at ITB Berlin.
 
The Tourism Services Directorate (DST) promoted Macau to Madrid between last Wednesday and yesterday. At the International Tourism Fair (FITUR), in the Spanish capital, the objective was to attract visitors from long-haul markets to Macau.
The start of promotional activities at Fitur included an exchange on the opening day of the fair for leaders of the European tourist industry. Participants were responsible for Tourism of Portugal, the Portuguese Association of Travel and Tourism Agencies (APAVT), the European Confederation of Travel Agency and Tour Operators Associations (European Travel Agents 'and Tour Operators' Associations - ECTAA), from Spanish confederation of travel agencies, travel agencies, among others, in a total of more than 40 participants.
At that meeting, Helena de Senna Fernandes, director of DST, pointed out that the reinforced presence at this year's FITUR marks the beginning of a series of promotional actions for Macau in 2025 aimed at the European market. The official said “we look forward to the promotional activities and major events planned for this year to showcase the new dynamics of Macau's development as a global tourism and leisure center and increase tourist flows from Europe”.
The “Sentir Macau” stand was placed at FITUR, which “provides the professional and general public with an overview of Macau's 'tourism +' offers, including a virtual reality tour of the city”, said DST in a statement, adding that the stand also serves as a platform for contacts with tour operators, conducting interviews with the media, among other activities. On the first day of FITUR, the DST stand also hosted an Update on Macau's Tourism Product for 50 travel agents.

The Macanese community in São Paulo, Brazil, is experiencing a decline in participation, particularly among younger generations. Internal disputes, the pandemic and the lack of cultural identity are factors and the biggest contributors. To preserve its heritage, the community must find new ways to get involved.
 
The Macaense community in São Paulo, Brazil, has been vibrant and united, with regular and crowded activities and meetings. However, internal disputes and the impact of the pandemic caused the active participation of the community to decrease. The Macao de São Paulo House currently has 110 members, however, it is estimated that the actual number of Macanese in Sao Paulo rounds 300 to 400. The average age of members is quite high and the younger generations seem to be losing The interest in Macanese culture and community. Although São Paulo has a larger Macanese community compared to other states of Brazil, the community in Brazil as a whole is relatively small compared to other countries. In an interview with the final point, Pedro Martins, whose inheritance Macaense dates back to Frederico Martins and Angelina Guerreiro, deepens the Macanese experience in São Paulo, as well as the challenges that threaten its preservation. To safeguard the Macanese culture, Pedro believes that the house needs to involve and educate the younger members about its heritage and rewrite the definition of “Macaense” in a diaspora context. In general, the young man who traveled 17,970 kilometers to be present at the meeting of the 2024 Macanese communities considers that more initiatives are needed to revive and strengthen the Maca community in São Paulo and Brazil.
 
How would you describe the Macanese community in Sao Paulo, if it's a united community and keep the connection to Macau?
The Macanese community in São Paulo had an initial moment, especially with the first generations that arrived in Brazil, very rich. It was very lively. They arrived in the 60s and 70s, mainly Macanese from the 30s and 40s generation. Some brought their parents and also came with their young children and, until around the 2000s, the community was very united. In the 70s until the 90s, they met in a more informal way, they used a Macanese house that had a larger space, they also used the Casa de Portugal, there in São Paulo. They had a choir, they had cooking activities, they also met in Chinese restaurants, they were very lively. The peak of this vivacity of the Casa de Macau in São Paulo occurred in the 90s, when all Macau houses around the world received money to build their own house, that was the peak. It was the time when they got together the most, they had lunch every Sunday, they sang choirs, they did dances, they organized patuá plays, this was the most powerful moment for the São Paulo community. Since 2000, the Macanese community in São Paulo has begun to experience a period of decline in its interactions, in its experience. I attribute two main factors to this drop in strength, one of which was the issue of internal disputes between members that ended up pushing each other away and also the pandemic, which caused people of advanced age to lose the habit of attending the House. . Today, the Casa de Macau in São Paulo is experiencing a period of little vibrancy, which can be seen by the fact that only six people came from São Paulo for that year's meeting of Macanese.
 
How does Brazil, in general, see Macau?
Macau is still very unknown to Brazil. Still very recently started to emerge videos of Brazilians who say “Look, there is a city in southern China that speaks Portuguese, which preserves the Portuguese…”, but is still very unknown. Even today Brazil does not pay as much attention as China itself gives the importance of Macau as a connection platform between the two countries. Macao still has a lot to be explored by Brazil, to understand this Lusophone integration, for universities partnerships, for media organizations, to understand Macau's role in this interaction with China. In this context, the Macaense community could play a very important role, even to make this connection but, due to the low number of macanese near the Brazilian population, ends that Brazilians themselves, newspaper organizations, academic organizations, the Brazilian diplomatic body itself, They need to have a larger initiative and seek Macau to explore this potential.
 
In this sense, what role does the Macau House of São Paulo play in São Paulo and, more specifically, in Brazil?
The Casa de Macau de São Paulo was originally very important to maintain the unity and coexistence of the Macanese who went to Brazil in the 60s and 70s. Today its role has changed a lot, because of those Macanese who came, many are already at a very advanced age and his children are no longer grown up, they are together, they no longer create bonds of friendship like their parents did. Today it no longer has a role so much in allowing friends to gather, but rather in preserving the community experience of the Macanese and the children of the Macanese. This is its biggest role and biggest challenge, how to ensure that the new generations, the generations that were born in the 70s, 80s and onwards until my generation, are able to maintain this sense of belonging to Macau, this sense of being Macanese through this community experience? The way it has been lived lately, which is a more individualized experience, everyone considers themselves Macanese but they don't have a community experience. It is very easy to become immersed in Brazilian culture, ending up, over time, losing that connection with Macau. Macau ends up becoming a footnote in their bibliography and no longer something in their everyday lives or something they always remember. I see that Casa de Macau de São Paulo is fundamental to allowing this community experience, which preserves the identity and sense of belonging to the Macanese community.
 
Would you say that São Paulo has a largest Macanese community than other Brazilian states?
In Brazil, the only places with significant communities are São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, other states have, at most, one Macanese. From what I know, apart from São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, only the state of Pará has a Macanese. They are all concentrated in Rio and São Paulo. São Paulo has a larger community than that of Rio de Janeiro, there were many more Macanese people to São Paulo, but close to the communities in the United States, Canada, Australia and Portugal, the one in Brazil is much smaller.
 
How many members does the House have?
Today there are 110 members only that, for you to analyze the Macanese community of São Paulo, you can not just look at this picture of associates because many macanese, over the last 20 years, have left, have disassociated from the house. I estimate that today, considering all who were born in Macau or have some connection with Macao, are around 300 to 400, but only a quarter of this is that it really goes to the house.
 
What is the average age of members?
Of those born in Macau, most of them are in their 80s/90s. There is also a significant number who are in their 70s, but the bulk are really those in their 80s and 90s. The children of these Macanese, many of whom were also born in Macau but were very young, two or three years old in Brazil, are in their 40s and 50s. Considering all the associates, like these Macanese people, their children and now their grandchildren and great-grandchildren, I think the average age should be around 30 to 40 years old.
 
And does the house have any incentive or goal to bring in more young people?
The big challenge of this is that in the last 20 years of Macao de São Paulo's house, the young people, both in the 40/50 years, and my generation of 20/30, have lost their habit of living Macau, to go to the Home, eat macanese food, have contact with Patuá, understand the importance of this ancestry they have. This made them lose their interest in attending the house. Those people who really attend events, especially lunch, are all elderly in the 80/90 year. The young people lost this experience. This is very dangerous because the community experience of the macanese is essential to maintain the culture, without this experience the culture is diluting and is lost over generations. At home this is an essential mission, if she wants to continue to exist in the next 20/30 years. The challenge is how to show these young people the importance of maintaining this Macanese experience, convincing them that even if they have not grown in Macau, even though in the last 30 years or 20 years they have not attended the home, It is very important to go back to frequent and maintain the culture and experience.
 
In addition to lunches, does Casa de Macau de São Paulo organize more activities or other events to bring the community together with that of Rio de Janeiro?
Historically, especially when the houses in São Paulo and Rio were built, the property itself had many exchanges between the houses. In the Casa de Macau in São Paulo, one of the great highlights compared to other houses in the world is that there were many pieces written in Patuá. We have a lady, very old, called Maria, her nickname is Mariazinha, she is Macanese and she is known in São Paulo as the Patuá lady, because she wrote many plays in Patuá and directed these plays. Outside of Macau, and perhaps Portugal, Brazil was one of the only communities that had plays written and performed in Patuá. There were also Macanese choirs that sang songs in Portuguese, Patuá, English, even Cantonese. There were also dances, plays, there were many activities that were very lively, very energetic. Today, with the deterioration of the community, the events are more limited to lunches, where some important event in Macau is celebrated, Portugal Day, Saint John's Day, Christmas, Chinese New Year, but these events are limited to just lunches and shared experiences. There are no more plays, choirs, all those events that you had in the past have been lost over time.
 
In this sense, what are the difficulties that Casa de Macau de São Paulo is going through?
I think there are several difficulties, but they are all connected to two central problems, one of which is the absence of younger people in the house, young people both aged 20 to 30 and 40 to 50 years old. It's a very big problem, in which there is a predominance of only those aged 80 to 90 years old. Young people mean the future, without young people without a future, this is a big central problem. Young people have lost this sense of belonging to the community experience within Macanese culture and the community, this is the main problem. Furthermore, I can also mention two events that happened in the last 20 years that separated Macanese from this age group of 70 to 90, which were some internal disputes and also the pandemic. These two events caused the community itself, which was previously very united, to also move away. This causes this sense of belonging to Macau to be lost, so much so that one of the reasons, in addition to advanced age, in addition to geographic distance, in addition to the issue of adaptation, is one of the main reasons why very few Macanese people came to this year's Macanese meeting it was the distance from each other within the community. This lack of social integration meant that they did not have as much motivation to come to the meeting, something that in the past, for example in the 1998 meeting, more than two hundred Macanese came from São Paulo and now five came. This is something very serious. I mention an issue, now more about Macanese identity, which is an important topic that several Houses around the world address. Today the Macanese community has a very big challenge of updating the term “Macanese”, that is, what does it mean to be Macanese? The definition is dynamic, throughout history it has been updated with each historical reality. Over the last 400 years, the meaning of being Macanese has been adapted and today the great challenge is how to define Macanese encompassing the large diaspora. It is the first time in history that there are more Macanese in the diaspora than Macau Macau, it is very important that the new definitions of Macanese encompass the realities of the diaspora. In the case of São Paulo, specifically, one of the challenges of defining what it means to be Macanese is understanding that, now in São Paulo, Macanese ethnically have become very diluted. All children of Macanese descendants who were born from the 70s and 80s onwards have only one Macanese parent, the other parent is from another ethnic group. This is a very big challenge because how are you going to define Macanese considering this reality, considering this issue of ancestry? Thinking about Macanese as a whole, the community of São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro or Australia have a current characteristic, they are multinational, they are globalized. They are all inserted in very different cultures, but they are united by this sense of belonging to one. Here I quote two very important authors from the Macanese community who help us update the meaning of being Macanese. One of them is Jorge Rangel, who at this year's Macanese meeting said a very interesting phrase: “We are all Macanese.” We all have a sense of belonging to Macau. This is very important because this definition encompasses the reality of diasporas, people who were not born in Macau or did not grow up in Macau, but who want to preserve this sense of Macanese identity. The other author is also called Jorge, Jorge Morbey. He was former president of the Macau Cultural Institute and also wrote some articles, in which he said that Macanese are both those born in Macau and those born in the diaspora, in the oldest diaspora such as Shanghai, Malaysia, Goa, Portugal, as well as the new diaspora, which are those born in the United States of America, Canada and Brazil. These two definitions they give, both Rangel's of “we are all Macanese” and Morbey's of considering all the children of the diaspora to be Macanese, are fundamental to account for this new reality of the Macanese.
 
And have not been a problem for the house?
A very particular reality of the Macau Houses in Brazil is that, thinking about meetings, both for young people and communities, the travel cost is the highest of all the Houses in the world, because as there is no direct flight from Brazil to China , to Macau, to Hong Kong. It is always necessary to take a long flight first to Europe, the United States, the Middle East or even Africa and then another to Hong Kong or Macau. These two necessary flights, from Brazil to somewhere in the middle and from there to China, make trips very expensive. I was talking to people from the United States community and they need just one flight, there are direct flights from San Francisco to Hong Kong, even people from Portugal also have shorter flights or flights with fewer stops [stopovers]. Not in the case of Brazil, there are two very large flights and this makes traveling to Macau very expensive. Also thinking about the costs for the community experience there in Brazil, this is also another big challenge. Houses have a very high maintenance cost. Casa de Macau de São Paulo is a very large piece of land, it requires a lot of maintenance, a lot of cleaning, a lot of conservation. In Rio de Janeiro too, they also had several problems during the pandemic with robbery and theft, which required reconstruction and renovation. All these costs end up greatly harming the community experience. This financial issue greatly affects both day-to-day living and participation in youth and community meetings.
 
Were these issues reported to the Government?
As far as I know, São Paulo does not have a culture of asking the Government for help. This will be something that is very difficult to ask for now, especially because the Macanese community is different from other communities, it is very small, it has never had such a large participation in the Government as the Italian community, the Armenian community or even the Portuguese community itself. . The Macanese community has always been very small and never had very strong connections with people from the Government. I believe that it is also a global challenge for Macanese communities, such as rethinking their financial management, creating a fund to manage heritage, achieving frequent financial returns, talking to cultural preservation institutions such as Fundação Oriente, the Conselho das Comunidades Macaenses, the International Institute of Macau, to create a new financial management perspective for the maintenance of the Houses. In fact, even at the meeting of the Macanese communities, the president of the Fundação Casa de Macau had a meeting with representatives of each House of Macau and presented the issue of seeking greater dialogue with the Houses to provide more financial and logistical support.
 
Is dialogue with other Macao houses something constant or just revived when they meet?
In the old days, especially with the Macao House of Rio de Janeiro, the dialogue was something more institutionalized. You had the house of Macau de São Paulo as an institution contacting the other houses. Today, this contact was very individualized. For example, some macanese from Sao Paulo goes to Canada and will visit the house there, he goes individually, not representing the house. There are no excursions. This is also a very sad thing, because this relationship of houses to a more institutional level would allow much more partnerships, be it financial partnerships or logistical partnerships. For example, at this year's Macanese meeting I noticed that US houses are the majority [majority], I think 70% -80% of the macanese who came to meet are associated with these homes. They could greatly help other houses that have fewer people, for example, giving hotel address tips, airline ticket tips, get -togethers, lunches. This lack of institutional dialogue between houses harms a lot of partnerships that could be very rich for the community. I even talked to the macanese of the house of Rio de Janeiro and many of them who are older, in the 60/70 range, mentioned that in the beginning, when the houses were built, had a very strong dialogue between them and that even made it easy Much trips to the meetings of the time, it made a lot of facilitating the purchase of airline tickets, much made the partnership to have a better stay in Macao a lot. This was much richer, had much greater potential for community preservation and experience.
 
It has talked a lot about the identity issues of the Maca community, particularly among younger generations. How is the cultural identity so loud of Brazil interacts with the macanese identity of the diaspora that lives there? Affect her anyway? Is it a dissuasive factor for young people?
This question is very interesting because in Brazil it can be seen, with the adaptation of the Macanese community to the location, that this adaptation was so strong, this sociocultural integration was so strong, that it threatens to dilute Macanese culture. There is a risk that the Macanese community in São Paulo will easily end up becoming part of Brazilian culture. Brazilian culture is very similar to Macanese culture in essential matters, in language, in the Catholic religion. The fact that Brazil has a very mixed population ended up integrating the Macanese in a very strong, very peaceful way. A strong expression of this dilution of the Macanese community is the fact that there was not a single couple from the Macanese community, from the generation born after the 70s, who married and had children. All Macanese who were born in Brazil from the 70s onwards are now married to other Brazilians and have children who only have one Macanese parent. This is the greatest example of this very strong integration in Brazilian society. This very strong integration is an even greater challenge for the Macanese community, to make young people have a sense of belonging to Macau. I have heard reports from some of the Houses in some other places in the world that, because they are made up of more Macanese, there have been many marriages within the community. This in Brazil, both because of this cultural integration and because of the smaller number of Macanese, ended up not happening and ended up being a very big challenge for this sense of belonging.
 
Would you say that the issue of distance between Brazil and Macau also weighs on this challenge?
It is a logistical issue, from Macau being too far and not being very easy to travel here. On average, from Sao Paulo to Hong Kong or Macao, considering all the logistics effort, it spends around 30 hours. 30 hours is a long time, not only for the matter of time but for the financial issue. This also ends up moving away from Macao, also the other problems we approached.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Away from Macau's casinos, looking for prosperity in the Lunar New Year</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/01/27/longe-dos-casinos-de-macau-a-procura-da-prosperidade-no-ano-novo-lunar/</link><description>Away from the brilliance of the Macao Casinos, the manager of a Cantonense seafood, a 'Feng Shui' master and a young couple question the economic moment for the new year of the serpent.
 
At the entrance of Tong Vu, large lobsters drag themselves inside aquariums. This year are being sold to the purchase price, because the times so require it.
Tong Keng Seoi, the manager, has lobster from Australia at 498 patacas, instead of the usual 900 (107). Option that brings more business volume to the old seafood restaurant in Macau during the Lunar New Year, with a full house and “a 30% increase in orders compared to the previous year”.
At this point, a banquet for 12 people, with lobster, ears and sea cucumbers, shark fin soup, suckling pig and roast chicken, can cost between four thousand and 12 thousand patacas. “Consumption this year is much lower than in previous years, but we are very busy and the main reason is because we offer the lowest price possible,” says Tong, who laments the drop in local purchasing power.
At the Campo do Dragão restaurant, 200 meters, the numbers also suggest retraction. Lin Zhiyuan, space manager, speaks of “600 to 800 tables” reserved throughout the month - “less 20% to 30%” than in 2024.
The difficulties are recognized in other spaces of the city. On a walk through Macao Baixa, small street food businesses gain in this fight to traditional restaurants and tabscas.
Chan Chak Mo, deputy and president of the Union of Restaurant and Beverage Establishment Owners' Associations, confirms the cautious spending environment: “General consumption is low, street food costs around 60-70 patacas”, he says .
After three years of pandemic and rigorous politics 'Zero Covid', the game's engine, the engine of the local economy, are already approaching the values ​​of 2019. However, despite the regeneration of the sector, in small and medium enterprises, the wound maintains- open.
In the case of restaurants, in November, according to the most recent official statistics, the turnover of “Chinese restaurants and food establishments and soup and chicken soup stores fell by 4.3% and 3.7%, respectively” .
And then there is the other side of the border. Quality products and services, lower prices and the possibility that, since 2023, two thousand vehicles with Macau registration plates will circulate daily in the interior of China, make neighboring Zhuhai a fierce competitor for small local businesses. “It is estimated that there are around 50 million US dollars that were previously spent in Macau and Hong Kong per month and are now spent in Shenzhen [Hong Kong's neighbor] and Zhuhai. And obviously this has a huge impact on the well-being of small businesses”, analyzes the president of the Luso-Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
Carlos Cid Álvares, also executive director of the Macao National Bank Overseas Bank, suggests adaptations: “Small businesses have done business equally for 20 years or 30 years and have to adapt to a new reality that is that of a younger population, with other needs ”.
Another sequel to the economic moment: in 2023, 3,712 births were recorded in the Chinese semi-autonomous region, 43.5% less than 10 years ago (6,571).
For Tao Xuemei and Wong Chio Fan, a young couple, personal finances and Chinese coffers do not allow them to take the step: “We are worried about having children because of the national debt, because of the economic recession. The choice for motherhood really depends on the country's economic capacity and debt repayment capacity”, summarizes Tao, 28 years old, working as a school counselor. “We don’t want to have children just to pass on [our] debts to them,” adds Wong, a 35-year-old contractor.
Finances are the theme that about 20% of people lead to consultations with Mickey Hung Sen Chun, Master of Feng Shui, a Chinese millennial practice that studies the influence of space on people's welfare.
This Lunar New Year, which starts on Wednesday, casinos will continue to prosper, says the master. “As the symbolism of the serpent is associated with wisdom and mystical luck, many visitors may be more inclined” to gamble, Hung further predicts.
In the negative level, the year of the serpent “is often accompanied by indifference and hatred”, and the fact that “there were many important historical events” in this sign of the lunar calendar may be a source of apprehension, warns the master, who points to the risk of future “similar occurrences”.
The Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor in 1941; Tiananmen's student repression in Beijing took place in 1989 and the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001. Every year of the serpent.
At the national level, Hung estimates, "With the gradual recovery of the world economy, China exports may be positively affected, which will help you achieve the fixed growth goal."
China, shaken by a deep real estate crisis, the main investment vehicle for Chinese families, launched several economic stimulus measures in the last quarter of last year, including reducing banks' mandatory reserve ratios and interest rates. Beijing also promised to pursue “more proactive” budgetary policies and a “moderate easing” of monetary policy, to boost domestic consumption. “The question is whether what they are doing at the moment, with all these macroeconomic support policies, is enough to stimulate domestic consumption”, assesses Nicholas Chen, analyst at consultancy Fitch Solutions, highlighting the weight of the real estate crisis “on sentiment of the consumer.”
Chen notes that, although China's gross domestic product reached Beijing's goal and grew 5% by 2024, Fitch Solutions foresees a slight slowdown by 2025 “to about 4.7% due to macroeconomic contrary winds, as well as slow domestic consumption, ”he adds.
Legend has it that the 'nian' ('year', in Mandarin), a mythical beast, takes to the streets these days and hunts for animals and people to devour and crop fields to ruin. As it is intolerant to noise and the color red, people started decorating their houses in red and launching fireworks and fireworks to scare away the monster.
Macau does not challenge conviction. The city is preparing the crossing for the new year. The streets dress as tradition dictates. Tong Vu, waiting for the snake, hung red lanterns, also seeing if lobsters would sell better next year.

The unemployment rate exclusively for local residents reached 2.4%, that is, one percentage point less than in the previous year. According to data from the Statistics and Census Bureau, the median monthly income grew by MOP500 last year.
 
The global unemployment rate over last year was 1.8%, less 0.9 percentage points compared to 2023, the Statistics and Census Services (DSEC) said. On the other hand, the exclusive unemployment rate of local residents was 2.4%, less one point than the previous year.
The results of the 2024 employment survey also show that the median monthly employment income of the employed population was 18 thousand patacas, rising 500 patacas compared to 2023. The median monthly salary exclusively for residents was 20,500 patacas, also registering an increase of 500 patacas.
Looking just at the last quarter of last year, DSEC says the global unemployment rate (1.7%) and the resident unemployment rate (2.3%) were both identical to the third quarter of 2024. However , the global underemployment rate (1.5%) increased by 0.4 percentage points.
In the last quarter of 2024, the number of employees (378,300) and residents employed (286,000) descended 1,000 and 1,700 persons, respectively, in quarterly terms. It is noteworthy that the number of employees of the economic construction branch of construction (25,100) and that of retail business employees (32,100) lowered 1,600 and 800 people, respectively. The number of employees of the real estate and services provided for companies (33,700) rose 1,900 people. For its turn, in the last quarter of last year, the average monthly income of the employment of the employed population and that of residents employed were held at 18,000 and 20,500 patacas, respectively, compared to the third quarter of 2024.
DSEC also says that the number of unemployed people in the fourth quarter of 2024 (6,700) was similar to that observed in the previous period. Among the unemployed people looking for a new job, the majority previously worked in the economic activity of lotteries and other betting games and in retail trade. In addition to these, the number of unemployed people looking for their first job represented 13.9% of the total number of unemployed people, 0.7 percentage points less than in the previous period.
In the last quarter of last year, the active population living in Macao was 385,000 people and the labor was approximately 489,600 people, less thousand than in the period between September and November, DSEC indicates.</description><pubDate>2025-01-27T06:55:35+08:00</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
