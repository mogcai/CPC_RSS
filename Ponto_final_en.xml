It is, therefore, a paradigmatic case. In an interview with PONTO FINAL, professor emeritus at the University of Lisbon, Luís Filipe Barreto, highlights the role of Macau, over the centuries, as an intermediary and conciliator in international trade networks. As for the future of the Macao SAR, for the former president of the Macau Scientific and Cultural Center, in Portugal, at this moment, it will always be dictated by what is happening, in the field of International Relations, in East Asia.

In recent years, more than investigating Macau, he has been focused on studying relations between Europe and Asia. What points have attracted your most attention?
Asian standards established before the 16th century — even earlier, in the 14th and 15th centuries — and which, in a certain way, condition or enable the Portuguese condition at the same time. I am very interested in the Portuguese settlement in Macau, closely linked to the international trade circuits between Chinese and Japanese groups. Without abandoning the issue of Macau or the issue of the Portuguese presence, I am increasingly interested in the Asian permanent funds, in which the Europeans will have to join or confront. We are talking about Taiwan, for example. Taiwan's strategic relevance largely depends on Macau and its connection with trade with Japan. Some Japanese came with the Portuguese to stay in the Fisherman's Island area — some attempts at settlement soon. Then, when the Dutch were unable to conquer Macau in 1622, they occupied Fisherman's Island, which the Chinese would later have to expel. The area we named Formosa is a chain of islands, from Taiwan to Okinawa. This explains the contemporary issues with Japan. I'm interested in trying to understand how certain realities, in the present, have a kind of relevant Asian prehistory and where the weights of Islam, China and India come into play. Macau is still present, but it is not the central focus of interest, it is something that complements it.

Why, at that time, did Taiwan's strategic relevance pass through Macau?
For the Portuguese, trade with the south of Japan (the Nagasaki career, but also before), to leave Macau, to catch the winds and currents favorable to the south of Japan, we have to take Formosa as a reference and then we have to go around Fisherman's Island. For us, Formosa is a strategic place, in terms of orientation/navigation, and because we don't allow competition there. If the Dutch settled on Fisherman's Island, the Macau-Nagasaki route would end, as would many of the Manila-Fujian routes. That area has been a kind of Fujian's breadbasket since ancient times. The importance of Formosa, even in strategic terms for China, begins with its international impact, from the 16th century onwards, and this international impact involves Japan and Westerners. Then, Sinicization itself, the solidification of the Qing dynasty's rule over Taiwan, once again involves Macau, because Koxinga is the national hero, who liberates Taiwan from the Dutch and has a family of rich Chinese traders, with ties to Macau. Macau is always on.

Has Macau always, throughout history, had this role of intermediary?
Macau was an island that, with the currents throughout the day or at certain times of the year, formed a kind of small peninsula and it gives the impression that later, from 1560/1570 onwards, this small tongue of land, which came and went, depending on the currents, was solidified. For us, it is important because it creates the Inner Harbor and there is no navigation that can enter through there, but, for the Chinese side, it is also important, because that is where they build the Siege Gates. Macau is an island that was later landfilled. The Portuguese end up at a place where there is a temple of a kind of international Chinese-Japanese-Southeast Asian maritime goddess.

Does this make Macau a unique case in History?
Yes. In relation to Europeans, yes. It makes Macau a headquarters for Asian consortia with a European incorporation, multiple Asian consortia: regional, overseas Chinese, Japanese and local powers. When we arrive [in India] we go to Calicut and we stay in the port area, which had been used by the Chinese in the 15th century. Calicut's greatest ally for spices and international trade is Malacca. We chose Malacca, within the framework of possibilities, and, probably, in seven/nine years, we didn't even have much chance of choosing any other place, because we had that route, which was clearly the safest route for allies and articulation. Ultimately, this means, on the Portuguese side, an immense capacity for adaptation. We make mistakes, like everyone.

In Macau?
In Macau, in the Indian Ocean, in the south of Japan. There are objective reasons why we were the first Europeans to park there, after other Europeans had not settled after the 19th century.

What are these reasons?
It's this ability to adapt. Malacca is the last place where there are armed forces of the State of India. From Malacca it's the wild west. As in the Indian Ocean, the entire part of Bengal, the entire eastern Indian Ocean, is already a certain release. There are areas of maritime Asia, which are relevant areas for the State apparatus and, therefore, for the Cochin-Goa-Lisbon connection and, later, Lisbon-Antwerp and the markets of northern Europe, but there are areas of the Indian Ocean that are very relevant for the “Asianized” Portuguese (married Portuguese). In the Indian Ocean, it is mainly the Bengal area. Saint Francis Xavier arrives [in the Indian Ocean] via a Portuguese, who is a private Portuguese, who leaves the Bengal area for Malacca. Then, we tried to approach China using official diplomatic rules — we realized that Chinese diplomatic rules were different, the so-called tributary trade, the acceptance of Sino-centric power, but that failed. It led to coastal military conflict, but then a much more private dimension entered and this dimension began to grow in the 1930s, grew even more in the 1940s and this is what led to the emergence of Macau in the 1550s. The State only appeared later. The History of Macau is always made up of internal tension in relation to Goa — both Goa and, at times, Cochin, had different strategic interests in relation to trade with China. Tensions are never just between the Portuguese and Chinese or between the Portuguese and Chinese in Guangzhou or between the Portuguese and Chinese in Beijing. There are internal tensions between Macau, Malacca and Goa, which are managed by Macau. Macau always has to negotiate its existence, not only against the dominant Chinese forces, but against different Portuguese interest groups. Throughout the second half of the 18th century and the first half of the 19th century, Macau ceased to have its own existence and strategic autonomy. It became a kind of English sub-colony of Hong Kong. Macau is an “abnormality”, because it was clearly the only permanent European establishment in East Asia until the 19th century and with a diffuse status.
PHOTOGRAPHY LUCIANA LEITÃO
Between 2021-2022, he was responsible for creating a History of Macau subject at the Faculty of Arts. What was the program?
Today it is integrated into several disciplines and master's and doctoral degrees. As an autonomous subject it disappeared, because, after a certain point, there were not enough students. Why was Macau important to us? For the same reason that Hong Kong is important to the British. They are places of installation and presence of Europeans in East Asia. The case of Macau is the first and the longest lasting, there is no other European example in East Asia, we are talking about the mid-16th century.
It begins as a place of temporary residence, and then becomes a place of permanent residence, always linked to the idea of ​​the winds and tides creating the need and possibility for Macau. It is the monsoons that make Macau rise and triumph. The fantastic side is how you survive afterwards, even if you survive with a lower status.
There are opportunities and they are largely dictated by Asian mechanisms among themselves. And there are Europeans who can and know how to enter. This explains why on the Chinese or Japanese side they are also interested in having a partner who is not a threat. This is the Macau formula: aiming to leave with benefits, with profits, which are always very important for the Portuguese, but the minority part of the business. This is also very much Confucian ethics.

One of the themes of his current research is Christianity and relations between China and Europe. He mentioned, in a document, that in Macau, there is a syncretism of missionary Christianity with Chinese state Confucianism. Was this the formula adopted to guarantee healthy coexistence?
The middle way. What's funny is that, we're talking about the end of the 16th century, beginning of the 17th century, the same thing happens on the Islamic side of China. We have some Chinese philosophers, literate mandarins, proposing a syncretization of Islam with Confucianism. While Ricci says he has Christian Chinese with him, some letters from these Christian Chinese were translated and they say: here is a guy who is great in astronomy and mathematics, extremely useful, he is in the service of the emperor, and then he has some strange spiritual and religious ideas, but what matters is that the business is profitable. The Portuguese had thought that it was possible to have the same system in the China Sea as in the Indian Ocean, of trading posts-fortresses, and that is what Tomé Pires tries: to have a certain idea of ​​monopoly or privilege in international trade in that area. But in Macau you can see that the Portuguese no longer think that way, they no longer want to establish their power in terms of hegemony, they want to find the space possible to be intermediaries in that international trade. Macau, in a way, always has the role of an intermediary, there is no territorial occupation.

Looking now at the present and future, in some of his studies, in this context of Eurasian relations, he mentioned that, in the 80s/90s, the renaissance of Asia in the world was already being redesigned. Nowadays, where are we?
The great winners of this globalization are China and India. We are at the point where China is the second economic power in the world and India is the fourth and Korea is in the top ten. It's not just the economic dimension, it's the cultural dimension, it's the international dimension. Japan sinks, but is fifth, Germany is third. Japan has fallen, but calmly. We are experiencing a profound Asian renaissance, but it is a very Europeanized or Europeanized-Americanized Asia. The Asia that is triumphant is a cosmopolitan Asia. It is a Eurasian, capable of incorporating the best.

Thinking about the future, doesn't China have weaknesses that could change its weight in the world?
Everyone has weaknesses — China, Russia, Europe, the United States. There are no pre-defined paths and ascension is never eternal, it has cycles. It is clear that India is growing at a pace — starting with its demographic dimension — at which it will be strongly competitive with China. There are always “n” possibilities for the future in front of us, one of these possibilities will triumph and that is profoundly indeterminate. The very globalization that we know in the 90s is in deep crisis, I don't know if it hasn't already ended, in practice. If the political dimension of the United States and the closure to open international trade materializes further, globalization itself disappears.

What is Macau’s status in the world at the moment?
Macau has always been a financial hub — Macau's third export was Chinese currency. It was a financial center for both currency and precious metals. This is a constant in Macau. The game is a financial square, it is a bank. It's the other side of the bank. The future of Macau now will always be dictated by what is happening in terms of international relations in East Asia — good relations between China and Japan, the game is good; bad relations, the game suffers. Bad relations between Taiwan and the People's Republic of China, the game suffers. The game grows in a global climate of more peaceful relations.

Does that intermediary role continue?
No longer from a Portuguese intermediary. Macau's intermediate dimension would have to go through other vectors: a cultural and academic vector, but this would imply that there were agreements between Portugal and China. Macau is a fantastic place to have a large Portuguese-language library in Asia.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Technology park focuses on biomedicine, digital technology, integrated circuits and aerospace technology</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/11/27/parque-tecnologico-foca-se-na-biomedicina-tecnologia-digital-circuitos-integrados-e-tecnologia-aeroespacial/</link><description>The Government yesterday began collecting opinions on the Macau Science and Technology Research and Development Industrial Park project, whose consultation period will last until December 26th. The document presented yesterday details that this technology park will focus on four areas: biomedicine, digital technologies, integrated circuits and aerospace technologies.

The collection of opinions regarding the Industrial Park project for research and development of sciences and technologies began yesterday. The Government leaves its plan for residents to consider until December 26th. This project, which had already been presented in the Government Action Lines (LAG) presented in April this year, is included in the region's economic diversification plan.
The document subject to public consultation proposes that the project focuses on four areas: biomedicine, digital technologies, integrated circuits and aerospace technologies. The objective is “to attract and concentrate technological companies and high-level qualified personnel with international competitiveness, promoting advances in central and essential technologies in the respective sectors and promoting characteristic industrial clusters”.
“The aim is to build a modern industrial ecosystem, characterized by a strong capacity for innovation, optimized industrial structure, a high level of openness and a comprehensive service system”, reads the consultation document.
This project also aims to be a “base for high-quality technological companies from mainland China that wish to go abroad”, a “service station for cutting-edge technological projects from abroad” and an “industry-university-research base in Macau”.
The park will be divided into two zones: the Wai Long Avenue land and the western portion of Zone E1 of the New Urban Landfills. The Wai Long Avenue site has an area of ​​83 thousand meters and has a total gross construction area of ​​around 150 thousand square meters. The western portion of Zone E1 of the New Urban Landfills has an area of ​​177 thousand square meters and a total gross construction area of ​​around 500 thousand square meters.
The project will consist of several functional zones, including the digital technologies zone, integrated circuits zone, aerospace technologies zone, data and computing center, urban reception room, public services pavilion, riverside vitality zone, landscape zone and green spaces, according to the document presented by the Directorate of Economic and Technological Development Services (DSEDT).
The authorities detail that “diversified spaces will be created that adapt to the needs of different industries and scales, including specialized laboratories, office areas for research and development, scientific research and experimentation sites, convention and exhibition rooms, support services, business exhibition rooms and presentation and roadshow centers, in order to reduce companies' research and development costs and promote collaborative innovation throughout the industrial chain”.
The consultation document also states that the Macao SAR Government will be responsible for the “general positioning and overall planning” of the park, including “the introduction of projects of great importance, the provision of development suggestions and the provision of support for specific policies”. On the other hand, the establishment of a public capital company will be studied that will be responsible for managing complementary facilities, operating and attracting investments, “creating a complete system of services for the scientific and technological innovation ecosystem”.
In the opening session of the collection of opinions, Tai Kin Ip stated that this project will allow “to build a relevant high-level connection in opening the country to the outside world” and “build an important window for exchange and mutual learning between Chinese and Western civilizations”.
According to the Secretary for Economy and Finance, the construction of the park “will not only open up broad perspectives for Macau's technological innovation industry, but will also bring new opportunities for the development of local young people”. Furthermore, “the completion of the Science and Technology Park will serve as a bridge between Macau's young people and technological innovation companies, enriching young people's career planning paths and creating more diversified development opportunities for those who aspire to dedicate themselves to the technology industry”.
Until December 26th, the Government will hold six opinion-gathering sessions, with the aim of listening to suggestions from all sectors of society, experts, academics and sector representatives.</description><pubDate>2025-11-27 23:15:44</pubDate></item><item><title>Floods cause around 170 deaths and thousands of people displaced in Southeast Asia</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/11/27/cheias-provocam-cerca-de-170-mortos-e-milhares-de-deslocados-no-sudeste-asiatico/</link><description>Floods and landslides caused by torrential rain have caused at least 170 deaths in recent days in Sri Lanka, Thailand and Indonesia, according to national authorities. In Sri Lanka, the Disaster Management Center said yesterday that around 40 people died due to heavy monsoon rains that intensified in recent days due to a depression in the east of the island, as well as a landslide in the mountainous district of Badulla that caused more than a dozen deaths. Sri Lankan authorities estimate that 400 homes were seriously damaged, forcing thousands of people to seek temporary shelter.
In Thailand, the Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation counted at least 82 deaths in 12 provinces in the south of the country, affected by flash floods since the weekend, estimating that around one million families and more than three million people have been affected. The water level began to fall yesterday, but several areas remain submerged, with electricity cuts and telecommunications failures. Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul declared a state of emergency in Songkhla province, the most affected by the floods, and the country's Ministry of Health set up eight field hospitals to support the Hat Yai hospital, which continues to operate on a limited basis.
In Indonesia, search operations continue on the island of Sumatra after flash floods and landslides have caused 49 deaths and 67 missing since Tuesday, according to the National Disaster Management Agency. Authorities admit that the number of victims could increase, as several areas remain isolated, more than 2,000 homes were destroyed by intense rains and around 5,000 people were forcibly displaced. Indonesia's meteorological agency predicts more rain and has recommended the use of climate change technology, including “cloud seeding” operations, a practice that involves introducing substances such as silver iodide into clouds to control the likelihood of precipitation. Floods and landslides are common in Southeast Asia during the monsoon season, between October and March, affecting densely populated regions in mountainous areas and riverine plains.</description><pubDate>2025-11-27 23:06:59</pubDate></item><item><title>Trump advises Japan not to provoke China with Taiwan</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/11/27/trump-aconselha-japao-a-nao-provocar-a-china-com-taiwan/</link><description>Donald Trump advised the Japanese prime minister not to provoke China with the issue of Taiwan's sovereignty. The North American leader's statements came following the Sino-Japanese diplomatic dispute.

The President of the United States advised the Japanese Prime Minister not to provoke China with the issue of Taiwan's sovereignty, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported yesterday, following the Sino-Japanese diplomatic dispute.
Relations between Asia's two largest economies are going through a difficult time after, in early November, the new Japanese Prime Minister, Sanae Takaichi, stated that Tokyo could intervene militarily in the event of an attack on Taiwan, an island that Beijing considers part of Chinese territory.
During a telephone call with US President Donald Trump on Monday, his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, insisted on this matter, stating that Taiwan's return to China is an integral part of the “post-war international order”, according to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Shortly afterwards, “Trump organized a call with Takaichi and advised her not to provoke Beijing over the issue of the island's sovereignty,” reported the daily WSJ, citing, although without identifying, Japanese officials and an American who are familiar with the conversation. “Trump’s opinion was subtle and he did not pressure her to go back on her statements,” the newspaper reads.
However, Japanese government spokesman Minoru Kihara declined yesterday to confirm whether Trump asked Takaichi to moderate his tone regarding Taiwan. “In the telephone conversation the other day, we discussed many issues, such as strengthening relations between Japan and the US and the situation and problems in the Indo-Pacific (…). I avoid giving further details because it is a diplomatic matter,” said Kihara during the daily press conference.
In the report of the call, the head of the Japanese Government limited herself to indicating that she spoke with Donald Trump about his conversation with Xi Jinping, as well as about relations between the two allies. “President Trump said that we were very close friends and suggested that I call him at any time,” said the Japanese leader.
According to the WSJ, however, “Japanese officials found the message worrying.” “The [North American] President did not want tensions around Taiwan to compromise the opening reached last month with Xi, which includes [China's] promise to buy more North American agricultural products, in order to support farmers hit hard by the trade war”, triggered by the North American leader, estimated the newspaper.
Following Sanae Takaichi's statements, China summoned Japan's ambassador and advised the population to avoid traveling to the archipelago.
The release of several Japanese films in China has also been postponed, according to Chinese state media.

Yoho Group, the company awarded for the renovation and management of the space, confirmed that the project involves an investment of 1.2 billion Hong Kong dollars, with reopening scheduled for the middle of next year.

With the new name “Gold Coast Hotel”, the Hotel Palácio Imperial Beijing, abandoned for almost a decade, is undergoing renovation work to be transformed into a five-star establishment with 700 rooms and suites. The information was provided by Yoho Group, adding that the luxury hotel already has a new owner.
The hotel, formerly known as Hotel New Century, located in Taipa, on Avenida Padre Tomás Pereira, next to the Altira Macau, operated with the Greek Mythology casino.
In a response to the Inside Asian Gaming news portal, Yoho Group clarified that it was not the company that acquired the hotel, but was hired by the new owner, through a public tender process, to carry out the construction and renovation project at the site. The company is, at the same time, awarded the operational management, for the next ten years, of the hotel and commercial complex after reopening.
The project is already underway with part of the hotel's facade covered by scaffolding, and an advertising poster for the “Gold Coast Hotel” has also been fixed to the exterior walls.
As highlighted by the Yoho Group, also the company responsible for the development of the YOHO Treasure Island Resorts World Hotel, YOHO Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel and other real estate projects, the renovation of the Hotel Palácio Imperial Beijing involves an investment of approximately 1.2 billion Hong Kong dollars.
The preliminary plan of the hotel's new owner points to a three-phase reopening, scheduled for the middle of next year, presenting the public with a “complete redesign” of the project, such as new interior spaces and facades.
Yoho Grupo also revealed that the planning for the hotel envisages offering 700 rooms and suites with five-star standards, a shopping center with a gastronomic square, parking, sports facilities and facilities for conferences and exhibitions, among others.
Furthermore, the company added that it had made a commitment to the authorities to assume social responsibility by complying with a scheme entitled “promotion of the local economy and support for entrepreneurship of local residents”. Under the commitment, initiatives will be launched in the short term to support resident entrepreneurship and the development of local catering establishments.
The group also guarantees that it will provide more employment opportunities for residents and training programs for university students.
“The main objective of promoting this [Gold Coast Hotel] project is to ensure that its reopening has a profoundly positive impact on residents and commercial entities, as well as being aligned with the Macao SAR Government's vision of building a leisure and tourism center”, he highlighted.
According to Inside Asian Gaming, the hotel works are “repair/maintenance”, with an execution period valid from August 14, 2025 to May 31, 2026. The construction license states that the entity responsible for the project is “Victory Success Holdings Limited”, a company owned by Alvin Chau, former leader of the Suncity group.
It is worth remembering that the previous New Century Hotel was developed by the Macau Hotel Company and was opened in 1992 with 554 rooms and 28 serviced apartments. The hotel housed the Greek Mythology Casino, with a theme inspired by figures from ancient Greek mythology, with 228 gaming tables.
The hotel experienced a dispute over shareholding and lease agreements in 2012, and changed its name to Hotel Palácio Imperial Beijing in 2014.
Subsequently, the Greek Mitologia Casino suspended its operations in late 2015 due to an order from the Directorate of Gaming Inspection and Coordination (DICJ), and the hotel was closed by the Directorate of Tourism Services in July 2016 due to security and management issues, with its license officially returned to the authorities in early 2017.
The hotel was also involved, in 2016, in a dispute related to an alleged fraud involving overbookings involving more than 700,000 hotel room reservations, worth 250 million Hong Kong dollars.

The level of English language proficiency in Macau was considered “low” in the new EF Engish Proficiency Index (EF EPI) report, recently published by EF Education First (EF). Data collected in 2025 attributed only 478 points to Macau, which is thus positioned below other Chinese regions such as Zhejiang, Guangdong and Sichuan.
A China situa-se no 86.º lugar do ranking global, com 464 pontos, numa lista que inclui 123 países e regiões da Europa, Ásia, América Latina, África e Médio Oriente. Dos cinco níveis atribuíveis a cada país (“muito elevado”, “elevado”, “moderado”, “baixo” e “muito baixo”), a proficiência em inglês na China foi classificada como “baixa”, entre o Malawi e Moçambique (empatados com 465 pontos) e a Palestina (com 463 pontos). The Chinese rating was also below the global average rating, which reached 488 points.
Looking only at the Asian continent, China appears in the middle of the table with a proficiency higher than that of Japan and Thailand, for example, but lower than that of India, Pakistan, Vietnam or South Korea. Malaysia and the Philippines lead the Asian table, each gaining 581 and 569 points. Among the 25 countries and regions included here, China is in 13th position.
Hong Kong and Zhejiang are the Chinese regions that most speak English, standing out with respective ratings of 538 and 506 points, corresponding to a “moderate” level. Analyzing by cities, those that stand out the most are Hangzhou, Beijing, Nanjing, Changsha, Shanghai and Jinan, all rated between 515 and 502 points.
The results of the 2025 edition show an increase of nine points compared to last year's report, in which the country obtained just 455. However, the vast majority of Chinese regions and cities continue to fall into the “low” level. In addition to Macau, these parameters also include regions such as Fujian (489), Hubei (482) and Hainan (458) and the cities of Guangzhou and Shenzhen (both with 498 points), Chengdu (472) and Chongqing (460). Finally, the lowest level of proficiency includes the regions of Gansu (447), Henan (433) and Guizhou (429), as well as the city of Zhengzhou (439).
Of the four basic skills essential to learning a foreign language – “reading”, “listening”, “speaking” and “writing” – Chinese participants were more confident in reading and writing, where they reached a “low” level with respective scores of 492 and 455. On the other hand, comprehension and oral production skills totaled 436 and 448 points, respectively, and were classified as a “very low” level.
The age group with the greatest skill in English is 21 to 25 years old, with an average score of 485 in this group. On the other hand, both younger people (between 18 and 20 years old) and older people (over 41 years old) show lower scores, 452 and 449, respectively. Regarding the sexes, there are no differences: both men and women obtained an equal score of 464.
The Netherlands leads the overall ranking with a “very high” proficiency of 624 points. Portugal, in sixth place (612 points), is the only country in southern Europe to achieve the maximum level of proficiency, placing it between countries such as Norway (613), Denmark (611) and Sweden (609). At the bottom of the table are Libya (395), Ivory Coast (393) and Cambodia (390).
The EF EPI was prepared based on the results of proficiency tests carried out by around 2.2 million participants from 123 countries and regions: 37 in Europe, 28 in Africa, 25 in Asia, 20 in Latin America and 13 in the Middle East.</description><pubDate>2025-11-27 23:19:25</pubDate></item><item><title>Deciphering Chinese Responses to Takaichi's Statements: Threat Perceptions as Real</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/11/27/decifrando-as-respostas-chinesas-as-declaracoes-de-takaichi-percepcoes-de-ameaca-como-reais/</link><description>Statements made by new Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi about Japan's attitude and policy towards Taiwan at the Diet on November 7 provoked strong reactions from Chinese official authorities in Beijing. The recent and ongoing Chinese responses to Takaichi's statements, from a political science perspective, are a manifestation that although the Japanese government perceives China's possible harsh action against Taiwan as real, the People's Republic of China's (PRC) perception of how Japan would approach the Taiwan issue is also real, leading to China's strong reactions. It remains to be seen how Tokyo can and will ease tensions with Beijing, including perhaps the option of sending a special envoy from among former Japanese prime ministers to meet with top Chinese officials as quickly as possible.

Takaichi's comments and official reactions from China

On November 7, Takaichi told the Diet that if China uses force to deal with Taiwan, Japan would consider such an act a situation that “threatens survival.”
This statement provoked strong reactions from Chinese authorities. On November 17, Masaaki Kanai, director-general of the Department of Asian and Oceanic Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan, went to Beijing to meet with his Chinese counterpart, Liu Jinsong of the Department of Asian Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China. But the meeting apparently had no concrete results, as Liu was seen publicly putting his hands in his pockets after the dialogue. Li told Chinese media that the Chinese side was indeed dissatisfied with the Japanese explanation.
On November 12, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said that Takaichi made a "mistake" in his remark because Taiwan belongs to the core interest of the People's Republic of China and China does not allow external interference in the Taiwan issue. Lin added that Takaichi “openly challenged” the post-World War II international order. He said that if Japan dares to use force to involve itself in the Taiwan situation, it would constitute “an act of aggression.” Under these circumstances, according to Lin, China would assertively exercise its right to self-defense under the United Nations Charter to defend Chinese sovereignty. Thus, Lin warned the Japanese side about the danger of “playing with fire” on the Taiwan issue and that those who “play with fire” end up “burning themselves”.
At the same press conference, Lin questioned whether the term “survival-threatening situation” meant that Japan would repeat its “militarism” and become China's enemy again. He interpreted Takaichi's statements as “insinuating” that Japan would have the possibility of using force to intervene in the Taiwan issue. Such an implication, according to Lin, constitutes a violation of the "one China" principle and a violation of the spirit and international principles of the four historical documents agreed by China and Japan. After all, the year 2025 marks the eightyth anniversary of China's victory over fascism and also marks the recovery of its sovereignty over Taiwan eighty years ago.
Lin also criticized Takaichi's position on the development of nuclear weapons as "ambiguous" because Japan would likely embrace the development of nuclear submarines, thus sending a "dangerous signal" to international society.
Another Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Mao Ning, made a series of comments that deserve our attention. Like Lin, Mao commented that Takaichi's statements "seriously harm the political basis of Sino-Japanese relations", worsening the climate of public opinion between the two countries. Mao added that the Chinese side "vehemently protested" against Takaichi's statements, that China requests the Japanese side to reflect on the erroneous statements and that Beijing demands the retraction of Takaichi's comments.
On November 17, Mao Ning mentioned the four Sino-Japanese documents in detail. In 1972, the Joint Declaration between China and Japan had three passages that mentioned Taiwan. In the preface, the Joint Declaration stated that Japan “fully understands” the principles of normalization of Sino-Japanese relations. In other words, Japan admits that the PRC is China's only legitimate government. Furthermore, Taiwan is an inseparable part of the PRC — a position that Japan fully understands and respects.
In 1978, the Sino-Japanese Friendship Treaty established that the 1972 Sino-Japanese Joint Declaration is the basis for their peaceful and friendly relations. In 1998, both China and Japan reached another Joint Declaration on their common position on the Taiwan issue, namely that there is only one China and that Japan would only maintain people-to-people and regional contacts with Taiwan. Thus, Japan does not maintain official relations with Taiwan. In 2008, China and Japan reached a Joint Declaration on their strategic and mutually beneficial relations, stating in Article 5 that Japan maintains its position on Taiwan in accordance with the Sino-Japanese Joint Declaration.
Like Lin, Mao stated that the Japanese side should withdraw Prime Minister Takaichi's statements and show its "deep reflection".

On November 16, four Chinese maritime police ships took to the waters around the Diaoyu Islands (Senkaku in Japanese). Mao responded to the reporter's question by reiterating that the sovereignty of the Diaoyu Islands belongs to China and that Japan should not disturb the patrolling of Chinese maritime police ships.

Deterioration of relationships

Takaichi's statements have already provoked other Chinese reactions. On November 14, Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Sun Weidong summoned Japanese Ambassador Kenji Kanasugi, expressing strong dissatisfaction and opposition to Takaichi's statements.
On the same day, Funakoshi Takehiro, vice minister of the Japanese Foreign Ministry, summoned Wu Jianghao, Chinese ambassador to Japan, and vehemently protested against the «highly inappropriate statements» made by the Chinese consul general in Osaka, Xue Jian. It was reported that Xue posted a message on X on November 8 saying that Prime Minister Takaichi's neck should be "cut." (See: Consul General’s Record of Inflammatory Remarks Comes Under New Scrutiny in Japan | JAPAN Forward (japan-forward.com)).
Suddenly, there were no plans for Chinese Premier Li Qiang to meet Japanese Prime Minister Takaichi at the upcoming G20 Summit, while other ministerial meetings were postponed.
At the UN level, Chinese Ambassador Fu Cong wrote a letter to UN Secretary-General António Guterres on November 21, stating that Takaichi's statements were "highly dangerous" and that Japan did not regret its behavior during the Second World War. If Japan dares to intervene in the Taiwan issue, China will be determined to take measures to defend its sovereignty over Taiwan. Fu wrote: “If Japan dares to attempt armed intervention in the cross-Straits situation, it would be an act of aggression… China will resolutely exercise its right to self-defense under the Charter of the United Nations and international law and firmly defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity.” (See: China takes dispute with Japan over Taiwan to the UN and promises to defend itself | Arab News)
Many mainland Chinese have canceled their trips to Japan, as have some Hong Kong Chinese. Japanese cultural activities in China have been canceled or postponed, including the postponement of Japanese animated films Crayon Shin-chan and Cells at Work. Demon Slayer, which had already been released in mainland China, saw a decline in viewers.
On November 16, the PRC Ministry of Education warned mainland Chinese students of the need to evaluate their safety if they decide to study in Japan. Three days later, Chinese authorities suspended the import of Japanese seafood products.
At the same time, some Hong Kong Chinese have canceled their visits to Japan, although traditionally many Hong Kongers consider Japan to be their preferred destination for travel and sightseeing.

Decoding political meaning: mutual perception of threats as real

The most important political implication of the saga over Takaichi's statements is that while Japan perceives the PRC's possible action against Taiwan as real, the same perception of the Japanese threat can be seen on the PRC's side. In other words, Takaichi appears to have revealed a Japanese plan to “bail out” Taiwan if China's attack on Taiwan became reality. Thus, Japan perceives China's military strength against Taiwan not only as real, but also as a situation that “threatens its survival”. In this situation, Japanese armed forces would likely be mobilized—a point that was mentioned by Chinese officials in response to Takaichi's statements.
This Japanese military preparation to intervene in the Taiwan issue is not surprising, as the US and Japan have already formed a military alliance, together with South Korea, to deter military threats from China, North Korea and Russia. If a new Cold War looms, it is not surprising that the Japanese Self-Defense Force could be sent to help Taiwan if the island is attacked by the People's Republic of China, even as Beijing has emphasized utilizing Taiwan's “one country, two systems” model to appeal to the Taiwanese people for reunification.
Perhaps Takaichi's political advisors failed to inform her of the sensitivity of making comments about Taiwan. Mainland Chinese media, such as WeChat videos, continued to show Takaichi asking the late Japanese Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama at the Diet in 1994 about why he admitted that Japan had committed an act of aggression in World War II against China (see: Footage from the 1990s shows Takaichi challenging then-Prime Minister Murayama on responsibility for the war, “exhibiting wrong historical views” – Global Times). Takaichi said at the time: "I don't want you to apologize as our representative without authorization." It appears that Takaichi believed that the younger generation of Japanese should not be held responsible for what their ancestors did to China in World War II—a belief that may have shaped his November 7 Diet statements. Still, it was puzzling that her political advisors did not sufficiently inform her about the high degree of political sensitivity regarding the Taiwan issue, especially in the year 2025, when China celebrates the 80th anniversary of the victory against fascism.
On August 15, 1995, Murayama issued a cabinet statement stating that “Japan, following a misguided national policy, has advanced down the path of war… and, through its colonial rule and aggression, has caused tremendous harm and suffering to the people of many countries, particularly those of Asian nations.” In October 2025, Murayama passed away at the age of 101. His death perhaps marked a change in the attitude of the future Japanese Prime Minister, Sanae Takaichi. Chen Yang, a Japan expert at Liaoning University, said that «Takaichi's misguided remarks about Taiwan in the Japanese Diet are clearly not accidental slips of the tongue or momentary lapses in judgment, but rather a manifestation of his long-standing distorted historical perspective» (Global Times, November 16, 2025).
Unfortunately, Takaichi's statements coincided with a period in which China considers its sovereignty over Taiwan to be a political issue of extreme importance. At a time when the People's Republic of China is criticizing the US for supplying military weapons to Taiwan and when Beijing views Taiwanese leaders of the Democratic Progressive Party as separatists who impede mainland China's efforts at economic integration, political dialogue and reunification, Takaichi's statements on Taiwan are naturally provoking strong official reactions from China.

Is there any way out of the impasse?

Given China's official demand that the Japanese Prime Minister withdraw her statement and that Takaichi has expressed his opinion that he wants to see better relations with China, there are still ways out of the current impasse. Due to China's actions to stop the import of Japanese food products to the Chinese mainland and in light of its warning to citizens and students about visiting Japan and studying there, cultural and social interactions between the two countries will inevitably be affected, unfortunately. China is clearly putting more pressure on Japan to realize the socioeconomic impacts of Takaichi's statements.
Perhaps the way out of the current impasse is, ideally, for the Japanese prime minister to consider saying something more diplomatic when she meets with Chinese leaders — an option that appears to be ruled out in the current climate.
Another alternative is for her to consider sending a former Japanese prime minister as a special envoy, who could deliver a letter from her to Chinese leader Xi Jinping. The use of special envoys can be an effective way to manage any diplomatic impasse between Japan and China.
The third alternative is to make full use of intermediary groups, namely Japan-China friendship groups, to deliver a conciliatory message to Chinese leaders.
In March 2025, PRC Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with representatives of seven Japan-China friendship groups in Tokyo. Among the representatives were the chairman of the Japan-China Parliamentary Friendship Union and general secretary of the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan, Hiroshi Moriyama, the president of the Japan Association for the Promotion of International Trade, Yohei Kono, and other leaders of the Japan-China Friendship Association, the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association, the Japan-China Economic Association, the Japan-China Association and the Japan-China Friendship Center (see: Wang Yi holds meeting with representatives of Japan-China friendship groups Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China (fmprc.gov.cn)) However, given the gravity of Takaichi's statements, it appears that these friendship associations will likely play a follow-up role following an important visit by his special envoy to China.

Conclusion

Although the Japanese perception of possible Chinese military action against Taiwan is real, the official Chinese perception of Japanese military intervention in the Taiwan issue is also genuine. Under these circumstances, where both sides perceive each other's statements as reflecting the real intentions and political agenda behind the scenes, the recent and ongoing escalations of Sino-Japanese tensions are inevitable and natural. The crux of the problem is how both sides can ease their tensions, especially how the Japanese side can consider a way out of the current impasse, such as sending a special envoy to Beijing with a letter from Takaichi, even if the Japanese prime minister does not withdraw her provocative statement in a highly politically sensitive year. It is hoped that political wisdom will bring back normalcy to Sino-Japanese relations.

Serena, 16, carries a box of bottled water to deliver to a secondary school in Tai Po, converted into one of the temporary shelters for those affected by the fire.
In addition to the 900 residents of the Wang Fuk Court residential complex, where the fire broke out, authorities ordered residents of the neighboring Kwong Fuk Estate to leave their homes as a precaution. “This is my school, but we don't have classes today because of the fire”, explains the young woman to Lusa, who joined several colleagues to buy and donate supplies, including cookies and instant pasta.
The school is just over two kilometers from the New Territories residential complex in northern Hong Kong, which caught fire on Wednesday afternoon. On the second day, columns of smoke continue to rise into the sky and the smell of burning can be felt in the air. “Everyone knows someone who lived in Wang Fuk”, highlights Serena. “We never thought this could happen here”, he adds. But it is not only in Tai Po, located closer to the border with the metropolis of Shenzhen than to the center of Hong Kong, that the population has mobilized to help.
An elderly woman came from Tuen Mun, 30 kilometers away, with blankets and clothes. “It’s not enough for someone who lost everything they had”, laments the resident, surnamed Fong.
The social neighborhood, built in the 1980s, is made up of eight towers with nearly 30 floors and a total of 1,984 apartments, where around four thousand people lived.
According to the local press, the fire also led many people to try to donate blood, running out of appointments in the center of Causeway Bay yesterday.
The fire caused at least 75 deaths and 68 injuries, including 16 in critical condition, the Hong Kong fire department said yesterday. This is already the deadliest fire in the city's history. In 1996, when Hong Kong was still a British colony, a fire in a commercial building in Jordan, in the Kowloon area, caused 41 deaths and 81 injuries.
The fire department said it had already managed to contact several of the 279 people who were initially listed as missing.
The temperature “is very high and there are floors where we cannot contact the people who called for help, but we will continue to try”, assured the deputy director of the fire department, Derek Armstrong Chan. At the scene, the black smoke that spread throughout the area began to decrease, allowing firefighters to use ladders to fight the flames, which were still active yesterday, especially on the higher floors.
Police arrested three men on suspicion of voluntary manslaughter after discovering flammable materials left during maintenance work that led to the fire spreading quickly through the bamboo floors.
Family members despair for news of those missing in the Hong Kong fire
A day after the deadliest fire broke out in Hong Kong in more than 100 years, with firefighters still fighting the flames, the families of the 279 missing are desperate for news. “Did you see this girl?” a mother asks the Lusa journalist in Cantonese, before switching to English. “Did you see my daughter or the ‘helper’?” he says, using the expression used in Hong Kong for domestic workers.
The woman, surnamed Cheng, waves a piece of paper on which she has printed a photograph of her five-year-old daughter, Hannah Cheng, and a copy of the work permit of the maid, Indonesian Maryan.
The family lived in Wang Tai House, part of the Wang Fuk Court residential complex, where the fire broke out on Wednesday afternoon.
A spokeswoman for the Indonesian consulate in Hong Kong confirmed to the South China Morning Post that the dead included two Indonesian maids. "I haven't seen them since the fire started. Please, have you seen them?", Cheng begged everyone he met at the entrance to the Alice Ho Miu Ling Nethersole, the hospital located closest to the social housing complex, in Tai Po.
The fire department said it had already managed to contact several of the 279 people who were initially listed as missing.
The temperature “is very high and there are floors where we cannot contact the people who called for help, but we will continue to try”, assured the deputy director of the fire department, Derek Armstrong Chan.
A post was circulating on social media from another mother, desperate for not being able to contact her in-laws, who were taking care of her six-month-old daughter, in Wang Fuk Court. "Almost 24 hours have passed [since the last contact] (…) My daughter needs to be breastfed otherwise she will die. Can anyone tell me if she was saved or not?", wrote Winnie Hui.
The Hong Kong Government yesterday created a fund with 300 million local dollars for the victims of the fire.
At a twice-postponed press conference, Chief Executive John Lee said that the fund, created at the state-owned Bank of China, began accepting donations yesterday. John Lee also announced that the Government will distribute 10 thousand Hong Kong dollars to each family affected by the fire at the Wang Fuk Court social housing complex.
Hong Kong suspends campaign and considers postponing legislative elections
The leader of the Hong Kong Government admitted yesterday that elections for the local parliament, scheduled for December 7, could be postponed, following the deadliest fire in the city's history. "We will carry out a thorough analysis and make a decision within a few days based on Hong Kong's overall interests," said John Lee, following an emergency meeting with heads of various government departments.
The Chief Executive added that the debates between candidates for the Legislative Council of Hong Kong that were scheduled for yesterday and today have been postponed, with no new date set.
The remaining election campaign activities were also suspended, John Lee told journalists. "The Government is committed to dealing with this major disaster. Our priority now is to fight the fire", highlighted the leader. "The top priority is to extinguish the fire and rescue the trapped residents. The second task is to treat the injured, the third is to deal with the consequences, and then we will carry out a thorough investigation," Lee added. "As for other matters, we will decide what to do in a few days, after we coordinate our work," said the government leader.
 
Hong Kong opens anti-corruption investigation
The Hong Kong Government yesterday announced the launch of an anti-corruption investigation following the deadliest fire in the city's history. Hong Kong's Independent Anti-Corruption Commission has set up “a working group to launch a full investigation into possible corruption in the major Wang Fuk Court renovation project in Tai Po.” In a statement, the commission justified the decision with “the immense public interest involved” in what is already the deadliest fire in the city's history, with at least 75 confirmed deaths and 279 missing.</description><pubDate>2025-11-27 23:10:31</pubDate></item><item><title>Group of Dili Portuguese School teachers on strike</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/11/27/grupo-de-professores-de-escola-portuguesa-de-dili-em-greve/</link><description>A group of teachers from the Portuguese School of Dili carried out a strike yesterday to demand payment of the installation allowance, which was initially allocated to them and which they will now have to return. “The supervisory authority’s failure to comply with the legislation regarding the payment of the installation allowance [to which we consider ourselves entitled] led to this strike and is the result of the need to express concern and dissatisfaction with the employment situation that has affected us in recent months, as well as to defend the rights and guarantees that Portuguese legislation enshrines for workers in public functions”, say the teachers in a press release.
The group of 31 teachers were teaching at the Escola Portuguesa de Díli on statutory mobility, having finished their duties on August 31, 2025.
The teachers competed in the internal competition, held in July 2025, but the result and respective acceptance only happened when they were already on vacation in Portugal.
When they left for Portugal, the teachers left their homes and sold means of transport, because they did not know the results of the competition, and they consider that they are entitled to the installation subsidy not only because it is a new contract, but also because they had to resettle in the Timorese capital.
The group, of around 30 teachers from the Escola Portuguesa de Díli, had initially called for an indefinite strike from October 30th, but decided to suspend the strike, after the management of the Escola Portuguesa de Díli revoked the decision to return the said subsidy.
This month, a new service order cancels the decision made and requires those teachers to return the installation subsidy. “In this context, these teachers feel that the final position taken by the management is not properly substantiated, it creates instability and a feeling of discouragement that does not benefit a good climate at the school, which is important for the development of the pedagogical process”, they highlight in the note.</description><pubDate>2025-11-27 23:08:35</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
