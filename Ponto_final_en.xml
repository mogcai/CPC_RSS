Of these, 8.2 billion (85.4%) came from gaming concessions. Budget execution data for January were published yesterday on the website of the Directorate of Financial Services (DSF).
It is worth remembering that last January, casinos achieved gross revenues worth 22.6 billion patacas. The revision to the gaming law, which came into force in 2022, stipulates that gaming sector concessionaires that operate casinos in the territory must pay a direct tax of 35% of their revenue.
DSF data also shows that public expenditure decreased by 0.9% in January compared to the same month in 2025. The region spent 4.67 billion patacas last month. The main reason for the drop was expenses with the operation of public administration, which shrank by more than half (55%), to less than 63 million patacas.
Spending on public works – the Administration Investment and Expense Plan (PIDDA) – increased by 4.2% in January, to 619.7 million patacas. This is despite the fact that the budget foresees an 8.6% drop in the PIDDA this year, which includes large projects such as the Eastern Line of the Light Rail, which will reach Portas do Cerco. Spending on social support and subsidies also grew by 0.4% compared to the first month of 2024, to 2.8 billion patacas.
This year's budget includes tax benefits to attract investment fund management companies, special investment funds and fund investors to help develop the financial sector.
Furthermore, the Government exempted the purchase of their first home by residents, up to six million patacas, from stamp duty, in a document that predicted a 4.3% increase in social support and subsidies.
In July, the Legislative Assembly had also approved a Government proposal to increase the expenses foreseen in the 2025 budget by 2.86 billion patacas, to reinforce social support. The review includes the creation of a subsidy, worth a total of MOP54,000, for children up to three years old, in an attempt to increase the lowest birth rate in the world.</description><pubDate>2026-02-11 23:22:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Bank profits in Macau rise by almost 93%</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2026/02/11/lucros-de-bancos-em-macau-com-subida-de-quase-93/</link><description>After four consecutive years of negative operating results, in 2025 the banking sector saw a considerable recovery in profits of 92.7%. The operating results of Macau banks reached 7.337 billion patacas, according to the Macau Monetary Authority.

Macau banks recorded exponential growth in operating results and closed the year 2025 with an operating profit of 7.337 billion patacas. The amount marked a strong recovery of 92.72% compared to the 3.807 billion patacas recorded in the previous year.
This positive balance of the banking sector was driven by factors such as the increase in interest margin and other bank income. The performance simultaneously put an end to a four-year consecutive decline in operating results that began in 2021.
According to data released by the Macau Monetary Authority (AMCM), banks' operating profit last year, despite the significant increase, was the third worst in the last 12 years. The banking sector's profit reached its lowest level in the last two years, while in 2022 the account ended with 13.183 billion patacas, 16.241 billion patacas in 2021 and 16.966 billion patacas in 2020, even with the impact of the epidemic outbreak.
AMCM information shows that banks' interest margin increased to 17.521 billion patacas last year, a positive difference of 8.41% compared to 16.162 billion patacas in 2024, as the decrease in interest costs exceeded interest income.
In 2025, the costs of passive interest operations totaled 64.365 billion patacas, a decrease of 19.17% compared to 79.634 billion patacas in the previous year. Income from active operations stood at 81.886 billion patacas, representing a reduction of 14.52% compared to the 95.796 billion patacas recorded in 2024.
With regard to other bank income, which accumulated 11.281 billion patacas by the end of last year, revenue from services from banking operations in Macau reached 9.644 billion patacas, an increase of 21.95% compared to 7.908 billion patacas in the previous year.
The banking sector also earned 1.032 billion patacas in income from financial investments, a slight drop of 0.8% in annual terms. They also had income of 604 million patacas from “other income”.
In this case, local banks had, by the end of 2025, 17.465 billion patacas as free resources, which is the sum of operating results, appropriations for amortizations and appropriations for provisions.
The balance sheet of local banks indicated, on the other hand, an annual increase in reserves of 14.4%, from 32.227 billion patacas to 36.854 billion patacas, at the same time that cash reserves abroad increased by 14.4%.

BAD CREDIT FALLS
 
The non-performing credit ratio until December last year saw a decrease of 0.6 percentage points in monthly terms, dropping to 4.9%, reaching the lowest level since July 2024. The amount of overdue credit involved totaled 49.656 billion patacas, a drop of 10.55% compared to the 55.514 billion patacas recorded in November last year.
Among these values, the non-performing credit ratio of residents stood at 4.2%, a monthly reduction of 0.4 percentage points, involving an amount of 20.542 billion patacas. The same non-performing credit ratio for non-residents was 5.6%, which also decreased by 0.8 percentage points in monthly terms, involving an amount of 29.114 billion patacas.</description><pubDate>2026-02-11 23:28:57</pubDate></item><item><title>A restaurant and some events in the capital</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2026/02/11/um-restaurante-e-alguns-eventos-na-capital/</link><description>He came from Macau to Lisbon, when he was 20 years old, and wanted to promote Macanese gastronomy. Being part of one of the oldest families in the territory, Graça Pacheco Jorge, who is now 83 years old, says that she took this mission into her own hands, as no one knew about it in Portugal, and published her first cookbook in the 90s.
He's been here all his life, but he's always focused on promoting his homeland's cuisine, despite not claiming to be a specialist. “I’m just a Macanese in love with my identity”, she declares. Therefore, throughout her life, she was always linked to the Casa de Macau in Lisbon. “For many years, I held lunches and workshops there,” he reveals.
With her maternal family in Macau since the 17th century, she reveals that she “had the privilege” of inheriting her grandmother's handwritten recipes. And it was based on these that his book was born.
Nowadays, he no longer cooks. Only when the children and their families come to your house. “I always cooked Macau food at home and our friends would come over and enjoy it,” he says.
The grandchildren's favorite is minchi, which is, in fact, the territory's emblematic dish. “I also made special dishes for Christmas, Easter and Carnival,” he says. However, today, many of their descendants also cook at home. “They learned from me and I have grandchildren who also cook and ask for the recipes”, she says, proudly. But why did no one want to open a space solely dedicated to Macanese food, in Lisbon? Don't know. For many years, he worked with the then Macau Mission (currently, Macau Economic and Commercial Delegation) and went to all the cooking schools, from the north to the south of the country, to promote the territory's gastronomy and, perhaps, encourage a student to move into a similar business. But he never managed to convince anyone.
For his part, Austin Bush, an American photographer and journalist specialized in gastronomy who has been in Lisbon for four years, is fascinated by Macau's food, having lived for many years in Asia and passing through the territory around ten times. “Macanese food is this interesting bridge between where I lived and where I live”, he says.
To satisfy the cravings, she usually makes it at home, following the recipe books by Cecília Jorge, Graça Pacheco Jorge or Antonieta Manhão. “I make minchi, chapel and okra and shrimp curries, for example,” he says. He assumes that Lisbon's offer is scarce in this field, ending up choosing to prepare Macanese dishes himself. He doesn't know why he doesn't find so much offer in the capital, but he suggests that it may have to do with the older age of the community.
Wednesday lunches
 
Graça Pacheco Jorge was involved in Macanese lunches, which were organized at the Casa de Macau in Lisbon, for many years, but nowadays, no longer. The person who took the lead was Maria João Ferreira, vice-president of this organization. “Casa de Macau even had a cook and made lunches very regularly, at times, but then it started to have less importance”, he says.
Two years ago, with new management, there was an attempt to “resurrect lunches on Wednesdays”. First, they started with a weekly experience with chef Justina Rosário, a native of the territory, who focused more on Asian food and, now, they are focusing on Macanese cuisine, every 15 days. “In fact, on Wednesdays, we are offering some dishes that we used to make for our fat teas,” he says. The menu includes a starter, which can be chicken or vegetable broth, in addition to the usual appetizers, such as xilicote or pastelinhas. You can have bafassá pork — pork seasoned with saffron and simultaneously stewed and roasted — in addition to serving desserts, such as tapioca cooked with coconut milk. The chefs are the mainstay of the house — the idea is to divide the work between Maria João Pires, an employee at the Casa de Macau secretariat, and Maria João Ferreira.
In addition to these lunches, which take place on Wednesdays, for members and non-members, there is another event, entitled “Hoje tem minchi”, which has up to 100 registrations, in parallel with occasional cooking workshops.
Maria João Ferreira has no professional training in the area, but, during her adolescence, she took cooking classes in the territory, ending up learning a lot there. But you're not alone. After all, he shares the responsibility of gastronomy with Macanese Edite Lopes. “She spends six months in Macau and six months here and, when she is here, everything is done with her support”, he says.
An Asian Urban Cuisine, in Lisbon
 
Sara Veríssimo lived in Macau for 10 years, between 1988 and 1998, and is the previous owner of Cozinha Urbana, an Asian food restaurant, which included minchi on its menu. Located on Calçada do Monte, in Lisbon, it only operated between July 2015 and October 2016, ending up closing due to the crisis. “My restaurant wasn’t focused on Macanese cuisine, I made some jokes there,” he says, clarifying that it was fusion food with dishes from Japan, Thailand and some things from the territory. “In Macau, there was only one fixed dish: minchi”, he highlights. Sporadically, he ended up making a xilicote and a chapel for specific events. “This is all a bit of memories and many cooks work like this: what they ate is ingrained in them”, he says. He never really specialized in Macanese cuisine and, currently, it is a little removed from his life.
Regarding the lack of options in Lisbon, he offers a theory: “Chefs who lived in Macau or have connections to Macau must be rare”.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Where to eat mochi… in Lisbon?</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2026/02/11/ondi-come-minchi-em-lisboa/</link><description>The answer is: at the Patuá restaurant, at Casa de Macau, in one or another Cantonese food space or at sporadic events that take place in the city. Other than that, only in private homes of Macanese people and their descendants, spread across Lisbon. And whoever says minchi is also talking about other dishes, such as bafassá pork, balichão, xilicotes and everything that makes up Macanese gastronomy.

It is called Patuá, after the Portuguese-based Creole language, and is located on Rua Angelina Vidal, in Lisbon, although its first address was on Rua da Ilha de São Tomé, in October 2019. With Francisco Rodrigues in the kitchen and Daniela Silvestre welcoming customers, it is the restaurant in Lisbon that includes the largest number of Macanese delicacies on its menu: among the favorites of those who visit are minchi and sambal de eggplant. But how did it all start?
They fell in love around pots, in one of Lisbon's best-known nightlife spaces, Damas, and, today, they are companions in life and business. "We have always worked in the kitchen. Daniela, however, decided to become a more serious professional and it was then that we thought about opening our own space", reveals Francisco. An Asian restaurant, which included dishes he always ate at home, seemed only natural. “That’s what I ate growing up,” says the Macanese chef.
At the beginning, in October 2019, the menu was less focused on Macanese cuisine, even though it already included minchi. “We had everything, but sometimes there was a woodpecker in the middle”, says Daniela. It was a phase of adaptation and experimentation. “We adapted and then there was a moment when we felt that there was an openness and demand for Macanese things”, he reveals. They then realized that there was little on offer in the capital of Alfacinha, with some places offering other types of dishes from the province of Guangdong. “We have Macau Dim Sum”, for example, which, sometimes, in its special dishes, hides some Macanese delicacies, along with Cantonese food.
To prepare the menu, they started contacting Macau's aunts, but they also communicated, on Facebook pages, with the Macanese population in general, when they were looking for a specific recipe. "We had a really cool episode with Dona Aida's daughter, from Riquexó, in Macau. We wanted to make the chacha recipe and everyone started sending recipes", says Daniela.
Nowadays, Portuguese and foreigners tend to go to the restaurant, but also many Macanese. “There are a lot of different people who come from all over, even people from Hong Kong who appear lost in Lisbon”, he comments. “Now we have had a wave of Macanese who are in California and Canada”, adds Francisco.

A tribute to origins
 
The chef grew up near Lisbon and never set foot in Macau, but his maternal family is Macanese. “My grandmother was Chinese from Guangzhou,” he says. “My grandfather went to Macau in 1910, but, on my grandmother's side, who was Chinese from Guangzhou, there were Portuguese military families, who had been there since 1812.”
At home, therefore, the menu always included Macanese food. It wasn't so much the mother who cooked, but more the aunts and uncle, even if they didn't live in their house at the time. “Usually, the guys always stayed at each other’s houses [when they came from Macau] and everything got together”, he declares, explaining that it has always been like that. And that's how it grew: watching people cook, tasting and helping, from time to time.
He grew up fascinated by Cantonese food, such as cha siu, siu yuks and the Cantonese barbecue trilogy. When it comes to Macanese gastronomy, I liked the minchi the most and all the tancaro dishes. “My family was in Taipa for a long time and there was a connection with the boat people [the tancás]”, he says. Afterwards, the grandfather, being a soldier and, later, belonging to the PSP, lived, like three brothers, in a series of crowded houses, all together. “These people mixed a lot, they were all Singh, from Jaipur, from northern India”, he adds, clarifying that this means that “someone will eat goat curry and that goat will exist forever and ever in the memory of those people who gathered on that street.”
For him, this is the spirit of Macanese food. “It was what was gathered at those tables, in those houses, when it was Christmas, for example, or when it was Chinese New Year.

A vegan menu
 
A different feature of Patuá's menu is the inclusion of several vegan options, which is not very common in Macanese cuisine. “We have always made minchi and vegan minchi”, says Daniela. And, for example, in the eggplant sambal, which is traditionally fried in lard, they chose to use oil. “Shrimp paste is also out: it’s really vegan,” he says.
The menu, over time, and from the first to the second restaurant, has diversified, although some dishes can never be removed. “I took the eggplant sambal for two days and it wasn’t a good experience,” the chef says, laughing.
And, during these tests, he noticed something that left him quite disappointed: "People here don't use steam. Steamed chicken, for example, minced pork or steamed shrimp. I found beautiful groupers on the stone to put in those steamed dishes and no one caught them."
The clientele also changed, from the first to the second restaurant. “In the beginning, it was our neighbors, who were curious and helped to overcome COVID-19, because there was a lot of solidarity from the neighborhood”, but in this “new” address there are more tourists.
Although they were not dissatisfied, the change of location was not voluntary. “They tried to double the rent, we closed and went to Oslo [Norway]”, he declares. An opportunity then arose to form a partnership with the owners of the A Tabanca restaurant. They grabbed her and here they are, on Angelina Vidal Street.
For the future, they are considering expanding the structure, in order to be able to prepare other types of dishes. “Having a steam table and your own wok station, making things in larger quantities and with higher quality”, specifies the chef.
As for the ingredients, you can find most of them at Hua Ta Li or Chen Supermarket and what is missing ends up coming directly from Macau. “We always improvise balichão with shrimp paste, but it lacks the salty and spicy flavor of dry Macanese balichão”, he admits. “When someone goes there, we always ask and there are customers who bring them”, adds Daniela. If something essential fails, it exits the menu.

How to cook for Macanese?
 
They are the most demanding and, at times, critical customers. There are some who sometimes complain that minchi is “savory”. Francisco warns that the recipe he follows does not use oyster sauce. “It contains dark soy, Chinese wine and five spices,” he reveals. But, in his opinion, different people, from different eras, enjoy different styles of this dish.
As it is something that affects so much identity and the past, it ends up being a more sensitive subject. "Mine is a family recipe. I only changed one thing, because my mother, at the time, couldn't find it: they couldn't find five spices in Lisbon, and so they used garam massala and saffron to simulate five spices", he says.
When he was young, Francisco even tried to compile some recipes from the Macanese people around him, in an attempt to rescue the memory of the elderly. He quickly gave up, as there were many who insisted on not sharing. “Nobody wanted to open the game”, he comments, laughing.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>MP warns that he will “severely punish crimes against national security”</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2026/02/11/mp-avisa-que-ira-punir-severamente-os-crimes-contra-a-seguranca-nacional/</link><description>The State Council recently published the “White Paper on the implementation of national security defense in Hong Kong under the principle of ‘one country, two systems’”.

The exercise simulated the entry of an individual with an unstable emotional state into a school, taking the teaching staff hostage. During the exercise, the school strictly followed the defined plan, immediately activating the school crisis management mechanism and reporting what happened to the police. At the same time, he blocked the place and carried out counseling and control work on the suspect, as well as immediately organizing the evacuation of teachers and students to a safe location, keeping the doors and windows locked.
After receiving the notification, CPSP personnel rushed to the scene, set up the security perimeter and adjusted the action plan according to the evolution of the situation. The PJ's Crisis Situations Negotiation Group soon arrived at the scene, and managed to stabilize the suspect's emotions and resolve the crisis. During the evacuation, a student fell and was injured and was transported to the hospital after preliminary treatment by CB personnel.
Authorities say that “the exercise went smoothly, positively testing the operability of the school security mechanism and the effectiveness of cooperation between the various services”.
After the drill, the participating services and the school held a joint review meeting, in order to carry out an in-depth analysis of response procedures, command, field control and coordination of rescue actions, as well as approaching improvement solutions.</description><pubDate>2026-02-11 23:22:35</pubDate></item><item><title>Forbes Travel Guide distinguishes Macau ‘resorts’</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2026/02/11/forbes-travel-guide-distingue-resorts-de-macau/</link><description>The winners of the Forbes Travel Guide 2026 awards were announced yesterday.

The building is expected to open in the second half of this year.

The Macau Catholic Center should finally open its doors “between the middle and end” of the second quarter of 2026, after a reconstruction process that has been ongoing since 2021. According to a statement sent to the newsrooms by the Macau Catholic Center association, the works are “practically completed” and are currently “in the process of improvement and submission and approval by the Government”.
The date indicated coincides with the calendar for the celebrations of the 450th anniversary of the Diocese of Macau, published on the official page, which reads that the inauguration ceremony of the project should take place between “the middle and end of the second quarter”. When publishing the program for this year's commemorative activities, the Diocese detailed that the building will have seventeen floors and will be based on the concept of “encounter between God and Humanity”.
The opening of the space will be marked with the launch of two large thematic exhibitions prepared for the occasion: “Honoring the Past, Creating the Future” and “Witness to Heritage, Mission in the World”. According to the Diocese, the two exhibitions aim to reflect the development of the local Catholic institution “from historical, personal and cultural perspectives”, also providing a preview of “its future directions”.
The Catholic Center association explains that the main mission of this building involves “disseminating and sharing the mission of the Catholic Church” in Macau, promoting “dialogue, exchange and integration of faith and culture”. The facilities provide reception services for all types of guests – visitors and pilgrims, Catholics and non-Catholics – who will be welcomed with the same spirit of “hospitality and inclusion”. In addition to accommodation, the public will also be able to enjoy dining facilities, classrooms, conference rooms and exhibition spaces. “By welcoming visitors from all over the world, the Center will not only reinforce its role as a spiritual refuge but also infuse new vitality into the religious and cultural panorama of Macau”, emphasizes the association.
In the same statement, it is mentioned that the construction costs of the religious building “increased significantly” after the Covid-19 pandemic, which caused slippage in initial forecasts. The completion of the reconstruction project was only viable thanks to the “understanding and support of the builders and contractors”, recognizes the association. At the same time, “donations from all sectors of society are very welcome to help sustain and carry forward the Catholic Center’s original mission of serving the Macau community.”
This year, the Diocese of Macau celebrates 450 years since its foundation in 1676. From January 2026 until the same month of 2027, an extensive program of commemorative activities and exhibitions is planned, under the theme “From Macau to the World: 450 Years of Mission and Mercy”.</description><pubDate>2026-02-11 23:28:07</pubDate></item><item><title>Chinese oil company CNOOC starts searching for hydrocarbons in Mozambique in March</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2026/02/11/petrolifera-chinesa-cnooc-inicia-em-marco-procura-de-hidrocarbonetos-em-mocambique/</link><description>The Mozambican Energy Minister, Estêvão Pale, assured that the Chinese state oil company CNOOC will begin exploring for hydrocarbons in March with the drilling of up to six blocks of the concession awarded in the sixth tender, launched in 2021.
"They will start very soon. In March, they will start preparing to start exploration", said the Minister of Mineral Resources and Energy, Estêvão Pale, questioned by journalists at the Mining Indaba conference, which has been taking place since Monday in Cape Town, South Africa. "Right now, we are in the initial phase, five to six more blocks", he also replied, regarding the holes to be drilled by the Chinese National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) in deep waters of the Rovuma Basin, north of the country.
On March 26, 2024, the previous Mozambican government approved five terms of concession contracts for the production of hydrocarbons – essentially natural gas – in the country, the then spokesperson for the Council of Ministers announced at the time.
These are contracts relating to the 'Offshore' Save (S6-A and S6-B) and Angoche (A6-G, A6-D and A6-E) areas, which have CNOOC Hong Kong and Empresa Nacional de Hidrocarbonetos (ENH) as concessionaires, said Filimão Suaze, after the meeting of that body in Maputo, contracts that were signed in the same year and have not yet progressed to the drilling phase. “As part of the implementation of the mineral resources policy (…), the Government of Mozambique continued with actions aimed at seeking more investments for the oil sector”, said the Government spokesperson at that time.
In December 2022, the National Petroleum Institute announced the award of these blocks to CNOOC, as a result of the sixth tender for gas and oil prospecting, launched on November 25, 2021.
The process covered 16 intervention areas: five in the Rovuma basin, seven in Angoche, two in the Zambezi Delta and two in Save, totaling more than 92,000 square kilometers. One of the regions, the Rovuma Basin, under the ocean floor in the high seas off the coast of Cabo Delgado (north of the country), already has areas allocated.
The current Minister of Energy, Estêvão Pale, questioned at the same event, assured that, for now, Mozambique has no plans for a new round of auctions for oil and gas blocks. "Not now, because we think there are still many areas for direct negotiations, which were part of the last round, that have not been developed. We now have the opportunity to continue discussions and see if we can find another potential partner," he said.
Mozambique has three development projects approved to explore natural gas reserves in the Rovuma basin, classified among the largest in the world, off the coast of Cabo Delgado.
Eni's Coral Sul project is the only one in operation since 2022, with investment in a second floating extraction platform, called Coral Norte, having been approved last October, in an investment of 7.2 billion dollars, which from 2028 will allow production to be doubled to 7 million tons per year (mtpa) of liquefied natural gas.
After four years of suspension due to the terrorist attacks in Cabo Delgado, the Mozambique LNG project (Area 1), operated by TotalEnergies, worth US$20 billion, officially resumed last January and is expected to produce up to 13 mtpa from 2029, followed by the Rovuma LNG project (Area 4), worth US$30 billion, operated by ExxonMobil, with 18 mtpa expected after 2030, and whose final investment decision is expected this year.

On an experimental basis, the no-smoking zone area covers the promenade around Parque Dr. Carlos d’ Assumpção and its open space on the south side, the promenades on both sides of the buildings, i.e. the promenade from the Cheng Feng Shopping Center to THE CARAT Building, as well as the promenade from the “Hot Line” Building to the “Vista Magnífica Court” Building. At the entrance to the no-smoking area, the white lines are marked with a warning that says “smoking is prohibited in this area, with the exception of the area designated for smokers”, and signs and posters are posted throughout the area to warn smokers.
In the area, there are nine designated smoking points, delimited by a dotted white line, where garbage bins with ashtrays are placed, and the smoking points are located next to the main road, trying to be as far away as possible from the entrance and exit of buildings, bus stops and pedestrian crossings.
Before implementing the measure in this location, Health Services workers distributed, in recent days, promotional leaflets and explanations to nearby commercial establishments, residents and tourists. During the trial period, Health Services staff will carry out random inspections and, if they detect smokers who do not smoke in the designated smoking area, the smokers in question will receive a warning and no sanctions will be applied. Smokers should pay attention to places where smoking is legally prohibited, such as Parque Dr. Carlos d'Assumpção, bus stops and other places. In case of violation, a fine of 1,500 patacas will be imposed.</description><pubDate>2026-02-11 23:23:10</pubDate></item><item><title>Cultural Institute completes second phase of restoration work on the Ruins of São Paulo</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2026/02/11/instituto-cultural-conclui-segunda-fase-das-obras-de-restauro-das-ruinas-de-sao-paulo/</link><description>The second phase of the restoration of the bronze statues in the Ruins of São Paulo was successfully completed, the Cultural Institute (IC) announced yesterday in a statement. Six of the seven bronze statues have already been repaired, with only one last phase remaining, which will focus on maintaining the statue of the dove representing the Holy Spirit.

The Cultural Institute (IC) announced yesterday that the second phase of the restoration and maintenance work on the bronze statues on the facade of the Ruins of São Paulo has now been completed. The archaeological site of the former Colégio de São Paulo, including the Museum of Sacred Art and Crypt and the virtual reality exhibition, also reopened to the public after the temporary closure of the facilities.
The first phase of works, remember, took place from May to June last year and focused on two statues on the second level and the statue of the Virgin Mary on the third level. At the time, the director of the IC, Leong Wai Man, said that this figure was the one that had deteriorated the most over time, appearing “severely corroded” despite regular cleaning actions and the installation of bird-deterring nails.
The second phase involved the repair of two bronze statues on the second level and the statue of the Baby Jesus on the fourth level. Although initially scheduled for mid-October 2025, with completion at the end of November, the works were postponed until the beginning of this year to avoid coinciding with the peak tourism season in the region.
For the third phase, all that remains is to clean and restore the seventh statue on the upper level: the white dove that represents the Holy Spirit. With this latest intervention, the program of the Center for Preservation and Transmission of Cultural Heritage of the Palace Museum will be completed, a center opened in November 2024 through cooperation between the Macao SAR Government and the Palace Museum, in Beijing.
The first major project of this cultural space was, precisely, the restoration of the facade of the Ruins of São Paulo. The work team included experts from the Palace Museum, international experts in metal conservation and professionals from higher education institutions in Macau, according to the IC in a statement.
The organization also says it considered factors “such as the typhoon season, safety in the workplace or peak tourist periods” when planning the restoration project, divided into three independent phases.
At the end of last year, upon news of the postponement of the second phase, the IC issued a statement in which it committed to moving forward with the works “strictly following the requirements for the preservation and restoration of cultural heritage and monuments and based on the principles of authenticity, integrity, minimum intervention and reversibility”.
At the same time, Leong Wai Man revealed that academic seminars and expert exchange activities would be organized in parallel to the second phase of works, in order to promote exchanges between experts and reinforce Macau's commitment to heritage preservation before the international community.
This was what happened at the end of January, when national and international experts gathered at the Macau Museum of Art for the “Symposium on Conservation and Restoration of Cultural Heritage”, in which the challenges and techniques applied in the restoration of the Ruins of São Paulo were discussed.</description><pubDate>2026-02-11 23:28:03</pubDate></item><item><title>Sam Hou Fai reaffirms support for the Macanese community in a meeting with representatives</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2026/02/11/sam-hou-fai-reafirma-apoio-a-comunidade-macaense-em-encontro-com-representantes/</link><description>The Chief Executive recently met with representatives of the Macanese community, reiterating the Macao SAR Government's commitment to supporting its development. During the meeting, he highlighted the unique and important role of the community in Macau, encouraged its active participation in integration with Hengqin and the Greater Bay Area, and highlighted government priorities for the current year, including public administration reform and economic diversification.

The Chief Executive, Sam Hou Fai, met last Monday with representatives of the Macanese community, in a meeting where he reaffirmed the Macao SAR Government's continued support for this important community. During his speech, Sam Hou Fai highlighted that the year 2025 was marked by a “good start” for the current government, with economic and social development progressing stably and achieving the main governance objectives.
The executive leader highlighted that the work carried out by Macao SAR over the last year received “full recognition” from the President of the People's Republic of China and the Central Government, a result that he considered inseparable from the “active participation and important contribution” of sectors such as the Macanese community. Specifically, he praised its role in the areas of cultural exchange, social services, law, education and restoration, highlighting the “unique and important status and role” it holds in Macanese society.
Looking to the future, Sam Hou Fai outlined the Government's priorities for the current year. He stated that the Macao SAR will strictly implement the spirit of President Xi Jinping's speeches, coordinate with the country's 15th Five-Year Plan and promote the objectives of Macau's 3rd Five-Year Plan. Government action, explained Sam Hou Fai, will be based on two main axes, namely, the “reform of public administration and the adequate diversification of the economy”, simultaneously pursuing “four relevant projects” in an orderly manner.
In this context, the Chief Executive expressed his belief that the Macanese community has “ample opportunities to contribute significantly”. He encouraged it to take advantage of its unique advantages in language, culture, gastronomy and international connections to help Macau become a relevant “gate” in opening the country to the outside world and a privileged “window” for exchange between civilizations.
A specific call was made for more active participation in the Hengqin Cooperation Zone and the construction of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. The Chief Executive assured that he was available to work together with the community to “tell the story of Macau well” in the implementation of “One Country, Two Systems”.
The meeting also served to reinforce the importance of the Macao SAR's “predominance of executive power” system. Sam Hou Fai stressed that this system works smoothly and will be used to promote good governance. Taking into account that many Macanese work in public administration and the legal sector, he expressed the expectation that everyone understands and promotes this principle, in order to “take advantage of the new situation in the Macao SAR and keep up with the accelerated pace of this new era”.
The direct meeting between the Chief Executive and representatives of the Macanese community is part of the closer governance strategy that has been a hallmark of the current administration, aiming to maintain an open channel of dialogue with the various social sectors. The meeting reinforces the vision that Macau's sustainable development and social cohesion depend on the involvement of all its communities, capitalizing on their specific knowledge and their historical and cultural connection.</description><pubDate>2026-02-11 23:27:02</pubDate></item><item><title>Bytedance launches new AI model capable of generating more realistic videos</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2026/02/11/bytedance-lanca-novo-modelo-de-ia-capaz-de-gerar-videos-mais-realistas/</link><description>The company ByteDance has attracted the attention of users and investors after launching an artificial intelligence model for video generation.

Chinese technology company ByteDance has attracted the attention of users and investors after launching an artificial intelligence model for video generation that analysts say “exceeds expectations in terms of realism”.
The new application, called Seedance 2.0, was launched this weekend, and its capabilities have already resulted in significant rises in the stock market for companies, not only in the technology sector, but also in the entertainment industry, with some of them reaching the daily earnings limit in recent sessions.
According to economic news portal Caixin, this model is capable of generating realistic images with fluid movements, also adding sounds that coincide with the images, which for the first time puts ByteDance in a position to compete with KlingAI, developed by the short video platform Kuaishou.
Feng Ji, producer of the popular video game Black Myth: Wukong, described Seedance 2.0 as “the most powerful video generation model yet,” and predicted a major impact on reducing production costs for film and television, as well as other types of content.
The official Seedance 2.0 portal states that the big difference compared to similar models is its ability to maintain the coherence of the characters in different scenes.
According to analysts at Kaiyuan Securities, cited by the Bloomberg agency, this new model could mark a turning point in the use of AI in film and television: "The test results are impressive. It supports text, image, video and audio input, and has achieved significant progress in crucial capabilities."
Feng also warned of the risks of the proliferation of fake videos generated by these types of services, which could lead to a crisis of trust: “Realistic fake videos will be available to everyone, and intellectual property and supervision systems will face unprecedented challenges.” "In the future, any video content that does not have an official and authorized backing – especially those with personal images and voices – may be fake. Please be sure to verify them through multiple channels to avoid being scammed," the producer wrote on social media.
Seedance 2.0 did not reach the market in isolation, as its great local rival, the aforementioned KlingAI, launched its 3.0 version on the 4th, with intelligent framing and the ability to add new images and people to the original video as major attractions.
