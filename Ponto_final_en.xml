Tai Kin Ip took the opportunity to challenge overseas Chinese to invest in Macau.

The 3rd Conference on Support of Overseas Chinese for High-Quality Development of the “One Belt, One Road” 2025 Initiative kicked off yesterday. On this occasion, Tai Kin Ip, Secretary for Economy and Finance, gave a speech to praise the role that Chinese businesspeople and community leaders have played around the world.
“Over time, Chinese businesspeople and community leaders around the world have been a valuable force in promoting global economic development and supporting the construction of the ‘one belt, one route’ initiative, as well as a crucial link in the connection between China and abroad, facilitating global trade and investment flows and cultural exchanges”, began by pointing out the ruler of the Macao SAR.
The secretary also pointed out that “Macau, as an important nodal point of ‘one lane, one route’, has a unique history of more than 400 years of cultural exchange between China and the West” and “has always been dedicated to meeting national needs” and “contributing to the construction of ‘one lane, one route'”.
This conference that started yesterday “constitutes not only a vivid illustration of the successful exercise of the ‘one country, two systems’ principle in Macau, but also an important support to promote Macau’s integration and service in the general panorama of national development”, said Tai Kin Ip.
The MSAR ruler recalled that Macau remains “committed” to “performing well the role of ‘precision interlocutor’ between China and Portuguese and Spanish-speaking countries”, deepening “cultural exchanges and economic and commercial exchanges with co-construction countries and regions, helping companies from the interior of China to expand to international markets and attracting international investors to establish themselves in Macau and Hengqin”.
Thus, Tai promised that the Macao SAR will improve “the political support system and the optimization of the business environment and provide a more solid guarantee for businesspeople and leaders of Chinese communities abroad to invest and develop businesses in Macau”, with the aim of allowing “deep integration between the resources of Chinese communities abroad and Macau's industries, such as finance, technology and cultural tourism, among others”.
At the same time, continued Tai Kin Ip, the Macao SAR Government will “consolidate the economic-commercial cooperation platform oriented towards ASEAN and radiating to Portuguese and Spanish-speaking countries, taking advantage of the bridge function of Chinese communities abroad, to promote exchange and mutual learning between civilizations, telling the story of China well and transmitting the voices of Macau”.
“We hope to be able to further consolidate the unity of hearts, gather the wisdom and mobilize the strength of Chinese communities abroad, as well as enable more friends from the diaspora to personally experience the vitality of Macau and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, transforming the ‘Macau Platform’ into a global opportunity and jointly participating in the high-quality development of the “One Belt, One Road” initiative, with a view to making a greater contribution to building a community with a shared future for humanity”, concluded the Secretary for Economy and Finance.</description><pubDate>2025-12-29 22:26:13</pubDate></item><item><title>New edition of “Os Livros e a Cidade” with a focus on art therapy</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/12/29/nova-edicao-de-os-livros-e-a-cidade-com-foco-na-arte-terapia/</link><description>The 41st edition of the publication “Os Livros e a Cidade” was recently launched, published by the Public Library of the Cultural Institute (IC), with the theme “Art Cures Life”.

Prices for five-star hotels fell by 6.4% – the 17th consecutive drop in this category, according to data collected by the Macau Hotel Association.

The average price of hotels in Macau fell in November, according to the monthly survey carried out by the Macau Hotel Association and published on the Tourism Services Directorate (DST) website. At the same time, the average hotel occupancy rate also decreased compared to the same period last year.
From a general perspective, average rates per night stood at 1,324 patacas, a drop of 5.4% compared to the same month of 2024. Prices for three-star rooms were the ones that recorded the sharpest drop, in the order of 8.6%, while four-star rooms fell by 5.4%. Rates for five-star rooms fell 6.4%, confirming a downward trend that has been occurring since June 2024 – that is, for 17 consecutive months.
Taking stock of the statistics from the last eleven months, from January to November, a general drop of 3.4% in hotel room prices per night continues to be observed. Rates for rooms rated three stars decreased by 2%, while those rated five stars saw the biggest drop: 4.9%. Conversely, four-star rooms saw a slight increase of 1.1%.
The occupancy rate, in turn, stood at 93.9%, a slight difference of 1.5% compared to the 95.4% calculated in the same month last year. The sharpest decline occurred in four-star hotels (1.6%), followed by five-star hotels (1.5%) and three-star hotels (1.3%).
On the other hand, the overall outlook for the year indicates an opposite trend. Between January and November, the occupancy rate of all types of properties belonging to the association's members grew by 1.8% compared to the same period in 2024. Three-star hotels had the biggest increase (2%), followed closely by five-star hotels (1.9%) and four-star hotels (1.3%).
According to data provided by the authorities, this year's occupancy rate peaked in August, when it stood at 96.6%. This was also the month in which hotel room rates were highest, at around 1,461 patacas per night. It is worth remembering that the month of August broke a new record in terms of monthly visitor arrivals, with the arrival of 4,219,034 tourists in Macau.
The month with the lowest occupancy rate was September, the only month in 2025 that failed to exceed 90%. Although the number of tourists passing through the territory was the highest ever for September, at least since DSEC began compiling data, more than 56% of visitors were daytrippers who spent less than a day in Macau.
For December, a month marked by more than a week of holidays and festive dates, the president of the Macau Hotel Association, Jocelyn Wong, estimated that the hotel occupancy rate would exceed 90%.
The establishments that make up the association include 27 five-star hotels, 13 four-star hotels and seven three-star hotels.</description><pubDate>2025-12-29 22:24:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Melco will continue to explore Mocha Golden Dragon, Mocha Porto Interior and Mocha Hotel Sintra</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/12/29/melco-vai-continuar-a-explorar-mocha-golden-dragon-mocha-porto-interior-e-mocha-hotel-sintra/</link><description>Melco will hire a management company to continue the operation of three gaming machine rooms – Mocha Golden Dragon, Mocha Porto Interior and Mocha Hotel Sintra. Therefore, even after the end of the transitional period after the revision of the gaming law comes into force, these three gaming rooms will remain open.

Melco will continue to operate three gaming rooms after the end of the year. They are the Mocha Golden Dragon, the Mocha Porto Interior and the Mocha Hotel Sintra. The gaming concessionaire decided to hire a management company to continue operating these gaming machine rooms, the Gaming Inspection and Coordination Directorate (DICJ) reported yesterday.
It should be remembered that the review of the gaming law carried out in 2022 stipulates that, after the end of a transitional period of three years – which ends on December 31, 2025 –, if concessionaires intend to continue operating satellite casinos, this exploration can only be done through the hiring of a management company. In this case, the concessionaire can only pay the management company the remuneration related to management, and cannot share casino revenues with it, or pay commissions.
The DICJ now explains that, taking into account that the three-year transitional period granted to satellite casinos ends at the end of this year, “the Macao SAR Government granted authorization to the request presented by Melco to operate the three existing gaming machine rooms (Mocha Golden Dragon, Mocha Porto Interior and Mocha Hotel Sintra), by hiring a management company”.
In this sense, the management company will allow Melco to continue to operate these spaces from January 1, 2026, “maintaining the employment relationship established between Melco and the workers in the same gaming machine rooms”.
“The DICJ will continue to ensure the coordination established with the concessionaires operating games of chance and the competent services, jointly promoting the healthy and orderly development of the gaming sector in Macau”, assure the authorities.
Yesterday, the Mocha Hotel Royal room was closed, which also belongs to Melco. The gaming room closed its doors at 11:59 pm on Sunday and the DICJ “immediately suspended the operation of the gaming machines, having ensured active coordination with various services, to monitor the process of removal from the respective venue, among others”. “The closure of the aforementioned gaming machine room took place in an orderly manner”, emphasize the authorities.
During the closure of this gaming machine room, the Directorate of Services for Labor Affairs (DSAL) sent staff to the site to provide clarifications to the workers concerned, and they were provided with information about an open line for further consultation. The statement also states that personnel from the Public Security Police Corps and the Judiciary Police have preserved public order at the site and in its surroundings, with the closure taking place in accordance with the prescribed procedures and in an orderly manner.</description><pubDate>2025-12-29 22:25:29</pubDate></item><item><title>South Korean Coupang offers one billion euros in coupons to customers after data leak</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/12/29/sul-coreana-coupang-oferece-mil-milhoes-de-euros-em-cupoes-a-clientes-apos-fuga-de-dados/</link><description>The South Korean e-commerce company Coupang, which in 2024 bought the Portuguese Farfetch, yesterday promised 1.7 billion won (one billion euros) to those affected by a data leak in November.

The compensation plan provides for the awarding of coupons worth 50 thousand won (approximately 30 euros) to each of the more than 33 million customers whose personal information was exposed. “All Coupang executives and employees are deeply dismayed by the concern and anxiety that the recent leak of personal information has caused our customers,” said the company's interim executive director, Harold Rogers.
The company will send text messages to affected customers to inform them about the process to redeem the vouchers, which include five thousand won (about three euros) for products, another five thousand won for the food delivery platform (Coupang Eats), 20 thousand won (12 euros) for the travel service (Coupang Travel) and another 20 thousand won for products from the Allux fashion and cosmetic line. “This incident will be an opportunity for Coupang to deeply practice ‘customer focus’ and fulfill its responsibilities to the end,” Rogers said in a statement.
On Sunday, the founder and president of the South Korean group, Kim Bom-suk, apologized for the first time for the incident.
In a statement, Kim called the insistence on waiting for the results of an internal investigation before apologizing “a bad decision.”
On Thursday, the company claimed to have identified a former employee as the person responsible for the leak and said none of the data – which included customer login credentials but not payment information or other sensitive data – was shared with third parties.
Despite the announcement, the South Korean government rejected Coupang's statement as a “one-sided allegation”, saying that a government working group created after the incident had not yet released the results of an investigation, according to the South Korean public news agency Yonhap.
Coupang, founded in South Korea but incorporated and listed on the stock exchange in the United States, operates the largest e-commerce platform in the Asian country, from where it obtains most of its revenue.
The company faces a class action lawsuit in the United States and another in South Korea due to the leak of information. Police recently searched the group's headquarters in Seoul.
In January 2024, Coupang acquired the Portuguese luxury brand sales platform Farfetch, injecting 500 million dollars (425 million euros) into the group founded by José Neves, who left the leadership.
Before the acquisition, Farfetch, the first Portuguese 'unicorn' (a 'startup' valued at more than a billion euros) had been making losses and suffering large losses on the stock market, after two years of profit in 2021 and 2022, in which it benefited from the 'boom' in online commerce.

In total, the Public Security Police Corps (CPSP) recorded 2,276,525 cross-border movements of visitors in Macau over the eight days of holidays and festive weekends.
The border posts most used by visitors arriving in the territory were Portas do Cerco (482,096 people), the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge (261,205) and the Hengqin border post (165,719). Macau International Airport also registered 112,163 passengers arriving to the city.
In an overview, the total number of entries and exits at border posts was 6,252,175, divided between 3,132,849 entries and 3,119,326 exits. According to CPSP data, 1,207,436 of these people were residents of Macau (around 39%), while 1,534,219 – that is, almost half (49%) – came from the interior of China. There were also 238,301 people from Hong Kong (7.6%), 25,499 from Taiwan (0.81%) and 127,394 from other origins and nationalities (4%).

At a press conference, the spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Lin Jian, stated that the carrying out of these exercises by the People's Liberation Army (PLA) constitutes “a severe punishment” against the “separatist forces” in Taiwan that “seek secession through force”.
Lin accused the authorities of the Democratic Progressive Party (PDP), currently in power in Taipei, of “obstinately persisting” in their pro-independence position and seeking support from the United States “to achieve secession”, investing huge resources to transform the island into a “powder keg”. “External forces that use Taiwan to contain China and that arm Taiwan will only fuel the arrogance of ‘Taiwanese independence’ and push the Taiwan Strait into a situation of serious risk of war,” warned the spokesperson, stressing that the Taiwan issue is the “core of China’s fundamental interests.” "Any mischievous conduct that crosses red lines and provokes tensions on the Taiwan issue will inevitably face a firm response from China. Any sinister maneuver to halt China's 'reunification' will fail," he added.
The exercises, called 'Mission Justice-2025', will continue until this Tuesday and come after a new escalation of tensions in the Taiwan Strait, in a context of increased military support from Washington to Taipei and recent visits to the island by Japanese politicians. Relations between Beijing and Tokyo have deteriorated in recent months, in part due to the Taiwan issue.
China's military maneuvers around Taiwan have included strikes against land and sea targets, anti-submarine operations and exercises to ensure “regional air superiority,” according to Chinese military sources.
In a statement, the Eastern Theater Command of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) reported that fighters, bombers and unmanned aerial vehicles were used, in coordination with long-range artillery, to simulate attacks against “mobile targets on land” in central areas of the Taiwan Strait.
The same Command, responsible for military operations around the island, also indicated that destroyers, frigates, fighters, bombers and unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) were mobilized for exercises in the waters and airspace north and southwest of Taiwan. “The training focused on the detection and neutralization of targets in waters and airspace, simulated attacks against land targets and real fire against maritime targets”, said the ELP, through its official account on the social network Weibo.
In a third phase, the Command announced maneuvers with warships and aircraft in the waters and airspace east of Taiwan, focused on “assaults against maritime targets, achievement of regional air superiority, hunting for submarines and anti-submarine operations”. “The exercises tested air-sea coordination capabilities and precision in searching, identifying and neutralizing targets,” the statement said.
Meng Xiangqing, professor at the National Defense University of China, told state media that “blockade and control” was one of the main aspects of the exercises, citing as examples two areas located in front of the port of Keelung, on the northeast coast of the island, and in the waters and airspace of Kaohsiung, the main port in southern Taiwan.
At the same time, the Chinese Coast Guard announced yesterday the start of “integrated law enforcement” patrols in waters close to Taiwan and in the surroundings of the Matsu and Wuqiu archipelagos, close to the Chinese coast, but under the control of Taipei. According to a statement released on the social network WeChat, the coast guards of Fujian province, located opposite Taiwan, deployed vessels to maritime areas adjacent to the mentioned areas from December 29th.
Spokesperson Zhu Anqing classified the operation as a “practical measure” to exercise jurisdiction over Taiwan and its adjacent islands, in accordance with the “One China” principle, defended by Beijing.
Taiwan authorities condemned the live-fire maneuvers initiated by China around the island, denouncing a campaign of “military intimidation” and “irrational provocations” that, according to Taipei, threaten regional peace. In a statement, government spokeswoman Karen Kuo said that stability in the Taiwan Strait and the Indo-Pacific represents a “broad consensus” of the international community and warned that Chinese military exercises “flagrantly undermine regional security” and defy international law.

Military exercises put pressure on Taipei after US support

The maneuvers launched by China around Taiwan simulate a “tightening of the siege” on the island and respond to the reinforcement of military support from the United States, according to Chinese experts cited by the official Chinese press.
The People's Liberation Army has delimited five live fire exercise zones – two to the north, two to the south and one to the east of the island – in a configuration that, according to Zhang Chi, professor at the National Defense University of China, aims to allow approaches “from multiple directions” and joint control of maritime and air space.
Speaking to the official Global Times newspaper, the academic pointed out three characteristics that differentiate the exercises from previous operations: the unprecedented proximity to the island, the three-flank configuration and the more defined tactical targets. Zhang stated that the northern areas are close to the region's main ports and target both infrastructure and “independence leaders”, in a possible blockade simulation. The eastern zone, he suggested, seeks to control a crucial corridor for possible external support for Taiwan – in a veiled allusion to the United States, Taipei's largest arms supplier.
Military analyst Fu Zhengnan, quoted by a social media account associated with Chinese state television CCTV, stated that the exercises are a direct response to Washington's recent approval of an arms sales package to Taiwan worth 11.1 billion dollars (9.43 billion euros).
According to Fu, unlike previous packages, this one includes offensive systems and command capabilities and tactical networks, which justifies, from Beijing's perspective, a “reasonable and legal” response to protect China's sovereignty.

This Sino-Lusophone festival featured a total of 780 artists and attracted more than 61 thousand participants.

The 7th Meeting in Macau – Arts and Culture Festival between China and Portuguese-speaking Countries, which was combined with the Lusofonia Festival, brought to Macau 780 national and foreign artists and performers, around 80 shows and parallel activities and attracted more than 61 thousand participants, indicated the Cultural Institute (IC) in a report made yesterday.
In the shows, historical and cultural spaces and community sites in Macau were used, in order to “display a splendid mix of different regional cultures in cultural heritage buildings full of humanistic charm, community public areas, professional theaters and other venues”.
The IC recalls that the Lusofonia Festival highlighted, over two consecutive weekends, the promotion of Angolan culture, presenting its typical gastronomy and portraits. There were also performances by artistic groups from ten Portuguese-speaking countries and regions, as well as more than 40 local Portuguese-speaking artists.
Within the scope of this festival, the event “GEG Traditional Music and Dance Shows in the Community” was also held for two consecutive weeks in several neighborhoods of Macau and also in Galaxy by the School of Music of the Guangdong Normal Polytechnic University, as well as eight groups from Portuguese-speaking countries and regions, namely Angola, Guinea-Bissau, Cape Verde, Timor-Leste, Brazil, Mozambique, Equatorial Guinea and Goa, Daman and Diu.
Dedicated to the theme “World of Fairy Tales”, the “Exhibition of Illustrated Books in Chinese and Portuguese” made more than 800 books available at the Carmo Auditorium for ten consecutive days. Book presentation sessions, puppet shows, face painting and several interactive workshops were held.
The 7th Film Festival between China and Portuguese-speaking Countries was also held, with the theme “Transcending Borders” and which presented a selection of around 30 films from East Asia and Portuguese-speaking regions.
This edition of the Festival of Arts and Culture between China and Portuguese-speaking Countries also presented the “Vanessa da Mata Concert with the Macau Chinese Orchestra” and the “Annual Arts Exhibition between China and Portuguese-speaking Countries”, which is also taking place in the Exhibition Gallery and Casa da Nostalgia at Casas da Taipa, with 28 pieces/sets of works of contemporary art, including painting, sculpture, video and installation, offering a visual feast on various media and guiding the public on a journey of self-reflection and spiritual exploration. The exhibition is open until March 1st of next year.
In addition, the “Chinese and Portuguese Tasting Workshop” organized three sessions of the “Hand Brewed Coffee Workshop” and three sessions of the “Parent and Child Workshop on Chocolate Carving Experience”.
In conclusion, the IC highlights that, “as a cultural and artistic bridge between China and Portuguese-speaking countries, Macau will remain committed to establishing platforms for cultural exchange and cooperation”.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Concerts and celebrations will liven up New Year's Eve</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/12/29/concertos-e-celebracoes-vao-animar-a-passagem-de-ano/</link><description>Macau is preparing to welcome the year 2026 with two large-scale events at Praça do Lago Sai Van and Casas da Taipa. From music to magic, including the celebration of multiculturalism, the two parties feature a diverse program – which, however, will not feature fireworks on the Peninsula side.

The Cultural Institute (IC) has prepared two events for New Year's Eve, December 31st, taking place on the Macau Peninsula and on the island of Taipa. The program includes musical performances by local and Hong Kong artists, innovative visual experiences and even a magic show.
The two events will take place simultaneously at Praça do Lago Sai Van and Casas da Taipa, under the titles “New Year’s Eve Concert – Macau 2025” and “New Year’s Eve Party – Taipa 2025”. As the name suggests, the Peninsula event focuses strictly on music, providing residents and tourists with a diverse catalog of local and neighboring artists.
The guest musicians from Hong Kong are the singer Panther Chan, known for her irreverent style, impactful lyrics and a very peculiar fusion of 'pop' and 'rock', and the band Dear Jane, which has captivated Cantonese audiences (and beyond) for over 20 years with 'power ballads' about love and feelings. As for artists from Macau, the highlight goes to the brother duo Soler, the bands thetiredeyes and Initial B and solo singers Filipe Tou, KC Ao Ieong, winifai and Jenny.
In a statement, the IC promises a musical night full of “joy and excitement”, supported on stage by an “electronic screen with lighting and visual effects” that will provide the Macau public with “a totally new visual experience”. The structure of the presentations was planned to resemble a play, reflecting “the exciting facets of the city” through the different themes interpreted by the artists. The concerts start at 10pm, ending when the clock strikes ten minutes after midnight.
The IC warns that all spectators are subject to security checks before accessing the concert area, and it is prohibited to enter the venue with large items, bottles, flammable substances or “any offensive or dangerous items”. The organization also informs that the concerts will not include fireworks displays when midnight strikes, appealing for “public attention and understanding”.

CELEBRATION OF DIVERSITY IN TAIPA

Passing the bridge to Casas da Taipa, the theme of the event is different. More than a musical celebration, cultural diversity, integration and “harmonious coexistence” between the various communities that reside in Macau are celebrated here.
The musical moments prepared for the occasion aim to spread the inclusive character of the city, including the youthful sound of the band FIDA, the patuá of Tuna Macaense, the Brazilian rhythm of Bossa Eva and the Portuguese language performed by João Gomes &amp; Band. The night ends with a performance by Hong Kong singer and actress Karen Tong, known for hits such as “Love in Wind and Rain”, “I Have a Date with Autumn” and “Sky of Serendipity”.
In addition to Chinese and Portuguese-speaking cultures, the event will also pay tribute to communities from the Philippines, India, Myanmar and Vietnam. In parallel to the great musical numbers, the Taipa stage will host demonstrations of modern and traditional dances from different countries, performed by professional dancers such as Victor Kumar, Bollywood Dreams Group or the Bisdak Association of Macau.
From 8:30 pm to 11:30 pm, the public will be able to view, in the same space, cultural exhibits from the four highlighted cultures, which will include traditional costumes, snacks and drinks and tourist information.
In addition to music, culture and gastronomy, the Taipa festival will also include a magic show. As happened at last year's celebration, magician Jason Fong will once again delight the audience with an innovative show of juggling and optical illusions.
Entry is free to both events.

The decision comes after weeks of speculation about the whereabouts and position of these officers, who have been absent from relevant military events since July, including the anniversary of the Armed Forces and the fourth plenary session of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, held in October.
Despite their expulsion from the national legislative body, the three continue to appear as members of the Party's Central Committee, the country's highest political decision-making structure.
Wang Renhua, 63, was promoted to admiral less than a year ago by Chinese President Xi Jinping, and led the Army's judicial and disciplinary structures - courts, prosecutor's offices and military prison system - becoming the third main person responsible for military security after the reform of the Armed Forces launched in 2015.
Wang's meteoric rise and abrupt fall illustrate the instability in the Chinese military hierarchy and the tightening of the 'zero tolerance' policy towards corruption.
The Chinese Ministry of Defense did not directly comment on the removals, but observers point out that the expulsions reflect a profound shakeup in the command structure and reinforce political control over strategic Defense sectors.
The anti-corruption campaign in the Armed Forces has been one of the flagships of Xi Jinping's government and has targeted dozens of senior officials in recent years, including commanders of the Air Force, Navy and nuclear forces.
The United States Department of Defense last week published its annual report on China's military power, in which it highlights that Beijing has expanded the definition of “core interest” to explicitly include Taiwan, as well as territorial claims in the South China Sea.
The report, submitted annually to the US Congress since 2000, also mentions China's military sales to Pakistan and Russia, the purge of military leaders for corruption and the technological advancement of the Chinese armed forces, with an emphasis on Artificial Intelligence. In response, a Chinese defense spokesman said on Thursday that the document misrepresents China's national defense policy and seeks to "mislead the international community" about the country's military strategy.</description><pubDate>2025-12-29 22:17:54</pubDate></item><item><title>South Korean prosecutor accuses former first lady of accepting bribes</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/12/29/ministerio-publico-sul-coreano-acusa-antiga-primeira-dama-de-aceitar-subornos/</link><description>South Korean authorities accused former first lady Kim Keon-hee of accepting bribes, including works of art, jewelry and a purse, totaling 377.25 million won (223 thousand euros) from businessmen and politicians.

South Korea's Public Prosecutor's Office (MP) yesterday accused former first lady Kim Keon-hee of accepting bribes totaling more than 223,000 euros, in addition to interfering in state affairs.
The wife of former president Yoon Suk-yeol was detained in August on a series of charges, including stock market manipulation, bribery and violations of electoral laws.
In a statement ending a six-month investigation, prosecutor Min Joong-ki said South Korean institutions were “severely harmed by abuses of power” committed by Kim.
The former first lady (2022-2025) will have “illegally interfered in state affairs behind the scenes, away from the public eye”, explained another prosecutor, Kim Hyung-geun.
The MP accuses Kim Keon-hee of accepting bribes, including works of art, jewelry and a purse, totaling 377.25 million won (223 thousand euros) from businessmen and politicians.
Kim also received two Chanel bags and a Graff necklace from Han Hak-ja, leader of the Unification Church. Other gifts included luxury jewelry, a painting by South Korean minimalist artist Lee Ufan, a Dior bag and a wristwatch.
Former President Yoon Suk-yeol denied any knowledge of these transactions when questioned by investigators, “a claim that many find difficult to accept,” according to prosecutor Kim Hyung-geun.
At the beginning of December, the MP requested a 15-year prison sentence and a fine of two billion won (1.19 million euros) for the former first lady, arguing that she placed herself “above the law” and “collaborated with a religious organization, thus compromising the constitutional separation between religion and State”. Kim Keon-hee denied all allegations, calling them “deeply unfair.”
The court is expected to deliver its verdict in relation to the former first lady on January 28.
In September, a South Korean court issued an arrest warrant for the leader of the Unification Church, also known as the Moon sect, on suspicion of having bribed Kim, who was already in pre-trial detention.
The nun Han Hak-ja, aged 82, was interrogated for nine hours, as part of this case of evidence of fraud, corruption and violation of electoral laws.
The Unification Church was founded in 1954 by Han's late husband, Moon Sun-myung, and claims to have three million followers around the world, with 300,000 “Moonies” in South Korea and 600,000 in Japan.
Prosecutor Park Sang-jin stated that the suspicions that fall on the leader of the Moon sect are related to alleged “violation of the political party financing law and the anti-corruption law” and also for alleged “destruction of evidence and embezzlement of funds”.

Both groups are expected to release their annual reports soon, but based on the latest data, BYD's accumulated advantage is such that it seems almost impossible that Tesla has managed to regain ground.
By the end of November, BYD had sold 2,066,002 fully electric vehicles, becoming the first brand to surpass this milestone. Tesla registered 1,217,902 units by the end of September.
The North American manufacturer benefited, in the third quarter, from a shopping rush caused by the end of tax incentives in the USA, which led many consumers to anticipate purchasing their vehicles. Tesla's global deliveries rose 7% year-on-year to 497,099 vehicles. Analysts predicted a rapid contraction in the following quarter.
The consensus of analysts at the financial services company FactSet points to 449 thousand units in the fourth quarter (-9.48% compared to the previous year) and a total of 1.65 million vehicles for 2025 (-7.66%). This is an annual projection well below the level already reached by BYD by November 30th.
German bank Deutsche Bank estimates that Tesla will deliver 405,000 vehicles in the fourth quarter, while analysts at Swiss bank UBS point to 415,000 – both forecasts recently revised downwards.
Deutsche Bank highlighted sales below expectations in North America (-33%), Europe (-34%) and, to a lesser extent, in China (-10%).
The TD Cowen bank presents a more optimistic estimate (429 thousand units), but highlights that the quarter was “a little delicate”, due to the end of tax incentives, which made projections difficult, according to analyst Itay Michaeli. “Tesla’s deliveries will show signs of weakness in the fourth quarter,” said the director of Wedbush Securities, Dan Ives. “A total of 420 thousand vehicles would already be enough to show some stability in demand, at a time when the market is focused on the launch of autonomous driving in 2026”, he added.
Tesla's sales have been affected by a slower-than-expected electric transition, increased competition and decisions by US President Donald Trump since returning to power in January.
The closeness between Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Trump, both during the campaign and after taking office, also affected the brand's image, leading to calls for a boycott. Sales fell sharply, especially in Europe.
The main Chinese competitor maintained a very fast growth trajectory, despite a drop in profitability in the domestic market due to consumer caution. BYD, however, accelerated its international presence. “It is one of the pioneers in installing production and supply capacity for electric vehicles outside of China,” said Jing Yang, director for Asia-Pacific at rating agency Fitch.
Geographic diversification should help the brand face an increasingly complex environment in terms of tariffs, he pointed out.
Trump imposed tariffs on imports from around the world, with even higher rates for Chinese products, which can reach up to 150% in the case of electric vehicles.
Competitors of Chinese manufacturers often denounce the high level of state subsidies granted by Beijing, which allows them to reduce prices and quickly gain market share. For Itay Michaeli, 2026 will be “the year of autonomous driving” and Tesla's future will depend on the ability to successfully achieve this technological shift.
TD Cowen predicts that Tesla could sell up to 1.98 million vehicles in 2026, but the consensus points to 1.86 million. “If they can successfully implement autonomous driving, this will boost demand for their vehicles”, commented Michaeli, who also foresees the launch of new products, such as the Semi truck and a possible SUV (sports utility) version of the Cybertruck.

The average temperature until the 18th was 19.5 degrees Celsius and in the last 26 years no December has come even close to this mark.

Although this month is not over yet and the data on the Meteorological and Geophysical Services (SMG) website is only updated up to the 18th, it is already possible to see that this month of December is being the coldest since at least 1999, the year from which data is available on the SMG website.
Between December 1 and 18 this year, the average air temperature was 19.5 degrees Celsius. Since 1999, no December has come close to this mark. Compared to December last year (17.1 °C), the difference is more than two degrees Celsius.
Since 1999, the closest December to the record so far was 2007, when the average temperature was 18.6 degrees Celsius. By contrast, the coldest December in the last 26 years was 2013, when the average temperature was just 14.7 degrees.
At the end of November, the SMG released the climate forecast for this year's winter, which said that the average air temperature during the winter of 2025, between December and February, would be normal to relatively high. The value considered normal is 15.7 to 16.7 degrees Celsius. The total precipitation predicted this winter could be normal to relatively low, with the value considered normal being 68 to 118 mm.
“Winter in Macau is mainly affected by high cold pressure at the surface of the ground located to the North, which when it moves south, forms a front and the winter monsoon brings cold and dry weather to Macau, after the front passes”, explained the SMG, who also said that the “La Niña” phenomenon was expected to continue in winter. “La Niña” is a natural phenomenon that consists of a decrease in the surface temperature of the waters of the Central and Eastern Tropical Pacific Ocean, which then affects precipitation patterns and temperatures on Earth.

RELATIVELY COLD NEW YEAR'S END

The SMG released a press release yesterday stating that the weather in Macau will be “relatively cold, both in the morning and at night”, on December 31st and January 1st. This is due to a wide band of clouds that will affect China's coastal regions on New Year's Eve, authorities explain.
The SMG predict that, on January 2nd, the weather in the region will be affected by a winter monsoon, when the temperature will drop again and the wind from the North quadrant will intensify. During the next weekend, the weather will be cold, with the air temperature dropping to 12 degrees Celsius or less, authorities say, appealing to citizens to be aware of the weather conditions and protect themselves from the cold when going out.</description><pubDate>2025-12-29 22:27:55</pubDate></item><item><title>64% of young people support the “Show City” vision, reveals survey</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/12/29/64-dos-jovens-apoiam-visao-de-cidade-do-espectaculo-revela-inquerito/</link><description>A recent study by the New Chinese Youth Association of Macau reveals that 64.2% of young people surveyed support the transformation of the territory into a “Show City”. The survey, carried out among 789 residents aged between 18 and 44, highlights the strong economic and tourist potential of the entertainment industry, but also highlights critical challenges, such as the need to improve accessibility to tickets and the underutilization of the new Outdoor Performance Venue. The association indicated its suggestions to the Government.

The entertainment industry in Macau has received strong support from its younger population, according to a specialized study released yesterday by the New Chinese Youth Association of Macau. The investigation, entitled “Thematic Study on Macau's Entertainment Industry”, concluded that 64.2% of respondents “explicitly” support the Government's vision of transforming the region into a “Spectacle City”.
The study, funded by the Macau Foundation and carried out in May through random street questionnaires to 789 young residents aged between 18 and 44, sought to understand consumer habits, attitudes towards politics and expectations for the future of the sector. The results reveal considerable optimism regarding the economic impact of the shows. Participants gave an average score of 4.25 out of 5 to the ability to “attract foreign tourists” and 4.04 out of 5 to “boost the local economy”. Almost half, exactly 45.4%, of those surveyed were optimistic about the future of the entertainment economy.
However, the study also identified significant challenges that could constrain the sector's growth. Despite strong demand, half of young people (50.2%) did not attend any paid show in Macau in the last 12 months, with lack of time (31.6%) and lack of interest in local events (24.1%) being the main reasons. The ticket purchasing experience was highlighted as a critical point. 58.4% of respondents considered it “difficult” or “very difficult” to purchase tickets for popular events through official channels.
The research dedicated a specific analysis to the Outdoor Performance Venue, in Cotai, the largest stage in the territory. The study concluded that there is a problem of underutilization and public ignorance. 28.6% of young people admitted “not knowing” the space, and 35.9% gave a neutral evaluation (“middle ground”). During its trial operation period, the venue hosted just five major events, raising questions about its programming and monetization strategy.
Based on these findings, the New Chinese Youth Association of Macau presented four main recommendations to the Government. The first involves establishing Macau's position as a “Spectacle-Friendly City”, where the Government acts as a facilitator, optimizing logistical processes such as space rental and traffic management, while the private sector leads the attraction of events. The second recommendation focuses on transforming the Outdoor Performance Space into a “high-frequency cultural point”, proposing the holding of more diverse and accessible events, such as electronic music festivals or band marathons, in addition to major concerts.
The third suggestion argues that young people should become the “central engine” for the construction of the “Spectacle City”, through the creation of a practical ladder that goes from the backstage to the stage, including the implementation of paid internship programs in entertainment companies and the creation of a system that provides opportunities for local artists to perform as opening acts at international events. Finally, the association proposes the creation of a “certification system for major shows” and the deepening of the “ticket stub economy”, where a ticket for a certified concert could be exchanged for a consumption coupon valid at small local merchants, thus directing the economic benefits of major events to the community.
The “Thematic Study on the Macao Entertainment Industry” was carried out by the New Chinese Youth Association of Macao in May 2025, with the sample margin of error being approximately 3.49% at a confidence level of 95%.</description><pubDate /></item></channel></rss>
