"We hope the United States will provide an open, fair and non-discriminatory business environment for Chinese companies that invest in the country," said Guo Jiakun, spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, at a press conference. "The Chinese government respects companies' will and encourages them to conduct commercial negotiations based on market rules," he added.
Guo also expressed the hope that it will be reached "a solution that complies with the Chinese laws and regulations and can balance the interests of the parties involved."
During the signing ceremony of the executive order, US Vice President Jd Vance justified the understanding achieved with the aim of "ensuring the functioning of Tiktok, while protecting the privacy of the data of Americans, as required by law."
In 2024, the US Congress approved legislation that determines that, for national security reasons, Tiktok would no longer operate in the country if an entity was not created independently from the Chinese mother company, Bytedance, especially in relation to the control of servers with US user data.
Vance revealed that Oracle, one of the companies involved in the new Tiktok shareholder structure in the US - valued at about $ 14 billion (about 12 billion euros) - already stored platform data even before the eventual operational separation of Bytedance.
For now, China did not officially confirm the existence of the deal, even after a telephone conversation between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping on the matter. The absence of details contrasts with Washington's firm dissemination.
One of the central points of the negotiation is the control of the application's recommendation algorithm, considered vital to its success among about 150 million US users.
In the US, the approved legislation requires any “qualified divestment” to prevent operating relationships with entities controlled by countries classified as “foreign opponents”, including the management of the algorithm.
In turn, the Chinese export control law prohibits the sale of software algorithms abroad, which would require a formal authorization from the authorities so that any transaction involving Tiktok was valid.
Also, Beijing's bytedance, refrained from disseminating details, merely stating last weekend that it will continue to "promote relevant work to ensure that the American Tiktok branch continues to provide good service to its users."

China condemns “external interference with Venezuela affairs” and criticizes USA

China condemned “external interference with Venezuela's internal affairs under any pretext” at a time when the United States maintains a military detachment in the Caribbean under the argument to combat drug trafficking.
Guo Jiakun condemned at a press conference "the threat of resorting to force in international relations and the weakening of peace and stability in Latin America and the Caribbean." According to the diplomat, "unilateral coercive measures of the United States against foreign ships in alleged international waters exceed reasonable and necessary limits, violate international law and undermine fundamental human rights, including the right to life." "US actions also represent a potential threat to the freedom and safety of navigation and can affect the freedom on the high seas that all countries are enjoying the law," added Guo.
The spokesman also stated that China "supports the reinforcement of international cooperation to combat transnational crime" and appealed to Washington to maintain "normal police and judicial cooperation through bilateral and multilateral legal frameworks."
Since mid -August, the US has highlighted in the Caribbean at least eight war ships, a rapid nuclear -propulsive attack submarine and more than 4,500 military personnel, and they classify as an operation against drug trafficking, but Caracas accuses of being an attempt to change regime.
On Thursday, the Venezuelan Minister of Foreign Affairs, Yván Gil, urged the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean to be the "spearhead" to wage what considered the "madness" of the US.

Despite not having emergencies, the hospital provides consultations of 52 specialties. The government points out that the medical institution “effectively reduces” the waiting time for consultations by residents and expects the hospital to take 25% of Macao's public health services by the end of 2027.

The Macau Union Hospital, known as the Islands Hospital, celebrated its first official anniversary. Authorities have made a positive balance at the service of the Semi-Public Hospital over the last year, noting that the institution already shares about 10% of the burden of public health services in Macao.
"The Macau Union Medical Center is already about 10% of the public health services burden, covering external consultations specialized, imaging exams, specialized surgeries, etc., effectively reducing the waiting time of residents," said Lam, secretary for social affairs and culture, in his speech in a commemorative ceremony on Saturday.
In this case, the government expects the hospital to reach the goal of assuming 25% of Macao's public health services by the end of 2027.
It is recalled that the Islands Hospital is a project of collaboration between the Macao government and the Peking Union Medical College Hospital, which began its experimental operations on December 20, 2023 and was officially inaugurated on September 16 last year.
Hospital das Ilhas does not yet have an independent emergency service, but provides free medical health services to Macao residents, after referral by health services. Currently, the institution provides medical consultations of 52 specialties, in areas such as chronic pain and anesthetic evaluation, gynecology, myopathy, cancer radiotherapy, pediatrics and nephrology, among others Pathologies.
According to the hospital's advanced data, external consultations specialized became an increase of 1.5 times compared to the previous year, having completed 17,000 consultations. The Islands Hospital, throughout the year, also received a total of 400 inpatients and performed 500 surgical operations.
In addition, with regard to the search for large -scale imaging services in Macao, namely computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (RM), the number of CT exams performed at the islands hospital represents more than a quarter of public services in this scope in the territory.
Lam, in his speech, said that the institution “has achieved many positive results” in terms of optimizing public health, exploiting high quality medicine and forming local frames, and is also reinforcing collaboration with the Conde de São Januário hospital center.
"The government has created favorable conditions to support the Macau Union Medical Center in taking advantage of the Specialized Advantage of the Union Medical College Hospital, actively promoting the diagnosis and treatment of complex, critic and rare diseases in Macao," he emphasized.
The secretary said he hopes that Macau Union Hospital will continue to reinforce the diagnosis and treatment of complex and critical diseases and introduce advanced medical technologies and equipment, as well as establishing a system of training local qualified conditions in the health area, offering them professional learning and development opportunities.
At the same time, LAM also intends that the hospital contributes to the promotion of the 'Big Health' industry and helps Macau become a regional medical center, through joint scientific research projects, academic exchanges, among others.</description><pubDate>2025-09-28 23:44:21</pubDate></item><item><title>Northwest of China wages constant struggle against desertification at Gobi's gates</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/09/28/noroeste-da-china-trava-luta-constante-contra-desertificacao-as-portas-do-gobi/</link><description>On the banks of the Gobi Desert, northwestern China, vineyards, straw grilles, and intelligent irrigation systems illustrate the constant struggle to wage desertification and create subsistence means on land once arid.

"It is unrealistic to think that we can eliminate deserts. The fight is constant to ensure that they do not cause damage to populations," Lusa Wang Xiaolin, head of Baitan's National Nature Reserve, in the Chinese province of Ningxia, was performed over 70 years by three generations of workers dedicated to combating desertification in one of the planet's most extensive arid areas.
With about 1.3 million square kilometers, the Gobi Desert is the largest in Asia and the fourth largest in the world, extending from southern Mongolia to the northwest of China, along the provinces of Gansu, Ningxia and Mongolia.
With more than 46,000 hectares of desert treated and the advance of the dunes retreated more than 20 kilometers, the Baitan reserve is today a model of ecological reforestation. Drought and cold-resistant plants, such as desert jujuba, saxaul (haloxylon ammodendron) or pastered grass (Miscanthus), which grows only one meter above the ground but with roots that extend up to seven meters, allow survival without irrigation, only with rain, Wang explained.
"The Baitan reserve, which was 90% desert, was almost fully recovered. Of the 987 square kilometers of land, almost the entire desert was treated. There are only about 13 square kilometers left as a demonstration and investigation zone," he said.
The straw grilles technique to fix the sand, introduced in the 1980s and 1990s, allowed to dramatically increase the survival rate of planted species. More recently, the “1+4” desertification control method, based on accuracy data, has been developed.
Zhang Xueyun, a peasant who has been working on desert's recovery for over three decades, recalls when "there were no roads, neither electricity, nor water." "Everything was hand -loaded," he explained. "Over time, we mechanized part of the process and recovered hundreds of hectares a year," he said.
The effect is double: fewer sand storms - a phenomenon that reaches northern China every year, destroying harvests and covering cities of dust - and more vegetation, which has contributed to increasing precipitation.
Also viticulture plays an important role. Christelle Chene, Xige brand ambassador, one of the region's largest wineries, has underlined the sector's environmental and social impact: "The vineyards help to fix sand, reduce sand storms and create jobs in the region."
Plantation density is low and almost all work is manual. "There is no one in the world to vindicate 2,000 hectares by hand. But because of the way we treat the vineyard, it is impossible to use machines," he said. The winery employs 1,500 full -time workers and benefits from a government -facilitated lease system. “Wine brought jobs and created communities,” he said. "Before, there was nothing here. Only Arid Land."
To protect the vines from the extreme cold, the drought and the strong winds, they are cultivated horizontally and are then buried during the winter. Watering is made with Gota-a-Gota systems initially imported from Israel, now replicated by Chinese companies, controlled by digital platforms that integrate meteorological data, soil moisture and water needs. “We use the yellow river water, but rigorously,” he noted to Lusa Lu Chao, director of the Ningxia Water Conservation Museum. "There is little rain and great evaporation, so each drop counts," he said.
According to the official, the region irrigated with river water grew from less than 1,330 km² before 1949 to more than 6,660 km² today.
Projects such as the Qingtongxia irrigation system, built in the 1950s, and modern flood and supply control works have not only agriculture, but also urban, industrial and ecological supply. "Desertification is a prolonged challenge, but Ningxia has shown that it is possible to contain desert advance, restore ecosystems and create sustainable development," said Wang Xiaolin.</description><pubDate>2025-09-28 23:30:53</pubDate></item><item><title>Pairing sessions provided thousands of jobs for young people residents</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/09/28/sessoes-de-emparelhamento-facultaram-milhares-de-vagas-de-emprego-a-jovens-residentes/</link><description>The various employment pairing sessions organized by the Directorate of Services for Labor Affairs (DSAL) in July and August provided thousands of job vacancies to the resident population of Macao, especially to young people and newly graded. In response to a written interpellation of Deputy Lei Chan U, the substitute director of DSAL stresses that “the resident's employment priority” and “the employment situation of young people in Macao” are priority matters for the government of Masters.

The Directorate of Services for Labor Affairs (DSAL) reported that between July and August this year, thousands of jobs were allowed to young people from Macao through the various counseling, pairing and recruitment sessions organized throughout the summer.
The data are contained in a response document to a written interpellation of Deputy Lei Chan U, in which he questioned the government about the situation of the measures created for the promotion of employment between the local population, especially the one belonging to younger age groups. In his questioning, the deputy began to recall that the report of the Governing Action Lines (LAG) for the year 2025 said that “priority to residents of access to employment” would be given, while dynamically controlled the number of non -resident workers. ”
He also recalled that the government expressed agreement with the suggestions made at the meetings of the Committee on the Public Administration of the Legislative Assembly, which stipulated “the restriction of the import authorization of non -resident workers in the restoration of leisure companies and retail, with a view to releasing jobs for local residents”.
Law Chan U said that, despite the various internship plans launched by the government, intended to raise the professional experience of young people from Macao, "the difficulty in getting a job is still great." "New jobs, especially high quality, cannot meet the needs of residents and, even if the unemployment rate remains at a low level, the quality of employment of the population has not improved significantly," he said.
Presented these points, the deputy then referred two questions to the government. In the first, it questioned the results of the studies carried out by the Committee on the Tracking of the Contracting of Non -Resident Workers, founded in 2010, and the plans that it has for the future.
Regarding this question, Dsal's substitute director Chan Chon U assured that “matters such as resident employment priority, the need for human resources by companies” and “the employment situation of Macao's youth remain the concern” of the committee, which has made visits of their members to Macao companies to learn “the real situation of development and human resources”.
“In the future, human resources needs will still be the focus of the committee's attention, so it will continue to listen and collect the opinions of different social sectors on the subject of non -resident workers, in order to help the government define labor policies,” said Chan Chon U.

Thousands of job offers at Summer events at DSAL

The second question sent to the government was related to the working group for the coordination of employment promotion, created in May of this year, and to the point of situation of the “more than 300 employment offers” identified in this context.
The Substitute Subdirector of the DSAL pointed out that, "from the perspective of employment offerings and pairing, they were collected from the integrated tourism and leisure sectors, the bank and financial, construction and various educational institutions available", covering areas such as "service to the public, administrative-loop and technical".
In July this year, DSAL held several pre-unemployment counseling and guidance sessions, in order to “provide employment pairing to young candidates”. Also the Young Employment Fair, at the Macau Tower Convention and Entertainment Center, provided in mid-July another thousands of job offers to newborn young people, including sectors such as Tourism, Hospitality, Information Technologies and Bank and Finance. Each of these events allowed "more than 1,100 job openings," said Chan Chou U, adding that "recruitment interviews [counted] with the participation of about 2,700 stakeholders."
In August, stood out the “Highlight Recruitment Session for Employment Promotion”, organized between August 20 and 22. According to a statement released at the time, the event attracted 1,279 people on the first day and was attended by more than 50 companies, which made more than 1,400 job openings available.</description><pubDate>2025-09-28 23:38:52</pubDate></item><item><title>China beats a new record with a 625 meter suspended bridge in Guizhou</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/09/28/china-bate-novo-recorde-com-ponte-suspensa-a-625-metros-em-guizhou/</link><description>China has inaugurated this weekend in the province of Guizhou, southwest of the country, which describes how the highest suspended bridge in the world, rising to 625 meters above the riverbed. After three years of construction, the Huajiang Granny Bridge opened to traffic on Sunday, reducing two hours to just a few minutes the time needed to cross the valley, known as the “slot of the world” due to its depth.
With an increase of 625 meters, the structure exceeds 60 meters to the previous world record holder-the Duge Bridge, also in Guizhou Province-and approaches 632 meters from Shanghai Tower, the highest building in China.
According to the South China Morning Post newspaper, Guizhou Hads almost half of the world's top hundred bridges in the world, due to its mountainous geography. Only three of the highest fifty fifty are out of China, all over 300 meters high.
In addition to the height, the new bridge is also the longest in the world built in the mountainous region, with a total of 2.89 kilometers. The main 1,420 meters long span consists of 93 steel beams with an estimated total weight of 22,000 tons - three times the weight of the Eiffel Tower.
Local authorities highlighted the technical challenges faced during the construction, namely the strong winds that blow in the valley and the complex geological conditions of the zone. The responsible engineers registered 21 patents associated with the technical advances developed to complete the project.
The bridge is part of China's effort to expand its infrastructure mesh in interior and mountainous regions, facilitating mobility and promoting economic development in remote areas.</description><pubDate>2025-09-28 23:31:38</pubDate></item><item><title>Black Eyed Peas returns to Macau on November 21</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/09/28/black-eyed-peas-regressam-a-macau-no-dia-21-de-novembro/</link><description>Almost two decades after the group's last passage through the territory, the Black Eyed Peas recall the old successes and present the latest topics at Macao's outdoor shows, where they will act in November. Tickets are already on sale, with prices ranging from 699 to $ 1,699 Hong Kong.

The American group Black Eyed Peas will act in Macao at 8 pm on November 21, at the outdoor spectacles site. More than 18 years after the group's last concert in The Venetian arena, the trio composed of Will.I.am, Apl.de.ap and Taboo returns to Macao with a long successful collection - including songs that had not yet been performed in the region, such as “I Gotta Feeling”, “Meet Me Halfway” or “Rock That Body”.
Macao's official outdoor shows page details that the ticket price ranges from 699 to 1,699 Hong Kong dollars, according to the location of the places and the proximity of the stage. In the middle, an intermediate section is also available for 899 and two side sections - but near the stage - for $ 1,099 from Hong Kong.

The American Rapper's big debut Travis Scott in the territory is scheduled for October 29, and some of the sections are already sold out.

2009 successes had not yet been touched in Macau
 
The premiere of the Black Eyes Peas in Macau took place on October 27, 2007 at The Venetian arena, regarding the tour "Black, Blue and You", for a hearing of about 15,000 people. In parallel to the group's discography, Rapper ’Will.i.am and singer Fergie also presented some of her solo themes -“ I Got it from My Mama ”, in the case of Will.I.am, and successes such as“ Big Girls Don't Cry ”,“ Fergalicious ”and“ London Bridge ”, played by Fergie.
The origins of the group date back to 1995, in Los Angeles, as an alternative hip hop trio. The albums "Behind the Front" and "Bridging the Gap" were released in 1998 and 2000, respectively, telling the participation of voices of ‘R&amp;B’ and ‘soul’ as Kim Hill and Macy Gray.
The third album - 2003 - marked the transition to a more fluid musical genre influenced by elements of 'pop', funk, 'rock' and Latin music. The third album was the first to have Fergie as the group's fourth element, as well as the one who dictated the group's commercial success and the beginning of the group's popularity to a mainstream audience. Some of the themes that marked this was "Hey Mama", "Shut Up" and "Where Is The Love?", With Justin Timberlake's voice in the chorus.
The fourth album was once again a resounding success, although accompanied by criticism of the lyrics of topics such as "My Humps" and the growing appeal of the band. Other featured “Monkey Business” topics of 2005 include “Pump it”, “Don't Phunk With My Heart” and “Don't Lie”.
“The E.N.D.” It was released in 2009-already after the group's debut in Macau-and marked a new musical transition, now influenced by 'EDM' and 'Electro-Funk'. The “I Gotta Feeling” and “Boom Boom Pow” successes ensured the permanence of Black Eyed Peas at the top of the “Billboard Hot 100” table for 26 consecutive weeks - a record that has not yet been overtaken by any other artist.
The fifth album, "The Beginning", was also the last as a quartet. Although public and critical reception was less enthusiastic than previous work, topics such as “The Time (Dirty Bit)” and “Just Can't Get Enough” are still highlighted. With the removal of Fergie and return to the origins as a trio, the subsequent album, "Masters of the Sun Vol. 1" (2018), was inspired by hip hop and in letters with strong political character.
Both this album and the following, “Translation” (2020) and “Elevation” (2022), are attended by J. Rey Soul as a “semi-official” member of the group. The Filipino-American singer, born in Hong Kong, is also the vocalist responsible for accompanying the group in a tour, as will happen in the show in Macao.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>China warns on the UN to danger the return of the “jungle law”</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/09/28/china-alerta-na-onu-para-perigo-do-regresso-da-lei-da-selva/</link><description>China has committed itself to the United Nations General Assembly to work with the international community in conflict resolution and warned of the danger of the return of the "jungle law."

"If the age of the jungle law will come back (…), humanity will face more bloodshed," warned Prime Minister Li Qiang by speaking at the UN headquarters in New York, representing Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Li recalled that the UN, that China is one of the founding members, was created after World War II (1939-1945) and said that since then humanity has lived 80 years of relative tranquility.
He stated that the desire for peace and development is now stronger than ever and asked the international community not to be silent or submit to "for fear of the powerful" in the face of injustices.
He considered that the world lives again a period of transformation and that “the Cold War mindset is returning”, with the world order to be questioned and the international system of the last 80 years to be disturbed.
Li said humanity is "once again in a crossroads" and that the various problems that currently affect the world worry the government of China. "How can we ignore the atrocities that make justice disappear and be impassive to what we see," he asked.
Li defended solidarity and cooperation among peoples, regardless of their differences, so that it is possible to avoid further global conflicts and, on the contrary, to foster economic development.
In this sense, multilateralism highlighted as the only way to promote peace and progress, and criticized protectionism in world trade, although without referring to the United States, which imposed unilateral customs rates.
Li said that China is ready to “adopt effective and coordinated measures” with all parts that allow you to achieve more concrete solutions to peace and stability in the world.
He asked all UN members to work together for world security, noting that it is important to respect the “legitimate concerns” of private countries.
China has warned the international community so as not to interfere with Taiwan, who considers it to be an internal issue, and threatens to take the island by stating independence.
Li also said that China is the second largest contributor to the Peace Maintenance Budget and the country that provides the most soldiers to the UN forces among security board countries.
He stressed that China contributes to promoting peace in issues such as war in Ukraine and between Palestine and Israel in the only conflicts to which he alluded.
The prime minister said President Xi Jinping has proposed a global view of the world, based on respect between nations and multilateralism. "Only when all countries receive an equal treatment and a true multilateralism is that the rights and interests of all can be protected," he added.

The storm forced to move more than 350,000 people in the archipelago, days after the passage of Super Typhoon Ragasa.
A spokesman for the Civil Defense Office, Bernardo Rafaelito Alejandro, indicated in a video statement to know ten deaths, three recorded in the Eastern Province of Master, due to the collapse of trees and houses, and the rest in the center of the Philippines. Fourteen people are still missing in the center of the Philippines, the authorities reported without further details. More than 200,000 people are still in reception centers, located in the storm's trajectory.
Known in the archipelago as Opong, the typhoon also forced evacuating 351,840 people, according to data from the Catastrophs Management Council (NDRRMC), and to decree the closure of government offices and schools.
The typhoon hit the province of Eastern Samar on Thursday night, accompanied by winds of up to 165 kilometers per hour, according to the Filipine Meteorological Agency (Pagasa), before crossing the Bicol region and the Western Island of Mindoro, losing strength as he advanced.
Bualoi has gaining strength again after entering the sea of ​​southern China, said Pagasa. The typhoon reached the north of Vietname.
The typhoon hit the archipelago after Super Typhoon Ragasa hit the north of the country last Monday, causing at least a dozen dead and 17 injured among thousands of displaced people.
Tuphins are recurring phenomena in Southeast Asia, when the hot waters of the Pacific Ocean favor the formation of cyclones, and countries like Philippines are reached every year by about twenty of these tropical storms, especially at the rainy season, which usually begins in June and ends in November or December. According to scientists, climate change is causing more frequent and intense extreme weather phenomena around the world.
The archipelago is going through a moment of popular indignation for corruption in flood control millionaire projects, designed to protect citizens from the effects of tuffles and floods and allegedly completed, but in reality nonexistent or of poor quality.</description><pubDate>2025-09-28 23:27:56</pubDate></item><item><title>Macau and Hong Kong need to prepare even worse after Ragasa, experts say</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/09/28/macau-e-hong-kong-precisam-de-preparar-futuro-ainda-pior-apos-ragasa-dizem-especialistas/</link><description>After Super Typhoon Ragasa, the most powerful storm registered on the planet in 2025, experts told Lusa that Macau and Hong Kong have to learn to live in a world of constant flooding and extreme climate.
Ragasa forced the two Chinese Special Administrative Regions to maintain the maximum tuft alert - Level 10 - for more than ten hours, a new historical record.
Authorities had warned that this super typhoon could bring comparable conditions to Mangkhut, which in September 2018 caused estimated damage to $ 4.6 billion from Hong Kong in the former British colony, and Hato, considered the worst typhoon in more than 50 years to reach Macau, which in 2017 caused ten dead and 240 injured in the territory.
The impact of Ragasa was much lower. In Hong Kong, there were about 100 people injured, 1,220 fallen trees and more than a thousand canceled flights. In Macao, the floods reached 1.51 meters, but only seven injured were recorded.
Yau Yung, professor at Lingnan University in Hong Kong, argues that it was not luck, but “structural adaptation”.
Tuphins are recurring meteorological phenomena in the Philippines, Southeast China and Taiwan during summer and fall, when the warm waters of the Pacific Ocean lead to cyclone formation.
Faith Chan Ka Shun, a professor at the University of Nottingham Ningbo, says the absence of deaths was “a victory”, which is due to improvements in the alert system and the preparation of civil protection. "This time they prepared very early, more than 12 hours [before Ragasa's passage]. People could decide to lose money because they stopped work, schools and everything else," said the Hong Kong-born academic.
In Macao, the authorities ended the casinos for 33 hours. Operators will have lost 880 million Patacas in revenues, almost 5% of the expected of September, estimated Jeffrey Kiang, analyst at Consultant CLSA, quoted by the Ggraia news portal.
Even before Ragasa's passage, Macao's government leader already showed optimism, pointing to the implementation of evacuation plans for the low areas and the annual exercise of exercise.
Sam Hou Fai also underlined the entry into operation of rainwater lifting stations and sewage projects, which “significantly improved” the ability to drain and flood prevention.
Yau Yung admitted that it would be possible to “really project a city to make it the flood test,” building “large-scale infrastructures,” such as the rails that protect the Italian city of Venice. But with much of Macau practically at sea level, a large -scale system “may not be effective or economically viable,” warned the urban planning expert.
On the other hand, it stressed Faith Chan, would make it harder for the population to enjoy the sea, part of the history and culture of both cities.
The Professor of Environmental Sciences recalled that there are areas of Macau and Hong Kong where floods are chronic during the rainy season between May and September, even without typhoons. Therefore, Chan argued that it makes more sense to build infrastructures to mitigate the impact of floods, namely underground tanks to store rainwater.
The sustainable flood management expert has given the example of the Netherlands, where parking parks are designed with space to divert rainwater.
Yau Yung argued that including rainwater tanks should be “a mandatory requirement” for any building to be built in Macau and Hong Kong. "Of course it would cost some money, but in fact, the benefits can compensate for the investment in the medium term. I would say it's a good deal," added the expert in inclusive cities.
Experts ask for education and fines to prevent deaths during tufts in Macau and Hong Kong
Experts have admitted that, in addition to educating the population, it may also be necessary to impose fines to prevent dangerous behaviors during the passage of typhoons, such as Ragasa, by Macau and Hong Kong.
A woman and five-year-old son remain in the intensive care of a Hong Kong hospital after Tuesday were taken by waves in Chai Wan, a riverside area in the city.
According to firefighters, the family decided to go to see the sea when the authorities had already recommended to the population looking for shelter, due to the passage of Super Typhoon Ragasa, the most powerful storm registered on the planet in 2025. "When a disaster happens, such as tufts or" tsunamis ", if the people are warned, the hypothesis of injuries is very reduced or minimal," said Faith Chan Ka Shun. "Unless we are talking about crazy people, who will still surf or for the beach to take a look, there are a risk," added the professor at the University of Nottingham Ningbo.
Yau Yung, a professor at Lingnan University in Hong Kong, argued that it is necessary to "educate people to really be aware and deal with these extreme climate." "I would say that, at the present time, the formation of the population is not enough, in Hong Kong and also in Macau," lamented the urban planning expert, who pointed to Japan as a good reference.
Japan is located in the fire ring, one of the world's most active seismic zones, and suffers tremors relatively frequency, so infrastructures in the country have been specially designed to resist on these occasions.
In addition, it stressed Yau, public schools in Japan include, since primary education, education on "importance and how they should respond to this type of emergency situations."
In addition, defended the sustainability expert, betting on children's education can generate "a kind of virtuous cycle," because they "can actually teach adults."
In Macao, videos of people were shared on social networks on flooded streets, fish that had escaped nurseries and aquariums in stores and restaurants, at a time when the maximum warning of typhoon was still in force. "Of course it is possible to laugh at the situation and say that it really depends on people, if they want to die to be able to see the waves climbing," admitted Faith Chan, an academic born in Hong Kong. But the Professor of Environmental Sciences recalled that dangerous behaviors during the passage of typhoons may also lead to the death of firefighters or police officers if a rescue operation is required.
After Ragasa's passage, Hong Kong police detained four people on suspicion of children's negligence because they took children to see the waves by the coast when the warning sign had already been issued.
In addition, a 54-year-old man was allegedly fined swimming on a closed public beach when the maximum alert-level 10-was in force on Wednesday.
In both Macao and Hong Kong, the tropical storm alert scale is formed by signs 1, 3, 8, 9 and 10, with the emission depending on the proximity of the storm and wind intensity.
On Thursday, Hong Kong Security Secretary Chris Tang Ping-Kung promised to consider the promulgation of a new law after dozens of residents ignored the alerts.
Faith Chan admitted that it may be necessary to punish hazardous behaviors and gave as an example the neighboring metropolis of Shenzhen, where police applied fines of two thousand yuans to those who did not stay at home. "It can be criticized, but if the [China] government continental is not strict, some people will end up paying for the offense with their own lives," Chan warned.

"The powerful dissuasive force, that is, the logic of maintenance of peace and security through strength, with nuclear forces as dorsal spine, is the unalterable stance of the Democratic Popular Républica of Korea (RPDC, North Korea)," said the leader, quoted by the North Korean Official News Agency, KCNA.
In the same vein, Kim not only presented Pyongyang's stance as "unshakable," but defended her as "the most right option for the country's present and future."
The North Korean leader also highlighted the importance of “constantly strengthening and modernizing” nuclear capacity to rely on a “shield” that allows a “reliable” defense of “national sovereignty, interests and the right to development” of the state.
To this end, he stated that both the party in power and the government will “give maximum priority to provide and support all possibilities and conditions to the field of nuclear technology for sustainable development”.
Kim's speech before the community of North Korean scientists and nuclear technicians comes after South Korea President Lee Jae Myung said on Friday that North Korea's nuclear military program is "very advanced," that the country has enough weapons to defend the regime. "
In this sense, Lee pointed out that Pyongyang already has large-capacity intercontinental ballistic missiles, which could reach the territory of the United States, and warned that if not subjected to control, it can make almost twenty nuclear bombs per year, and it is expected to have 2 tons of highly enriched uranium to build a hundred nuclear warheads.

Seoul fires warning shots to the North Korean ship on the sea border

The South Korean army fired warning shots on Friday when a North Korean merchant ship crossed the sea border between the countries, but later the vessel retreated north, South Korean authorities said.
 "Today, around 5:00 am, local time on Friday, in the northwest waters of Baengnyeong Island, a North Korean merchant ship crossed the North Limit line (LNL) and our forces issued a warning messages and fired warning shots. The ship later left our jurisdiction," South Korean joint (JCS) said in a statement.
This is the first incident of the genre in nearly three years of the fragile relations between Seoul and Pyongyang, after the refusal of North Korea in dialogue with the South Koreans and their constant criticism of Seoul. The South Korean army stated that it acted according to its protocols and is still fully prepared to respond to "firmly to any situation."
According to JCS sources, cited by the local Yonhap local news agency, it was a 140-meter-long Toksong freighter, which remained in South Korean waters for almost an hour.
The South Korean authorities added that the intrusion was probably not intentional and believe the ship has changed course to prevent Chinese fishing vessels.
The last time a merchant ship broke into South Korea was in October 2022, when the ship also returned to the north after the South Koreans fired warning shots. Pyongyang believes NLL should be directed south.

According to economists, intersectoral response capacity, uninterrupted functioning of the bag and increasing adaptation to remote work have helped to limit damage. Analysts, however, warned that the increasing frequency of extreme climate phenomena is imposing a “new normality” of annual losses on the region.
The typhoon led the authorities to activate the maximum alert sign (No. 10), paralyzing economic and social activity during Tuesday and Wednesday. Torrential rainfall, cyclonic winds and storm tides caused urban floods, landslides and severe damage to coastal areas. Among the most affected are restaurants in the riverside of Tseung Kwan O and the Fullerton Ocean Park luxury hotel, where broken glass doors and destroyed furniture were recorded. The damage rises to several million local dollars.
Gary NG, senior economist at French bank Natixis, told South China Morning Post that "the costs associated with extreme climate phenomena are becoming a constant in Hong Kong and worldwide." Economist Simon Lee estimated the total damage caused by Ragasa between 2,000 and $ 3,000 million from Hong Kong, below 4,600 million caused by Mangkhut Superirty in 2018, which left 458 injured. Lee pointed out that the retail and hotel sector were the hardest hit, with losses of about $ 1,300 million from Hong Kong.
The new regulation that allows the stock exchange to operate during adverse weather conditions was considered crucial to mitigating economic impacts. Gary NG stressed that this measure, coupled with the generalization of teleworking, limited the global impact of the storm to about 0.15% of Hong Kong's gross domestic product.
Consumption and aviation were the most penalized sectors. About a thousand flights were canceled, affecting 140,000 passengers. The schools were closed for two days and some were still without activity last Friday.
As the city begins the recovery, economists and analysts call for the reinforcement of resilience strategies to face the structural impacts of extreme climate phenomena, increasingly frequent in this Asian financial square.</description><pubDate>2025-09-28 23:37:16</pubDate></item><item><title>Macao waiting for 1.2 million tourists in the golden week of October</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/09/28/macau-a-espera-de-12-milhoes-de-turistas-na-semana-dourada-de-outubro/</link><description>The director of tourism services advanced to receive a total of 1.2 million visitors during the next week in early October, with a daily average of 150,000 arrival of tourists, exceeding last year's number. Helena de Senna Fernandes expressed optimism regarding hotel occupation rates, pointing out that hotel prices have been kept "reasonable".

Authorities are waiting to reach a new record of tourist visits to Macau in the golden week of October. Helena de Senna Fernandes, director of tourism services, believes that the number of visitors during the holidays of this year's National Day is expected to exceed last year's numbers, with a daily average of 150,000 visitors.
This year's National Day holiday coincides with the lunar cake festival, predicting a prolonged period of vacation in the interior of China, a total of eight days, after October 1 and 8. The Directorate of Tourism Services (STD) considers that people are more encouraged to travel, so the number of visitors should increase, making arrivals reach 1.2 million.
"Our forecast on the increase of visitors also has to do with policies in the interior of China, which are favorable to Macao tourism," said Helena de Senna Fernandes, in statements to the Chinese channel of TDM Macau. Measures that make it easier for the residents of mainland China Macau now include a week -old trip to the Zhuhai inhabitants, as well as multiple entries for those who live in Hengqin, among other individual travel regimes for certain Chinese cities.
According to STD data, during the seven days of holidays of last year's National Day, a total of 993,117 visitors entered into Macao, on a daily average of 141,000. The number has been a record for the territory since there are records.
Regarding the hotel occupation, Helena de Senna Fernandes was optimistic about occupancy rates during the holidays of National Day. "We have seen that the average hotel occupancy rate recently exceeded 90%. Although this week's numbers can be affected by the typhoon, the average occupation accumulated in the year remained essentially close to 90%, with the figures of August to project above this threshold. Therefore, we remain optimistic, anticipating favorable occupancy rates during the golden week," he explained.
Helena de Senna Fernandes added that hotel rooms “have maintained reasonable prices” in recent years, both in the hotel industry and on online travel platforms. In your opinion, even during high times, such as July and August, when tariffs increase, there are no sudden and marked increases in the past.
It is recalled that last year, during the holidays of National Day, the average hotel occupancy rate reached 94.5%, with an average price per quarter of the hotel industry establishments to be set at 1,860 patacas, an increase of 4% compared to the same period of the previous year.
Macao currently offers about 47,000 hotel rooms. Helena de Senna Fernandes considers that there is still room for a gradual increase in the offer of rooms in Macao. The official also intends to reinforce the collaboration with Hengqin, where there are new hotels to open progressively, in order to take advantage of resources across the border to launch integrated tourist products.

According to local authorities, the acceleration of inflation was mainly due to food products and non-alcoholic beverages.

Inflation in Macao accelerated in August, to the highest level since January, in a month when the consumer price index fell back to mainland China.
The index in Macau rose 0.27%in August, in homologous terms, more than double the amount recorded in July (0.11%), and the highest since January (0.57%), according to official data.
According to the direction of statistical and census services, the acceleration of inflation was mainly due to food products and non-alcoholic beverages (plus 0.44%). The cost of meals acquired away from home rose 1.54%.
Expenditure on lace or apartment mortgages rose 0.84% ​​and 0.56%, respectively, even before Macau's monetary authority approved, on September 18, the first decrease in the interest rate since the end of 2024.
The Legislative Assembly of the Territory approved, in April 2024, the end of several taxes on the acquisition of housing, to “increase liquidity” in the real estate market, defended the Secretary for Economics and Finance, Law Wai Nong.
With the recovery in the number of visitors, the region registered a 19.1% rise in the price of jewelery, goldsmiths and watches, popular products among tourists in mainland China. In the opposite direction, the cost of excursions and hotels for foreign travel from Macau residents increased by 8.29%, while education and insurance spending rose 1.27%and 1.34%, respectively.
In mainland China, by far the largest commercial partner in Macau, the IPC returned to fall 0.4% in August, in homologous terms, the fifth month of deflation (annual fall in consumer prices) in the last half year.
Deflation reflects weakness in domestic consumption and investment and is particularly severe, as a drop in asset price, as a lawsuit under credit, generates an imbalance between the value of loans and bank guarantees.
The data surprised the analysts, who provided for a price contraction of 0.2%, after the rate was unchanged in July, ending four consecutive months of fall.
The second largest world economy remains under deflationary pressure due to the combination of poor internal demand and excessive industrial capacity, aggravated by trade war with the United States, which has hindered the flow of inventories accumulated by companies.
The price index in the producer, which measures the prices to exit the factory, fell 2.9% in August, noting the 35th consecutive month of contraction, despite representing an improvement compared to the 3.6% decrease in July.
Chinese authorities have reiterated that reinforcement of internal demand will be one of the central economic priorities for 2025. In the neighboring Hong Kong region, inflation rose slightly from 1%in July to 1.1%in August.
