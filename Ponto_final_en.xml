The cases were discovered at the Border Posts of Portas do Cerco and the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge, with the SA seizing 991 items of used electronic products, 9.16 kilograms of undeclared foodstuffs, 9 bottles of Chinese liquor, approximately 6.006 grams of cigars and 68 cosmetic items.
According to authorities, the 18 individuals involved in the cases are residents of Macau, residents of Hong Kong and residents of mainland China, aged between 18 and 60 years.
The SA brought its action in accordance with the provisions of the Foreign Trade Law. Once convicted, they can be punished with a maximum fine of 100,000 patacas, and the seized assets will be declared the property of Macao SAR.
In a press release, the SA highlights that in some cases detected, those involved tried to tie the goods to various parts of the body to hide them from customs inspection.
Among the cases, the organization intercepted a resident of Macau, on the 30th of last month, at Portas do Cerco. The man was in an “abnormal gait” and, upon inspection, was discovered to have 372 items of used electronics tied to his legs, attempting to smuggle them out of the territory.
Last Thursday, also at the Portas do Cerco Border Post, the SA successively detected two residents from the interior of China “with rigid body movements” and who were trying to smuggle out of the territory 240 items of used electronic products tied to various parts of the body.
There was yet another similar case to happen the day after the previous case, in which a resident of the Mainland, “with an abnormally large waist”, was intercepted and found with 34 items of used electronic products tied to various parts of his body.
The SA reminds that any individual who transports items to enter or leave the Macao SAR must comply with the applicable legal provisions, and must not, for the sake of profit, become involved in illicit trafficking activities. Citizens who detect relevant illegal activities can report them to SA via the hotline 2896 5001 or email *protected email*.</description><pubDate>2025-10-13 22:36:42</pubDate></item><item><title>NBA's return could help China combat prejudice against sports</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/10/13/regresso-da-nba-pode-ajudar-china-a-combater-preconceito-contra-desporto/</link><description>The return of the North American Basketball League (NBA) to China, after six years of disruption, could help combat Chinese parents' prejudice against playing sports, two businesspeople said.
 
Almost 14 thousand people saw the Brooklyn Nets beat the Phoenix Suns, 111-109, on Sunday, avenging Friday's defeat, also in Macau, which will host NBA pre-season matches for five years.
A victory that excited Pang, 10, who proudly wore a Nets cap. "It was so cool! When I grow up I also want to be a player", the young man born in Macau told Lusa.
It was a dream weekend for Pang, who on Saturday trained with former NBA glories including Vince Carter, Kevin Garnett, Shaquille O'Neal, Jeremy Lin and China's Yao Ming. But, asked about their son's wishes, the parents were realistic. "Of course he can play and have fun, but here in Macau no athlete is professional. The most important thing is studies", his mother told Lusa.
Pang also pointed to Zeng Fanbo, the 22-year-old who left the Beijing Ducks, from the Chinese capital, to sign in August with the Nets, but his parents were not convinced.
There was no need to go that far. Leo Lei, 17, became the first local player invited to the NBA's Basketball Without Borders camps and signed for the Macau Black Bears, who compete in the East Asia Super League. But prejudice has been going on for a long time. “I've been coming to China for 25 years and I've always heard parents say that [their children] can't play sports, because education is more important”, lamented David Beckham today.
Something that ends up limiting the impact of “a lot of investment in youth” made in China, added the former English international footballer, at a public event about the business of sport.
At the same event, the owner of the Brooklyn Nets, Joe Tsai Chung-Hsin, admitted that “Asian culture is not very conducive to the great development of collective sports”. “If you are a parent, you want your children to get good grades and get into a good university,” added the president of Chinese technology giant Alibaba.
Joe Tsai, born in Taiwan, lamented that the role of sport in education is not “recognized in China” and argued that “participating in team sports teaches you how to be a good human being”.
David Beckham, who played professional football for 21 years, confirmed that “education and sport go hand in hand” and said that football in particular teaches “dedication, respect, [and] sacrifice”.
China is already one of the biggest sporting powers in the world, but Joe Tsai argued that the current system does not help, as it “forces you to choose between sport and studies from a young age”. "Chinese sports development used to be a cylinder that later turned into a pencil tip. It is necessary to build a pyramid that ends with the elite", explained the businessman.
Still, Tsai is excited about “broader participation of children [in sport] in Asian societies.”
Um caminho que o futebol nos Estados Unidos também está a percorrer, referiu David Beckham, que se juntou, em 2007, ao LA Galaxy. “Quando me mudei para os EUA, nenhuma equipa da MLS [a liga norte-americana de futebol] tinha camadas jovens. Agora, todas as equipas têm”, disse Beckham, um dos donos do Inter Miami, clube da MLS cuja principal estrela é Lionel Messi. “Espero que inspiremos mais crianças a seguir os seus sonhos”, disse à Lusa Ziaire Williams Jr, extremo dos Nets. “O basquetebol é realmente divertido e também ensina sobre a vida”, acrescentou.
At the end of the day, the most important thing is to “maintain the joy and spirit of sporting competition”, agreed the Phoenix Suns coach. “Even at the highest level, in the NBA, that's all we want to do and feel when we play sport,” Jordan Ott told Lusa.</description><pubDate>2025-10-13 22:31:43</pubDate></item><item><title>New book from Mandarina Books teaches the value of memory to young people</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/10/13/novo-livro-da-mandarina-books-ensina-o-valor-da-memoria-aos-mais-jovens/</link><description>Publisher Mandarina Books presents another chapter in the saga of Júlia and Pou, protagonists already known to children in Macau after the successes of “Na Rua” and “Em Casa”. Catarina Mesquita's new bilingual book, “Na Memória”, aims to awaken readers' interest in the history and culture of the place they call home, while at the same time charting a still unexplored future.

After having lived adventures “Na Rua” and “Em Casa”, the characters Júlia and Pou are returning with a story about the importance of preserving history, culture and identity. Although the official launch of “Na Memória” is scheduled for November 2nd, starting this week it will be possible to find the new book from children's publisher Mandarina Books in bookstores in Macau.
The protagonists are the same ones who had already been presented in the best-seller “Na Rua”, the first book published by the publisher: Júlia, a girl growing up in a Portuguese family living in Macau, and Pou, a boy belonging to a typically Chinese family. The debut work, which provided a tour of Macau's architecture, tradition and gastronomic culture, was followed by a second chapter born during the pandemic: “Em Casa”, a portrait of how the Portuguese community and the Chinese community in Macau dealt with confinement.
“In Memory” adopts a different perspective. The backdrop is no longer a concrete place, but rather a set of all the history, knowledge and heritage – material and immaterial – that is inherited from ancestors or the place of birth. “The idea is to highlight the importance of not forgetting what is important and special”, explains author Catarina Mesquita to PONTO FINAL, confessing that she was inspired by her own experiences to create the book. “I was a little inspired by the coexistence and the stories that my grandparents told me from other times, when they lived in other places, and the fact that I experienced my grandmother's loss of memory up close”.
The first spark of imagination emerged, however, with the celebration of the 20th anniversary of the Historic Center of Macau on the UNESCO World Heritage List, which reaffirmed the importance of preserving and continuing to transmit the linguistic, cultural and architectural riches of the region to future generations. It was an idea well received by Mandarina Books readers, as the publisher's founder reveals: “There was a need to continue the collection, given the requests that several people made to us”.
More than a tribute to the past, the work also reflects on the way in which seeds built in the present become legacies for the future. “There is also talk about the importance of seeing new places being born, like Hengqin, where today’s children can claim to have been the first to see a mega-city grow that will last into the future.”
Unlike what happened with the two previous entries in the collection of Júlia and Pou's adventures, which were written in collaboration with author Joe Tang, this book has the sole signature of Catarina Mesquita. The format remains unchanged, with the usual illustrations by Fernando Chan and the translation of the text into Chinese.
Another new feature in this edition is the inclusion of sticker pages with words in Portuguese, Chinese and Patuá. The objective, according to the author, is to “make the book more interactive, help with language learning and celebrate the Macau dialect, Patuá, so that it does not fall into oblivion”.
The presentation of “Na Memória” to the public will take place on the 25th, at 6:30 pm, at the Carmo Auditorium, in Taipa. The book is co-edited in partnership with the International Institute of Macau (IIM) and has the support of the Cultural Development Fund of the Macao SAR Government and Banco Nacional Ultramarino (BNU).</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Chef António, ambassador of Portuguese cuisine in Macau, has died</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/10/13/morreu-o-chef-antonio-embaixador-da-cozinha-portuguesa-em-macau/</link><description>António Neves Coelho, leading figure of Portuguese gastronomy in Macau, where he established himself in the late 1990s, passed away on Sunday. Chef António, distinguished both in Macau and in Portugal, leaves a legacy of authenticity and tradition, say friends and professional colleagues.
António Neves Coelho died on Sunday in Macau, aged 77. “He dedicated his life to spreading the greatness of Portuguese cuisine in Macau”, highlighted the family on social media, adding that, “as a person, António is recognized by many as a great man and a great mentor”. He was “a great blessing to many, spreading wisdom, courage, joy and happiness through his passion throughout his life.”
Chef António first visited Macau in 1970, when he was in the Army. Then, in Portugal, he became a health inspector and was later invited to manage a restaurant in the Alfama neighborhood of Lisbon.
In 1997, he decided to return to Macau to help manage the Lusitânia restaurant. The chef later worked at Clube Militar and also went to Hong Kong, where he opened a Portuguese restaurant. In 2003, he returned to Macau to open the Espaço Lisboa restaurant in Vila de Coloane, before being invited to open António’s in Vila da Taipa. In recent years, he joined Angela’s Café and Lounge, at Hotel Lisboeta.
Throughout his career, he received several distinctions, including the tourist merit medal from the Macao SAR, in 2013, and the Portuguese communities' merit medal from the Portuguese Government, in 2015. The restaurants he visited were also frequently included in the Michelin Guide.
AN ADVOCATE OF TRADITIONAL AND AUTHENTIC CUISINE
In 2017, in an interview with Macau Closer magazine, he said that the territory was his second home and explained his approach to Portuguese cuisine: "I'm a traditional man when it comes to Portuguese food. I don't think about the past, but I'm a supporter of traditional and authentic Portuguese cuisine."
In addition to being faithful to the authenticity of Portuguese cuisine, chef António believed that the secret to success also lay in the use of the best quality ingredients and the training of his team. "You have to believe in the restaurant and have patience. Cooking just for money and profit will never bring success", stated António Neves Coelho.
Santos Pinto, responsible for the “O Santos” restaurant, was a long-time friend of chef António. “It was a friend I lost, it was many years of friendship”, he lamented in statements to PONTO FINAL. “I have no doubt that he conveyed Portuguese gastronomy very well in Macau”, he highlighted.
Ana Maria Manhão Sou precisely recalled his role as a mentor and strong defender of the authenticity of Portuguese cuisine. “He was a good teacher”, said the person responsible for the Belos Tempos restaurant, adding that one of the lessons that chef António taught her was precisely that of preserving tradition. Describing him as an “ambassador of Portuguese cuisine in Macau”, Ana Maria Manhão Sou highlighted that his death is “a very big loss” for the territory. "He preserved the authentic flavor of tradition. This is the type of chef we need in Macau, he kept Portuguese culture and cuisine alive here", he stressed.
Pedro Esteves, from Food Truck, met chef António when he arrived in Macau, 23 years ago. “He is a human being who deserves to be honored”, he said, highlighting his “good heart”. “It was a huge loss for Macau and Portuguese gastronomy”, he stressed.
Chef Antonieta Manhão also considered it a “loss for Macau and Portuguese cuisine”. Nelson Rocha, from the Mariazinha restaurant, confessed that, despite never having worked directly with chef António, he noticed his “great charisma”. “I feel sorry for not having had the opportunity to get to know him better”, he lamented.
The wake is scheduled for October 18th, from 4pm to 9pm, with a mass at 8pm at the Diocesan Mortuary House, located on Avenida do Almirante Lacerda. On October 19th there will be another mass in memory of António Neves Coelho, at 9:30 am, in the main chapel of the Diocesan Mortuary House.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Operators increase investment and Grand Prix promises “great excitement”</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/10/13/operadoras-aumentam-investimento-e-grande-premio-promete-grande-emocao/</link><description>More details were presented yesterday about this year's edition of the Macau Grand Prix, which will take place between the 13th and 16th of November. Among the seven races that the Guia Circuit will host in this 72nd edition, there will be the FIA ​​FR World Cup, the FIA ​​GT World Cup and the motorcycle race, for example. The six gaming concessionaires, which last year had contributed a total of 100 million patacas, this time will increase the investment to 120 million.

The 72nd edition of the Macau Grand Prix, which will take place between the 13th and 16th of November, will once again feature seven races “of great excitement”, the organization said yesterday. They are the FIA ​​FR World Cup, the Macau GT Cup – FIA GT World Cup, the Macau Guide Race – Kumho FIA TCR World Tour Event of Macau, the Macau Formula 4 Race – FIA F4 World Cup, the 57th Macau Motorcycle Grand Prix, the GT Cup – Greater Bay Race (GT4) and the Macau Roadsport Challenge.
Details of this edition were presented yesterday at a press conference by the organizing committee. Mok Chi Hang, deputy coordinator of the organizing committee of the Macau Grand Prix, stated at the time that this event “has continually innovated over the years, constantly introducing new elements into the event, and this year it is expected to once again captivate fans around the world”. Tickets are now on sale.
The organization also announced that this year each of the six tourism and leisure companies will contribute 20 million patacas, which makes a total of 120 million. Last year, the total investment by gaming concessionaires was only 100 million patacas, as Melco and Wynn had reduced their investment to 10 million each.
The Macau Grand Prix “offers a platform for local companies to increase their investment in elements not related to the game, taking advantage of their resources and knowledge to enhance activation actions and promote the event through additional channels”, indicated the organizing committee.
The organization also revealed some of the names that will race in the Guia Circuit. At the FIA ​​FR World Cup, “a constellation of the most promising young talents in world motorsport” will be present. Among them, Ugo Ugochukwu, from R-ace GP, winner of the race last year. PREMA Racing's Freddie Slater, Rashid Al Dhaheri and Charles Leong will also accelerate in Macau. The ART Grand Prix team will bring Evan Giltaire, Taito Kato and Kanato Le. Noah Stromsted, Tasanapol Inthraphuvasak and Reza Seewooruthun will also be present, among others.
In the Macau GT Cup – FIA GT World Cup, a “star line-up of the world's elite GT drivers will compete”, says the organization.
“Mr Macau”, Edoardo Mortara, returns to the Guia Circuit in search of his fifth victory in the Macau GT Cup, which will allow him to regain his status as the record holder for the most victories in the race. Two-time winner Raffaele Marciello will also return to Macau.
When it comes to the Motorcycle Grand Prix, Peter Hickman, five-time winner in Macau, and the defending champion, Davey Todd, lead the list of entries. Finn Erno Kostamo, second behind Todd last year, returns in an attempt to repeat his 2022 victory. Joining the Finn in this international driver line-up are Belgian Laurent Hoffman and Frenchman Almaric Blanc, who was the fastest newcomer in Macau in 2024. Michael Rutter, in turn, will not participate in this year's edition.
In addition to the races, the organization will also invest in side events. Between the 1st and 2nd of November, the Guia Circuit will be recreated in Praça do Tap Seac for a “Family Festival”. The Macau Grand Prix Car and Motorcycle Exhibition will take place at Praça Tap Seac, on the 8th and 9th of November. The photographic competition will also be held again, inviting residents to show their best photos.</description><pubDate>2025-10-13 22:32:55</pubDate></item><item><title>Asian Development Bank predicts lower growth for Timor-Leste</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/10/13/banco-asiatico-de-desenvolvimento-preve-crescimento-mais-baixo-para-timor-leste/</link><description>The Asian Development Bank (ADB) maintains stable economic prospects for Timor-Leste, but slightly lowered the forecast for economic growth, in the September report on Asian development prospects.
The ADB predicts “economic growth of 3.8% in 2025 and 3.4% in 2026”, lower than the April forecast, when it projected growth of 4.0% for 2025 and 3.8% for 2026.
According to the document, economic growth will be supported by more efficient budget execution, sustained growth in credit in the banking sector and the constant inflow of remittances, supported by an environment of low inflation.
The ADB projects that inflation will remain low, with an “average of 1.2% in 2025 and 1.9% in 2026”, due to the decrease in food prices and moderate pressures on the prices of goods and services. “Timor-Leste’s accession to ASEAN [Association of Southeast Asian Nations] in October 2025 will represent a significant milestone that will strengthen confidence and drive long-term, sustainable economic growth by unlocking new opportunities in trade, investment and private sector development,” said ADB director in Timor-Leste, Stefania Dina.
According to Stefania Dina, for Timor-Leste to fully benefit from regional integration it is essential to give “priority to investments in human capital and infrastructure, improve the mobilization of domestic resources, implement fiscal reforms and resort to long-term development financing”.</description><pubDate>2025-10-13 22:26:27</pubDate></item><item><title>Revitalization of the Tamagnini Barbosa Market starts at the beginning of next year</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/10/13/revitalizacao-do-mercado-tamagnini-barbosa-arranca-no-inicio-do-proximo-ano/</link><description>The Institute for Municipal Affairs presented two new projects to be carried out in the city. The Tamagnini Barbosa Market will be revitalized, with the introduction of a food center and a future connection with the Citizens' Sports Park. Renovation works will begin in the first quarter of 2026. The other project refers to the Children's Exploration Pavilion, to be built on Avenida de Venceslau de Morais, whose works will be ready in 2028.

Another municipal market in Macau will be handed over to revitalization, announced the Institute for Municipal Affairs (IAM). The Tamagnini Barbosa Market will receive renovation work with improved facilities and the construction of a food center, which will begin in the first quarter of next year, with the market expected to fully resume activities at the beginning of 2027.
The IAM presented the project yesterday, in which it will adjust the layout of the stalls, in order to create a “market with a new model” that provides a diversified consumption experience and increases the vitality of the community.
However, the authorities did not reveal the budget for the project, explaining that it is still in the projection phase and that the budget will only be announced after the conclusion of the public tender process.
According to IAM's planning, after the renovation, all stalls selling fresh and live food products will be concentrated on the ground floor of the market, and the area will be divided into sales of fish, meat, refrigerated products, vegetables and fruits, traditional grocery stores, among others.
A food center is planned to be introduced on the first floor of the market, with 16 stalls offering light meals and prepared foods. The current stalls and prepared foods on the ground floor will all be transferred to operate on this floor equipped with an additional 150 seats for customers.
The original entrances and exits will be maintained at the market, public access will be expanded and the stall area will be increased. The IAM indicated that there are currently nine prepared food stalls and 23 fresh and live food stalls and, after the revitalization, the total number of stalls will be increased to 39.
Adjusting the general layout and spatial design of the market will help to “improve the shopping experience of consumers”, “satisfy the demands of sellers and the population” and “create a more comfortable business environment and better lines of shopping movement”, highlighted the IAM.
The project also brings new facilities and equipment to the market. According to the IAM presentation, it is planned to install barrier-free elevators and a breastfeeding room, optimize the market's lighting equipment, as well as a wastewater drainage and ventilation system.
 A corridor will also be built to connect to the public parking lot at the Toi Fai Building, in Toi San, and a junction will be reserved at the overpass to connect with the future Sports Park for Citizens, located on the land of the former Yat Yuen Canidrome.
The Tamagnini Barbosa Market is located in the Toi San area, between Avenida do Conselheiro Borja, Rua do Dr. Ricardo de Sousa and Rua Central de Toi San. The space was originally a vegetable field, having been transformed into a market by the Portuguese government of Macau, as a large number of vendors gathered in the area to do business. The Tamagnini Barbosa Municipal Market Complex was later built there, opened in May 2005.
According to the IAM, the revitalization will be carried out in two phases, with work on the first phase on the first floor expected to begin in the first quarter of 2026, during which all stalls will continue to operate normally on the ground floor.
The second phase of works will take place on the ground floor, which will begin in the third quarter of 2026. During this period, fresh and live food stalls may choose to temporarily suspend their activities or be transferred to the temporary stalls area. It is expected that the food center on the first floor could open to the public in the third quarter of 2026, and that the fresh and live food stalls on the ground floor could resume operations in the first quarter of 2027.

NEW SPACE FOR CHILDREN
 
The IAM announced yesterday yet another construction project, a Children's Exploration Pavilion, which will be located on the first and second floors of the new Macao SAR Service Center on Avenida de Venceslau de Morais. This new facility dedicated to the fun of children and teenagers will occupy a space of 6,500 square meters.
The design of the project will begin next year, with the aim of developing public tender work for the respective works in 2017. Completion of the works is scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2028.
According to IAM, the Children's Exploration Pavilion will have the first floor divided into six play areas and facilities aimed at users between 0 and 12 years old, featuring a low-altitude adventure area, a slide area and a climbing wall, a toy library and a light snack area, among others. The second floor will be divided into five areas with games for users between 6 and 18 years old, providing a trampoline park, an exploratory network trail and a sports area, among others.
The IAM highlighted that the new installation is intended to serve children in early childhood, pre-school children, school-age children, teenagers and parents, aiming to create a space to guide children in autonomous discovery through interactive games with a multi-themed modular design.
The body further noted that planning recreational facilities for children requires consideration of several factors, particularly safety, which requires considerable time for design and evaluation. Regarding the project budget, the IAM stated that there are no specific construction costs available so far, but “it will follow the principle of prudent use of public funds”, he assured.</description><pubDate>2025-10-13 22:35:40</pubDate></item><item><title>“CreatorWeekMacao 2025” brings a week full of conferences and activities</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/10/13/creatorweekmacao-2025-traz-uma-semana-repleta-de-conferencias-e-actividades/</link><description>“CreatorWeekMacao 2025” is about to arrive in Macau, an event that will bring together hundreds of digital influencers and sector leaders in various events taking place between the 24th and 28th of October. The initiative's program, released yesterday, offers sessions open to the public in various areas, from live shows to yoga sessions.
 
“CreatorWeek Macao 2025” will take place from the 24th to the 28th of October, bringing together in Macau some of the most popular local and international digital influencers around a common objective: to spread and elevate the image of Macau as a tourist destination. The highlights and program of the initiative, as well as the various forms of participation, were presented yesterday at the Macau Tower Convention and Entertainment Center.
At the presentation event, the director of Tourism Services (DST), Helena de Senna Fernandes, began by highlighting Macau's “unique position as a bridge between East and West”, which enables the interaction and fusion of Chinese culture with international influences.
The 20 local ambassadors recruited for the program have the mission of providing “unique experiences” and presenting Macau’s “rich multicultural heritage” to the 20 international content creators invited to join this project. The official believes that, “by promoting innovative and integrated tourism development, the event will inject new creative energy” into Macau and consolidate its role as a “world center for tourism and leisure”.
The floor was then passed on to the director and co-founder of the content production company Branded, Jasper Donat, who presented the line-up of international influencers who will be in Macau next week and revealed some of the activities that will be promoted over the five days of “CreatorWeek Macao 2025”, with participation open to the public.
The ceremony was also attended by officials from the world of entertainment, who highlighted in their speeches the need to promote Macau through “authentic and interactive” publications and to increase the influence and penetration of Chinese culture on social media, to the point of becoming “a global trend”.
Rico Leng, creative director of the YouTuber group “Bacalhau”, also took the stage and shared his experience as a content creator in Macau, tracing a chronology from the first videos in 2016 to the vast opportunities – such as trips to different countries and collaborations with creators and artists – that have unfolded since then.

SIX THEMATIC PROGRAMS

“CreatorWeek Macao 2025” will bring together around 250 international guests and those from mainland China, whose content published over the five days of the project is expected to reach more than 1.5 billion reactions and reach the screens of 1.2 billion people.
The program is divided into six thematic “zones”, in order to facilitate consultation of the events taking place throughout this period. “Zone 1” concerns the opening and closing ceremonies, taking place at the Wynn Palace on the 24th and 28th of October, respectively. According to the organization, these are valuable opportunities for influencers, speakers and international leaders in the sector to mingle and exchange contacts, with a “creative and vibrant atmosphere” as a backdrop.
“Zone 2” brings a two-day program full of conferences on current trends in social media, focusing mainly on the fusion between Chinese and Western cultures. On the 27th and 28th, between 9am and 5pm, around 50 international industry leaders and local content creators will debate the latest social media trends and Macau's position in the Asian cultural panorama at the Grand Lisboa Palace Resort Macau.
Moving to “Zone 3”, the program foresees the holding of four health and well-being workshops between the 25th and 26th, with sessions at 9am and noon. For this section, four influencers from the world of fitness and yoga were invited: Will Liu, Matt Tralli, Jacky Cai and Ryan Narayan. Upon prior registration, the public has the opportunity to participate in these sports sessions, taking place at MGM Macau's Fantasy Box, and also receive tips and advice from the influencers in question.
This is followed by “Zone 4” with more than 40 ‘meet-and-greet’ events, taking place at The Londoner Macau on the 25th and 26th. These sessions – which also require prior registration – allow fans and various content creators (such as Austin Sprinz or Ian Boggs) to interact and take photos together.
“Zone 5” brings a musical atmosphere to Galaxy Macau’s “Broadway Food Street”. On the 25th and 26th, between 4pm and 10pm, two dozen local and international musicians will perform live and interact with fans, who can attend the concerts without needing to register in advance.
The program ends with “Zona 6”, a “creative academy” that will bring together between 100 and 200 industry professionals at the Grand Lisboa Palace Resort. On the last two days of the event, October 27th and 28th, the “academy” will enable the exchange of opinions between sector leaders and will also offer practical sessions to “take advantage of the cultural profile of the intersection of Chinese and Western cultures”, as the organization said in a statement.
“CreatorWeek” was founded last year in Singapore. This year's edition is the second in total and the first to take place in Macau, as a result of cooperation between DST and Branded. The initiative is sponsored by six tourism and leisure companies in Macau and supported by 25 local, Greater Bay Area and international companies.</description><pubDate>2025-10-13 22:39:05</pubDate></item><item><title>Son wins Asia's Best Footballer award for the 10th time</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/10/13/son-vence-premio-de-melhor-futebolista-da-asia-pela-10-a-vez/</link><description>Son Heung-min, a 33-year-old Korean striker currently playing for Los Angeles FC, was named Asia's Best Footballer of 2025, according to a panel of journalists and Asian football experts. It was the 10th time that the South Korean won the Best Football Player in Asia (BFA) award, which this year marked its 13th edition. Portuguese Cristiano Ronaldo was in third place.
The jury comprised 64 Asian football experts, including 42 journalists and experts representing 42 AFC countries and regions, which included DOT FINAL representing Macau, voted to honor Asia's best football players for their performances between 16 August 2024 and 16 July 2025, in accordance with the 2024-25 AFC football calendar.
A list of 25 nominees was provided for voting, although the judges were free to select any eligible player beyond the list. Out of a total of 1,024 points, Son Heung-min received 146 points, representing 14.26% of all votes, to regain the title of Best Footballer in Asia. Lee Kang-in, a 24-year-old Korean striker, finished in second place with 105 points (10.25%), while Cristiano Ronaldo closed the podium in third place with 91 points (8.89%).

In a quarterly credit bulletin, the financial rating agency states that efforts to rationalize production and stabilize prices in sectors with excess supply, namely cement, steel or automobiles, can benefit more efficient companies with state support – as is the case with many of those rated by Fitch – but can also reduce demand faster than supply, penalizing growth.
Fitch predicts that Chinese economic growth will slow to 4.7% this year and 4.1% in 2026, with the impact of tariffs imposed by the United States limiting the contribution of exports.
The increase in domestic consumption, which Beijing defined as a priority for 2025, is expected to slow from 4.9% this year to 3.5% next year, due to weak consumer confidence, stagnation in the real estate sector and the exhaustion of one-off effects such as subsidies for the replacement of household appliances. “In the short term, the campaign against involution may alleviate price wars that negatively affect the credit ratios of consumer service providers,” the report reads.
The term 'involution' designates a form of excessive internal competition, in which manufacturers reduce prices to the point of compromising profit margins, in a fight for survival that ends up making businesses unsustainable.
The agency notes that less aggressive discounts could help stabilize the profitability of vehicle manufacturers, but warns that competitive pressures associated with innovation and battery costs continue to pose risks.
Fitch highlights the downward revision of Beijing Automotive Group's debt, from 'b+' to 'b', reflecting the expectation of lower profit margins and greater liabilities until 2026.
On the other hand, the agency maintained the 'BBB+' rating of the home delivery company Meituan, but revised the outlook, from positive to stable, due to the slowdown in revenue growth and lower profitability in the face of intense competition.
The agency also considers that the difficulties in rationalizing cement production or oil refining, including political resistance to the closure of factories, illustrate the obstacles to the implementation of the anti-involution policy.
In sectors such as steel, domestic demand could be lower than expected, leading Chinese producers to intensify exports and increase pressure on foreign rivals.
In the financial sector, Fitch estimates new cuts in the seven-day reverse repurchase rate, which should fall to 1.2% this year and 1% in 2026, something that will allow banks to reinforce liquidity. However, the effects of monetary policy are limited, due to weak demand for credit and pressure on bank margins.
Stimulus measures, such as subsidies that reduce the interest rate on new consumer loans by up to one percentage point, will, according to the agency, only have a marginal impact.
Despite the strong recent performance of Chinese stock markets, driven by the diversion of investments from the real estate sector to technology stocks, financing via the stock market remains marginal.
Fitch predicts a slight devaluation of the yuan against the dollar, from the current 7.12 to 7.30 per dollar by the end of 2026, insufficient to offset US tariffs, but which could favor Chinese exports to other Asian markets.
In the real estate sector, sales of new homes are expected to fall by 7% in 2025 and a further 6% in 2026, prolonging the collapse that began in 2022.
The agency emphasizes that a recovery in consumption will be unsustainable without a lasting restoration of consumer confidence and a stabilization of the housing sector.

The head of government affairs and policy at YouTube (a Google subsidiary) in Australia and New Zealand, Rachel Lord, noted that the measure, which will come into force on December 10, could have “unintended consequences”. “Not only will the legislation be extremely difficult to enforce, it will also fail to deliver on its promise to keep children safer online,” Lord said, during a hearing at a committee in the Senate, the upper house of parliament, which is examining the new measures.
The executive emphasized that the YouTube video platform has invested significantly in age-appropriate product design and parental control tools.
Preventing minors from using the platform will eliminate filters and protections designed to provide a safe environment for children in areas such as sports, music and learning, Lord lamented. Lord also insisted that YouTube “is not a social network”, but rather a video platform “that Australians use as a content library and educational resource”.
Among the features that would no longer be available to teenagers, the executive mentioned the deactivation of automatic playback, break reminders and the removal of personalized ads.
In November, the Australian parliament approved a ban on accounts for under-16s on social media, giving digital platforms a year to complete the process.
Fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars (around 28 million euros) are expected for companies that systematically fail to implement this measure, a pioneer at a global level. However, in September, Australian authorities declared that social media platforms must avoid widespread age verification of users. “We think it would be unreasonable if platforms verified everyone’s age”, said the Australian commissioner of ‘eSafety’ (an entity dedicated to preventing online abuse and scams), Julie Inman Grant, adding that companies in the sector already have enough information about users to know who is over 16 years old. Inman Grant argued that widespread age verification of users would be a “terror tactic”.
Australia's Communications Minister, Anika Wells, stated that the local government wants to keep the information and data of account holders on those networks as private as possible. "Social platforms already know a lot about us. If a person has been on Facebook, for example, since 2009, companies know that they are over 16 years old. There is no need for verification," he said.

Xi Jinping also stressed that “peace and stability are essential conditions for the integral development of women”.
Chinese President Xi Jinping yesterday defended the strengthening of women's participation in politics and decision-making processes, calling on States to “expand the channels” of female representation in national and social governance. “It is essential to ensure that gender equality truly takes root throughout society,” said Xi, during the opening speech of the World Leaders’ Meeting on Women, taking place in Beijing, according to the official Xinhua news agency.
The Chinese head of state stressed that “peace and stability are essential conditions for the integral development of women” and defended the strengthening of mechanisms to combat violence and “all forms of abuse directed against them”.
Xi warned that more than 600 million women and girls live in areas affected by conflict and that one in ten remains in extreme poverty.
During the meeting, the Chinese leader announced a donation of US$10 million to UN Women, as well as a contribution of US$100 million to the Fund for Global Development and South-South Cooperation, aimed at projects supporting women and girls. Beijing will also create a global training center for women.
According to Chinese state media, dozens of heads of state and government, parliamentary leaders, deputy prime ministers, ministers and representatives of international organizations are taking part in the meeting, organized in partnership with the United Nations, which aims to boost global progress towards gender equality.
The conference takes place in a context in which the female presence at the highest levels of Chinese politics is practically non-existent. Since the 20th Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, in 2022, no woman has joined the Politburo, the country's main decision-making body.
The absence of female figures in the Party's leadership contrasts with the broad participation of women in Chinese society: according to the World Bank, 62% participate in the labor force. In the business sector, they represent a quarter of company founders and run around 40% of new e-commerce brands.
Despite these advances, challenges linked to discrimination and gender-based violence persist, with cases of harassment and mistreatment that have sparked public outrage in recent years.
The lack of female political references in China also contrasts with the existence of leaders in the region, such as Carrie Lam, in Hong Kong, Park Geun-hye, in South Korea, Sanae Takaichi, in Japan, and Tsai Ing-wen, in Taiwan, who held or hold top positions in their respective governments.

The deputy noted the absence of a standard in the Administration on leaving work before the hoisting of signal No. 8, which meant that, during super typhoon Ragasa, workers from different services left at different times, the disparity of which made effective disaster preparedness difficult for some civil servants.

Rep. Lei Chan U urged the Government to clarify the provisions regarding the departure of civil servants from work before the 8th typhoon signal is issued. In a written interpellation sent to the Government, the legislator, who will leave the chamber as of Thursday, criticized the lack of explicit provisions for the organization of pre-storm work, which posed difficulties in preparing for the arrival of typhoons by public service workers.
“There is a lack of explicit rules regarding the provisions on when employees must leave work before the Meteorological and Geophysical Service raises sign no.
The issue was raised following the passage of super typhoon “Ragasa” in Macau at the end of last month. Having advanced the prediction that the typhoon could cause an impact similar to typhoons Hato and Mangkhut, the Government made strong calls for disaster prevention. The Meteorological and Geophysical Services, at that time, issued signal no. 8 on the 23rd at 5pm, within public administration working hours.
Lei Chan U, in his interpellation, said he had received questions from some civil servants on the matter due to the unequal approach to work output between different departments. According to the legislator, given the differences in the nature of the departments and the recipients of the services, the effective provisions varied between departmental heads. "Some departments allowed staff to leave two hours before the sign was raised, while others required staff to remain until the time the sign was formally raised. This disparity prevented some public officials from responding effectively to the typhoon," he said.
As the deputy recalled, the Directorate of Administration and Public Service Services had issued a circular to public departments informing them that department heads may, “based on actual circumstances and as long as it does not affect the department's external services”, arrange for employees to leave their workplaces with “adequate advance notice” before sign no. 8 is hoisted.
Lei Chan U regretted, however, that the decision largely depends on the department heads' own assessment and should instead be taken on clear and established grounds, so as to also let citizens be informed about the service suspension time.
In terms of measures to be adopted by public services and entities in situations of tropical storms, Executive Order No. 166/2002 stipulates provisions relating to the working hours of public servants only during signal 8th or higher degree of typhoon and after a tropical cyclone.</description><pubDate>2025-10-13 22:38:05</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
