Yesterday a strategic partnership agreement was announced to create the joint company SB OpenAi Japan, with a generative AI project called “Crystal”.
 
The American technology company OpenAi and Japanese Softbank warned of possible “security problems” related to Artificial Intelligence (IA), alluding yesterday in Tokyo to DeepSeek, Chinese competitor in the sector.
“We have to protect human security. Although technology and the result are similar, the characteristics for human security are different, ”said Softbank founder Masayoshi Son, in an event in the Japanese capital, which was also attended by OpenAi Executive Director Sam Altman.
At a meeting between them, Son mentioned DeepSeek and left Altman a question about the Chinese company, which Altman, without referring to China's competitor, replied that "society has to decide what the sector's boundaries are." "Depending on the country of origin, very dangerous situations may arise if we use this technology incorrectly, which can trigger a very bad situation for humanity," said Son.
Altman more positively said that society as a whole "will be able to do things correctly."
As for comments on whether AI could steal work, the two entrepreneurs were optimistic, stating that humanity “always finds new jobs” and that technology “is capable of generating new knowledge”.
Also yesterday, those responsible for the two companies announced a strategic partnership agreement to create the joint company SB OpenAi Japan, with an AI project called “Crystal”.
Son stated that the goal is to develop “cutting -edge solutions” for companies and said softbank will become the first user of the project under the line message service or paypay payments application.
The announcement comes after several media reported last week that softbank is in negotiations to invest up to $ 25 billion (24 billion euros) in OpenAi, in a business that would make it the biggest financier of Chatgpt manufacturer.
The news also comes after the new US President Donald Trump announced an investment of up to $ 500 billion (488 billion euros) in the private sector to build AI infrastructure.
This project advanced by Trump will be formed by Openia, Softbank and Oracle, which will start with an investment in a data center in Texas, southern United States, then expanded to other states.

Now, in response to an interpellation of Deputy Lei Chan U, the Social Security Fund says this study should be ready by the end of the first half.
 
The study on the creation of an index that follows the variation in the prices of the most consumed products by the elderly should be completed by the end of the first half of this year, said the Social Security Fund (FSS) in response to a written interpellation of Deputy Lei Chan U.
The government had already advanced that it was going to study the creation of this elderly consumer price index (IPC), which may then be linked to adjustments of the pension value for the elderly.
This is because it is currently the general IPC that determines the increase in the value of the pension to the elderly. If this index reaches the 3%, the values ​​must be updated. However, in recent years this index did not reach this goal - in September 2024 was in 2.47% - which has prevented the pensions update over the last five years.
In its interpellation, law Chan U stated that, “in recent years, although the rate of variation of the general IPC has not reached 3%, the prices of some of the first need has increased significantly, which is a certain pressure for the lives of the elderly".
The FSS response begins by pointing out that before moving into the compilation of an independent IPC for specific groups you need to develop studies. The Study on the Elderly IPC is being done by the Directorate of Statistics and Census Services (DSEC), which selects and reviews information from household aggregates who have elderly members, based on data collected in the inquiry to family expenses and revenues 2023/2024 , “Which allows a detailed analysis of the accuracy, reasonableness and representativeness of the elderly consumption structure, through scientific methods, in order to evaluate the adequacy of the respective information to elaborate the elderly IPC and the need for the elaborate ”.
The FSS explains that “currently, analyzes and studies are performed only based on limited data from samples collected, namely, different calculation solutions are adopted for data analysis of elderly household aggregates and from various perspectives evaluates whether or not there are conditions to create an indicator that allows to reflect the consumption situation of these aggregates. ” The body says that the respective evaluation works should be completed in the first half of this year.
The body ends by stressing that, regarding the optimization of the regular adjustment mechanism of installments of the social security regime and the promotion of the indexation of the base of the pension to the elderly to the value of social risk, will perform the respective studies and, “taking considerations comprehensive to Light of FSS's own financial situation, socioeconomic development, as well as the results of the Elderly IPC evaluation compiled by DSEC, so that the Macao Social Security regime can be better adapted to social development and respond to the real needs of residents, ensuring that resources are accurately placed in the needs with needs. ”</description><pubDate>2025-02-04T03:30:40+08:00</pubDate></item><item><title>A cream pastel that can drink</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/02/04/um-pastel-de-nata-que-se-pode-beber/</link><description>The 35 Pastel cream liquor has become a great success in Macao. The product was launched in the market in 2016, initially successfully in Portugal and other countries in Europe, and can now be found also in the Portuguese Bookstore.
 
One of the most famous products in Portugal is, of course, the delicious egg pie or pastel of cream. And in fact, these delicious delicacies also became an emblematic symbol of Macao, with the tourists to make a line around the block to order them when they visit.  Now think of combining the irresistible taste of an egg pie with a creamy and sweet liquor and what it has is one of the city's hottest new items today: liquor 35 Nata Liqueur pastel cream.
With cinnamon and flavors the puff pastry and egg cream, liqueur 35 is made with brandy, resulting in a 14.5% alcohol drink that can be enjoyed pure, with ice or added to your coffee, and always with a Recommended pinch of additional cinnamon.
“Liquor 35 has become very popular, not only because it is a nice drink, but also because you can do many things with it, such as cocktails and desserts. I have even seen a kitchen chief to add a little to a meat plate, ”says Renato Henriques, the company's export director. “And we're not selling just one drink. We are also selling a little of Portuguese culture around the world, and I think a little of Macau too. ”
We talked with Renato in November, when he was in town for the Macao International Trade and Investment Fair, his second time at the event.
The product was launched in the market in 2016, initially successfully in Portugal and other countries in Europe. “Two years ago, I received an email from Ricardo Pinto, director of the Portuguese Bookstore of Macau, saying that he wanted to make an order and since then the product has become very popular in Macau,” says Renato.
And it's not only the drink that is a sales success at the bookstore, but also the ceramic cups for eggs that accompany it. "In fact, the ceramics were not our focus, but suddenly Ricardo began to order more and more because they were very popular here, especially among the tourists of mainland China."
Liquor 35 promotional slogan in Macao is "the eggpot to drink." But what really seems to have placed these products on the map about a year ago, it was some posts that became viral on the Chinese Social Media platform, Little Red Book, which resulted in a wave of tourists who wanted to buy so much liquor like ceramic cups and dishes.
Last year, the K-pop band Seventeen, which visited the territory, also published a post about the product on its Instagram, creating even more agitation. “Honestly, I had never heard of Little Red Book or Seventeen, but the impact of these posts has been amazing. It's really something I can't explain, ”admits Renato.
With sales of about 200,000 large -size bottles per year, liquor 35 is currently sold in 27 countries worldwide, and its largest market is Europe, followed by Brazil and North America. With the success obtained in Macao, Renato is now focusing on the Chinese market. “A few years ago, many people told me that Liquor 35 would not be popular in China because the Chinese do not like sweet things. But I can tell you that this is not true. The new generation likes to try different things and like our drink very much and, of course, the ceramics, and have a lot of curiosity about Portuguese culture. ”
Accompanying the demand for ceramics has also been a challenge. They were created by a Portuguese craftsman who never waited for them to be so sought after. “One by one, they take a clay, make a gross shape and put it in the mold by hand. Then they are painted and baked to bake, so there are no two cups exactly the same.  The craftsman who makes them is being a little crazy trying to handle the orders, but a happy madman! ”Laughs Renato.
In his previous career, Renato worked on a bank for 15 years. So, about nine years ago, one of his clients, Paulo Lima - the inventor and owner of Liquor 35 - came with him looking for advice on a new business.
“I said to him, 'Drinking and eating is always a good deal'. A few months later, he invited me to a wine fair in Dusseldorf, Germany. We talked to a liqueur producer about Portuguese cream and had an idea: why not put together both? ”.
Renato returned to his work at the bank, without expecting much more involvement with the project, until one day his future boss came with him with five early product samples to try.
“After trying the samples, Paulo said that almost everyone preferred the samples three and five, so he decided to call the product Liquor 35. He left and produced 12,000 bottles to sell and then asked me to leave the My job at the bank and join him in the venture. Most people thought I was crazy, but I was tired of the work I did and looking for a new adventure, and now I am, traveling the world making people happy with this delicious drink. ”
Renato attributes Macao, in particular, the success of ceramic products related to liqueur 35. “Honestly, in other markets were not much sold, but Macau changed it.  And, of course, we have a strong connection with Ricardo and his great team in the Portuguese bookstore. They are really like our family from Macau. ”

In a written interpellation, Ron Lam said that over the last 10 years, the executive has not been able to end the exclusive use of the concession assets nor realized the assignment of convergence licenses according to the promised.
 
Telecommunications legislation was once again the subject of an interpellation of Ron Lam sent to the government, in which the deputy urged the authorities to explain the progress of preparatory work for the respective law, as well as the calendar for issuing the telecommunications convergence license .
The deputy understands that the delay in legislation and the fact that the government repeats the extension of contracts for a short term with the operators "are undermining the development of the sector."
According to the legislator, the government had stated in 2013 that the direction of future telecommunications licenses would be “Convergence” and “Integration of the Three Networks”, and in 2019 launched a consultation for the sector on Network and Service Convergence licenses of telecommunications. "The government proposed the separation between the infrastructure license, related to the construction of base networks and stations, and the telecommunications service license, but after that, it never disclosed the following plans," he lamented.
Revealing some concerns, Ron Lam pointed out in the written interplies that telecommunications services are important public services and a basis for the development of Macau as a intelligent city, but the government has been unable to deal with the issue of development of the sector. telecommunications.
"The government did not take the opportunity to liberalize the fixed network in 2011 to realize the fair use of the concession assets, which led to their exclusive use for 13 years, making it difficult to develop fair and healthy development of the telecommunications sector." , criticized.
In 2013, the government issued licenses for the installation and operation of public telecommunications networks to the Macao, S.A.R.L (CTM) telecommunications company and the MTEL Telecommunications Company (MTEL).

According to the deputy, licensing renewals took place in 2021 for a period of two years, in 2023 for a period of nine months and last year for a period of one year, while the concession contracts of public telecommunications services concession They will expire in September this year.
In this case, the deputy said he received reports from the sector, who is concerned about the approach of the end of the contact deadline, and only eight months left for the term of the contract.
“Since telecommunications infrastructures should operate 24 hours a day, without interruptions, if the government intends to ensure independent management and equitable use of the concession assets after the contract is required to clarify the policy and formulate the principles Details of equitable use, as well as the equitable management plan in the public tender, ”he warned.
On the other hand, Ron Lam suggested creating an advisory board for the development of the telecommunications sector, which will serve to “regularly and proactive auscuct the opinions of professional sectors” on the regulation and planning of industry development.
