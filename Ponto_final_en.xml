In Macao, there is still little awareness for the urgency of climate action, defended Joe Chan. At the end, the environmentalist added that the government, despite being more active in this context, still lacks long -term vision. Chan also proposed the end of all disposable plastic utensils on the market.
 
Although the Government of MSA is more active in the area of ​​the environment, there is still lack of long -term vision and this is “the biggest environmental challenge” Macau currently faces, Joe Chan defended, in statements to the final point regarding World Environment Day, which is marked today.
The environmentalist and president of the Macau Green Student Union association justified that the successive mashed governments have tried only to solve the most urgent environmental problems through inefficient methods, and set an example of the plan for building an “ecological island” near HAC-Sá beach that will serve as a trash. "When there is no place to deposit construction waste, they [government] have the idea of ​​building a landfill in the ocean," he lamented.
Another obstacle that Macao faces, explained the environmentalist, has to do with the lack of connection between the population of Macau and the global situation. People "are not aware of the urgency of climate action," he said, adding, "We don't know what price we or the next generation will have to pay due to pollution."
"Without the awareness of citizens, we will not be able to start planning the advancement of different legislations, such as the garbage rate, mandatory recycling or energy savings policies," Chan said, indicating that "more efforts and investment in environmental education are needed, so that people understand why our city needs to keep track of the global trend."
Joe Chan pointed out that “in general, the Macao government has become more active in building a better macao to live in recent years”, for example, “widening streets to facilitate citizens' circulation, planting more trees to increase green cover in the city, investing more resources in clean recycling”.
Recently, the government has announced that it will prohibit the importation of cotton swabs with plastic rods, balloons and balloon plastic stems from next year, marking a new phase in the disposable plastic restriction plan in the territory. Previously the importation of plastic bags and disposable cutlery had been prohibited. However, for Joe Chan, these restrictions do not embrace most plastic items used by the population.
In addition, traders "may claim that they are using items they have stored, and can also easily find sources of plastic products by various means." "This is why I suggest that we should establish a date until there will be no more disposable plastic utensils on the market, which will facilitate tracking and monitoring," he proposed.</description><pubDate>2025-06-05 04:22:09</pubDate></item><item><title>China requires the WTO Supervision of “unilateral tariffs”</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/06/05/china-exige-a-omc-supervisao-de-tarifas-unilaterais/</link><description>Caption:
 
Chinese commerce minister Wang Wenta has urged the World Trade Organization (WTO) to reinforce the supervision of “unilateral tariffs” and present “objective and neutral” political proposals, according to a statement released yesterday.
 
According to the Chinese Ministry of Trade, Wang met Tuesday with WTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, on the sidelines of a ministerial meeting of the organization in Paris, where they maintained an "in-depth discussion about the serious situation of world trade." "In response to the arbitrary imposition of tariffs by some members, the WTO should reinforce the supervision of these unilateral tariffs and offer objective and neutral political recommendations," the ministry said in a veiled reference to the United States.
The message also urged the WTO member countries to ensure that any bilateral trade agreements "comply with the rules" of the organization and "avoid harming the interests of third parties."
Wang reiterated China's position of defending "a multilateral commercial system" and said the WTO has its support to play "a more important role in global economic governance."
The Chinese minister also met with the European Commissioner for Trade, Maros Sefcovic, with whom he maintained “deep, frank and comprehensive discussions” about “urgent and important issues related to economic and commercial cooperation between China and the European Union”.
According to the ministry, Wang has appealed to greater efforts to “prepare the important agenda between China and the EU this year”, which includes a summit to celebrate the 50th anniversary of bilateral relations.
The presidents of the European Commission and the European Council, Ursula Von Der Leyen and António Costa, respectively, are expected to travel to Beijing in the second half of July to meet with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.
Von der Leyen said the EU should "work constructively with China to find solutions" throughout this year, and that Brussels should "maintain a more balanced relationship with Beijing, in a spirit of justice and reciprocity."
The EU also appealed to China to avoid “a new climb” in the trade war triggered by the tariffs announced by US President Donald Trump, although Beijing believes that Washington is not fulfilling the agreement reached by the two powers in Geneva.
For his part, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi met Tuesday with the United States Ambassador in China, David Pound, to whom he drew attention to the recent introduction of "a series of negative measures based on unfounded arguments, undermining China's legitimate rights and interests." “We firmly oppose that,” said Chinese diplomacy chief.
Among the measures are the suspension of sales of computer programs for semiconductor design, new controls to vital semiconductor exports to artificial intelligence and revocation of visas to Chinese students, a measure that China has described as discriminatory.
On May 12, both powers agreed to a three -month tariff truce, in which the US pledged to reduce tariffs from 145% to 30% and China from 125% to 10% in an attempt to make way to a broader deal.
 
Trump says it is “extremely difficult to reach an agreement” with Xi Jinping
 
United States President Donald Trump said he appreciates the Chinese counterpart, but it is “extremely difficult to reach an agreement” with Xi Jinping at a time when the two countries lock a trade war. "I like President Xi from China, I always liked it and I will always like it, but it is very difficult," said the US leader on his Truth social network, the day when customs on steel and aluminum imported by the US increased to 50%.
Trump's statements come at a time when US press advances with the possibility of the two leaders approaching a final deal by telephone that attenuate commercial tensions. It was not clear if Trump spoke to Xi, however.

Between Friday and Sunday, the “Feeling Macau” campaign will be exposed to the Bangkok audience with tourist offers, airplane tickets and local celebrity performances.
 
The tourist campaign “Feeling Macao” returns to Bangkok, Thailand, between June 6 and 8, under the theme “Macao Wonder”. This is the first large scale promotion that the Tourism Services Directorate (STD) holds this year in Southeast Asia, after several promotional activities in Indonesia and Malaysia.
Today, on the eve of the inauguration, STD and several representatives of Macau's tourist industry will hold a contact scholarship and a promotion seminar on “Tourism + Conventions and Exhibitions” products, allowing Thai residents and tourist operators to deepen their knowledge about the tourist trends of destination. For its part, the Institute for the Promotion of Investment and Commerce (IPIM) will present the current context of the convention and exhibition sector in Macao and will allow tourist operators of both regions to establish contacts and promote mutual flows of visitors.
On the same day, STD will also have a meeting with the Sino-Tailandian Chamber of Commerce “to exchange impressions with Chinese Diaspora on Tourism, Conventions and Exhibitions, Trade and Consular Protection between Macao and Thailand”, according to a statement from the body.
The inauguration of the campaign takes place tomorrow, at Siam Paragon, and will remain open to the public until Sunday. During these three days, the six major Macao's Integrated Tourism and Leisure Companies will join several airlines and Thai travel agencies in the sale of tourist products, exclusive offers and plane tickets to Macau. In a statement, STD notes that the sale of airplane tickets presupposes a bangacoque trip to Macau and a return ticket originated in cities in the Great Bay, in an attempt to promote “multi-desert tourism”.
Thai tourists who visit Macau can also benefit from discounts on the spending on the region if they use a Thailand electronic payment platform, thus enabling a more convenient tourist experience for visitors and at the same time the development of the local economy.
The range of the STD campaign goes beyond tourist promotions in the shopping center, extending through the stations of Metro and Bangcoque streets with a total of 128 electronic screens. The event will also feature performances by Thai celebrities and digital influencers, as a way to increase the adhesion of the local population to the project.
Macau Tourism Bodies have sought to widen the market of international visitors, especially those from Southeast Asia. To this end, STD has participated in several international tourism fairs, launched special offers in cooperation with airlines and travel agencies and organized familiarization visits and presentation of new tourist attractions to attract more visitors from these regions.
Macao has been registering an increasingly significant increase in visitors of this group of countries, with Thailand currently occupying eighth place among the top ten visitors' markets. In April, there were 20,463 the Thai tourists who chose Macao as a vacation destination, which represents an increase of 24.1% in annual terms. Direct air connections between Bangkok and Macao play a significant role in this increase, there are currently 54 direct flights per week between both cities.

The hospital authority announced on Tuesday that it is collaborating with Abbott Laboratories, the US test manufacturer for prostate specific antigen levels (PSA), after receiving reports of irregularities in quality controls last week.
An increase in PSA levels may be indicative of prostate cancer, but the defective lots, distributed to the Caritas Medical Center in Sham Shui PO and Tuen Mun Hospital, can “lead to clinical errors,” the agency warned.
"Defects in the reagent can lead to an erroneous prostate cancer diagnosis, leading medical professionals to consider unnecessary interventions," the hospital authority emphasized.
Quoted yesterday by the South China Morning Post newspaper, the agency assured that a “strict investigation” has started and that it is contacting patients affected to repeat the tests.
Tuen Mun Hospital did not use the product, but the Caritas Medical Center analyzed blood samples from 406 patients, who have been conducting these tests since April 28.
After evaluating the results, approximately 70 patients will be contacted this week to repeat the tests, while the rest will have appointments scheduled for the coming days. "We confirmed that no affected patients underwent unnecessary clinical procedures or was delays in treatment due to this incident," said the hospital authority, who created a telephone line for possible consultations.
In addition to PSA tests, doctors use complementary methods such as rectal exams, ultrasounds and biopsies to diagnose prostate cancer. Both centers replaced the defective reagent with alternatives, and other public hospitals did not use the affected lots.
A spokesman said the agency required the supplier "a complete investigation of its quality controls and test records, as well as explanations and corrective measures." The hospital authority, which notified the Health Department, did not rule out additional actions to hold the company responsible.
In 2022, prostate cancer was the fourth most common cancer type in Hong Kong, behind the lung, breast and colorectal cancer, with 2,758 new cases reported, according to official data.
This disease was responsible for 16% of the new diagnoses of cancer in men, consolidating itself as the third most common in this group, with an average age of 71 years at the height of the diagnosis. This type of cancer showed the largest increase in a decade in the Hong Kong population, with a 69% increase between 2012 and 2022.
Prostate cancer was the fourth main cause of cancer mortality among men, with 519 deaths in 2022, the equivalent of 6.2% of all cancer deaths in men in the Asian city, according to the hospital authority.

China is considering the possibility of ordering hundreds of airplanes from European Construtora Airbus next month, at the time of the 50th anniversary of official relations between the country and the European Union, Bloomberg yesterday advanced.
According to the news agency, which cites unidentified sources, the business may focus on about 300 narrow and narrow fuselage aircraft, while another source advances with 500 devices, which would constitute one of the largest airplanes in history and the largest for China.
In any case, these sources claim that negotiations are still open and that the business may not materialize or be closed on a later date. So far, neither Airbus nor the Chinese authorities responsible for the aircraft negotiations have issued any official confirmation on the subject.
France and Germany, two of the countries that control Airbus, will be able to send their leaders, Emmanuel Macron and Friedrich Merz, to the China - EU, which takes place in July, in Beijing.
If the agreement is signed at that time, it may also be interpreted as a sign of Chinese President Xi Jinping to his US counterpart Donald Trump that he intends to strengthen commercial ties with the EU, at a time when Beijing's ties with Washington deteriorate due to trade war between the two powers.
However, Bloomberg points to Airbus's main rival, the American Boeing, as one of the potential winners of a hypothetical trade agreement between Beijing and Washington.
In the recent Commercial Pact with the UK, one of the most important points was precisely the sale of aircraft. But Boeing has been in difficulties in the Chinese market for years, compared to commercial tensions and concerns about the security of its planes, which resulted in a ban of nearly five years of 737 MAX, after two accidents with a total of 346 dead in Ethiopia and Indonesia.
This, associated with other temporary prohibitions, such as the ban, for a month, between April and May, from the delivery of Boeing aircraft to Chinese companies due to the escalation of the trade war between Beijing and Washington, allowed Airbus to gain advantage in China in recent years. Boeing has not received a major order from China since at least 2017.</description><pubDate>2025-06-05 04:27:12</pubDate></item><item><title>Contest for leasing commercial spaces in zone A ends on the 20th</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/06/05/concurso-para-arrendamento-de-espacos-comerciais-na-zona-a-termina-no-dia-20/</link><description>The Housing Institute (IH) announced the opening of a public tender for the lease of the first five public housing spaces in zone A of the new landfills.

Tiananmen's birthday again without vigil in Macau
 
The repression of the Tiananmen student movement yesterday turned 36 years and, once again, the vigil was not held that was usual until 2019.

According to the representative of the sector, supermarkets are being affected by changing residents' consumption habits and competition from the mainland market, and more supermarkets are planned to close their doors during the year.
 
The Macao Supermarket and Basic Food Association warned of the business difficulties of local supermarkets due to revenue reduction and increased operating costs. Wong Man Wai, president of the association, pointed out that some spaces of certain supermarket chains have recently closed the doors and said he believed it will end later this year.
Wong Man Wai stated that supermarkets are “spending a difficult period of adjustment” with a 30%business break, and the situation is more critical in non -tourist areas. "During the pandemic, supermarkets played an important role as a pillar of safeguarding the basic needs of the population, but, after the epidemic, they became the least benefited industry," the official lamented, in statements to the newspaper or world.
He also acknowledged that the exclusion of some major local supermarkets from the list of eligible traders to participate in the Grand Prix for Consumption Prize had “a big impact” in the supermarket sector as well as suppliers. "The big supermarkets were forced to leave the market due to the high operating costs," said Wong, adding that the spaces in the North Zone had "even more difficulty" due to the lack of support from consumer policies.
The local supermarket leader Tai Fung stressed that some small and medium -sized suppliers have entered a “survival crisis” because of the “sharp drop” of supermarket orders.
It is recalled that the Passada Round of the Grand Prix for Consumption in Community Zones has offered discounts in more than 20,000 physical shops. However, the plan excluded discount on large supermarket chains, water services, electricity, fuel, medical services, parking parks, among others.
Wong Man Wai, moreover, pointed out that the reduction of consumer expenses is now also a problem for the industry, and these are more focused on prices. "In the past, they used to choose foreign food products, but now they think that the continent products are more diverse," he said. "The high cost of products imported abroad makes it difficult for sale, so many supermarkets do not dare to buy large quantities. The proportion of products from the interior of China increases, causing local supermarkets to face competitive challenges in the continent market," he noted.
The representative admitted that the transformation of business model for online sale is also "useless" and "ineffective", as labor and logistics costs continue to be high and e -commerce in mainland China occupies an increasing space in the market.
The most up to date data on statistics and census services show that the turnover of retail trade establishments recorded a 15% annual decrease in the first quarter of this year, ciphering at 17.58 billion patacas. According to the inquiry, 52.3% of retailers predict that the exploration of establishments will be even worse in the second quarter.
In this case, Wong Man Wai drew attention to the possible opening of another new supermarket on the other side of the border, near the Gongbei Border Post, which can make the business of local supermarkets even more difficult.</description><pubDate>2025-06-05 04:24:45</pubDate></item><item><title>Hospital das Ilais creates position of “doctor's assistant” to absorb local licenses</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/06/05/hospital-das-ilhas-cria-cargo-de-auxiliar-de-medico-para-absorver-licenciados-locais-de-medicina/</link><description>The Islands Hospital is planning to create a new position as a “doctor's assistant” to help entry into the sector by local medical school graduates. Health services guarantee to give priority to residents in access to health use, indicating that all doctors in office at the Macau Union Medical Center are places, except those highlighted by Peking Union Medical College Hospital.
 
The Islands Hospital continues to carry out the recruitment procedures of doctors and revealed the plan to create a new “doctor's assistant” post to attract the entry of more licensed healthcuts, revealed health services, in response to a written interpellation of Deputy Leong Hong Sai.
The issue was raised under a government forecast on employment pressure in Macao of medical graduates over the next three years. Authorities had warned of the difficulty of finding employment by more than 1,800 health graduates by 2027, and the number may exceed the search for local medical services.
Alvis Lo, director of health services, reiterated in the response that the government always follows the principle of giving priority to local residents in access to employment. "It only uses the recruitment of experts with vast professional and clinical experience abroad when there is a lack of local professionals in some specialized health care services," he said.
For the islands health care complex - Macao Medical Center of the Peking Union Medical College Hospital, which officially entered operation in September last year, the executive assured that, currently, except for the staff highlighted by Peking Union Medical College Hospital, all acting doctors are residents.
Alvis Lo also confirmed that he is developing the transformation of the Macau Union Medical Center in a high level training institution in the territory, “thus contributing to provide local health professionals a platform for continuous medical education of high quality and continuous professional development,” he said. The official stressed that the government will send in the future, in phases, some doctors, nurses and clinical technicians to Beijing or other places to receive different formations.
 
“Stable and sufficient” medical team
 
Reiterating having attributed “great importance” to the construction of the team of health professionals from Macau, Alvis Lo recalled that Macau has established a proportion between the population and the medical and nursing staff that is defined according to their real needs, which foresees, by the end of this year, a ratio of 3 doctors and 4.2 nurses per thousand inhabitants. In this case, last year, he set 2.9 doctors and 4.4 nurses per thousand inhabitants, "getting close or reaching the above objectives," he said.
The answer also stands out the stability of the nursing staff team. It indicated that more than 1,300 nurses are currently in health services and, in recent years, the rate of service detachment and nurses' retirement has been kept at a relatively low level, in the order of 2%.
The Council of Health Professionals, according to Alvis Lo, will optimize the internship environment of nursing staff and raise the quality of the internship by increasing the number of internship advisors and the distribution of interns by different services.
Authorities, on the other hand, pointed out that they “pay close attention” to the work of medical and nursing staff, indicating that they have established an electronic system of patient referral monitoring, mobilize human resources and increase the number of vacancies in external consultations according to the needs of services.
In the first quarter of this year, the average waiting time at the Emergency Emergency Service of the Conde de São Januário hospital center was about an hour, and the average waiting time at the first external specialty consultation was reduced to about three weeks.</description><pubDate>2025-06-05 04:23:11</pubDate></item><item><title>Lukashenko thanks Xi in Beijing the “strong support and long -term assistance”</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/06/05/lukashenko-agradece-a-xi-em-pequim-o-forte-apoio-e-assistencia-a-longo-prazo/</link><description>HUANG JINGWEN/XINHUA PHOTOGRAPHY

COOPERATION
 
Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko expressed yesterday to Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, the gratitude of his country to China for his "strong support" and "long -term assistance" at a time when Minsk is more isolated in Europe.
Quoted by the Chinese official news agency Xinhua, Lukashenko stated that in each of his 15 visits to China, "felt the deep friendship" of the Asian country.
The Belarussian leader said that his country "has great confidence in China, with which he will unobailably develop his relationships and promote cooperation." "At the international level, China firmly defends multilateralism and opposes unilateralism and sanctions, giving an example to the world," he added.
Xi Jinping congratulated his counterpart for reelection as president of Belarus last January, an election marked by allegations of fraud by the exiled opposition and western countries.
Xi stressed that China and Belarus "are true friends and good partners," who have been treated "with sincerity and friendship."
According to the Chinese leader, the confidence between Minsk and Beijing is "unshakable" and cooperation in several domains "has been reinforced," said Xinhua. Xi urged both parties to "oppose hegemony, intimidation and violence, and to defend international equity and justice."
Quoted by the Bielarrussian news agency Belta, Belarus ambassador in China, Aleksandr Chervyakov, said on Tuesday that some of the main topics during Lukashenko's visit would be "the modernization of the Belarussian economy based on Chinese technology."
The trip is an opportunity to “evaluate and review the results of cooperation work” between Minsk and Beijing, he said. "China remains a fundamental strategic partner for us, as always," he emphasized.
Lukashenko visited China in February 2023, when he assured that "the expansion of contacts with China is a priority of Belarusian foreign policy." In December of the same year, President Belarusso went back to China as a sign of good relations between Beijing and Minsk.</description><pubDate>2025-06-05 04:27:12</pubDate></item><item><title>Infrastructure Forum will have an exhibition zone dedicated to Macau and Hengqin</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/06/05/forum-sobre-infra-estruturas-tera-zona-de-exposicao-dedicada-a-macau-e-hengqin/</link><description>The 16th edition of the Forum and International Exhibition on Investment Investment and Construction (IIICF), which will take place at the 10th and 12th of June, will include an exhibition zone on brands and outstanding technologies from Macao and Hengqin infrastructure companies. During the event, the infrastructure development index will also be released in Portuguese -speaking countries, faced with more than 400 elites and government representatives from Lusophone countries and the Great Bay area.
 
The 16th International Forum and Infrastructure Investment and Construction Exhibition (IIICF) will feature an exhibition zone centered on Macau and Hengqin.
In a statement, the Institute for the Promotion of Commerce and Investment (IPIM) reports that the exhibition zone includes an area of ​​150 square meters and that it was projected “based on the experience gained in its first installation last year”. This year, the zone “will present a combination of multimedia facilities and products developed autonomously by companies”.
Among the products that will be on display, we highlight the “immediate installation structure models ready to inhabit” and “the models of intelligent 5G inspection vehicles”. These examples of “prominent technologies” already in Macao and Hengqin will allow participants in the forum-which include representatives of governments and leading companies in the infrastructure sector-familiarize themselves with the joint development opportunities of both regions, guarantees IPIM.
To date, the IIICF has registered more than 400 government representatives and elites from Portuguese -speaking countries and the Great Bay. In the same statement, the organizing entity underlines the intention to cement Macau as a “infallible link” between the two parts, noting that infrastructure projects held in previous editions-covering areas of activity such as construction, technical consultancy or energy and electricity-ascend to a value of about $ 39 billion.
The 10th Infrastructure Cooperation Forum between China and Portuguese -speaking countries is scheduled for the first day of the IIICF, where the third consecutive year will be released the infrastructure development index in Portuguese -speaking countries. It is recalled that in 2024, Brazil and Angola were Portuguese-speaking countries with the highest quotation in the index, which evaluates criteria such as the environment, demand, receptivity and costs for infrastructure development.
The 16th International Forum and Infrastructure Investment and Construction Exhibition will take place at the Venetian Cotai Expo between 10 and 12 June, subordinate to the theme “Enhanced connectivity for mutually beneficial cooperation”. Over the three days of the event, exchanges, exhibitions, official launches and contact scholarships intended for national and international entrepreneurs will be boosted, with the purpose of promoting cooperation between China and countries around the world in the infrastructure sector.
In a statement issued in late May, the IPIM said the event will be part of the “Innovative Results Premiere Ceremony” for the first time, which will be exhibited 13 projects never before presented. Featured projects are related to various domains, such as smart construction, digital intelligence technology, new materials, environmental protection and low carbon.

Vast reservations of phosphate and free trade agreements with the European Union make Morocco in the “favorite place” for Chinese companies to install their supply chains, described the reflection group in a report. Strategic location and tax incentives reinforce this attractiveness.
"Morocco is reaping the fruits of a 25-year modernization effort, led by its reformer king, Mohammed VI. With low-cost labor, favorable investment policies and efficient transport infrastructures, the country has benefited from the regionalization of global supply chains, emerging as a platform for the European market," says Gavekal Dragonomics, cited in the analysis.
The Port of Tanger Med, the largest Mediterranean container terminal, located just 14 kilometers from southern Spain, through the Gibraltar Strait, is pointed out as another of the decisive factors, along with the dozens of free trade agreements that keeps with partners such as the United Kingdom and the United States.
Companies such as Chinese BYD and CATL have invested, in the last ten years, in the development of this technology, anticipating the transition from the automotive sector to the electric segment.
China now has more than 80% of the global capacity for electric vehicle batteries and the monopoly of raw materials and key components needed for production, threatening to shake the 'status quo' of the automotive industry, dominated by western and Japanese manufacturers.
Morocco currently produces about one million vehicles per year, half of which to the European market. Although production is now focused on internal combustion engine cars, Moroccan authorities provide that by 2030 electric vehicles represent up to 60% of sector exports, anticipating the prohibition of the use of fossil fuels in the European Union, scheduled for 2035.
Morocco holds about 70% of world phosphate reserves, positioned the country alongside Chile (lithium), Indonesia (Nickel) and the Democratic Republic of Congo (cobalt) in the group of main suppliers of critical minerals, observed Gavekal Dragonomics.
Phosphate is an essential component of lithium-fosphate batteries (LFP), which, although less energy-dense than nickel-manganese-okalto batteries-usually used in high performance electric vehicles-have a lower cost.
China concentrates almost 100% of the installed production capacity of LFP batteries. However, a combination of excess capacity and threats of tariffs abroad is leading Chinese companies to move part of production abroad. "This is a significant opportunity for Morocco, which aims to transform phosphates into the backbone of their future industrial development," said Gavekal Dragonomics. "With the support of foreign companies, the country is positioning itself throughout the value chain of electric vehicles-from extraction and refinement to cell production, breeding of batteries and final assembly. If it can capitalize this impulse, Morocco could become the largest LFP battery production center outside China," added the reflection group.

"I will be the president of all, embracing and serving all the people," said the president, promising to leave behind ideological clashes and resort to useful policies, "whether Park Chung-Hee or Kim Dae-Jung," in reference to two former presidents of opposite orientation.
As for foreign policy, particularly challenging in the current context of transforming world economy and security, Lee Jae-Myung, was willing to choose "pragmatic diplomacy, centered on national interests."
The new South Korean head of state said he will reinforce the alliance with the United States and said that his strategy for maximizing national interests does not exclude dialogue with North Korea. "We will seek ways to coexist with North Korea," he said. "True security is not needing a war," he said.
In the internal level and following the serious political crisis triggered by the attempt to impose martial law, he promised to “prevent any future attempts at military insurrection”, such as the one that led to the dismissal of his predecessor Yoon Suk-Yeol. "The weapons entrusted by the people were used to declare the martial law. This cannot happen again. I will blame the culprits and assure myself that such a thing will not happen again," he promised.
Lee pledged to activate an emergency economic response team and reactivate the virtuous growth cycle, supported by public investment.
The new president announced investments in artificial intelligence and new industries, and said his government will promote an energy transition to renewable sources. "Climate change is threatening people's ecosystem," he said.
Lee Jae-Myung has also pledged to reinforce the cultural industry and turn Korea a power power power, mentioning K-Pop, K-Dramas, K-Beauty and other "K" brand sectors. "I will become a president of the people. Koreans, when we become one, become strong and we can overcome any challenge," he said.
The inauguration ceremony took place inside the National Assembly (Parliament), in Seoul, in a small format, with 360 participants, including bipartisan leaders, deputies and members of the outgoing government, where the absence of the main defeated rival candidate of the Popular Power Party (PPP), Kim Moon-Soo, was also notorious.
 
Lee Jae-Myung, from Children's Worker to the Presidency of South Korea
 
Judicial processes, scandal and even the knife attack of an aggressor did not prevent Lee Jae-Myung, an ancient modest-origin worker, from winning the South Korean presidential elections.
A triumph, after his defeat by a small margin in the 2022 elections against the then PPP candidate, Yoon Suk-Youol, devoid of having tried to impose martial law in December. A frustrated attempt that had as a result, namely, the triggering of these early elections.
A very rare fact in a country where social origin is a national obsession, Lee, 61, cultivates his own fairy tale of the working-class son who has become a political leader to convince South Koreans that he will know how to solve the country's problems.
Born in Andong, east of South Korea, Lee Jae-Myung had to start working at a glove factory at age 11 for lack of money to enter secondary education. But at age 13, his arm was stuck in a press, which made him unable for the rest of his life.
He began attending night classes and then law school until he became a lawyer specializing in human rights defense.
He entered politics in 2010 and widened the fight against inequalities, in a country facing the increase in housing cost and a high unemployment rate among young people. "We can worry about the people who tremble with cold outside while we are sitting in the heat of our room," Lee told the French news agency AFP in an interview in 2022, adding, "But we can never really understand your pain."
South Korea has been without a stable leader since the deputies suspended Yoon Suk-Yeol in December after the failed attempt to establish the martial law on the night from December 3, 2024.
Lee Jae-Myung joined other deputies to vote against the suspension of the civil regime, despite an army barrier sent by Yoon, and broadcast live on social networks his trip to Parliament. "It was a race against time," he described to AFP.
With extensive political experience, he was mayor of Seongam, a city on the outskirts of Seoul for eight years, contributing namely to the closing of the largest canine meat market in the country. Subsequently, he was governor of the province of Gyeonggi, the most populous in the country, for more than three years.
In 2022, he first ran for the presidency of South Korea, but lost a narrow margin to Yoon Suk-Youol, a then novice prosecutor in politics. It was hospitalized in 2023 after 19 days of hunger strike started to denounce the “incompetent and violent” policies of the conservative government.
He later emerged in the polls as a strong candidate to run again for the presidency.
In January 2024, a man who said he wanted to stop him from becoming head of state stabbed him in his neck during a trip to Busan (south). Lee Jae-Myung was on the edge of death and underwent emergency surgery.
Lee Jae-Myung claims to want to reinforce the artificial intelligence sector so that South Korea joins the three most advanced countries in this area. It also wants those responsible for the attempt to impose martial law to be held responsible.
But Lee Jae-Myung is also the target of several lawsuits, namely for abuse of trust and corruption. The politician denies any fault and claims to be the target of accusations with political motivation.
One of the most media cases in which it is cited concerns alleged links with a company suspected of having illegally transferred eight million dollars (seven million euros to the current exchange rate) to North Korea.
Lee is also at the center of four corruption cases, most of which are related to allegedly doubtful contracts celebrated when he was Mayor of Seongam.
At least five people linked to the various scandals involving Lee were found dead, mostly suicide.
In early May, the South Korea Supreme Court annulled its acquittal in a case of violation of the electoral law and ordered a new trial, which could make way for its ineligibility at the end of its eventual presidential term.
Lee's opponents argued that the accusations were serious enough to disqualify the elections. “With this kind of corruption accusations, how is it possible to run for a public office?” Asked Kim Moon-soo, the main opponent, during a television debate.

In this period, almost 2,000 inspections were made.
 
Since the beginning of 2024 and March this year, the Directorate of Tourism Services (STD) has made 1,977 inspections in the fight against illegal tour guides, and 19 illegal situations were detected and sanctioning procedures. The information was shared by STDs in response to a written interpellation of Deputy Lo Choi In, which required measures to "fight, from the source, the illegal excursions."
The 19 cases of illegal guides detected by the authorities were also referred to the Public Security Police Corps (CPSP) and the direction of services to labor affairs (DSAL), as "these individuals are probably also involved in violating the legislation that regulates illegal work."
The STD details that 17 of the illegal tour guides were tourist operators from the interior of China and, therefore, these cases were reported to the continent's authorities.
Macao authorities point out that they have released to the tourist operators and tourists from the interior of China "the information that organized excursions to Macau must be welcomed by the licensed travel agencies of Macao and the Macao tour guides." At the same time, STD warns visitors who want to participate in macao excursions to “consider the itinerary of them, the quality of services and the reasonableness of price, among other factors, in order to carefully choose the tour with quality”.
In the answer, STD cites DSSA that “the provision of work by any non -resident in Macao is considered an infringement of the law, unless it obtained a permanence authorization in the quality of a non -resident worker, or the holder of an authorization for the exercise of activities for their own benefit”, except certain situations provided for in the regulation on illegal work.
In conclusion, STD ensures that it will continue to combat irregularities in the Tourism sector and, at the same time, “will continue to exchange and cooperation with the competent tourism services of neighboring regions, maintaining communication with tourist operators, to actively improve their work, jointly promote the orderly and the interests of visitors and safeguard the image of Macao as Tourist City ”.
In the interpealing, Deputy Lo Choi in complained mainly about the illegal guides that organize “zero cost excursions” and “low cost excursions”, warning that “these organizations, to escape inspection, often choose to organize activities in Macao outside the work hours of inspection services”.</description><pubDate>2025-06-05 04:25:10</pubDate></item><item><title>Hong Kong accused man of alleged threat of bomb against concert</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/06/05/homem-acusado-em-hong-kong-de-alegada-ameaca-de-bomba-contra-concerto/</link><description>INVESTIGATION
 
Hong Kong police announced yesterday that they accused a 35 -year -old man of four crimes of a "bomb threat" against a concert and against the representation of the Chinese central government in the former British colony. On Tuesday, police had announced the detention of men and four women, between 24 and 38, for "conspiracy to commit terrorist activities."
According to an investigation, the five suspects will have sent several messages to the police, via telephone, electronic mail and messaging platforms, between April 29 and May 13.
Messages included threats to explode bombs placed in various Chinese central government offices in Hong Kong and Kai Tak Sports Park, police said.
The last call included a bomb threat against a concert on May 13, said at a press conference, the superintendent of the National Security Department, Steve Li Kwai-Wah.
Kai Tak Sports Park, which opened in March, is part of a stadium with a place for 50,000 spectators, which hosted, on May 13, a Mayday concert, a Taiwan band.
According to local press, Steve Li said police searched the stadium that same day, but found nothing suspect and that the concert was normal. The statement said the suspects will also have sent "seditious messages that incited Taiwan and Hong Kong's independence."
Steve Li said the five suspects were arrested on Monday following four homes searches, during which mobile phones and computers were seized. The four women were released under bail, "while further investigations are awaited," the statement said.</description><pubDate>2025-06-05 04:27:12</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
