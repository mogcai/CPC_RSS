The Suzhou city court ruled that Zhou Jiasheng, 52, stabbed the three victims because he was in debt and did not want to continue living, Japanese Government Secretary-General Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters in Tokyo. The case was one of two knife attacks against Japanese children in China last year, raising concerns about rising anti-Japan sentiment in the country. Tokyo asked Beijing to guarantee the safety of its citizens in China. Hayashi said the court's decision made no reference to Japan. “We believe that the crime that killed and injured innocent people, including a child, was absolutely unforgivable and we take the decision seriously,” Hayashi said. Officials from the Japanese Consulate in Shanghai were present at the trial, he said.
The stabbing occurred at a bus stop at a Japanese school in Suzhou on June 24. Bus table maid Hu Youping, who tried to prevent the attack, died days later due to injuries. The Japanese mother and child did not suffer serious injuries. In September, a 10 -year -old Japanese student died after being stabbed near his school in the city of Shenzhen in the south of the country. Other attacks on the knife involving foreigners last year were isolated incidents, according to the Chinese government. In June, a Chinese stabbed four US university professors in a public park in Jilin, in the northeast of the country, as well as a Chinese citizen who tried to intervene. In May, a knife attack in a hospital in southwest China killed two people and injured 21 others.</description><pubDate>2025-01-24T01:06:06+08:00</pubDate></item><item><title>“Flora Macanensis” unites cultures on display in Poland</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/01/24/flora-macanensis-une-culturas-em-exposicao-na-polonia/</link><description>The exhibition “Flora Macanensis”, by artists Cheong Kin Man and Marta Stanisława Sala, highlights the cultural exchange between Macau and Poland, revisiting the 1990 “Operation Dragão”, which legalized thousands of immigrants in Macau. Presented at the Katowice Municipal Library, the exhibition includes works that connect Polish historical figures with personal narratives, as well as interactive pieces and an experimental video.
 
Artists Marta Stanisława Sala and Cheong Kin Man recently presented their first joint exhibition in Poland, entitled “Flora Macanensis”. The exhibition opened on January 7th at the Katowice Municipal Library (MBPK), located in Bogucice, and included an hour-long conversation between the artists and the public, focusing on Macau culture.
During the conversation, Sala and Cheong shared details about their collaboration with Lam Sio Man on the 2023 Macau Biennale. Lam, who was previously curator at the Macau Pavilion at the 2019 Venice Biennale, brought a third perspective to the works presented.
Among the exhibited works, there was a new work. A series of seven posters, also called “Flora Macanensis”. This series, manually printed and incorporating elements of the room family textile archive, tells the story of Flora, Cheong's mother, who fled the post-revolutionary boat China to the then Portuguese colony of Macao, where she was welcomed by refugees Vietnamese.
Additionally, another work by the artists, consisting of three textile pieces, combines the risky journey of Cheong's father, who was looking for a better life in Macau, with references to the Polish travelers, including the Jesuit Michał Boym and the adventurer Maurice Benyowsky, who was in Macao in 1771.
This textile series was presented for the first time in spring 2024, during the duo's debut in Germany, at Krakauer Haus, Kraków's only cultural mission abroad, in collaboration with Nuremberg City Council and with the support of Fundação Oriente .
The exhibition also includes a science fiction art mini -man, called “Apocalypses”, written entirely in a fictional language with translation to Polaco, and commissioned for the Macao Biennial two years ago. In addition, an experimental video was shown entitled “Pombr do Noszenia” (“The Emergency Monument”), where Portuguese navigator António de Abreu Freire shares a report about a brief encounter with the future president of Poland, Lech Waęsa , in the early 1980s.
Additionally, “Flora Macanensis” addresses the theme of the 1990 “Operation Dragon,” during which more than 50,000 illegal immigrants, including Cheong’s mother Flora, were granted residency rights in Macau.
Furthermore, the exhibition highlights the connections between Macau and Poland, through the stories of explorers and other adventures. The duo of artists dates back to the publication of “Flora Sinensis”, a work by Michał Boim, published in 1656, which serves as the title and inspiration for the exhibition.
The seven -poster series and the three -piece textile series, titled “The Compass of Utopia”, are just some of the works that are part of the exhibition. Other pieces, such as “Ghost Money”, complement the show and highlight the rich cultural diversity that unites Macau and Poland.
“Flora Macanensis” will be available to visit at the Bogucice Library (Wajdy 21, in Katowice) until February 28, providing an opportunity to explore identity, migration and cultural relations between Poland and Macau.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Hennessy launches limited edition inspired by designer Shuting Qiu</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/01/24/hennessy-lanca-edicao-limitada-inspirada-na-designer-shuting-qiu/</link><description>Hennessy has launched a new collaboration for the Chinese New Year, the year of the serpent, with a limited collection inspired by Chinese fashion designer Shuting Qiu. In a fusion of fashion and luxury, the collection, called “Reimagion”, “is a tribute to the serpent, which represents the renewal and positive transformation, leaving behind the past and embracing new beginnings,” says a statement from Hennessy.
“Vibrant, abstract interpretations of a serpent writhe across the bottle designs, utilizing splashes of color and prints, like ancient Chinese brocade patterns, to reflect the texture and scales of the serpent’s body,” adds the company.
Shuting Qiu, originating from Hangzhou and currently living in Shanghai, was inspired by his cultural heritage. Based on the 'jacquard' fabric, the Chinese brocades and the embroidery traditionally used in the clothing and textiles of his hometown, Qiu reimagined the symbolic floral motifs and the abstract patterns of snake scales to adorn to brandy bottles V.S.O.P, X.O and Hennessy paradis. “With red -base colors, each bottle tells a unique story and, like a nod to Hennessy's inheritance, the swing's movements through the standards evoke the Charner River in Cognac,” says Hennessy.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Japan records record of exports in 2024 with commercial deficit to fall 44%</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/01/24/japao-regista-recorde-de-exportacoes-em-2024-com-defice-comercial-a-cair-44/</link><description>Japan registered an export record in 2024, with its commercial deficit decreased by 44% over the previous year, the Ministry of Japanese Finance said yesterday.
The trade deficit, which measures the value of exports minus imports, fell to 5.3 billion yen (32 billion euros), according to government data, despite the value of imports having increased due to rising shipping costs. energy and rising inflation around the world.
Exports from the world's third largest economy totaled 107.9 billion yen (663.9 billion euros), surpassing the 100 billion yen mark for the second consecutive year, and the highest value recorded in comparable data, which dates back to 1979, the ministry reported.
Some companies may have accelerated exports in anticipation of potential tariffs that new US President Donald Trump promised to impose. Trump said he hopes to put 25% tariffs over Canada and Mexico from February 1.
During the campaign, the new North American President threatened to impose tariffs on imports from China, although details about this eventual decision remain unclear.
In December, Japanese exports increased by 2.8% over the same month of 2023, while imports increased by 1.8%. Exports grew to Asian and European countries while fell slightly to the United States.
Imports from India, Hong Kong and Iran were the fastest growing. Vehicles, semiconductors and other machinery were the champions of the exports of Japan.
The weakening of the yen, another recent trend, has the effect of inflating the value of imports.
In the last year, the US dollar has been around 150 yen, sometimes exceeding 160 yen, while a year ago fluctuated around the reference of the 140 yen.
Japan registered a commercial deficit for four consecutive years, but last year's deficit was considerably less than the 9.5 billion yen deficit in 2023.</description><pubDate>2025-01-24T01:06:14+08:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Hotel occupation grew almost five percentage points last year</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/01/24/ocupacao-hoteleira-cresceu-quase-cinco-pontos-percentuais-no-ano-passado/</link><description>The occupancy rate of Macao hotels was, in 2024, 86.4%, more percentage points than in 2023, reported the management of statistics and census services. Over the past year, hotels received more than 14.4 million guests.
 
Last year, Macau hotels welcomed a total of more than 14.4 million guests, 6.4% more than in 2023, and the hotel room occupancy rate stood at 86.4%, 4% more .9 percentage points than in the previous year, indicated yesterday the Directorate of Statistics and Census Services (DSEC). The organization also indicated that the average length of stay for guests remained at 1.7 nights.
DSEC confirms that the number of visitor arrivals arriving on tours to Macau corresponded to around 2.1 million, that is, 63.8% more, compared to 2023. Of the total, 1.8 million were visitors on tours from from the interior of China, noting an increase of 57.1%. Around 200 thousand were international visitors on tours, registering an exponential increase of 157%. DSEC highlights that the number of visitor arrivals on tours from South Korea (91,000) and India (24,000) rose by 226.4% and 302.2%, respectively.
Over last year, the number of Macao residents who acquired travel agencies to travel abroad reached 583,000, 39.1%, in relation to 2023. From these residents, 215,000 traveled on excursions - plus 87 %, compared to 2023-, 193,000 of which moved to the interior of China.
In the month of December last year, the number of arrivals of visitors arriving on tours to Macau was equivalent to 189 thousand – 13.1% more, in annual terms –, of which 163 thousand were visitors on tours coming from the interior of China – plus 9.5% – and 22 thousand were international visitors on tours – plus 50%. DSEC highlights that the number of visitor arrivals on tours from South Korea (11,000) and Thailand (3,000) rose by 86.5% and 83.4%, respectively. In turn, the number of Macau residents who purchased services from travel agencies to travel abroad was 59,000 – 10.4% more, in annual terms –, 23 thousand of whom traveled on tours – 4.8% more.
The DSEC also says that at the end of the year 2024 there were 146 hotel establishments that provided accommodation to the public, another four compared to the end of the year 2023, providing a total of 43,000 rooms of guests, less 7.8%.

Dinis also determined that all official documentation of the kingdom, previously written in Latin, if he started writing in Portuguese. One of the purposes of this measure was to remove almost total control over writing, especially official documents, from the hands of clerics. Few knew Latin, which meant that the administration of the kingdom, and beyond, could not be carried out without the intervention of members of the clergy who in this way extended their tentacles to practically all aspects of public life. Until the middle of the thirteenth century, notarial activity was almost exclusively in the hands of members of the clergy.
This does not mean that before 1290 it was not written in Portuguese. The oldest document written entirely in Portuguese, the 'will of D. Afonso II' (in the image accompanying this article), dates from 1214; It was written in Coimbra and there were thirteen copies of which two came to us.
Already before this document written in full in Portuguese, there were documents where Portuguese words or phrases appeared in the middle of the Latin text, as is the case with the 'news of guarantors' of 1175. Some of these 'hybrid' texts are often difficult to classify , 'Are you in Latin?, are in Portuguese?' Is this the case of the 'pact of the parents', an unnatural private document that the academics believe it is also from 1175. It was recently suggested by a Galician linguist who This would be the oldest document written in Portuguese, arguing that the Latin words and expressions in the document would be read 'to the Romanesque'. To give an example of what this means, where in the document it is written 'Homines' in Latin, it would read 'men' in Portuguese. This argument is not an emptiness of merit, since many Portuguese words would be difficult to write, thanks to the evolution and appearance of new sounds that the spelling of Latin did not contemplate. In the text in question, for example, the word 'Today' appears written in Latin 'Hodie'. In the vernacular of the height, 'today' would be pronouncing 'Odje' and the transcription of the 'DJ' sound to someone with little experience in writing vernacular could be complicated, as soon as the hypothesis that the Galician researcher raises is not totally unreasonable . However, if the hybrid language in which this text is written results from an attempt to write Latin by those who did not know Latin or an attempt to write Portuguese by someone who had no experience in doing so, as the Galician researcher claims, past Almost a thousand years, it is difficult, if not impossible, to determine the initial intention of the Amanuense of the text. Moreover, the hypothesis that it was a draft to be written later in Latin cannot be discarded.
This type of documents is usually classified as being written in 'barbaric Latin', a Latin teaching and full of Latinized vernacular words used by those who did not know Latin, but had to write in Latin because the vernacular language documents at the time were not valid official. The 'pact' could also represent an extreme case of barbaric Latin. Interesting to note, however, that this document already has totally Portuguese verbal shapes such as 'help ours', with the respective assimilation of the termination of the verb to the reflex pronoun (helping ourselves → Help ourselves).
More or less on the same path is the ‘Notícia de Tordo’, a also private document, in Galician-Portuguese, full of Latin words and expressions that some believe was a draft to later be converted into an official document in Latin; There is no date, but it is believed to be between 1211 and 1216.
Also at the same time it will be the oldest poem of the Galician-Portuguese Trovators, the derision song and curse ‘now Host'o Lord of Navarre’ by João Soares de Paiva. This song, of course, is not dated, but as the events it seems to allude, namely the Aragon invasion by King Sancho VII de Navarra (1194-1234), suggests that it was written between 1204 and 1213, Period of conflict between the king of Navarre and Pedro II (1177-1213) the Catholic, king of Aragon and Count of Barcelona, ​​at a time of intense attempts to unify the Christian kingdoms of the Iberian Peninsula.
Galician-Portuguese troubadour poetry, which is contained in the famous songs of friend, love and derision-and-Maldizer extended for a period from the mid-century to the mid-fourteenth century. To this profane-themed poetry should also add the religious theme poetry compiled by Afonso X (1221–1284), the wise, king of Castile, under the aegis of 'Cantigas de Santa Maria'. The songs of troubadour poetry are the first literary monuments of the Portuguese language.
 
The beginnings of Portuguese spelling
Problems of textual classification such as those in the ‘Pact of the Pais brothers’ are nothing more than a reflection of the difficulties that the authors of ancient Portuguese texts felt when they had to write them. At the time, for those who wrote in Latin, there was a well-established spelling norm, but when they tried to write in the vernacular, especially words that, given the evolution of the language, became distant from the Latin word in its origin, the task of writing vernacular became a challenge.
In this first phase of writing of Portuguese what imposed was the principle of phonetics, that is, words wrote as they sounded. The fact that Portuguese derived from Latin and that the relationship between the two languages ​​was to some extent noticeable, especially in older language phases, makes the application of the Latin orthographic norms to the vernacular if it had been charged with a significant part of the representation of the sounds of the new language. However, new words and new sounds whose relationship with Latin may be harder to glimpse, in these cases the person who writes has to exercise his judgment to be able to write the sounds that Latin does not contemplate. Still it is to Latin that Portuguese will seek, not only the writing system, that is, the letters, for the transcription of its sounds but also the writing rules of the same sounds; For example, the initial 's' is simple, but within the word it has to double ‘-ss-’, if you want to maintain your quality deaf consonant.
The vowels, for example, maintain the value they had in late Latin. The biggest difference that Romance languages ​​have in relation to Latin, with regard to the vocal system, is that the 'vocal amount', that is, the distinction between brief and long vowels, was replaced by 'quality', ie, ie, The distinction between open and closed vowels, an evolution that had already begun to have an effect on the late period of the colloquial Latin itself. In fact, the Romance languages ​​inherit from the late colloquial Latin of their respective regions their almost intact vowel systems (exception to the French).
The evolution of the consonant system, which is susceptible to profound changes, led to some further changes to the vowel system, but nothing that would trigger the need to create new spellings.
One of the great features that distinguishes Galician-Portuguese from the other Romance languages ​​of Iberia, and of Romania in general, is the 'loss of the nasal and simple lateral in intervocalic position', that is, Latin words that had an -n- or an -l- between two vowels, in its evolution into Galician-Portuguese, they lost this -n- and this -l-, a loss that brought with it several consequences of a different nature, including changes in the syllable structure. This is too complex and technical a subject to be discussed here, so two or three examples will suffice to illustrate the point. The drop of simple -n- and -l- into intervocalic position led to the meeting of vowels that were previously separated by a consonant. Depending on the vowels in question, a diphthong could develop, such was the case of the verbal form ‘sai’, from the Latin ‘sali(t)’, which appears with the Spanish ‘sale’. But in most cases, the loss of intervocalic -n- and -l- caused the development of a hiatus. Gaps are phonetically uncomfortable and the language tends to resolve them in some way. This is, in fact, the explanation for the pronunciation of ‘aiágua’, instead of ‘water’, which is sometimes heard in popular language. One of the ways to solve these hiatuses was contraction when the quality of the vowels in hiatus was the same. Thus, the Latin word ‘panatariu-’ gives the medieval Portuguese ‘paadeiro’, which finally gives ‘baker’; the ‘a’ of the first syllable is open despite being in an unstressed position as it derives from the crasis of the two ‘a’s. The word ‘paadeiro’ also shows another typical characteristic of Galician-Portuguese vocalism, that is, the maintenance of the diphthong -ei- of secondary origin, compare the Portuguese ‘padeiro’ with the Spanish ‘panadero’.
The loss of intervocalic nasal also led to the creation of nasal vowels and diphthongs. Medieval Portuguese unified in the termination -three different Latin endings. In the plural, however, this termination regains its three different Latin origins; The terminations -hos, -ans, -people derive from Latin -years, -Anes and -ones, respectively. Although these plurals can be described as irregular from an etymological point of view, it is the singular-it is irregular and corresponding to the standardization of two different medieval terminations, namely '-on' and '-an'. Here we see how til is the only 'thing' we need to add to the vowels inherited from Latin to denote the evolution of Portuguese.
 
New Consonant Sounds
Despite all the evolutions in the vowel structure of (Galician-)Portuguese, the vowels inherited from Latin were sufficient to denote the results achieved. In the context of consonants, linguistic evolution gave rise to new sounds that did not exist in Latin and for which it was necessary to find spellings to represent them. The menu of consonant innovations is much broader than those of vowels and as such is also much more complex and technical, let's look at just a couple of examples.
The initial consonant groups pl-, cl- or fl- in Latin evolved into the tch- sound in (Galician-) Portuguese, for which it was necessary to find a spelling. Thus, the Latin words 'pluvia-', 'clave-' and 'flamma-' gave rise to the Portuguese 'chuva', 'chave' and 'chama', written with ch-, which was then pronounced tch-. The spelling ‘ch’ already existed in Latin but not to denote the sound ‘tch’.
Another example, still related to the loss of the simple intervocalic nasal, is the development of the palatal nasal – the palatal nasal is the one in the last syllable of the word ‘Aranha’. When the Latin word ‘vinu-‘ loses its intervocalic -n-, the previous -i- acquires the nasality of the lost -n- and develops a palatal nasal; This is how the Portuguese word ‘wine’ appears. It was then necessary to find a spelling for the sound represented here by the letters -nh-. The various Romance languages ​​that developed this sound adopted different spellings to denote it; medieval Portuguese and Castilian used -ñ-, French -gn- and Catalan -ni-, other hypotheses were the doubling of -nn- or, in the case of Portuguese, also the use of agá in -nh-, which It was finally the solution that prevailed in Portuguese, despite the fact that, at first, this spelling was in very restricted use.
Although going, for example, from Lisbon to Coimbra then probably took a good couple of days of travel, the 'network' that had existed between the various parts of the Roman Empire remained, at least partially, after the fall of the Roman Empire. west of said empire. There was thus, despite the long distances and difficulties in traveling, a certain 'connection' between the nations that were part of the empire and that now spoke Romance languages. Religion and, in the case of southern Europe, the common struggle against the Saracen enemy help explain this “international” connection between the different peoples and nations that emerged in post-imperial Europe. This also had an influence on writing and many Romance languages ​​shared not only certain orthographic options but also the same oscillations in the representation of some sounds that their respective languages ​​developed.
In the 'Cancioneiro da Ajuda', handwritten on the end of the thirteenth century, which contains a collection of 310 songs in Galician-Portuguese, has for the sounds that are now denoted in Portuguese with the digraphs -nh- and -H-, the Alternative spellings -ñ-/-ll-, typical of the Castilian, -i-/-li-, typical of Provencal and Catalan, -g-/-typical of the French and the spelling -nn-, inherited from Latin. All these spellings to denote the same sounds coexist in the same manuscript.
These are just a few examples of the many spellings that Galician-Portuguese had to adapt to accommodate developments from late colloquial Latin to Portuguese. In this first phase of the history of Portuguese spelling, the great concern was to represent in the written text the sounds of the language spoken on the streets. However, the stability that the orthography of any language requires would only be achieved in classical Portuguese.
 
Classical Portuguese Spelling
Around the sixteenth century, after the fall of Constantinople, the Renaissance and the Reformation, the invention of the press by mobile characters, the discovery of the Americas and the way to India, episodes that mark the end of the Middle Ages and the beginning of the age Modern, the Portuguese language had already acquired the features it has today; Camões's language is basically the same as we use today. This is not to say that since Camões the Portuguese language had kept static, but the great changes that transformed the late colloquial Latin of the Iberian West into Portuguese had already finished their work.
The questions of how to represent the sounds of Portuguese were all, more or less resolved, and variations in writing derived above all of variations inherent to the language itself, such as regional variations, pronunciation, etc., and sometimes variations in style or influences of Other languages, such as Spanish or Italian through literature.
The Twilight of the Middle Ages brings with it the opening of academic education to non-clerics and the rebirth of classical studies. With the increase in the number of people who know how to write and the most liberalized access to classical culture appears a new concern, that of 'writing well'. Around this time, the Portuguese language, like the other Romance languages, suffers an influx of new Latin words, some of which come to coexist with old forms, such as the case of the old Portuguese word 'palace' that It becomes coexist with the new word 'palace', both derived from the Latin 'palatiu-'.
It is difficult to establish to what extent and since when people became aware of the etymological relationship between Portuguese words and their etymological origin, but from classical Portuguese onwards, 'writing well' meant using as many tone words as possible. classic and write Portuguese words as close as possible to the Latin etymology.
As in the Middle Ages, in modern and contemporary ages, there was no fixed spelling norm for the Portuguese language, the difference was that in classical Portuguese the representation of the sounds of the language was already well established. In the Middle Ages, for example, we wrote 'Paço' and 'Passo' with two different spellings because the two words were heteropones, while in the classic time the two words, which had already become homophones, continued to be written In a different way, not for reasons of a phonetic nature, but for semantic and etymological reasons and also because, however, a certain orthographic tradition had begun to impose.
With the development of modern society, the school, the university, the state institutions and the editorial houses were imprinting on the Portuguese language written a certain orthographic tradition. Thus, Portuguese spelling was finding its norm naturally based, above all, on the best practices of writers, such as Eça or Camilo, or the influence of institutions, such as the University of Coimbra. This orthographic tradition was mainly characterized by respect for the phonetics of Portuguese and respect, whenever possible, of the etymological origin of words. Thus, a word like 'grammar', which in the Middle Ages would be phonetically writing as 'grammatics', from the sixteenth century, the etymologizing spelling 'grammatic' becomes considered 'correct'. This is how the First Republic found Portuguese spelling when in 1911 decided to impose a spelling through the law.</description><pubDate>2025-01-24T01:06:04+08:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Tourism registers “positive trend”</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/01/24/turismo-regista-tendencia-positiva/</link><description>The Tourism Services Department (DST) yesterday presented an overview of the work carried out over the past year, highlighting that “the development of Macau's tourism industry has been registering a positive trend”.
In a statement, STD recalls that Macau registered more than 34.9 million visitors in 2024, an annual increase of 23.8%, with the number of visitors with 88.6% of the 2019 values ​​before the pandemic. The number of international visitors increased by 66%, reaching 2.42 million, recovering to 79% of 2019 levels. On the other hand, hotel establishments registered an annual rise of the average occupancy rate in 4.9 percentage points, reaching 86, 4%.
The organization highlights the series of promotional activities nationally and abroad to attract visitors. For example, “tourism +” elements were promoted in the “Macao Week in Xi'an‧Shaanxi”, as well as the Central Government's support measures for Macau, and street promotions were carried out in several cities recently added to the “individual visa” program, along with promotions on the main social media platforms on the continent, launch of special marketing activities in cooperation with e-commerce platforms, among others. In the Greater Bay Area, in particular, multi-destination itineraries and tourist products on the islands were boosted.
Targeting international markets, several special offer projects were launched, and street promotions and promotional seminars were also organized for tour operators in various markets abroad. Participation was made in important international tourism fairs, among others, promoting tourism of Macau in various forms, in conjunction with online platforms.
DST currently has 9.23 million followers on its 28 promotional accounts on social networks around the world. Last year, seven “roadshows” were held in Hong Kong and several international markets, which attracted more than 1.27 million visitors to the venues.
STD also encouraged associations to organize a monthly tourist activities in the community neighborhoods. Last year, 41 activities were funded and, according to data until January 15, attracted more than 1.34 million participants, and the direct involvement of more than 2,100 commercial establishments, effectively attracting visitors to community zones, boosting the consumption and development of tourism in community neighborhoods.
The body also pointed out that the International Gastronomy Cities Festival attracted 107,000 participants and the Grand Prix Museum was visited by over 156,000 people, for example.</description><pubDate>2025-01-24T01:06:10+08:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Investigators ask South Korean MP to charge deposed leader with insurrection</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/01/24/investigadores-pedem-ao-mp-sul-coreano-que-acuse-de-insurreicao-lider-deposto/</link><description>South Korean authorities want the deposed president, Yoon Suk-Youol, to be accused of rebellion and abuse of power by declaring martial law in December. If Yoon is considered guilty of leading an insurrection, a crime for which a president has no immunity in the country, he may be sentenced to life imprisonment or the death penalty.
 
South Korea's anti-corruption office yesterday recommended to the Public Prosecutor's Office that deposed President Yoon Suk-yeol be charged with rebellion and abuse of power for declaring martial law in December.
The Senior Officials Corruption Investigation Office (CIO) announced that it has transferred the case to the Public Prosecutor's Office, which has the power to formally charge a South Korean head of state.
Cio considers that Yoon conspired with then-national minister Kim Yong-Hyun and other military officers to start a riot, declaring martial law on the night of December 3.
It argues, moreover, that Yoon abused power by sending troops to the National Assembly (Parliament) to prevent deputies from revoking martial law. The Public Prosecution Service now has 11 days to decide whether or not to start the requested process.
If Yoon is found guilty of leading an insurrection, a crime for which a president does not have immunity in the country, he could be sentenced to life in prison or the death penalty.
Yoon is in custody at the Seoul Detention Center in Uiwang, south of Seoul, since January 15.
The Constitutional Court is simultaneously made a judgment to determine whether or not to ratify the dismissal approved by parliamentarians on December 14.
If the highest court in South Korea confirms the impeachment, early presidential elections have to be called within 60 days after the court decision. Yoon, who refuses to witness in the investigation into the alleged crime of rebellion.

ELOI CARVALHO PHOTOGRAPHY
On the way to Goa, where he will mark the 30 years of activity of the East Foundation Indian delegation, Carlos Monjardino made a point of coming to Macao. The chairman of the East Foundation's Board of Directors will meet the new head of the Social Affairs and Culture portfolio, LAM, to try to promote greater cultural exchange between the Government of Masters and the Macao delegation of the Oriente Foundation, Bem how to highlight the importance of IPOR in the region. In an interview with the final point, he was optimistic about Sam Hou Fai and said the new chief executive seems to be "more accessible to projects with Portugal." Still, Monjardino stated that Macau "has not fully fulfilled the role of sino-illusophone platform." About the next 25 years of Macao's transition period, he anticipated a growing influence of Beijing in the region.
 
In these days in Macao, will you meet with members of the Government of MSAR?
I'm going, with the secretary for Social Affairs and Culture.
 
What do you want to discuss?
There are always some things that are pending. I also liked to give a word about IPOR [the East Foundation has a 40% stake in IPOR activity]. About the foundation, I wanted to try to bring more things here to Casa Garden, some cultural manifestations, and know if we can work more together with the Macao entities, namely with her, who is responsible for the cultural sector.
 
Regarding IPOR, what will be discussed with Macao SAR entities?
I want to, once again, draw attention to the importance that IPOR has for the teaching of Portuguese, which will greatly benefit the Chinese students.
 
In November 2023, he said, in an interview with PONTO FINAL, that he would like the Foundation to have a more prominent role in the social aspect in Macau…
I also said that I realized that, after 1999, the local government wanted to have this responsibility before anyone else, so our responsibility in this area was reduced.
 
The margin of maneuver has diminished, but will there be something that can be done on the social aspect?
There is, there, but they are punctual and relatively small or poorly important things. For example, we help an association that deals with minors who has the responsibility of welcoming minors who have problems or cannot live within the family context and will live there and we, every month, support this institution.
 
In 2023 he also said that the Fundação Oriente would have to reduce its expenses. Has this had an impact on the Foundation’s work?
It is obvious that you always have an impact. In a cultural institution, the problem is not getting things to do, it is getting money to be able to do these things. Sometimes those responsible for the Foundation's cultural area - as on all foundations - do not do many math. They want to do the actions, but do not see what is necessary to be able to take these actions to good term.
 
Any particular project that you would have liked to have carried out but were unable to do so due to these cost constraints?
No, I don't let projects advance too much, die in the shell.
 
In Macao, this spending containment was also noted?
Not here. The budget remains more or less the same thing. Sometimes delegates pull a lot to have more actions without thinking much "with what the bananas are bought."
 
Here in Macau too?
Everything has been going well here.
 
Now you won't meet the new chief executive of Macao, sam Hou Fai?
No. I tried, but it has a complicated schedule and I will also be here a few days.
 
Did you try why there was any subject that liked to argue with him?
No, it was just to greet him, since I don't know him.
 
Not knowing him, what he has seen, and what he has read, what is his impression of him?
It made me a good impression. I think it is more open to thinking about projects with Portugal, because it has a strong Portuguese base for having been in Portugal and studied at the University of Coimbra. It gives me the impression that you are a more sensitive person to projects with Portugal.
 
The new Chief Executive of Macau has said that he attaches great importance to the Portuguese community in Macau. Do you think you can resolve the issue of restrictions on new residence applications for Portuguese people?
I hope so. Do anything for that, yes; Solving the problem is completely able to be difficult.
 
What makes the situation difficult?
I have no idea. There is clear protection for Chinese citizens to reach higher positions and this is certainly a concern that anyone in the position he is in would have.
 
There is also the issue of qualified staff that the Government wants to bring to Macau…
Yes, but they really have to be qualified pictures. Before, everyone came, qualified or unqualified. In my time it was a see if you were avia. Now they make this selection and I realize perfectly they do it.
 
Accompanied President Xi Jinping's recent visit here to Macau?
Yes.
 
The Chinese President spoke about Macau's role in China's strategy of opening up to the outside world, namely through its functions as a Sino-Lusophone platform. Has Macau fulfilled this role?
If you want it to respond diplomatically, I say the answer is, "Yes, Lord." If you want it to respond without being diplomatically, I say that it has not fully fulfilled the role of Sino-Misophone platform.
 
How do you notice this?
No materialized results appear, they always fall short of what I expected. Namely business, Portuguese investment here. The important investment is not made through Macau, it is made directly between China and Portugal and does not pass through Macau, and it should. The Government could do more in this regard.
 
How do you expect the Macao SAR to develop in the second half of the transition period, until 2049? How do you imagine Macau in 2049?
I hope that China will gradually occupy Macau in terms of influence, which is no longer small. The President of China will want, within his mandate, to reunify the country, that is, with Taiwan.
 
Does this have consequences for Macau?
For sure.
 
Can you imagine a Macau that is more diluted on the Chinese mainland and, consequently, with fewer of its own characteristics?
Yes. But it's natural for this to happen, it's not a criticism. It's something that I think will happen naturally.
 
But wasn't it supposed to change much by 2049?
It was supposed not to change much. It may not change much, but it will change something.
 
How do you look at this trajectory? Do you agree that it may be, or would you prefer Macau to maintain all its distinctive elements until 2049?
I would prefer Macau to maintain its own characteristics for as long as possible.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>New cross-border trafficking patterns from Thailand to Myanmar</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/01/24/novos-padroes-de-trafico-transfronteirico-da-tailandia-para-myanmar/</link><description>The recent revelation and rescue of mainland actor Wang victims and took them to work in inhumane conditions on fraudulent farms in Myanmar. New patterns of cross-border trafficking of people from mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and even Macau have been identified.
Firstly, victims were deceived through social media and the Internet, where organized crime elements promised them jobs in Thailand, Taiwan or Japan, but as soon as they arrived in Thailand, they were kidnapped and transferred to work on farms. scams in eastern Myanmar, where family members were contacted and intimidated with ransoms. Some cases revealed that victims were released after paying large ransoms. However, paying ransoms does not necessarily guarantee your safe return.
Secondly, as the economy of mainland China and even Hong Kong has recently entered a decline in the post-Covid era, some victims, who have fallen into the clutches of cross-border trafficking syndicates in Thailand and Myanmar, naively believed that they could find employment in Thailand, where their geographic proximity to eastern Myanmar via land and sea routes meant they could be kidnapped with relative ease.
Thirdly, elements of organized crime deceived the targets in Hong Kong, even paying them the plane tickets to Thailand. When the targets arrived in Thailand, they were kidnapped and transferred to work on fraudulent farms. It has been reported that trafficking unions consider Hong Kong victims more educated and highlight them to work in more advanced activities, such as those related to information technologies.
Fourth, although the trafficking of mainland Chinese into Myanmar is not new, what is new is the cross-border trafficking into eastern Myanmar following the crackdown on local warlords by the Myanmar military in northern Myanmar, where a large number of mainland Chinese were abducted, exploited and eventually released and returned to the mainland in 2024. In other words, the location of the fraudulent exploitations has shifted from the northern areas to the eastern regions, where Chinese police find it impossible to cross the border and penetrate criminal syndicates, unlike what happens in northern Myanmar.
The 22 -year -old Wang Xing's case revealed the functioning of transf by (The Guardian, January 14, 2025). He communicated with people at Wechat and was fooled to work in a large Thia entertainment company. A Chinese "employee" from this company received him at Suvarnabhumi airport in Bangcoque, where he drove him for five hundred kilometers to Mae Sot in western Thailand. Mae Sot is located at the Thai border with Myanmar, across the Burmese city called Myawaddy, which is a famous place for telecommunications frauds and on the internet.
Wang Xing's situation was lucky, as his girlfriend used social networks in mainland China to draw attention to her disappearance. His messages were shared and released by mainland China celebrities, warning Chinese consular employees in Thailand and demanding Thai police intervention to quickly rescue him. Wang revealed that the work environment in Myawaddy was extremely dangerous because he couldn't sleep or urinate. Myawaddy is a convenient place for human trafficking and fraudulent explorations. Geographically, it is linked to Bangkok by terrestrial and maritime routes, thus facilitating the process of trafficking in human beings and concealment.
Following the Wang Case, police cooperation between China and Thailand led to the rescue and release of twelve Chinese from the continent, including a Chinese male model from the continent that lost contacts for more than 20 days (Sing Tao Daily, January 18 2025).
The Wang Xing case also exposed twenty -eight cases of people from Hong Kong whose family members requested the assistance of the Hong Kong government (Oriental Daily, January 16, 2025). These people were also victims of human trafficking for Myanmar. The Hong Kong government stated that from August 2024 to January 2025, sixteen from twenty -eight cases were released, but eleven people are still in Myanmar and a case in Cambodia. Two women who were released told Hong Kong police that they knew a woman in Hong Kong and who offered them free plane tickets to participate in a Thailand tour in late December. But after arriving in Thailand, they were sent to a fifth fraudulent after 10 hours of land and maritime transport. The family members of the two kidnapped women paid a ransom for their eventual release. Hong Kong's police authorities arrested a woman from Hong Kong for allegedly deceived two other women to go to Thailand.
According to the Macau police, between September and December 2024, five people from Macau were kidnapped to work in the fraudulent exploitation of Myanmar. Four of them were rescued and one escaped the fraud syndicate and managed to return to Macau. The Macau Police appealed to Macau citizens not to trust comments from strangers on the Internet, especially those who appeal to Macau citizens to work in foreign countries (San Wa Ou Newspaper, January 13, 2025).
A delegation led by Deputy Secretary for Security Michael Cheuk, together with officials from the police and immigration services, traveled to Thailand on January 14 to discuss the cases of Hong Kong victims with the Thai police. After a 25-year-old Hong Kong person was rescued and returned to Hong Kong, Secretary for Security Chris Tang expressed his gratitude to the Thai Government for its assistance. The Hong Kong victim told police that he had been promised 120,000 Hong Kong dollars if he could bring jewelry from Thailand to Taiwan, but that he had been kidnapped to a fraudulent farm in Myanmar as soon as he arrived in Thailand (Wen Wei Po, 17 January 2025).
On January 16, 2025, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with ten ambassadors from ASEAN countries in Beijing and called on Southeast Asian countries to be more concerned about the phenomenon of cross-border trafficking of Chinese people. He hoped that the countries concerned would take responsibility to adopt strict measures to combat online fraud, to protect the lives of ordinary people and to protect the interests of not only Chinese citizens but also citizens of other countries.
On January 16, it was reported that the Karen Border Guard Force announced the repression of fraudulent operations following a meeting with the Democratic Army of Benevision Karen and local Chinese entrepreneurs. The leader of the Karen Border Guard Force, Colonel Saw Chit Thu, has narrow relations with the military of Myanmar. He promised to end human beings and other criminal activities (see: revelation of the founder of the city Yatai de Myawaddy: The life of two faces of She Zhijiang Poisters the Chinese “piglets”-China-點新聞 -DotdotNews). It seems that Myanmar's authorities told Colonel Saw to repress the fraudulent parks that victimized many Chinese.
On January 17, Global Times reported that, after the Wang Xing case, public security officials are now investigating a Criminal Trafficking union in Myawaddy -based human beings. This union has attracted Chinese to work on site since December 2024.
A Taiwanese victim who was kidnapped but later released revealed that those responsible for the Myawaddy criminal organization are mainland Chinese (Oriental Daily, January 18, 2025). In fact, it has been reported that the founder of Myawaddy's Yatai City, which has a large scam complex, is She Zhijiang, a mainland Chinese born in Hunan, who obtained Cambodian nationality in 2017 and who was detained in Thailand in August 2022 on suspicion of illegal exploitation of cross-border gambling. The city of Yatai has become a place where gambling, scams and other illicit activities persist. She Zhijiang has been criticized as one of the possible masterminds of the so-called “KK park”, which has been involved in human and even organ trafficking (see: Revelation of the founder of the Yatai city of Myawaddy: The two-faced life of She Zhijiang poisons Chinese “piglets” – China – 點新聞-dotdotnews). It has been reported that in the city of Yatai, there are more than 20,000 mainland Chinese “piglets”, which refers to people who have fallen into the hands of scam and fraud factories.
Although She Zhijiang had already been detained by Thai authorities, his remnants and followers may have revitalized the scam parks, thus victimizing many Chinese who were smuggled to work as slaves.
Generally speaking, the Wang Xing case exposed many other cases of Chinese transionic trafficking to work in Myanmar's fraudulent parks through their visits to Thailand. It is urgent that the Thai authorities solve the problem of organized crime elements that have kidnapped Chinese visitors to work on Myawaddy's fraudulent farms. Hong Kong singer Eason Chan canceled his Bangkok concert in February, followed by many Chinese who canceled his visits and digressions to Thailand - a huge blow to Thai tourism immediately. If the image of Thailand as a tourist center has been harmed by the scandal of transionic trafficking, the Thai government and police have to accelerate the process of combating organized crime elements involved in Chinese visitor trafficking, including those of Continental China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. In addition, Myanmar's authorities have to repress MyAwaddy's famous fraudulent parks, which have become the main source of transionic trafficking. On the other hand, in addition to transfringing police cooperation, Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan's mainstream authorities should, more than ever, educate their citizens about the need to prevent the possibility of being easily deceived against the possibility of being easily deceived by strangers through social networks and calls. These multiple strategies of Thailand, Myanmar, and the regions of Greater China should be adopted to more effectively combat transfronic trafficking and transnational transnational blows.</description><pubDate>2025-01-24T01:06:04+08:00</pubDate></item><item><title>China and Brazil highlight “growing consensus” to find political solution</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/01/24/china-e-brasil-destacam-consenso-crescente-para-encontrar-solucao-politica/</link><description>The head of Chinese diplomacy, Wang Yi, yesterday highlighted the “growing consensus of all parties to promote a political solution” to the war in Ukraine, during a telephone conversation with Brazilian special advisor Celso Amorim.

Wang also expressed his hope to “work with Brazil to defend genuine multilateralism”.
Amorim called for efforts to “build a community of common destiny between Brazil and China for a fairer world and a more sustainable planet”. “Brazil and China, as emerging powers, can further strengthen cooperation and play a greater role in maintaining world peace and combating climate change,” stated the special advisor to the Brazilian Presidency.
According to official data, China has been Brazil's largest trading partner since 2008.
The Chinese market was the destination for 30% of Brazilian exports in 2023, when sales to the Asian country totaled 104 billion dollars (100 billion euros), mainly made up of food products and raw materials.
China, in turn, maintains investments in Brazil of about $ 40 billion (38.4 billion euros), which in recent years have been applied in the energy sector.</description><pubDate>2025-01-24T01:06:06+08:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Xia Baolong met with Raymond Tam in Beijing</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/01/24/xia-baolong-reuniu-se-com-raymond-tam-em-pequim/</link><description>A delegation led by the Secretary for Transport and Public Works, Raymond Tam, was in Beijing and held a meeting yesterday with Xia Baolong, director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office of the State Council.

In addition, three fire brigade vehicles will also provide transionic relief services in Guangdong. Firefighters also revealed that last year, fires increased 5.5% to 882 cases.
 
After launching the cross-border ambulance service with Hong Kong, Macau is now working with authorities in mainland China to implement emergency services between the territory and Guangdong province in the future.
The Fire Department (CB) already has three ambulances to be used in the experimental Cross-Border Ambulance Transport Plan between Hong Kong and Macau. The organization revealed that it plans an additional five ambulances, as well as three fire engines, to carry out cross-border relief tasks in the future between Guangdong and Macau, “in order to realize a two-seat relief team in the future and establish a base for the viability of cross-border support”.
Leong Iok Sam, CB commander, recalled that the governments of Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau signed the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau emergency management cooperation agreement and emergency rescue actions of the Great Baia. .
“We carried out a cross-border patient transport exercise in an ambulance between Hong Kong and Macau, with the border crossing going smoothly”, said Leong Iok Sam at a press conference held yesterday. The official added that the province of Guangdong and Macau have prepared five ambulances with dual registration. “There are no problems with the movement of vehicles between the two sides, but we have to cooperate with the work of the medical team, which involves several departments. We are actively working on the issue”, he assured.
It is recalled that the cross-border ambulance pilot plan between Hong Kong and Macau was inaugurated at the end of November last year, lasting one year. According to the Executive's presentation, patients with specific needs and whose clinical conditions are considered adequate can be transferred directly between certain hospitals in the Macau and Hong Kong regions. If there is no need to transfer from one ambulance to another at the border post, it will be possible to reduce the risks that may occur during the transfer.
 
Fire and ambulance exits continue to rise
 
On the occasion of a talk with the media, firefighters also released data on last year's operational activities. The total number of all events throughout 2024 included 54,133 cases, which represented an increase of 1,448 cases (2.75%) compared to those recorded in the previous year.

The cases of ambulance exits in 2024 accounted for 45,236 occurrences, equivalent to an increase of 2,177 cases compared to the previous year, ie a rise of 5.06%. Authorities pointed out that the reason for the climb was mainly due to the increase in cases of indisposition with dizziness and headache.
Rescue work resulted in 1,792 cases, minus 30 occurrences annually, with a decrease of 1.65%. Rescue tasks were mainly the aid in opening doors and helping to treat injured. In addition, the removal of fallen objects and the floor/oil washing dominated the exit of special services from firefighters, which had 6,223 cases, with a significant reduction of 745 cases compared to 2023.</description><pubDate>2025-01-24T01:03:01+08:00</pubDate></item><item><title>China orders funds to buy more shares to boost markets</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/01/24/china-ordena-fundos-a-comprar-mais-accoes-para-dinamizar-mercados/</link><description>The Chinese Government announced yesterday that it will order pension and investment funds to buy more shares in Chinese companies, aiming to stimulate the country's financial markets, after years of stagnation.
 
Authorities said that, from this year, mutual funds should increase their participation in national shares, called Actions A at least 10% per year over the next three years.
Commercial insurance funds will have to invest 30% of their new annual premiums in equity markets from this year, they added. “This means that at least several hundred billion yuan of long-term funds will be added [to the stock market] every year,” said Wu Qing, chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission. “Implementation of the various measures in the plan will further increase the capital allocation capacity of medium and long-term funds, constantly expand the scale of investment, improve the supply and structure of funds in the capital market and consolidate good conditions for the recovery of the capital market”, he explained.
The Chinese Communist Party announced this measure just before China's biggest holiday of the year, Lunar New Year, which begins on Wednesday, January 29. This is a time when families tend to increase spending on meals, travel and cash gifts for children and young adults.
Hong Kong and Shanghai markets rose after the announcement, with the Shanghai Index composite initially winning about 1.5%, although in the middle of the session it was rising 0.8%. Hang Seng Kong's Hang Seng Index lost its first gains and remained virtually unchanged.
Chinese stock markets reached their peak value before the Asian financial crisis and have since remained well below that level. The lack of appreciation in stock prices, coupled with falling property prices, has diminished investor confidence, raising deflationary risks in the world's second largest economy.
To date, Chinese government efforts to make people spend more and save less have been mitigating success. An initiative to promote the purchase of energetically efficient vehicles and appliances through the payment of subsidies to consumers who deliver old versions of these articles increased sales. But stock prices stopped after a brief recovery at the end of last year.
Wu stated that pension funds will be required to reformulate the way they evaluate their performance and that companies will be encouraged to perform more action repurchase and pay higher dividends to provide better income to shareholders. “This is a very important institutional advance for the entry of medium and long term funds in the market. It can be said that it solves a problem that has been solved for many years, ”he added. "Sales of the main shareholders and the high market volatility have damaged Chinese financial squares," said Law Meng, Chinese action analyst at UBS Securities, in a comment widespread yesterday. "The willingness of long -term investors to participate in the scholarship market has decreased," he added. "The proposal of reform of market value management directly addresses this issue, because it is directly related to the sense of gain of investors," he said.
 
Beijing says customs rates do not benefit China, USA or the world
 
The Chinese Ministry of Commerce stated yesterday that the United States' imposition of customs duties on Chinese goods "did not benefit China, the United States or the world", in the face of threats from US leader Donald Trump. Ministry spokesman He Yadong said at a press conference that his country “has always maintained a consistent position” on increasing rates. "China is willing to work with the US to put economic and trade relations between the two countries in a stable, healthy and sustainable direction," he said. Asked whether his ministry has already communicated with the new US administration's commercial team, He said that China “always maintains contact with the competent authorities” in the United States. Chinese diplomats assured on Wednesday that “there are no winners in a trade war”, after Trump said he was considering imposing 10% duties on Chinese imports in retaliation for the flow of fentanyl. “We're talking about a 10% rate based on the fact that they're shipping fentanyl to Mexico and Canada,” Trump told reporters at the White House on Tuesday. The Republican leader said that he spoke “the other day” with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, and that he told him that he did not want that “crap” in the country. Last year, around 70,000 deaths were recorded in the United States due to the consumption of that synthetic opioid. Members of Trump's team on Monday included China, along with Canada and Mexico, among the countries whose trade relationship with the US would be reviewed by the Republican, who launched a trade war against the Asian nation during his first term ( 2017-2021).</description><pubDate>2025-01-24T01:06:08+08:00</pubDate></item><item><title>China supports Cape Verde with 26.3 million to finance projects in several areas</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/01/24/china-apoia-cabo-verde-com-263-milhoes-para-financiar-projectos-em-varias-areas/</link><description>China signed an agreement with Cape Verde to support the archipelago with 26.3 million euros for security, renewable energy, digital economy, tourism and infrastructure projects, reinforcing bilateral cooperation between the two countries.
 
“We provide this support to Cape Verde”, to finance projects in the “domains of renewable energy, blue economy, digital, tourism and to help” the country to “achieve its objectives in priority areas”, stated the Embassy’s charge d’affaires of China in Cape Verde, Shi Leike, at the agreement signing ceremony, in the city of Praia.
The agreement was signed by the charge d'affaires and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs of Cape Verde, Myrian Vieira. Shi Leike considered that Cape Verde is “worldwide recognized as a country of good governance” and recalled its long-standing friendship with China. “Last year, bilateral relations between China and Cape Verde were elevated to a strategic partnership during the visit of the Prime Minister, Ulisses Correia e Silva, to China,” he said.
The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs considered that this agreement reflects the “excellence of bilateral relations between the two countries”. “It is also about implementing the commitments agreed last September, at the Africa-China cooperation forum”, where support of 26.3 million euros for Cape Verde was announced, he said.
Myrian Vieira stated that the amount will support the continuity of the third phase of the “safe city” project, which is a priority for Cape Verde, as it aims to reinforce the country's internal security, with the update and expansion of the video surveillance system in seven cities: Praia , Mindelo, Sal Rei, Santa Maria, Tarrafal, Assomada and Porto Novo.
The project will also reinforce the training of technicians to operate this equipment and maintain surveillance command centers.
In addition, other projects in the field of education, health and other vital importance infrastructures will be discussed with the Chinese part for the development of Cape Verde. “China has contributed to the development of Cape Verde throughout these 49 years of bilateral cooperation, being an important strategic partner in the fields of education, health, agriculture, new information and communication technologies and renewable energy. We really want to bring these relationships to increasingly high levels of excellence, ”he concluded.
In May last year, the two countries celebrated a six-year protocol (2024-2029) in the health area that continues cooperation and support to the sector with the displacement of medical teams to the archipelago.
China is the largest commercial partner on the African continent, with bilateral trade reaching $ 167.8 billion (151.8 billion euros) in the first half of 2024, according to the Chinese official press.

Trump was sworn in for the second time to serve as President of the United States, the first President to serve two non-consecutive terms since Grover Cleveland in the late 19th century. Whatever my personal feelings, Trump pulled off the biggest political upset in American history. Trump has committed to declaring a national emergency that would allow him to close the border, use American troops to conduct these operations and carry out sweeps in American cities to arrest undocumented foreigners. Trump has pledged to arm the Justice Department and use the agency to prosecute his political enemies, including generals, former and current public office holders, former Presidents and their families, journalists and anyone else he claims to have. “crossed” during his ten-year political career.  Making light of the word “hostages”, Trump pardoned or pardoned around 1,500 people who participated in the January 6 riots, including those who attacked police officers and those who were convicted of trying to overthrow the government. Trump promised to remake America, and I believe he will try to do so. We will see whether or not it will be successful in converting a constitutional republic into an authoritarian electoral autocracy.
The effects of Trump's seizure of power began to reverberate around the world.  Some of his supporters claim that Donald Trump's victory guaranteed a ceasefire in Gaza that allowed the return of 33 Israeli hostages and the release of around 90 Palestinian prisoners.  After 15 months, the guns are silent. However, other observers note that the terms of this ceasefire are almost identical to those that the Israeli government rejected last May. They accuse Netanyahu of having rejected these terms to prevent Biden and Harris from a hard-won victory that could help them in the 2024 US elections. Instead, Netanyahu waited until Trump was elected to give him credit for the ceasefire that everyone wanted. If these allegations are true, they illustrate the absolute selfishness and cynicism of Netanyahu and Trump. Since May, thousands of Palestinians and hundreds of Israelis have been killed or injured, along with the destruction of their homes and belongings. And for what? To keep Netanyahu out of prison and to give Trump his electoral victory? Historians will debate this question for decades, just as they debated the Paris Agreement to end the Vietnam War in the fall of 1968; or the negotiations to free the American embassy hostages held by the new Iranian revolutionary government.
Although unstable, the ceasefire remains in Gaza and the Middle East.  Thousands of kilometers away, to the north, the war is rather in Ukraine and Russia. Trump had promised that he would end this war on the "day one." This achievement did not happen. Quite the contrary. Last week, European leaders said their support for Ukraine and its President Volodymyr Zelensky. French President Emmanuel Macron warned that the war against Ukraine would not end "tomorrow or the day after tomorrow." The third anniversary of the Russian War against Ukraine is celebrated next month. Macron also urged Europe to “wake up” and spend more in defense to reduce his alliance with the US. Macron's reaction is that Trump's inauguration is an "opportunity for a European strategic care call." Macron stated that Europe must fully “play its role” in the rearmament of Ukraine.
In a similar speech, Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Great Britain, on his first visit to Kiev, committed to supplying Ukraine with a new air defense system called Gravehawk. Britain and Denmark developed this missile defense to allow the Ukrainians to shoot down aerial threats using retooled ground-launched air-to-air missiles. Norway promised Ukraine six American-made F-16s, while France promised Mirage 2000-5. Ukrainian forces used ground-based drones equipped with machine guns and mines to carry out the first documented all-machine ground attack in their war against Russia.  Ukraine claims that Russia suffered 434,000 casualties in 2024 alone and that around 819,000 Russian soldiers have been killed, captured or injured since the start of the war in February 2022. Ukraine has not reported its own casualties, but estimates Westerners point to around 300,000 Ukrainian casualties, along with at least 600,000 Russian casualties.  Ukraine declared that last week, in a single day, Russia lost more than 2200 soldiers.
However, despite these heavy losses, Russia has used its superiority in terms of population and resources to slowly and progressively conquer the Ukrainian territory.  Since a year ago, Russia has been making daily attacks with human waves throughout the 3000 km from the Eastern front. Moscow reported that he had captured several villages and cities in his attempt to capture the once -bustling Pokrovsk city.  The capture of the ruined city would open the rest of Donetsk province to Russian capture. Russia has used thousands of North Korean forces in its attempt to resume the areas of Kursk province that Ukraine took last summer. However, these malnourished and poorly trained North Korean troops suffered heavy casualties, and for the first time the Ukrainians have captured and are currently interrogating two North Korean soldiers. Russia has launched a combined attack of drones and missiles against several Ukrainian cities, including one in downtown Kiev. On a visit to Moscow on January 17, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian signed a vast cooperation pact that deepens his partnership. Russia's ties with Iran narrowed after Putin sent troops to Ukraine. Ukraine and the West have accused Tehran of providing Moscow hundreds of drones to be used to attack Ukraine. Pezeshkian stated, "We watched a new chapter of strategic relations." Yesterday, Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Putin spoke on the phone about Ukraine, Donald Trump's inauguration and the Middle East. It is not yet known what has been said.
Ukraine fears this day since Donald Trump was elected on November 6. Trump blames Ukraine and its president because they caused the circumstances that allowed their first dismissal in 2019. For Trump, the unprecedented request for Zelensky to find "rotten" about the Biden was a "perfect decision." In contrast, Trump has had good personal ties with Russian autocratic president Vladimir Putin, ties reaffirmed at his meeting in Helsinchy during Trump's first term. Trump said several times that he believes that Ukraine was partially responsible for the Russian invasion, due to his will, supported by the West, to join the NATO. Ukraine was only able to keep Russia in a military draw thanks to the influx of western military aid, especially American, and the blood of the Ukrainian people who resisted the invasion.
Ukraine fears that Putin and Trump meet alone in any “neutral” European capital and make an agreement, an agreement to give Russia the two Eastern provinces of Donetsk and Lukhansk, Crimea and the Azov Sea Coast.  Fears that Ukraine does not receive military security guarantees, such as adherence to the NATO or EU. Finally, fears that Zelensky is forced to fire himself and to be replaced by a pro-Russian Ukrainian politician. If this happens, Ukraine and most Western nations believe that the country will cease to exist within a year, as Russia will absorb the state as Germany absorbed the entire Czechoslovakia six months after the Munich conference. Europe knows that Donald Trump's inauguration means that the responsibility of maintaining the freedom of Ukraine falls on his shoulders and that the United States can no longer be counted to militarily defend Europe from external aggression. Soon, the world will witness whether we are watching the 1945 Peace Agreement, based on an order based on rules, territorial integrity, sovereignty of all nations, and multilateral decisions and actions. Donald Trump's inauguration that the world came into dangerous times, perhaps recalling the ages that preceded the first and World War II.</description><pubDate>2025-01-24T01:06:05+08:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Chinese companies have released updates to generative AI models in recent days</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/01/24/empresas-chinesas-lancaram-actualizacoes-dos-modelos-de-ia-generativa-nos-ultimos-dias/</link><description>Several Chinese technology companies such as ByteDance, Moonshot AI and DeepSeek this week presented updates to their generative artificial intelligence (AI) models, highlighting their advances in complex tasks such as mathematics and programming.
 
Bytedance, known internationally for creating the social network of short videos Tiktok, made known its real -time voice model, called Doubao, designed to act as an English teacher or narrator for users, according to the News Portal YICAI LOCATION.
DeepSeek, in turn, presented the DeepSeek-R1 model, which the company assured is comparable to the OpenAI o1 model in tasks such as mathematical problem solving, programming and natural language inference. OpenAI is the creator of the famous ChatGPT that accelerated the development of the generative AI market.
MoonShot Ai presented, however, the Kimi K1.5 model, which is able to offer similar performance to OpenAi O1 in Multimodal Mathematics, programming and reasoning.
The Chinese Tencent also presented the open source Hunyuan3D 2.0 model, designed to convert 2D images into 3D images, with applications planned for the development of video games, advertising in e-commerce and industrial production.
In total, more than 200 large-scale language models (LLM – Large Language Model) were launched on the Chinese market.
Among the registered models are some developed by Chinese technological giants such as Jiutian, China Mobile, Baidu Wenxin Yiyan, Tongyin Qianwen, Alibaba, Pangu, Huawei Cloud, Andpo, and Lanxin, Vivo.
In July 2023, China approved interim regulations to regulate generative artificial intelligence services similar to ChatGPT, which will be subject to “current regulations on information security, personal data protection, intellectual property, and scientific and technological progress.”
In addition, they must respect the “fundamental socialist values”, “social morality and professional ethics” and are prohibited from “generating content that undermines national security, territorial unity, social stability or the rights and legitimate interests of others people". Given this, questions arose about the application of this type of technology in China due to the strong censorship imposed by the authorities.
