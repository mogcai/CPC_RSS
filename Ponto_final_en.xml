Health services value mosquito prevention and control, but advise the use of repellent for 14 days after the return of a trip abroad.

Health services ensure that work against chikungunya fever will focus on the prevention and control of mosquitoes, and that they will not follow the “health self-management” measures now imposed on some Chinese regions. The government also stated that there are no plans to perform “large -scale tests” for this disease.
Due to the chikungunya fever outbreak in Guangdong, namely in the city of Foshan, some regions in the interior of China are requiring people who “have visited high-risk places” to make a 14-day “health management”.
So far, the city of Fujian province is implementing the measure for those in Foshan, after a document from the National Health Commission recommend a two -week “health monitoring” after a trip from abroad.
The cases of chikungunya detected in Foshan continue to rise and there were more than 2,700 new cases between 20 and 26 July, having accumulated more than six thousand cases throughout this summer.
As for Macao, where the first two local cases of Chikungunya were already registered that share the same source of infection in zone A as the new landfills, the authorities ensured that they have reinforced the elimination of mosquitoes in the city, having performed more than 8,900 stagnant water inspections and more than 1,400 chemical eliminations of mosquitoes between January and July this year.
“Macao is currently at an early and critical phase of chikungunya prevention and control,” warned Alvis Lo, director of health services, on the sidelines of a disease awareness campaign held on Sunday, quoted by the newspaper or Mun.
Alvis Lo stressed that hot weather and heavy rains of recent days in Macao “have created ideal conditions” for reproduction of the Aedes albopictus mosquito, which significantly increased the risk of disease propagation in the region.
It revealed, however, that the July Mosquito Propagation Index (Ovitrap) was 66, a level considered normal and similar to that of the same period last year.

Mosquito repellent for two weeks
 
"During summer holidays, residents have more opportunities to travel. In addition to taking precautions against mosquitoes during the trip, they should also do the same, such as using the mosquito repellent, during the 14 days after the return to Macao," advised Alvis Lo.
"Some people have very good physical condition and have little evident symptoms after infection and, if they are bitten by mosquitoes with disease after returning to Macao, can transmit the disease in the community," he explained.
Alvis Lo has appealed to residents to take mosquito prevention measures, hoping that Macao will be able to control the disease at an early stage and prevent chikungunya fever from becoming a “permanent disease” in Macao.
It also emphasized that chikungunya fever is not transmissible among people, but warned of its impact on resident health. "Once infected, about one third of patients may have joint pain that lasts several months. Although it is a light disease, it severely affects the quality of life," he said.
According to the doctor, the residents, if they have fever, rash or joint pain, should immediately resort to the medical consultation. Authorities also communicated to all medical institutions, stating that all patients with fever, without breathing symptoms, but with a history of travel abroad, should be tested. Currently, about 20 tests are performed per day.

WORK IN THE COMMUNITY
 
The government promises to be aware of the “significant increase” of chikungunya fever cases in Macao and neighboring regions. Health services had a meeting with the Institute for Municipal Affairs (AMIs) and representatives of various sectors, where strategies and measures for prevention and control of mosquitoes transmitted by mosquitoes were discussed.
AMI has indicated that since July, it has intensified mosquito elimination measures in subordinate municipal facilities, increasing the frequency of control operations from three to four times a month.
According to health services, following local cases of chikungunya fever and the notification of confirmed cases of cases, made by the interior authorities of China, will proceed to the chemical elimination of mosquitoes in the areas of T'oi Sán, on the marginal street of the Hortas Canal; in Rua dos Minta, Rua da Tribuna and Rua da Serenity; In Health Street and the Black Areia Road.

Guangdong promises decisive measures as chikungunya fever cases spread

The Chinese province of Guangdong recorded thousands of new cases of chikungunya fever last week, with local authorities promising “decisive and vigorous measures” to lock the spread of the disease. According to CCTV state television, 2,892 new cases were detected in the week finished on Saturday, without registering serious or fatal infections. Most - 2,770 - occurred in Foshan, while Canton, the provincial capital, accounted for 65 cases. At a provincial government meeting on Saturday, Governor Wang Weizhong called for “more resolution” measures to “overcome the difficult battle against the shortest time as possible,” said the state agency Southcn.com. On the same day, Shen Hongbing, director of the National Center for Disease Control and Prevention, visited Foshan, appealing to quick efforts to "eliminate outbreak in the shortest term and safeguard public health and social stability." Guangdong is so far the most affected province in China with Foshan - an industrial center with 10 million inhabitants - representing more than half of reported cases. During the visit to Foshan, Shen also stressed the need to standardize treatment. On Friday, the Hong Kong Health Protection Center indicated that all cases recorded in Foshan were slightly without severe or fatal infections. On Saturday, the region announced the first case of Chikungunya since 2019. At the provincial meeting in Guangdong, Foshan was done to focus on key areas and intensify targeted control measures, creating favorable conditions for "an early turning point in the outbreak."</description><pubDate>2025-08-05 00:07:23</pubDate></item><item><title>Animal adoptions decreased in the first half</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/08/05/adopcoes-de-animais-diminuiram-no-primeiro-semestre/</link><description>In the first half of this year, 273 animals were adopted in the Municipal Kennel. This number represents a 16% decrease compared to the first six months of last year.

Among the deadly victims are the driver, a 20 -year -old resident and three male passengers, also young. According to police, the car left the Nape area and eventually packed in the iron barriers and signposts near the Grand Prix building.

A 20 -year -old resident, driver of a light car, died yesterday in an accident on Friendship Avenue. Among the deadly victims are three passengers of this vehicle, young men.
The serious traffic accident took place at 6 am, near the Grand Prix building and reservoir benches, involving a total of seven residents - two women and five men, aged 19 to 21 years.
The preliminary police investigation found that there were no passersby among the injured, with all seven people inside the rugged light vehicle, so “the possibility of overload” in the car is not ruled out. The authorities ensured that the driver had a valid driving letter.
According to the Public Security Police (CPSP), those involved “were unconscious” when the agents arrived at the scene and were immediately sent to hospital units after the incident. Two were transferred to Kiang Wu Hospital and five to the Conde de São Januário Hospital Center. Three were later declared dead despite the resuscitation attempts, while four went to the hospital. One of them eventually died yesterday.
The concrete cause of the accident is still being investigated, but the authorities have indicated that the driver will have lost control of the car and stuffed in the shit.  “The car collided with several iron protection barriers, signaling plates and stone steps on the left side, near the Grand Prix building,” CPSP said.
On social networks circulated several photos from the scene of the accident where it can be seen that the front of the car involved was severely damaged and deformed, and the windshield was fully broken. According to the newspaper or Mun, the residents who passed in the area at the time of the accident said they heard a very high sound "that seemed thunder". The traffic was then conditioned in the area for the operation of the firefighters.
The police authorities updated the preliminary investigation yesterday afternoon and indicated that the vehicle involved in the accident left the parking lot of Rua de Brussels, in the Nape area. He passed Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Avenue and entered Friendship Avenue through the viaduct. Upon arriving at the scene of the accident, the car lost control and collided with the ride.
Police have not yet advanced whether the accident was related to driving in a state of drunkenness. According to CPSP, the investigation of the case is underway to ascertain the vehicle's parts as well as the speed of the vehicle at the time of the accident.
Police calls for citizens who have witnessed the accident or have any relevant information contacting the CPSP Traffic Department Service Officer at 2837 4214.</description><pubDate>2025-08-05 00:05:37</pubDate></item><item><title>Health services bet on the use of artificial intelligence and expansion of telemedicine</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/08/05/servicos-de-saude-apostam-no-uso-da-inteligencia-artificial-e-expansao-da-telemedicina/</link><description>Artificial Intelligence (IA) already applies to Macao hospitals, with algorithms to analyze medical examinations and help in diagnosing diseases. The revelation was made by health services in response to questions posed by Deputy Ho Ion Sang. This technological change comes at a crucial moment, with the aging of the population to press services to find solutions. In addition to AI, telemedicine is bringing consultations to elderly homes, while new hospitals expand the capacity of care.
In response to an interpellation of Deputy Ho Ion Sang, sent in June, health services (SS) presented a detailed health system modernization plan, with a special emphasis on the application of artificial intelligence and the expansion of telemedicine services. The official response, signed by the director Alvis Lo, compromised the concerns raised by the deputy about the efficiency of the system in the face of population aging and the need for technological innovation.
The SS highlighted the progress achieved with the entry into operation of the Peking Union Medical College Hospital Medical Center, the central unit of the Island Health Care Complex. The new infrastructure has already performed more than ten thousand external specialty consultations and about nine thousand imaging exams, demonstrating the ability to relieve pressure on the public system. Operational integration with the Conde de São Januário Hospital Center has been gradual, with projections that about a quarter of the care load will be transferred to the new center by 2027.
In the field of technological innovation, the authorities' response confirmed the implementation of artificial intelligence solutions in medical diagnosis. The Conde de Saint Januario Hospital Center already uses AI AI algorithms to aid in reading computed tomography, with plans to extend this technology to the tracking of diabetic retinopathy and other clinical applications. SS maintain collaboration with medical technology companies in the interior of China to adapt advanced solutions to local needs, aiming to improve diagnostic efficiency and optimize specialized human resources, explained Alvis Lo.
Regarding the development of telemedicine, the central theme of the deputy's questioning, the SS reported that public consultation on the new legal regime for private health institutions was completed and is in the final stages of consolidation. Advances in this area are already visible in the universal coverage of proximity medical services in all subsidized elderly homes, allowing the elderly residents to complete the entire care process without traveling to hospital units.
Given the challenge of population aging, a question raised by the deputy, the institution is implementing a multifaceted strategy that includes the creation of a Family Medicine Training Base, one of the main bets of Alvis Lo, as announced in May during the 78th World Health Assembly in Switzerland, as well as the decentralization of services through cooperation with non -profit institutions, the introduction of a new category for hospitals and the hospitals and the hospitals and reinforcement of community health programs.
In response to concerns about resource management, SS pledged to maintain a dynamic assessment of the distribution of beds and equipment, permanently adjusting it to the needs of the population. The importance of international cooperation for the exchange of best practices was also highlighted, particularly with regions facing similar demographic challenges.
The phased implementation of these measures aims to respond to the current challenges and prepare the territory for the future needs of a population in aging, positioning itself in the forefront of digital health transformation in the region, the response concluded.</description><pubDate>2025-08-05 00:03:54</pubDate></item><item><title>Authorities attentive to pedestrian offenses on Avenida de Artur Tamagnini Barbosa</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/08/05/autoridades-atentas-as-infraccoes-dos-peoes-na-avenida-de-artur-tamagnini-barbosa/</link><description>In the first half of this year, the Public Security Police (CPSP) registered 4,680 breaches committed by pedestrians for not crossing the roads by observing the traffic rules. Of these, 322 were committed on Artur Tamagnini Barbosa Avenue, in the northern part of the city. This high incidence causes authorities to prepare new measures to reduce these situations on that avenue.

Between January and June this year, 322 pawns were charged on Artur Tamagnini Barbosa Avenue, in the northern part of the city, for crossing the road not observing the traffic rules. In total, the Public Security Police (CPSP) registered 4,680 offenses committed by pedestrians throughout the territory. In response to a written interpellation of Deputy Leong Hong Sai, the direction of services for traffic affairs (DSAT) said it was aware of the situation on that avenue, adding that new measures will be taken.
DSAT has signaled that the Institute for Municipal Affairs (AMI) has already installed metallic grid on the conditioned tours of Artur Tamagnini Barbosa Avenue, “to increase the safety of pedestrians”. However, "as some points on site are intended to stop buses, parking zone, pedestrian crossing zone or passenger and loading and loading and unloading zone, there are no conditions for the installation of metallic grid."
For its part, AMI will “review the pedestrian paths in various zones of the territory and, in coordination with the surrounding road environment, to consider, in an opportune manner, the feasibility of adding metallic grid”.
In addition, DSAT has announced the installation of warning signs to alert the pedestrians to use the crossing facilities along the road. DSAT is also studying the feasibility of optimizing the arrangement of bus stops on the outskirts of Artur Tamagnini Barbosa Avenue, as well as adjusting scale arrangements, “with the aim of minimizing, as much as possible, the crowding of people in bus stops” on that avenue.
In turn, CPSP reinforced the daily patrol of the avenue “to combat these offenses in order to ensure the safety of the public road users and maintain the traffic order”.
In response to Leong Hong Sai, it is also read that AMI has made revisions and improvements of barriers without barriers, including the addition of lifts and ramps without barriers, among others, "in order to satisfy citizens' needs in barriers without barriers."
Finally, DSAT says that parking space is already available in industrial buildings in the Avenida de Artur Tamagnini Barbosa Avenue, and areas intended for passenger and loading and unloading of goods for public use was created. In addition, DSAT has created more passenger and loading and loading and unloading zones on the adjacent street of the Hortas Canal, “with the aim of improving passenger and loading and loading and unloading conditions of merchants and residents of surrounding areas”.</description><pubDate>2025-08-05 00:04:42</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
