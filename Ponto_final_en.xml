Japan, which sees the alliance as the axis of its defense and diplomacy, will also consider “proactively” ways to strengthen the alliance's dissuasion and response capabilities and will maintain close communication with the United States, said the secretary general of the Japanese Japanese News Agency, Kyodo News.
The comments were made after Trump, in the first comments about the Bilateral Security Pact between the United States and Japan since returning to the White House in January, having told reporters: "I love Japan. We have a great relationship with Japan, but we have an interesting deal with Japan we have to protect them, but they don't have to protect ourselves."
In recent years, Japan and the United States have been reinforcing the interoperability of Japanese self-defense forces and US armed forces in the growing security threats of North Korea and China.
Hayashi said the two nations can now “help each other without problems” in response to various situations following a legal change that allows Japan-whose constitution renounces war-exercising the right to collective self-defense when certain conditions gathered. "We are fully confident that the United States will fulfill their obligations within the Japan-United States Treaty, using all available capabilities, including nuclear," Hayashi said at a press conference.
Japanese Defense Minister Gen Nakatani echoed the same opinion in comments to journalists. Although he has avoided directly addressing Trump's observations, the military stressed that Tokyo is “working to fundamentally reinforce” defense capabilities to increase defense expenses to 2% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the 2027 fiscal year.
Trump's return raised concerns about the fact that Washington exerts more pressure on allies to spend and do more to defend themselves.
The president of the United States has released questions about NATO, while Elbridge Colby, nominated by the Trump Administration's Defense Policy, earned Japan earlier this week to increase its budget to 3% of GDP.
Under the Japan-Eu ​​Security Pact, US military forces are parked in Japan, especially Okinawa, which is near Taiwan and Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea.
The Senkaku Islands, run by Japan but claimed by China, have been in the center of tensions between Tokyo and Beijing.
At the first summit with Trump in February, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba confirmed the US leader that the uninhabited islands are covered by the security treaty.

Under the theme “Intelligins. Natural. Artificial. Collective ”, this year's Venice Biennial of Architecture, with 66 national representations, is covered by Carlo Ratti and will present a program of events parallel to the general exhibition in the areas of Arsenal, Gardens and downtown Venice.
Among the 11 events selected this year is the exhibition “Parallel Worlds”, organized by the Macao Art Museum, which will be evident throughout the Biennial period, according to the organization, in a statement.

When Xu Yi was studying at college, only five of the 50 students in the classroom were women. Today, in the laboratory where he works in Macao, the numbers are not very different: five women in a universe of 40 scientists. “I grew up listening to teachers to discourage girls from attending courses in the Stem area [English for Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics],” says the scientist of the State Reference Laboratory for Lunar and Planetary Science at the Macao University of Science and Technology.
When disciplines like physics and mathematics became more difficult, teachers repeated that “women were not as good as men,” recalls Xu Yi, who was born and raised in mainland China.
Women remain “significantly underrected” in the Stem domain in the Pacific Asia region. The work world in this area "remains dominated by men, excluding and adamant," he told Lusa in an email response to UN women in the region.
This is “a frequent problem,” said the organization on the occasion of International Women's Day (March 8) and the 25th anniversary of Resolution 1325 of the Security Council, signed in 2000 for the promotion of gender equality and women's rights.
An investigation in the 2022 Philippines also notes UN Women, states that gender prejudices start early, with students to lose interest in this scientific area at the age of ten, because they believe it is a men's paste.
This year is also the 30th anniversary of Beijing's historic declaration and platform of action platform, a document adopted at the United Nations World Conference on women, held in the Chinese capital, in September 1995, in which governments have pledged to ensure that gender equality will be reflected in policies.
But Xu Yi, who studied in the United States Physics, Microelectronics and Electronic Engineering and Informatics, makes sense in the skin. “In the Stem domain, most of the colleagues around us are men, who do not think of cooperating with us, only after we have some achievements in the curriculum and people approve of us,” he says.
UN Data Women Asia Pacific 2022 point out that, globally, women represent 35% of students in Stem courses and only 3% of students in the area of ​​Information and Communication Technologies. In the workplace, 19.9% ​​of science and engineering professionals are female. Despite the increase of registered in higher education in this area, “persistent prejudices and gender norms continue to push women away from Stem careers,” says the UN.
The Academic and Scientist Li Ting, from the State Reference Laboratory for Quality Research in Chinese Medicine, at the University of Macau, says it intentionally selects students depending on gender. And choose the balance. “After giving birth, as a mother, the pressure is significant, and I think this is one of the greatest career twists of all women,” he says.
Also scientist Betty Law-Yuen Kwan, a native of Hong Kong and working in the same laboratory, explains that when he was in the secondary, a third of fellow women opted for the scientific area. “I welcome half boys and half girls, I think they can complement it,” he says.
Despite this example, in the leadership of the two reports referred to are only male names. And this reality “discourages the participation” of women in the area, according to UN Women for the Pacific Asia region. “Therefore, mentoring programs are crucial,” he says.
In 2023, the UN criticized the sub-representation of women in top positions in public administration and private companies of Macao.</description><pubDate>2025-03-10 03:46:03</pubDate></item><item><title>Exports and Imports of China slowed in January and February</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/03/10/exportacoes-e-importacoes-da-china-abrandam-em-janeiro-e-fevereiro/</link><description>China exports increased by 2.3% and imports fell more than 8% in January and February, in homologous terms, in a period marked by uncertainty compared to customs imposed by the United States.
 
China's surplus in trade with the rest of the world was set at $ 170.52 billion in the first two months of the year. China's customs publish trade data for January and February together to avoid any distortion arising from the Lunar New Year, which pits every year on different days.
"Export growth covered in the first two months of 2025, with the anticipation of fees to be given less impetus for what we had had," said Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics consultant. "This slowdown occurs before any substantial impact of the rates, which will almost certainly lead to sharp declines on exports to the US soon," he said.
Springs of imports suggests that increased demand driven by government expenses at the end of last year "has already been inverted partially," Evans-Pritchard said.
This week, the second of two increases of 10% in the rates imposed by US President Donald Trump came into force on China imports, which should affect Chinese exports in the coming months.
Chinese buyers and suppliers rushed to complete business, to avoid the impact of fees.
Chinese authorities have confidence in the resistance of the economy and the fact that trade with other countries could help compensate for any export reductions to the US after the rates. Beijing also stated that he is open to conversations with Washington on a basis of mutual respect.
Last year, exports helped China reach its 5%economic growth target. Beijing once again set the goal by about 5%, despite the uncertainties of commercial perspectives for this year.
Exports to the US grew by 2.3%, in homologous terms, in January-February, while exports to the European Union and Japan grew only 0.6%and 0.7%, respectively. Exports to Russia fell 10.9%.
The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) continued to be China's largest commercial partner, with exports to grow 5.7%, in homologous terms. "Although it is not very important for a few months of data, the office raises questions about how export trends can change when rates start to affect the US as well," said Lynn Song of Ing Economics in a report. "With fees to come into force in February and March, it is likely that the impact will be felt gradually in the coming months," he said.

The North Korean president supervised the project during a visit to “important shipyards” for the construction of war ships, said the North Korean news agency KCNA, which did not detail the location of these facilities or the exact date of Kim's visit.
During the visit, the North Korean leader analyzed the construction of “a strategic submarine of nuclear-propulsive guided missiles”, in accordance with the regime's decision to reinforce their defense capabilities.
KCNA also distributed photographs showing Kim's visit to the shipbuilding facilities, where you can see the bow of a large ship and other large cylindrical structures.
A nuclear -propulsive submarine is one of the advanced weaponry systems that Kim promised to develop during the North Korean Workers Party Congress, along with other actives, such as spy satellites and intercontinental ballistic missiles of solid fuel.
Kim stressed during the visit to the shipyard the need for Pyongyang to also develop “overwhelming war ships,” such as the deterrent of the enemies “hostile forces”, which he accused of carrying out naval and underwater military activities, “which seriously threaten North Korean sovereignty and interests, according to KCNA.
In September 2023, North Korea presented what called its first tactical nuclear submarine, capable of nuclear attacks from water. Kim then announced his plan to build more submarines, including a nuclear propulsion.
South Korea announced on Thursday the beginning of annual military exercises of South Korean and North American troops next week. Freedom Shield Freedom [Shield of Freedom], a computer-simulated command training training, with military exercises on the ground, will take place between 10 and 21 March, the South Korean joint state in a statement has informed, and will develop answers to evolving challenges, such as the growing military partnership of North Korea with Russia, according to the statement.
North Korea considers large -scale military training between South Korea and the United States as an invasion test and often responds to missile tests and inflamed rhetoric.</description><pubDate>2025-03-10 03:48:34</pubDate></item><item><title>Three women, three stories of resilience and struggle for equality</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/03/10/tres-mulheres-tres-historias-de-resiliencia-e-luta-por-igualdade/</link><description>On International Women's Day, the end point gives voice to three women with different life experiences: a maid, a survivor of domestic violence and a lesbian woman in a society that chooses to ignore homosexuality. In 2025, Macao women continue to fight for the right to exist with dignity and respect in a region still marked by coexistence, not always peaceful, between tradition and modernity.
 
The speeches of Women's Day, celebrated on March 8, were overwhelmingly positive. Several institutions, since the Institute of Social Action (IAS) to the General Association of Macao Women of Macao, praised progress in the struggle for women's rights since Macau has returned to the country in 1999. Currently, the law advocates equal rights for women and men in the most varied parameters, from medical care to education, and seems to make feminist struggle in a region that, in paper, ensures gender equality.
The gaps in this idyllic scenario reveal themselves under a closer observation. The Health Care Network is free for pregnant women and parturients from Macao; Not for non-resident maids, eternally “foreign” in a region where they have been working and contributing for decades. Divorce is cool at MSAR, but the generational roots of female silence and submission to husband survive to this day and instigate many women to remain in abusive relationships and marriages. Homosexuality, although decriminalized, remains a cause for discrimination and seen as a “abnormality” compared to the standard.
 
The end point has three reports of women who, despite obstacles and different forms of discrimination, maintain their greatest source of power: the voice.
 
“The hardest work with the lowest salary”
 
In 2024, there were 15,052 families with domestic employees in Macau. Although data from the Directorate of Services for Labor Affairs (DSAL) do not specify the sex of workers, the profession has a vinkly feminine face. They are cleaning professionals, cooks, caregivers, mothers, teachers: they accumulate all the traditionally expected functions of women, in a work that extends at 24 hours of the clock. As a remuneration, they receive a salary stipulated by the employer family and a single day off a week.
“In my case, I have already exceeded the hardest part,” admits Nedie Tabardo, president of the Greens Philippines Migrant Workers Association. With an easy smile, he will enumerate the reasons why he considers himself, perhaps, a little fortunate than the general panorama. He has been working for the same family for over 21 years since he arrived in Macau, and the ten -day child who helped raise is now a young adult. It has more time for you; You no longer need to be alert even in sleep, if an emergency occurs and the family come to wake it up. Sundays are entirely their own, dedicated to the projects they love.
This is not the case with most of their professional colleagues, especially those from Indonesia (usually less qualified and therefore “more exploited” than the Philippines). Nedie is said to be “lucky”, also, receiving “twice” of the salaries of other companions: “receive 3,500 patacas, 4,000 patacas, depending on the value of the market,” he says in a whisper weighing the words. "This is why we continue to insist that the government guarantees us the minimum wage," currently situated in the 7,072 patacas, "but so far we have not heard."
The Philippine community is “very cohesive, very united,” as it is easy to confirm with a walk through the streets of Macau on Sunday. They gather weekly to do sport, play, listen to music, talk. Still, the economic fissure between men and women is undeniable. Men are mostly focused on hotels and casinos, protected by the minimum wage guarantee. Women, most of them domestic, survive with what they can. When it comes to survival, this must be interpreted in the literal sense - the great threat to Philippines is even the inaccessibility of health care, as Nedie stresses.
“Just see the situation in recent months, in which they have made free vaccination available for residents. For non -resident workers, we have to pay everything with our own money. Who can pay three doses? ”He asks, shaking his head in the way of answering his own question. But flu and vaccination times are seasonal, unlike health care specifically female. “Earlier, they only asked for a minimum rate for childbirth at the Count of St. Januario. In recent years, the increase has been so high… ”In 2018, maids have paid 2,925 for a natural birth and 5,850 by caesarean sections, values ​​that often surpass their salaries and postpone, indefinitely, the possibility of being mothers. Biological mothers, not just caregivers.
“If we get sick, we pay all consultations and medicines. If an accident occurs outside the workplace, we are not offset. And, of course, working conditions… ”Nedie reiterates that her situation is positive now that the bosses' son has independent; It is concerned with the other workers who vent, in the Sunday living, about hours of abusive work (“sometimes more than 16 hours a day, even those who have their own home”) and psychological violence.
“There are bosses that are constantly implying, always angry. The maid is already used to and knows she has to hear and shut up, because she needs jobs and opportunities can scarce. If you resign, what can you do next? If you have not completed the provisional period of six months, migration services spend a two or three day visa and there is no choice but to return to the country of origin and wait another six months to return, ”explains Nedie. Given these conditions, "maids know that they have to be silent and withstand the difficulties, rather than denouncing and abandoning employment"
And physical abuse, also exists? The cases are much rarer, confesses, then lowering their voice in hesitation: “Some girls were sexually abused. In one case, the boss took a picture while the girl took a shower. She filed a complaint, but police only fined him for 'illegal photography' and not for sexual harassment. But these are rarer cases. Verbal abuse is that it is more difficult to be eradicated, it is too rooted. ”
Rooted in the society of Macao, too, although to a lesser extent. The instances where the bus is not rare in the street with a group of Philippines and hears exasperated comments, especially from older generations. “Philippines, so noisy, so annoying, always causing problems,” he reports with a skewed smile. "They don't know that I speak Cantonese and I can see them."
Throughout the interview, Nedie is showing on her mobile phone the projects with which she is concerned: the “World Cleanup Day” initiative; the Social Entrepreneurship Program of the Philippines Consulate it has just concluded; An art workshop that will start in two weeks. It entertains in a region that you can never call home, even after two decades. “As a contract work, I can never be a resident,” he laments. It is perpetually foreign, dedicating life "to the most difficult work with the lowest compensation." It is a weight that, admits, men will never know. “If Philippines are married, there are someone who takes care of their needs, food, the house. No women. After working for our boss, we still have to cook and take care of us. ”
 
“Break the standard” of domestic violence
 
Carina Ribeiro has lived in Macau since she was 16 years old. At 18, legally adult but still “innocent”, as repeated several times throughout the interview, began a relationship with a Portuguese boy. There were no signs of alarm at the beginning: "It was a dear, a love," until the day the first act of violence happened.
“I noticed that any boy looked at me on the street. I didn't even see the face well, but someone had looked at me. Suddenly my boyfriend hit me. ” It was an unpredictable gesture, fast - and suddenly everything had become: in a matter of seconds, the figure of the boyfriend, one meter and ninety, had a threatening potential. But not enough to end the relationship.
“Women are like this. Although they are victims, they feel guilty and empathize with the aggressor. They want to understand why he beats him; They want to try to cure him; They want to have 'happy forever'. Carina is lighting up, smoking and extinguishing cigarettes throughout the conversation, returning something hesitant to times already gone and closed in her memory. You are now married to four children - from this chapter of your life, there have only been the teachings that now shares with your customers in individual or couple therapies. It is “healer”, a term that prefers to call his work, but learned from an early age that self-preservation is more important than excessive empathy.
It took eight months to put a term in the relationship - eight months based on more verbal and physical violence. “I tried to cure him. I even managed to get into childhood trauma and realize why he felt that way: his father beat his mother. Automatically, without himself realizing, as if he was hypnotized, he drew a knife and came against me. ” Carina then made a decision that totally changed the course of her life. It did not go back even when the partner tried to end his own life, claiming not being able to overcome his disgust. “I had to realize no, I couldn't change it. I thought, 'If I continue, who's going to be dead is me'. From the moment the woman accepts this, she takes a step back and realizes that when trying to save a relationship, she is forgetting her own. ”
It was not an easy decision, repeats, "I was about to resume because I couldn't handle his suffering." In this loving dilemma, he eventually choosed himself. He only had news of his former partner years later, when he learned that he had been diagnosed with schizophrenia after assaulting the bride with whom he was about to marry. A bride who, if Carina had made another decision, could have had his face. "Never left the hospital since then."
As a healer, the 47-year-old Portuguese now focuses on conveying her knowledge to others-or to others regarding violence in an intimate context. Domestic violence may occur in multiple contexts, but the standards around the world leave no room for doubt: it is a virally feminine scourge, starting with the “physical dominance” of men in the face of women. Not everything is biological, however. Generally speaking, women are taught as a child to be submissive, empathic and prioritize the feelings of others in relation to their own - finally, to be "an eternal romantic."
This does not mean that domestic violence is a sentence, warns Carina. “Everything can stop from the moment the woman decides to break the standard. If a woman suffers from domestic violence and imposes herself to the man, take the phone and call the police, the child does not see the mother as a weak being. He sees his mother as someone who had the strength to say 'enough' and took both of the danger situation. When someone says they remain in marriage because of their children, they are teaching the children that this is the role of the woman. And when he grows up, his son will do the same partner because his father did, his mother consented, and will carry in himself not only the anger he feels for his wife, but the anger he feels for his parents. ”
Of the four children, three are girls. The only boy, Carina guarantees that he educates him to be a “gentleman”; As for girls, he has already started warning them of what he considers to be “a standard common to everyone” the aggressors. First, the incessant compliments (“you are so beautiful”, “you are a goddess”) that slowly go to attempts to control and coercion (“Was it really need to wear this dress?”, “I am not entitled to opinion?”). The "small violence" that women tend to smoke, such as the attempt to keep her insecure and vulnerable ("you are stupid, stupid, lower"). The bridge between a plagued dating and an abusive relationship is a short crossing that requires attention to details that the woman often ignores - or chooses to ignore, for the relationship.
According to statistical information released by the Secretary's Office for Security, in 2024 there were 133 cases of domestic violence, five more than the previous year. From this number, after investigation, until February 4, 2025, only 12 had been classified as crimes of domestic violence, and most received the categorization of “crimes of offenses to physical integrity”. As a Portuguese resident in Macau for over three decades, Carina Ribeiro is considered familiar with both Portuguese and Chinese thought. Statistics don't surprise her: “The Macao government always tries that everything is very beautiful,” he says, lighting another cigarette.
However, it recognizes undeniable differences regarding the approach of both cultures regarding love relationships. While Portugal defines domestic violence as a public crime, in Macao citizens choose confidentiality: “They are educated to maintain their problems between four walls; do not denounce them. ” Carina believes that this situation does not translate into a necessarily worse scenario for women in the MSAR: although men defend more traditional gender standards than Portugal, they also believe in lasting relationships and are more attentive to women's particularities. Protect it; they value it as a mother; They prepare teas and offer medication during menstruation.
Above all, they learn from their mistakes. “When a woman complains to the police and then withdraws her, the man from Portugal sees him as a sign of weakness. The man of Macau is not. It ends up trying to improve, communicate and not repeat the mistakes it has made. ” Whatever the outcome, an irreconcilable separation or a second attempt, the way of dealing with domestic violence always goes through the same action: the denunciation.
 
Lesbians are women “equal to the others”
 
Cathy Law (fictitious) knew it was lesbian when I was nine years old. While his schoolmates seized boys and drew huge hearts with the names of the men's handles, Cathy looked at his best friend with a mix of friendship and admiration that he couldn't well define. I knew later, through the internet, that it was not the only one and that there was a name for women who thought and felt like her.
When he grew up and the function of choosing his own clothes was incurred, he opted for “comfortable” more masculine pieces, such as training pants or the same worn shoes. She didn't want “tight and restrictive” clothes like the skirts her friends wore and that made them impossible to play as they did in primary education, climbing the trees or making the pin. “I already have a son, I don't need two,” sighed his mother, when her daughter came home at 17 with a haircut just like her brother's. But Cathy points out that it was never his intention to resemble a man: “I am a woman, with great taste. I just do not identify with clothes and behaviors traditionally associated with female. I may not be feminine, but that does not change the fact that you are a woman. Lesbian woman ”.
Day him with pride at 42, after a teenager and youth in which the word seemed not to slide fluently in the tongue. He had a fleeting dating with a classmate in early teens, when he still believed his feelings were a "phase" that would soon give way to the "correct way of life, just like that of others." The embarrassing kisses and the trips to the cinema did not result. He assumed him for herself 15 years old and before her family at 21, when she had her first serious relationship. “I believe my parents always knew, but they preferred to stay in denial,” he says.
Founded with reality, they had a "much better" reaction than the parents of some lesbian friends, who have been moved or who have never spoken with parents since then. “My father said he did not understand, but that he respected me enough to let me live my life. I was more afraid of my mother's reaction. I wrote a letter to him and left her at the bedside table, to read badly. I remember being on the couch trying to distract myself with the television, shaking uncontrollably, afraid of what I would say when I opened the bedroom door. Around eight in the morning, finally leaves, shrugging and says: ‘Well, it could be worse. At least you don't have cancer, isn't it? '”He says, between laughter.
Cathy feels that the struggle of lesbian women is devalued even within the gay community. Discrimination against homosexual men often occupies greater prominence, something Cathy can even understand: "A man who behaves in a feminine way is more shameful than a male woman, in the eyes of society, because the feminine is below in the hierarchy." But the prejudice that lesbian women are victims should be taken more seriously, especially those who present themselves in a disagreement of what is expected of Chinese women. “The Chinese woman should be makeup, elegant, graceful, submissive, faithful to her husband. I am not any of these things, and Chinese society in Macau makes a point of pointing out my finger and saying that I am a "wrong" woman, as if such a thing existed. "
To the derogatory comments that he listens on the street, join the sexualization to which he is subject when he is with his partner in public. “Men approach us and ask us how two women can relate closely. They ask us if we need a third element, take us pictures without permission… ”.
Macao is much more “progressive” than other regions of Asia, especially compared to rural areas where tradition reigns. Still, the only moments of “absolute normality” happen when it puts the mask and walks with the companion hand in hand - with half of the face covered, in the eyes of Macau's society are just another heterosexual couple. “It's curious that they treat me differently for something that only concerns me. I love women and prefer comfortable clothes. Who does this affect? Don't I still be a citizen? Don't I still be a woman, a woman like the others?

“More than two years ago we asked us to meet Keir Strmer, even before he was a prime minister. It's now or never, ”said Sebastian Lai told a group of journalists in London, including Lusa agency.  Jimmy Lai is 77, has been detained for four years in Hong Kong in isolation, “without access to daylight”, and suffers from diabetes, and there is life -threatening, he said.  Both the father and the son have British nationality because Hong Kong was a British colony until 1997. “I don't know what I have to do to meet my own Prime Minister, so that he shows that he supports my father and that the United Kingdom government supports him and wants to free him as soon as possible. Unfortunately, I don't know how long it is left to my father, ”said Sebastian Lai.
Last week, he personally delivered a letter in Downing Street to renew his meeting with Keir Stmerer.
Sebastian Lai complained that his father has been treated by the "totally inhuman" Chinese authorities, so health deteriorated, being much thinner, "when he was known to be plump and cheerful."
The entrepreneur was arrested in 2020 during the pro-democracy protests in the now Chinese territory and accused of “collusion with foreign forces” and sedition, in the light of the National Security Law promulgated in the same year.
Lai was, however, convicted of fraud and participating in “unauthorized” pro-democracy protests in 2019 and 2020 and forced to close the daily newspaper “Apple Daily” in 2021. On Thursday, the testimony ended in court, which lasted 52 days due to the previous interrogation of the prosecution.
The trial, which began in December 2023 but was extended by multiple delays, is expected to resume in the coming weeks for final allegations and conclude with the reading of the sentence, scheduled for October.
Lawyer, Caoilfhionn Gallagher, considers that this "is a critical moment" not only in the trial, but also for Jimmy Lai due to his age and state of health.  "Frankly, it is not acceptable for people like Sebastian to have to fight their own government for attention," he lamented, referring to the promises of the labor of "protecting his citizens" during the election campaign.

Thus suggested a greater opening of the mountain island commercial market with the importation of Portuguese wines with exemption from customs rights. On the other hand, Guangdong authorities advanced with the plan to impose the possibility of border passage at the Hengqin post without presentation of identification documents.
 
Macao representatives in the National Committee of the Chinese Political Advisory Conference (CCPPC) proposed the exemption of customs rights for goods from the Lusophone countries entering Hengqin, namely the wines of Portugal.
Regarding the market opening of Mountain Island, those responsible also ask to introduce “more convenient” customs policies to facilitate the process of importing products manufactured in Portuguese -speaking countries.
The proposal was presented jointly by nine members of Macau to the central government, signed by Leonel Alves, Chan Wa Keong, who are lawyers and former deputies to the Legislative Assembly; Huang Liuquan, subdirector of the Central Government's connection office on the MSAR; Ho Ion Sang, IP Sio Kai and Lam Lon Wai, current deputies of Hemiciclo; Chui Chi Tou, editor-in-chief of the newspaper or Mun; Li Peng Bin, subdirector of Kiang Wu Hospital; and Francisco Ho Ka Lon, businessman.
Thus, members of the CCPPC consider that the products of Portuguese -speaking countries can be a starting point for hengqin to open and liberalize the entry of products from abroad, complementing the diverse development of Macao.
“There may be problems and risks if goods, especially cigarettes and alcohol, are fully liberalized to enter hengqin. Therefore, we have to explore viable paths in this regard, ”they stress. Responsible stress that the consumption of products from Lusophone countries in the interior of China is still “within the controllable range” compared to those of other countries, so it is “suitable for being a pilot project” of customer rights exemption.
The choice of Lusophone products is also due to the fact that, according to the document, Macau has been operating the Sino-Portuguese platform for many years and has “has a vast experience in economic and commercial exchange”, and the approach can better consolidate the role of Macao's Sino-Portuguese platform.
 
Border travel
 
The question of facilitating the border passage between Macao and the interior of China dominated a meeting of the Guangdong delegation in the National People's Assembly (APN). Wang Weizhong, governor of the province, has revealed that he is promoting measures to accelerate the border passage at the Hengqin border post with exemption from presentation of identification documents.
The also deputy secretary of the CCP Provincial Committee indicates that Beijing will formulate a series of hengqin support initiatives and will implement more policies for the connection within the large bay centered on the circulation of people and vehicles.
Macao member to APN, Kevin Ho, suggested adding a visit visa to Macao de Sports Talents from the continent on the occasion of this year's national games. Vong Hin Fai proposed special measures for the access of Hong Kong and Macao lawyers to Guangdong Province through single enrollment vehicles, “promoting the cooperation and development of legal services and facilitating the establishment of ties between the Great Bay lawyers and the Guangdong Province companies and organizations,” he defended.
 
Supreme Popular Court of China reinforces protection of rights of residents of Macau
 
China's Supreme Popular Court admits to work this year to reinforce the protection of citizens' rights and interests, including Macao residents, as well as increasing awareness of the rule of law. The highest judicial body of the RPC presented on Saturday its report on the work where it revealed that last year 27,000 cases involving Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan were tried, which represents an increase of 4.3% over the previous year. There were also 7,840 processes dealt with with mutual legal assistance involving Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, 15.4% less than 2023. Zhang Jun, president of the Supreme Court Popular, stressed that he created a platform for judicial and legal cooperation in the Great Bay that serves the promotion of the convergence of judicial and legal rules between Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau. The official added that seven Hong Kong and Macau mediation organizations established cooperation last year with the Guangdong Courts for resolution of civil and transfronight commercial disputes.</description><pubDate>2025-03-10 03:47:24</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
