In the early morning, young people began the demonstration in front of the National University of Timor-Leste (UNTL) and with Parliament under a strong police device, which conditioned the protesters and eventually pushed them into the educational establishment.
After negotiations between students and the security forces, the police allowed the most manifestation to the top of Lisbon Avenue, where the National Parliament, Untl and the Resistance Museum Archive is located. But the moods exalted and quickly began to shoot tear gas at the protesters, who responded with the throw of stones and burnt tires on the roads, and a state vehicle was set on fire.
The disorders affected the Government Palace zone, the National Bank Overseas, Pateo, the National University of Timor-Leste (UNTL) and the Ministry of Justice.
In the early afternoon, after new negotiations between protester and police, the security forces device was reduced and the young people returned to the front of the UNTL and the National Parliament to finish the second day of protest. "The 65 deputies who are currently in the National Parliament do not represent the Timorese people, do not discuss the legitimate interests of the people. Deputies take the position to achieve their personal, group and partisan rights, but are not responsible for the suffering that the people face," student César João Batista told Lusa.
Vicentino da Costa Lemos also criticized the performance of “rogues” deputies, noting that the university students are representing the voice of the people. "The deputies make rascal decisions and we will fight. The resistance of university students, unreservedly firmness, the struggle continues," said Vicentino da Costa Lemos.
Next to Parliament, young people shouted slogans against the deputies, but also danced traditional Timorese songs.
The protest ended peacefully, with the students to be summoned to the last day of demonstration, which takes place on Wednesday. In the end, the young people collected the trash, including the burnt tires, left through the various streets where they passed in confrontation with the police.

Excessive use of tear gas

Timor-Leste Human Rights and Justice Provider Virgílio Guterres said the Timorese police exaggerated the use of tear gas against protesters during students' protest actions. "According to preliminary information I received about the last two days, I think police have shot over excess tear gas. Our police used too much tear gas against protesters," Virgílio Guterres said at a press conference.
Students from four universities in Timor-Leste began a protest against deputies' perks, which was eventually dispersed with tear gas by the police, after the protesters shot stones and other objects against the National Parliament, where the third legislature of the sixth legislature was due.
Yesterday, the police conditioned the protesters leading to disorders between security forces and students in various arteries of the city of Dili. Virgílio Guterres explained that the use of tear gas or other forms of intervention with force should only occur when protesters have actions that may undermine public order or damage public buildings. "The use of force is necessary when, in our analysis, protesters begin to destroy public goods and severely disturb public order on the ground," he said.
The provider also lamented that police action hit journalists, with tear gas shots while conducting interviews. "If journalists are interviewing protesters, police cannot fire tear gas directly against them. I think this is not acceptable," said Virgílio Guterres.
The journalist Jeniche da Costa, from Suara Timor Lorosae (STL), was hit by tear gas while interviewing protesters, having been injured in a leg. He was already assisted at the Vera Cruz Health Center and returned home.
Virgílio Guterres praised the maturity demonstrated by students and civil society organizations in Monday's demonstration. "We observed that the manifestation of the first day took place with a remarkable maturity, which deserves praise," he said.
The provider once again appealed to protesters to reject any form of anarchy or violence, defending solidarity and mutual respect.
Virgílio Guterres asked the Timor-Leste National Police to maintain high standards of professionalism in order to control public order with balance. "We trust that the police will continue to act with professionalism. Sometimes one or another member can resort to the use of force in certain situations, but we hope the command monitor and take action against those who leave the proper conduct," he said.
The provider also asked the security forces to respect the constitutional right of meeting and peaceful manifestation.
Virgílio Guterres stressed that the government must have sensitivity to the life and concerns of the people, especially in the context of student manifestations and civil society. "We also appeal to the government and the deputies to continue to dialogue with the protesters and to hear their concerns," added the Human Rights and Justice Ombudsman.

The work should take 30 days, the authorities indicate in a statement released yesterday.
When this crossing is ready, it will not be necessary for the pawns to get around the exterior of the Garden of Arts, and can then cross Avenida da Amizade and Rua Cidade de Sintra in a direct pedestrian line.
At this moment, if the pedestrians near Avenida 24 de Junho or Rua de Cantão want to travel between Zape and Nape, they need to circumvent temporary access, separated by water barriers and located on Friendship Avenue, next to the Jardim das Artes, lacking a walk. In order to improve the pedestrian environment, it is planned to build pedestrian metal platforms, in the access of parking park lanes on both sides of the Jardim das Artes, some trees from the Jardim das Artes to another place and some recreational and sports facilities and also a monument in the garden area, in order to vacate space and articulate with general planning; And although the passage to pedestrian, on Friendship Avenue, next to the Jardim das Artes, is extended to 12 meters, in order to create facilitated pedestrian access and optimize the crossing environment, explains a statement from the Directorate of Public Works Services, the Services for Traffic Affairs and the Institute for Municipal Affairs.

Also in these elections, the authorities have decided to abandon a procedure that was done in all other elections since 2001, the public verification of the null votes, in which journalists could see the vows invalidated. Asked the reasons why the public was no longer accessed to the invalid votes, the President of the General Court justified with the “duty of confidentiality” - which was already consecrated in previous electoral acts.

Last Sunday's elections were marked by the exponential increase in blank and null votes. Only the null votes were more triple compared to the 2021 electoral act and more than the 2017 elections. Also this year, the authorities decided to stop public verification of the null votes, a process that was open to journalists. Yesterday, in the presentation of the general investigation of these elections, the authorities only said that this year there was no public verification due to the "duty of confidentiality".
"The law says that the vote has to fulfill the duty of confidentiality," said Cheong Kuok Chi, president of the General Court of Legislative elections, in the presentation of the final results. The official added that although the invalid votes were not projected when their verification were shown to the representatives of the lists
The “secret of voting” is consecrated in the revision of the electoral law to the legislative assembly in force since last year, as it was also safeguarded in the previous version and other electoral acts that have been held in the MSAR since 2001. In addition, this article of the electoral law only says that “no one can, under any pretext, oblige the voter to reveal his vote or his voting intention” Distance from 100 meters from the building where it is in operation, no voting can reveal, under any pretext, your vote or your voting intention. ”
Asked if he considered that the MSAR violated the electoral law in the electoral acts prior to publicly publicizing the invalid votes, Cheong Kuok Chi, who is also a delegate coordinator of the Public Prosecution Service, said he did not want to comment on the work done by the authorities in the past.
The official was also asked about the considerable increase in the number of invalid bulletins and replied that the General Court of Legislative Election Assembly is responsible for checking the votes, noting after there can be “various reasons” so that the null votes have increased.
Already at the press conference given by the Legislative Assembly Electoral Affairs Commission (Caeal) late Sunday night, the body's president, Seng Ioi Man, did not want to risk any explanation and said that "[in each election] there are always numbers to rise and descend, there are many reasons."
In the 2021 elections, after the disqualification of dozens of candidates mostly from the Democratic wing, the public projection of invalid votes showed several bulletins with political messages, criticism of the electoral process and references to the exclusion of candidates. In this year's elections, authorities also excluded a dozen candidates, including former deputy Ron Lam.
Yesterday, the General Court of Legislative Elections informed that, after verification, 24 of the votes initially considered null were given as valid. Thus, the number of invalidated votes dropped from 7,077 to 7,053, not changing the final result of the elections.</description><pubDate>2025-09-16 23:45:45</pubDate></item><item><title>Authorities warn of cybersecurity risks in Macau again</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/09/16/autoridades-voltam-a-alertar-para-riscos-da-ciberseguranca-em-macau/</link><description>Local authorities have renewed appeals to greater awareness of cybersecurity risks. The Judicial Police stresses that cyber security is becoming increasingly “complex” due to increased cybership threats. In this case, the body says that the population should deal with the question of a perspective linked to “national security” and “national rejuvenation”.
 
Cyber ​​security is again the subject of discussion of the authorities. The Judicial Police (PJ) warned that the territory is facing increasingly serious risks to cybersecurity, so it needs to stay alert.
"We must further increase surveillance, adopt a mindset of preparation for worse scenarios, and formulate comprehensive plans with prudent provisions, to deal with the numerous uncertainties and risks found during development," he said.
The PJ added thus the risks of the cybersecurity that Macao is facing include threats posed by various cybership, data violations, cyber extortion and online fraud.
Lai Man Vai, substitute director of the PJ, approached yesterday the subject in a speech given at the opening ceremony of the “China Cybersecurity Week of 2025-Macao Sub-For”, organized by the Cybersecurity Alert and Response Center, which had 400 participants.
Under the authorities, cybersecurity is the “life force” of the digital age, which involves not only technical safeguards, but also “national security, economic development and social stability”.
"A deeper recognition of the critical role that safeguarding cyber defense capabilities and the reinforcement of the safety of the supply chain play in national development and national rejuvenation is necessary," he said.
The PJ argues that the comprehensive reinforcement of cyber security and data protection is no longer optional, but an “imperative response”, pointing out that the region should face this issue through the national security lens and national rejuvenation, as if it were the fulfillment of “daily duties with greater responsibility and more urgent actions”.
In his speech, Lai Man will admit at the same time that the work of this government always requires training through technology, given that the government lines have delineated a series of development plans and measures linked to information and networking technologies, such as electronic governance, smart cities and digital economy.
"Over the past year, Artificial Intelligence Technology (IA) has not only quickly advanced, but has accelerated its widespread adoption. The way I apply AI more effectively and safe remains a continuous discussion between government, companies and the general public," he said.
PJ, in this sense, pointed out the importance of cyber security, stressing that, since the entry into force of the Cybersecurity Law in 2019, the government has been actively established a preventive governance framework in cybersecurity.
For the future, according to the official, the government and the center of alerting and response to cybersecurity incidents will adopt a “prospective approach” to coordinate planning and formulate more “resilient and sustainable” technological development strategies.
The work will aim to reinforce the collaboration of critical infrastructure operators and various sectors of society in promoting Macao's cybersecurity abilities.
The PJ also revealed that it will continue to collaborate with Guangdong and Hong Kong province to reinforce qualified frames and technological innovation in the three regions, promoting transfronhetic flow of data and strengthening cybersecurity defenses.
According to data released by the PJ for last year, the average number of cybership and espionage directed to macao critical infrastructures increased 8.6% to 6,300 times a day. Over 2024, 291 warning notifications were issued to critical infrastructure operators and 38 incident reports were received, 12 of which were incidents of cybers.</description><pubDate>2025-09-16 23:44:17</pubDate></item><item><title>Open to traffic the main arteries of zone A</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/09/16/abertas-ao-transito-as-principais-arterias-da-zona-a/</link><description>Yesterday opened the main arteries of zone A of the new landfills.

The Deputy Minister of Chinese Trade, Li Chenggang, confirmed the agreement reached with the US and assured that it is "mutual interest."

China and the US agreed in Madrid that the Tiktok social network has an American owner, the US Treasury Secretary said after conversations between the two countries, without advance details. "The structure (the social network) aims to have an owner under American property. But, once again, I will not anticipate" the conversation "of the leaders scheduled for Friday," said Scott Bessent, referring to the discussion announced on Friday between US President Donald Trump and Chinese homologist Xi Jinping.
The Deputy Minister of Chinese Trade, Li Chenggang, confirmed the agreement reached with the US and assured that it is "mutual interest." "The reason why China has accepted a consensus on Tiktok is because, based on our assessment, we conclude that such a consensus is in our mutual interest," Li said during a press conference.
After two days of negotiations in the Spanish capital, China and the US has reached an agreement on Tiktok, which includes the transfer of the platform to US control. Now, this agreement is expected to be finalized by the US President and Xi Jinping on Friday. "The main commercial negotiations in Europe between the US and China have been doing very well. They are about to end. An agreement has also been closed about a" certain company that the young people in our country really want to keep. They will be very happy, "said President Trump on his social networks. "I will talk to President Xi on Friday," added Donald Trump.
The short video platform has been at the center of a dispute between the two countries for months, and Washington required Tiktok to be sold until September 17 to a non -Chinese owner, otherwise it is banned in the US.
According to a 2024 Congress law, Tiktok is in principle subject to a ban in the US, unless the mother company, the Chinese group Bytedance, gives up its control.
The deadline for the social network to find a non -Chinese buyer or banned in the US is September 17, after a third extension of this period made by Trump.
This legislation aims to prevent Chinese authorities from having access to the personal data of Tiktok users in the US or can influence American public opinion through the powerful algorithm of the social network, although no evidence has been presented to substantiate these fears.

According to Chinese diplomacy spokesman Lin Jian, Wang expressed during the tour, which included stops in Austria, Slovenia and Poland, the desire for these countries to “contribute to the healthy and stable development of relations between China and the European Union, when Beijing tries to reinforce ties with the European bloc, in view of the aggravation of tensions with the United States.
During the trip, which took place between September 12 and 16, Wang criticized “unilateral hegemony” in a “turbulent and complex” international context in an indirect allusion to Washington. In response, the leaders of the three countries visited expressed support for multilateralism, the United Nations authority, and the reinforcement of global peace and development, the spokesman said.
The war in Ukraine was one of the central themes of the agenda. In Vienna, Austrian Minister Beate Meinl-Reisinger appealed to Beijing to exert her influence on Moscow to end the invasion, reiterating Austria's availability to welcome future negotiations.
In Liubliana, Slovenian Foreign Minister Tanja Fajon called for China to help achieve “just and lasting” peace, while in Warsaw, the Polish authorities called for measures against “Russia's destructive actions” and provocations from Belarus.
Wang's travel to Europe has coincided with a worsening tensions in eastern continent after the violation of Russian non -manned air vehicles (“drones”), described by Warsaw as an attempt to test the response capacity of Poland and Nato.
Since the beginning of the war, China has maintained an ambiguous position, appealing to respect for the territorial integrity of all countries, but also to the legitimate security concerns of each part - in a formulation that aims to balance its strategic relationship with Russia with its global image as a mediator.</description><pubDate>2025-09-16 23:31:43</pubDate></item><item><title>Macau Jane Zhang director among the winners of the International Film Camp 2025</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/09/16/realizadora-de-macau-jane-zhang-entre-os-vencedores-do-international-film-camp-2025/</link><description>Local director Jane Zhang is among the eight winners of the International Film Camp (IFC) 2025, announced Monday at The Londoner Macao.

In addition to honors Mozart and multiple thematic shows, such as New Year's or Easter, the great highlights for season 2025-2026 are the inclusion of international artists and young talents in the program.
The 2025-2026 season of the Macau Orchestra was officially inaugurated on September 6, with an opening concert held at the large auditorium of the Macao Cultural Center.
The classic chosen to mark the moment was “Concert for Violin”, by composer Felix Mendelssohn, under the guidance of the music director and main conductor Lio Kuokman. The special participation of the South Korean violinist Inmo Yang contributed to the “masterful execution” of the play and the “environment of great solemnity” in which the inauguration ceremony was held, as a statement from the Cultural Institute (IC) refers.
Subordinate to the “Next” theme, the new season proposes to expand the spatial, temporal and sensory limits of music through “a multiplicity of meticulously selected concerts”. Following this idea of ​​progress and enhancement, the Macao Orchestra promises to lead “the audience for a musical trip that travels through different eras and geographies, evoking classical and contemporary composers from China and the world through their timeless works”.
International Artists in Macau
The Time For Three (TF3) band opens the first concert of the new season on November 30, with a demonstration of the “boldness and avant -garde” that has already earned them Grammy and Emmy awards. The trio will provide “a multifaceted artistic experience” that combines violin, double bass and guitar, crossing classical, 'folk' music and 'pop'.

Thematic concerts and promotion of young talents

In Easter, Holy Week will be marked with Bach's “Passion Second St. John”. In June, Children's Day offers an experience for the whole family with the “Symphonic Film Concert”, in which both “kids and big” can “dive into enchanting fantasy stories”.
One of the great objectives of the new season is the creation of “various platforms to support the new musical generations”, underlines the IC. Professional musicians of the Macao Orchestra and local academic talents will act side by side at the concert “The Future of Classical Music”, while the “Florest Floor Arts” concert will present the winners of the “Macao Youth Music Contest”.
In order to “promote sharing and cultural exchange through music”, this season also hosts the winner of the “Singapore International Violin Contest”, intended for young people. The IC ensures that "the Macao Orchestra will continue to boost artistic education and culture with the communities, thus bringing classical music closer to urban daily life, transforming the melody into a living landscape, shared by residents and visitors."

At these prices, eight offers coupons can also be applied to different audiences (such as students, elderly or residents of the large bay area), which can discount up to 50% of the original value.
