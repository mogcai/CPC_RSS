The Japanese government warned yesterday with the “increasingly serious and imminent” threat of North Korea due to the development of missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads to Japanese territory. The information appears in an annual report from the Japanese Ministry of Defense.
The document also warned of the rapid intensification of China's military activity, from the southwest back of the archipelago to the Pacific, classifying Beijing as "the biggest strategic challenge" for its safety.
The annual report of the Japanese Ministry of Defense, delivered to the executive of the country, also highlights the growing military cooperation between China and Russia, the increase of tensions around Taiwan and the threats from North Korea as serious concerns to Tokyo.
"International society has been experiencing a new era of crisis, facing the biggest challenges since the end of World War II," says the 534 pages report, which warns of profound changes in the global balance of power and a possible climbing rivalry between China and the United States.
Safety threats are concentrated in the Indo-Pacific region, where Japan is inserted, and may get worse in the coming years, the text adds.
Given the fear of a possible conflict in Taiwan, Japan has been accelerating military reinforcement on the southwest islands, including the preparation for the detachment of long -range cruise missiles.
Taiwan began last week annual ten -day military maneuvers with royal fire, while Japan tested last month an anti -range anti -range missile.
According to the report, the presence of Chinese war ships in the Pacific has increased constantly, with the frequency of passages off the Japanese southwest to triple in the last three years, including in the waters between Taiwan and the Japanese island of Yonaguni.
The publication of the document occurs days after Japan required China to suspend the “abnormal proximity” flight flights of Japanese recognition aircraft, warning of the risk of clash. Beijing answered accusing Tokyo of spying flights near Chinese airspace. The report also cites two incidents that occurred in June, when Tokyo first detected two Chinese aircraft carrier operating together on the Pacific.
The increase in the frequency of shipping chains and Chinese bombers for long-range missions in the Pacific is, according to the Japanese Ministry of Defense, an attempt by Beijing to project naval power in distant waters and reinforce its operational capacity around Japan.
With US President Donald Trump, focused on strengthening security and internal economy, the report points out that Japan and other US allies now face greater expectations regarding stability and regional peace.
The report also states that Russia maintains active military operations in the vicinity of Japan, including the violation of Japanese airspace last September, and stresses that the growing strategic cooperation between Moscow and Beijing constitutes "a strong reason for concern" for Tokyo.

In June, Indian Energy Minister Manohar Lal Khattar proposed a rule requiring air conditioners sold in the country to have thermostates that cannot be adjusted to less than 20 degrees Celsius.
Authorities expect this small change to generate huge energy saving in the country of more than 1,400 million inhabitants. Annually, 10 to 15 million air conditioners are sold as income and urbanization increase, such as temperatures.
The current lower configuration is 17 ° C. Authorities claim that each more degree in air conditioner saves about 6% energy. The reaction to change is mixed. Lal Khattar said the proposed rule will come into force soon, but did not specify the deadline.
Energy experts stated that the proposal is a positive step, but defend more energy efficient devices, which would help more. The proposal received mixed criticism from people living in the suffocating cities of India.
Air conditioners are rapidly becoming the largest energy consumers in India, representing up to a quarter of the necessary electricity during periods of higher consumption in 2024, a measure known as peak demand, according to estimates at the University of California in Berkeley.
According to researchers from this university, the new conditioned air sold between 2019 and 2024 increased the peak of demand in an amount almost equivalent to what would be necessary to supply new Deli for a year.
The demand for energy is usually higher during summer, when temperatures can reach 51 degrees Celsius in some parts of the country. If no changes are made, India is expected to have energy shortages next year.
Power consumption in India is also one of the main reasons why the country is one of the largest gas emitters that heat the planet. The use of clean energy is growing, but most electricity is provided by polluting fossil fuels such as coal.
Nikit Abhyankar, leader of India's Center for Energy and Climate at the University of California, in Berkeley, said New Delhi, like other major Indian cities, has two peaks in electricity use-one in the afternoon and one around midnight-driven mainly by air conditioners.
The proposal regarding air conditioners is the latest in a series of government measures adopted in the last decade to save energy, such as the obligation of government offices to be cooled at a temperature not less than 24 degrees Celsius.</description><pubDate>2025-07-16 02:12:44</pubDate></item><item><title>Tour price index registered an annual increase of 1.42% in the second quarter</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/07/16/indice-de-precos-turisticos-registou-aumento-anual-de-142-no-segundo-trimestre/</link><description>The goods and services acquired by visitors in Macao were slightly more expensive in the second quarter of this year. According to the Directorate of Statistics and Census Services (DSEC), between April and June, the Tour Price Index (IPT) grew 1.42% in annual terms.
The increase is mainly due to the price rise of jewelery and the clock, as well as fun and leisure, however, the decrease in clothing prices and restoration services compensated for part of the index growth.
Among the pricing rates of the goods and services sections, the price index of the section of various goods, such as jewelery, clock and handicrafts, and the fun and cultural activities recorded an annual increase of 13.4% and 12%, respectively. On the contrary, the price index of the clothing and footwear section and the restoration dropped 3.14% and 2.8%, respectively.
The DSEC also revealed that, compared to the preceding quarter, the second quarter index found a decrease of 2.31%. Thus, the accommodation section price index descended 13.29%, in quarterly terms, due to the decrease in prices of the hotel rooms. The price index of the fun section and cultural activities and that of various goods rose 4.59% and 3.83%, respectively.
It is recalled that the IPT reflects the price variation of goods and services acquired by visitors in Macao. According to the authorities, the IPT sections of goods and services are based on the consumer structure of visitors, namely: food products, alcoholic beverages and tobacco; clothing and shoes; accommodation; restoration; transport and communications; medicines and goods for personal use; Fun and cultural activities, as well as diverse goods.
Still in the same inquiry, DSEC has advanced that the IPT from the beginning of the year to June rose 1.29%in annual terms, noting that the price index of the various goods (+14.32%) and the fun and cultural activities (+10%) recorded the highest increases, but the price index of the accommodation and the drugs and goods of use Personal (-3%) decreased.
As for comparison with the four previous quarters, the average IPT of the four quarter -end quarter increased 1.96%, DSEC said. The price index of the section of various goods (+13.60%) had the most pronounced increase, however, the accommodation of the accommodation section (-2.31%) registered a decrease.</description><pubDate>2025-07-16 02:12:43</pubDate></item><item><title>Russia and North Korea inaugurate direct flights between capital</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/07/16/russia-e-coreia-do-norte-inauguram-este-mes-voos-directos-entre-capitais/</link><description>North Korea and Russia will inaugurate direct flights between Moscow and Pyongyang from July 27 in a reinforcement of cooperation between the two countries. It will be the first direct air service between the two capitals and the flight will last approximately eight hours.
 
North Korea and Russia will inaugurate direct flights between Moscow and Pyongyang, from July 27, in a reinforcement of cooperation between the two countries, the Russian government announced yesterday.
This is the first direct air service between the two capitals and the flight will last approximately eight hours, the Russian Ministry of Transport, quoted by the country's news agency Tass.
In the first phase, the calls will be made once a month to generate a stable demand and ensure flight occupation.
The announcement of the date comes five days after Russia's federal federal air transport agency has authorized Moscow -based Nordwind to regular flights between the two cities, with a maximum frequency of two calls per week.
So far, the only direct airline between the two countries was the route between Vladivostok (East Russian) and Pyongyang.
The announcement follows the visit of Russian Foreign Minister, Serguei Lavrov, North Korea last week, which included a meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, who reaffirmed "unconditional support" to Russia in the war against Ukraine.
Lavrov also had a meeting with North Korean counterpart, Choe Son-hui, in which both reaffirmed the desire to advance to a “long-term strategic partnership” through the bilateral treaty signed in 2024, which includes a mutual defense clause in case of aggression.
The ties between Russia and North Korea were narrowed after this treaty's signing and Pyongyang is believed to have sent troops, rockets and ammunition to support Ukraine's Russian invasion in exchange for anti-aircraft weapon systems. The restoration of direct flights follows other recent developments in the transport sector.
On June 17, Russia and North Korea restored the direct rail service between Moscow and Pyongyang, suspended since 2020 due to covid-19 pandemic and considered the longest-stopped train trip, covering more than 10,000 kilometers in just eight days.
The two nations also agreed to resume the railway route between Pyongyang and Khabarovsk (Far East Russian), as well as increasing the frequency of flights between the two countries and starting the joint construction of a bridge for vehicle circulation over the Tumen River, in line with strategic commitments to reinforce transport cooperation.

The Directorate of Environmental Protection Services ensures that it is evaluating the restoration sector operations and will promote legislative work. In response to an interpellation, he added, however, that the number of complaints about fatty fumes has been decreasing.
 
The Directorate of Environmental Protection Services (DSPA) confirmed its intention to extend control of the emission of fatty fumes of restaurants. The body said it will promote, in timely manner, the legislative work of the administrative regulation on the “limits on the emission of fatty fumes and restoration equipment management standards”, currently studying and evaluating the restoration sector's operating situation and the economic environment of Macao.
DSPA's guarantee is in response to a written Ho Ion Sang interpellation about oleosy fumes, where the deputy questioned the progress of the relevant legislation, as well as the monitoring of the situation in food transformation workshops located in housing zones.
In this sense, according to IP Kuong Lam, director of DSPA, in response, the number of complaints about fatty fumes from restoration establishments and eating products “has verified a decreasing trend” in recent years.
He added that in the current law are regulated, among other industrial establishments, the establishments of making food products.
"DSPA also, at the request of the services responsible for the supervision of industrial establishments, issues technical opinions in the area of environmental protection for the installation of food making establishments," he said, hoping to minimize the impact caused on the environment during the operation of these establishments.
At the interpellation, Ho Ion Sang complained of fatty fumes and bad smells from restaurant kitchens on the housing ground floor due to filtering facilities failures.
"They often emit fatty fumes, which not only disturbs the residents of the superior and surrounding floors, but also a threat to the health of residents, and the continuous inhalation of these fumes can cause respiratory disease," said the deputy, stressing that the emission of "oily fumes" is one of the main sources of pollution that affects the air quality in Macau.
Ho Ion Sang has asked the government to accelerate the legislative process in question and to launch a plan to encourage the sector to eliminate old treatment equipment of this smoke, introducing more efficient filtration and control techniques.
In response, DSPA said it was aware of the development of fatty fume treatment equipment and monitoring auxiliary systems, communicating with relevant licensing services to study the eventual introduction of a digital monitoring system.
The body will also advance with the planning of Macau environmental protection work for the next five years, which, according to DSPA, will take into account the projects to improve the situation of fatty fume emissions, particularly at the time of defining the content and related environmental indicators.</description><pubDate>2025-07-16 02:12:40</pubDate></item><item><title>Macau Historic Center has been a UNESCO Heritage for 20 years</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/07/16/centro-historico-de-macau-e-patrimonio-da-unesco-ha-20-anos/</link><description>Yesterday was the 20th anniversary of the registration of the Macao Historic Center in the UNESCO World Heritage list, on July 15, 2005. The launch ceremony of commemorative activities took place at the Dom Pedro V Theater at 16:30, at an event where the cultural institute exalted Macao's “unique position” as a confluence between eastern and western cultures.
 
The twentieth anniversary of the registration of the Macao Historic Center on the UNESCO World Heritage list was yesterday celebrated by the Cultural Institute (IC) at the Dom Pedro V Theater at 16:30. IC President Leong Wai Man opened the ceremony with a speech where he stressed the unique characteristics of Macao as a bridge of connection between the West and the East, incorporating in itself a fusion of cultures enrolled for centuries in the streets and monuments of the city.
“Macao's historic center, as a strategic and crucial nucleus of the Silk Maritime route, opened the doors to the East-Cultural Cultural Dialogue,” said Leong Wai Man, giving as an example of this “harmonious coexistence” the temples and baroque churches, erected side by side, or the Chinese courtyards where to “serve” the Portuguese sidewalks. "Like a three -dimensional epic sculpted in the territory, this heritage materializes a unique paradigm of peaceful coexistence and mutual enrichment between civilizations," he said.
The inscription of the Historic Center of Macau - composed of 22 buildings and eight wide, as well as the streets that interconnect these points - on the UNESCO World Heritage list has publicized the richness of this ancient port city, allowing the recognition of the “unique position” and the “exceptional contribution of the territory as a point of confluence” of different languages, cultures, architectures and creeds.
Leong Wai Man emphasized, however, that cultural heritage is not a static organism: on the contrary, it should be safeguarded as a “continuous civilizational legacy of perpetual transmission” in constant development and protection work. Speaking on behalf of the IC, the official assured: “in collaboration with all sectors of society, we have sought to ensure preservation and inheritance and the innovative use of heritage”, through measures such as “the construction of the legal system, monitoring and repair, the protection of science and technology [and] national exchange”. These measures aim to act as an “effective barrier” of heritage preservation, forming “a cultural protection system that involves the entire population”.
The day 20 years have been marked since the recognition of UNESCO, the IC has committed to “expand and streamline the resources” of protection, respect and valorization of a “cultural treasure” that, after all, “belongs to all humanity”. “We will guarantee that the essence of the dialogue between East and West, which is part of the Macao World Heritage, continues to shine and illuminate a future of peace and integration for all humanity,” said Leong Wai Man.
The ceremony was also marked by the inclusion of a musical moment, in which the Chinese orchestra of Macao presented themes that intended to illustrate the cultural richness and diversity of Macao. While the first piece refered to the celebrations of the year of the serpent, the current cycle of the Chinese horoscope, the second was an instrumental version of the song “Lisbon Girl and Girl”, originally played by fadista Carlos do Carmo.
The IC has prepared several commemorative activities to mark the date, ranging from night tours and literary rails to tea tests and craft workshops. The full schedule, which extends by the end of the year, can be consulted on the electronic page https://www.icm.gov.mo/MHD20/, and the activities are subject to prior registration through the Macao Single Account.
 
Project of viaduct AB subject to UNESCO evaluation
 
The center of UNESCO World Heritage has required Macao to evaluate the impact on heritage (Heritage Impact Assessments) on the construction of the viaduct between zone A and zone B of new urban landfills. The AB viaduct project, it is recalled, generated criticism from society due to a possible impact on the Macao's historic center landscape as well as the landscape corridor of the Cultural Center to the Kun Iam statue. Leong Wai Man, president of the Cultural Institute (IC), confirmed that he had received UNESCO's request, but stressed that it is a "normal mechanism" that the agency requests the presentation of the evaluation of new construction projects. The official said yesterday that she is still listening to public opinions about the venture of Viaduct AB to elaborate a concrete construction plan. "After the preparation of the plan, we will then make a risk assessment to be sent for analysis. According to the guidelines, the authorities will not start the work before the results of the analysis of the center of the world heritage," he said. On the sidelines of the launch ceremony of the commemorative activities of the Macao Historic Center as UNESCO Heritage, Leong Wai Man, quoted by Macao Radio in Chinese language, revealed that the East Line Line project is also subject to UNESCO assessment. Regarding the unfinished buildings on the Calçada de Gaio, which raised controversy due to its height during construction, the IC spokeswoman said the subsequent proposals for the design of the project have already been submitted to the center of the world heritage. According to Leong, the venture can advance with the current conception, according to the resolution of the agency, without the need to evaluate the impact on heritage.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Economic Association projects GDP growth by 2.8% in the first half</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/07/16/associacao-economica-projecta-crescimento-do-pib-em-28-no-primeiro-semestre/</link><description>The Macau Economic Association estimates that the annual growth of the local economy reaches 2.8% in the first half of this year, recovering almost 90% of gross domestic product recorded in the same period of 2019. In an analysis, the association points out that Macao's economy was affected by weak external demand in the first six months of the year, but demonstrates “a certain degree of resilience” and maintains stability by the end of the year.
 
An analysis released by the Macao Economic Association advanced a growth projection of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of 2.8% for the first half of this year, which is encrypted by 208 billion Patacas. The estimate implies a 89.4% GDP recovery compared to the 2019 same period.
The association was confident that Macau has a positive GDP growth after a 1.3% decrease in the first quarter. According to its calculation, the Macao GDP in the second quarter of this year is expected to reach a level and 110 billion patacas, corresponding to an increase of 7% in annual terms.
"Macao's economy was affected by the weak external demand in the first half of the year, but indicators such as visitors' arrivals, hotel occupancy rate and unemployment rate remained stable with the support of the country, and the economy in general demonstrated a certain degree of resilience," the association noted in a monthly report on the balance and predictions of the economic performance of the territory.
Joey Lao, author of the document and leader of the Association, concluded in his analysis that the economic prosperity rates for the last May and June months were, respectively, 6.1 and 5.9, having remained “at a stable level”. In this respect, he highlighted the “continuous recovery” of the game's gross recipes, due to the realization of a series of concerts.
The economist stressed, however, that the residential property price index continued to fall to 200.7 points, while the local resident loan and deposit ratio has dropped to 49.3%, both indicators of historical minimums in the last ten years, which “reflects the difficulty in effectively transforming capital into real economic dynamics”, he noted.
 
Continuous stability
 
Noting that Macao's external situation is “complex and volatile” and that consumer confidence remains weak, Joey Lao believes there are “many uncertainties” for local economic activities in the second half of the year. However, economic perspectives should “remain stable”.
The report said it is expected, in the medium and long term, the decrease in the US dollar interest rate and, on the other hand, there was recently a descent of Hong Kong and Macao interbank interest rates that contributes to reducing financing costs, helping to regain investment market confidence. It is expected that the prosperity rates between July and September are between 5.8 and 5.9 points, the lowest of the last three months, but the “stable” level.
“Macao's economy is in a critical phase of restructuring and development, which requires joint government and market efforts to improve the business environment,” emphasizes the analysis, warning of the need to increase the global competitiveness of the various industries of Macao.</description><pubDate>2025-07-16 02:13:43</pubDate></item><item><title>Rejection of homosexual union may violate law</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/07/16/rejeicao-da-uniao-homossexual-pode-violar-estado-de-direito/</link><description>Hong Kong's government leader promised yesterday to respect the Legislative Council's decision on same -sex recognition of union, but warned that a rejection could violate the rule of law.
John Lee recalled that the Superior Court of Territory gave, in September 2023, two years to the authorities to elaborate rules that guarantee the “fundamental rights” of homosexual couples, such as civil unions.
"The government should not act in violation of the court's decision; otherwise, it will be against the rule of law," the chief executive of the region stressed to journalists. "The rule of law is the basic stone of Hong Kong's economy, investor confidence and its longstanding success. Violating the rule of law will mean serious consequences," John Lee warned.
A legal framework, proposed by the Executive, who intends to recognize certain rights to same-sex couples legally married abroad, goes to the Legislative Council for the first time on Wednesday.
On July 3, most of the interveners in a parliamentary discussion were against. According to the South China Morning Post newspaper, at least 41 of the 90 deputies have already shown the intention to veto the proposal.
John Lee has promised to "respect the final decision" of Parliament, but has ensured that Hong Kong will continue to only allow "the monuting monogamous and heterosexual."
Also on July 3, the founder of the non-governmental organization Hong Kong Mariage Equality ('equality in marriage') assured Lusa that “society is ready”, citing a 2023 study, according to which 60% of the population supports marriage among homosexuals. "The orientation is very conservative and we have a great concern with one of the conditions, which would require couples to first register the union abroad. We believe this is unfair," said Jerome Yau. "If the proposal becomes law, what will be done essentially is to create two classes of same -sex couples, those who got married outside and those who are not married," said Yau, making a strangeness of having to "pay to travel" and marry.
The proposal under discussion will not equate unions to marriage, but merely grant rights in areas such as medical issues, including hospital visits and access to the couple's medical records, as well as post-death provisions.</description><pubDate>2025-07-16 02:12:44</pubDate></item><item><title>Thai Police hold a woman suspected of extorting Buddhist monks</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/07/16/policia-tailandesa-detem-mulher-suspeita-de-extorquir-monges-budistas/</link><description>Thai police yesterday stopped a woman accused of seducing and having sex with Buddhist monks, who demanded money to hide the cases. Wilawan Essawat was detained at home in the province of Nonthaburi, north of Bangcoque, and was accused of extortion, laundering of capital and receiving stolen goods. So far, nine monks have been expelled from temples, for violation of the vote of celibacy, said the Central Investigation Office of the Thai Police. Police said they have located money transferred to Emsawat by a monk from a temple bank account. Before being detained, the woman had admitted, in statements to the Thai media, a relationship with a monk. According to police, Emsawat deliberately chose older monks and received large amounts of several.
The deputy commissioner of the Central Research Office, Jaroonkiat Pankaew, indicated that the investigation began after an abbot abruptly abandoned a Bangkok temple. Researchers later found that the abbot had been blackmailed because of the romantic relationship. Emsawat told the monk in question he was pregnant and asked him to pay 7.2 million Baht (about 190,000 euros) in financial assistance, Pankaew said at a press conference. The Thai media reported that a search for women's mobile phones showed tens of thousands of photographs and videos, as well as numerous records of conversations that indicated intimacy with various monks and could be used for blackmail. Thai Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai ordered the authorities a revision of existing monks and temples laws, especially about the transparency of temple finances, to restore faith in Buddhism, said government spokesman Jirayu Hungsub.</description><pubDate>2025-07-16 02:12:48</pubDate></item><item><title>Analyzed connection between 34 missing gamblers and anti -drug war in the Philippines</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/07/16/analisada-ligacao-entre-34-apostadores-desaparecidos-e-guerra-antidroga-nas-filipinas/</link><description>Philippines are investigating a possible relationship between the disappearance of 34 men linked to bets on rooster fights and extrajudicial executions during former President Duterte's anti-drug war, a lawyer of the victims said yesterday.
The connection between the disappearance and executions within the Anti-Drug War, carried out by Rodrigo Duterte, would reinforce the case before the International Criminal Court against the former president, told the broadcaster Filipina ABS-CBN Kristina Conti, one of the representatives of the victims' families. "It would be an additional evidence. The police, or in particular these death squads were involved in assassinations of activists and other targeted murders," he said.
The case of the 34 Sabungaros -as they are known in the Philippines the fans of the rooster fights -, missing in 2021, has made headlines since one of the accused, Julie Padidongan, said they were killed and then thrown into the lake surrounding the Taal volcano.
Padidongan accused businessman Charlie Ang, involved in lucrative online bets and for those who worked as security, to have ordered the murders, carried out by police officers.
Philippine coastal diver teams continue to search the turbulent volcanic waters, a process that can take months, and has so far recovered several bags with human and animal remains that authorities are analyzing.
The Secretary of Justice, Jesus Crispin Remulla, said on Monday that he was investigating whether police accused of the disappearances were also involved in extrajudicial executions during the Duterte War against the drug. "There are people involved in the murders of the war against drugs and e-sabong [online bets], that's all we can mention for now, but we have to establish clearer connections," he said.
For its part, the presidential palace stressed that it will proceed to an exhaustive investigation into the disappearances, despite the criticism of family members for years of inaction in this case. "This will not be neglected, there will be no cover-up and the investigation will continue; this is what the president [Ferdinand Marcos Jr.] wants," said presidential spokeswoman Claire Castro at a press conference on Friday.</description><pubDate>2025-07-16 02:12:47</pubDate></item><item><title>China's economy grows 5.2% in the second quarter although commercial tension with USA</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/07/16/economia-da-china-cresce-52-no-segundo-trimestre-apesar-de-tensao-comercial-com-eua/</link><description>The Chinese economy grew 5.2%in the second quarter of the year, in homologous terms, according to official data released yesterday, in a context of climbing the trade war with the United States.
 
In view of the previous quarter, the world's second largest economy expanded 1.1%, according to data released by the National Statistics Office (GNE). In the first semester, China Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 5.3%, in homologous terms.
One of the main engines of growth was exports. On Monday, Chinese authorities announced that sales abroad increased 5.8% in June, compared to the same month of the previous year, accelerating the 4.8% registered in May.
Temporary relief from punitive tariffs on Chinese products in the US, as part of the resumption of commercial negotiations between the two countries, led to a sudden increase in orders by companies and consumers.
Chinese companies have also sought to diversify export destinations and reinforce production in other countries as a way to mitigate the impact of the tariffs imposed by Washington. “Generally speaking, with the application of more proactive and effective macroeconomic policies, the national economy maintained stable growth, with good dynamics, demonstrating resilience and vitality,” reads the GNE report.
Despite growth, the data show signs of fragility in internal demand: consumer prices fell 0.1%in the first half of 2025, which highlights persistent deflationary risks in the country.
Chinese leaders have set a 5% growth target for this year, in line with the expansion recorded in 2024. However, the resuming of US tariffs, which can reach 245% if Washington and Beijing do not reach a new trade agreement until August 12, could compromise export recovery-one of the main engines of economic and employment growth.
 
China's industrial production accelerates growth in June to 6.8%
 
China's industrial production increased by 6.8% in June, a percentage point above the amount recorded in May, according to official data released yesterday, far exceeding analysts' predictions, which anticipated a slowdown to 5.6%.
Among the three major sectors analyzed, the largest expansion was recorded in the transforming industry, with a growth of 7.4%. Following are the mining sector (+6.1%) and the production and supply of electricity, heating, gas and water (1.8%). In the accumulated 2025, Chinese industrial production has a rise of 6.4%.
The National Chinese Statistics Office (GNE) also highlighted the strong growth of specific segments in the first half, such as the production of 3D (+43.1%, in homologous terms), electric vehicles (+36.2%) and industrial robots (+35.6%). On the other hand, other indicators released yesterday point to signs of weakness in domestic consumption and investment.
Retail sales, considered a barometer of families consumption, grew only 4.8% in June, retreating from 6.4% in May and being below the forecast of 5.6%.
The official urban unemployment rate remained stable in the 5% for the second consecutive month, in line with expectations.
Investment in fixed assets, in turn, grew 2.8% in the first half, below 3.7% accumulated until May and below stability estimates or slight increase.
By sectors, the investment in the transformative sector rose 7.5%, the infrastructure increased by 4.6%, while the real estate sector worsened the retraction, with a drop of 11.2%, after retreating 10.7%between January and May, reflecting the prolonged crisis of the sector.
Sales of commercial real estate, measures by the area of construction, fell 3.5% in homologous terms until June, the GNE said.
 
In a separate report, the body revealed that the prices of new housing in 70 large cities fell 0.27% between May and June, registering the 25th consecutive month of falls.

China President Xi Jinping and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese gathered yesterday in Beijing with the aim of “boosting the bilateral relationship” in a context of ties between the two countries. "Beijing is willing to collaborate with the Australian part to promote the development of the bilateral relationship and achieve new progress that benefits both peoples," said Xi Jinping before the meeting, according to a statement issued by the Australian government.
Albanese highlighted the advances in cooperation with his main commercial partner and the desire to update the free trade agreement between the two countries, in force since December 2015, despite political and commercial differences. "I thank Australia's opportunity for the opportunity to present the opinions and interests of Australia, as well as our perspective on how to maintain peace, safety, stability and prosperity in our region," said the Australian leader, known for his criticism of the growing Chinese influence on Indo-Pacific.
Albanese's visit to China comes at a time when both Camberra and Beijing seek to diversify their markets, before the high customs imposed by US President Donald Trump.
Relations between the two countries deteriorated between 2018 and 2022, under the previous Australian conservative government, following the request for an international investigation into the origin of COVID-19.

A bilateral meeting scheduled for June, on the sidelines of the G7 Summit in Canada, was canceled at the last minute, and Albanese did not participate in the NATO meeting in the Netherlands.
Relations between the two historical allies cross a sensitive moment due to the US -imposed tariffs on Australian exports of copper, aluminum and steel. In addition, Trump has revised the terms of the Aukus Security Pact, signed in 2021 with the United Kingdom and Australia, as Camberra plans to acquire nuclear propulsion submarines with US technology.

The authorities did not explain why they consider that these candidates are not faithful to MSAR and do not defend the basic law.
 
The Commission of Electoral Affairs of the Legislative Assembly (Caeal) announced yesterday the disqualification of 12 candidates for the elections of September 14. Among them is Ron Lam, who in the 2021 elections had passed in the sieve of the authorities and is deputy of this then.
In addition to Ron Lam, five other candidates from the Synergy Power List: Ian Heng Ut, Che I Kei, Sio Ieng Weng, Chan Chon Meng and Cheong Iek Chong were disqualified. To these, the six candidates from the Popular Liveliod Force List in Macau are added: Alberto Wong, Leong Sio Iok, Che Meng Lam, Chow Chi Fai, Ngai Ka Fong and Fong Kai Hou.
The “patriotism” of the candidates was evaluated by the State Security Defense Commission in recent weeks and yesterday the opinion was sent to Caeal, which made the decision to move away from the race to these 12 residents.
Seng Ioi Man, president of Caeal, recalled that the opinion issued by the State Security Defense Commission is binding, and the targets are not entitled to appeal.
According to the judge, these candidates "do not defend the basic law" or "are not faithful to mashes." For Seng Ioi Man, the legal grounds are “clear and sufficient”, but did not explain which facts led to the disqualification of these candidates. The president of Caeal said that "the opinions and support documents related to the meetings of the State Defense Commission are confidential and cannot be published" not to harm national security. "The data have to remain highly confidential, otherwise they can cause risks to national security," he said, adding that "the State Security Defense Commission is a specialized body of the Government, responsible for national security matters, and should not doubt its authority and specialization."
Asked how the population can know what the limits are if they are not data details about what led to the disqualification of these candidates, Seng Ioi Man repeated that the character of decisions is confidential.
The most recent review of the electoral law, which came into force in April 2024, establishes seven criteria that candidates have to obey: to defend the constitutional order established in the Constitution of the Popular Republic of China and in Basic Law and not organize or participate in activities that have the “intention to overthrow or harm the fundamental system of the State”; Defend unity and territorial integrity of the State; Do not make a collusion with “anti-china” organizations, associations or individuals; Respect the political system consecrated in the Constitution of the Popular Republic of China and in the basic law and not slander or outraged the country or the masters; Respect the competences of the National Popular Assembly and its permanent committee; Do not perform acts against sovereignty and national security or state security; and do not provide assistance or facilitate the practice of the referred acts. Under the authorities, if it is considered that one of the elements of the list does not defend the basic law and masters, the other elements are also excluded.
With the removal of these two lists, there are only six to run for 14 seats in the AL for direct suffrage - never before there have been so few candidacies to the Hemiciclo. The lists that can compete in these elections are: the Macau-Guangdong Union (UMG) of the Jiangmen community; the Association of United Citizens of Macao (ACUM), from the Fujian community; Promoter Union for Progress (UPP), from the General Union of Macao Residents Associations; the Good Home Alliance of the General Association of Macao Women; the Union for Development (UPD), of the Federation of Macao Workers Associations (Faom); and New Hope, from the Macao Public Function Workers Association (ATFPM).
In the 2021 elections, it is recalled, the authorities also disqualified five lists, mostly pro-democracy. This year, the abstention rate was the highest ever in the field: 57%.
 
Ron Lam: “My desire to serve Macau will not change”
 
Ron Lam, a deputy since 2021 and was one of the most active voices in the Hemiciclo, reacted to the removal on social networks saying that he was not notified of the decision by Caeal and that he only knew through the broadcast of the press conference. The synergy power head of the power said he was "quiet" and said, "My desire to serve Macau will not change, I believe the sun always comes after the storm." "At this moment, I can only apologize to all you, I cannot continue to serve you," he lamented.
 
Government expresses “strong support” to Caeal's decision
 
Shortly after the announcement of the removal of the 12 candidates, the Government of the MSAR expressed its "strong support" to Caeal's decision, noting that this "is a correct measure for the full implementation of the fundamental principle" Macau governed by Patriots ". The executive's note stresses that the elections of 14 September “constitute a major political event of sinters” and underlines that “the defense of the basic law and the fidelity to the sabbare of the People's Republic of China are the legal duties and the most fundamental political ethics than deputies to the Legislative Assembly should observe”. “Under the constitutional order established in the Constitution of the People's Republic of China and the Basic Law, people who are part of the mandate's governance structure must be those who firmly love the homeland and Macao,” reads the government's statement. Finally, local authorities say they will "fully guarantee the rights and freedoms that Macao residents enjoy under the law."
 
Connection Office: ALM members must be “convinced patriots”
 
Like the local government, the spokesman for the Central Popular Government Cabinet on the MSAR also expressed its agreement in the face of Caeal's decision. In a statement, the body that represents Beijing in the territory said to “firmly” the decision, justifying that, “as members that make up the government's government structure, members of the MSAR Legislative Assembly must be convinced patriots”. The connection cabinet spokesman stressed that the September 14 elections must "implement the" Macao Patriotas "principle and candidates must comply with the standards of convicts." "We believe that all sectors of society and the population of Macau will certainly defend the rule of law and transmit the fundamental value of 'loving the country and macau'," said the connection office, concluding that "while supporting Caeal in the performance of their duties according to the law, they will actively participate in various electoral activities and jointly perform high quality elections."
 
Alberto Wong stresses that he loves his homeland and macao
 
Alberto Wong, number one on the Liveliod Popular Strength list in Macao, also reacted to disqualification, noting that he only learned of Caeal's decision through the broadcast of the press conference and was not previously notified by the body. In a short statement, Alberto Wong, whose list competed for the first to the elections, said his "posture of loving the country and loving Macau remains unchanged." Moreover, he reiterated that his "loyalty to the Mand remains unchanged." The now disqualified candidate has concluded that he will "try to maintain an optimistic attitude and continue to serve Macau."</description><pubDate>2025-07-16 02:14:42</pubDate></item><item><title>Firefighters record less occurrences in the first half</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/07/16/bombeiros-registam-menos-ocorrencias-no-primeiro-semestre/</link><description>The total number of firefighters' operational actions descended 6.1% in the first half compared to the same period last year. According to data revealed yesterday, the Fire Department organized 307 disclosure activities, 86 lectures and 55 evacuation simulations over the first six months of the year.
 
The Macao Fire Department (CB) revealed yesterday, in a press release, which filed a total of 25,966 cases in the first half of 2025, which represents a 6.1% drop compared to the same period of 2024.
Between January and June this year, the homologous rate of variation decreased in all operational services carried out by firefighters. The total of fire exits fell 10.77% compared to the same year of the previous year, from 455 to 406 cases. Within this number, 321 of the cases - ie 79.06% of the total - corresponded to occurrences that dispensed with the use of hoses (compared to 375 cases in 2024), while 78 were related to burnt food (against 111 cases registered last year).
The CB statement clarifies that, in the first semester, the fires are mainly due to the forgetfulness of lit stingers, the flames not fully extinguished and the burning of incense, candles or votive papers. The short circuits of electrical installations and mechanical or equipment failures were the most frequent reasons, representing 62.81% of fire exits.
Regarding first aid exits, using ambulance, there was a decrease of 819 cases (or 3.53%) compared to the same period last year, and 22,388 occurrences were recorded in the first six months of this year. Firefighters attribute this decrease in the “reduction of cases of slight indisposition, fever and difficulty breathing”. As for output data, the numbers released by CB show a 9.06% decrease in rescue operations from 916 to 833 cases, and 23.96% of special services from 3,076 to 2,339 occurrences.
In the same statement, the CB takes the opportunity to highlight the dissemination and awareness actions it develops “constantly”, with the aim of “strengthening citizens' ability to respond in case of emergency”. According to the data provided, in addition to the 11,715 people who completed the “Fire Safety Training Course”, there was also the participation of 689 people in 18 stages of fire fighting and 15,021 participants in 55 evacuation and incident simulations, performed throughout the first half of the year.

In parallel, “uninterrupted” safety and inspection work in community buildings have been streamlined, counting 4,197 inspections in the period in mind. Guaranteeing the execution of the Dangerous Substance Control Law is another of the main CB outbreaks, which has already performed 3,382 Safety Inspection Actions in industrial buildings, gas stations and food establishments, among others, in order to ensure the safety of storage and the surrounding environment. Regarding sanctioning procedures, 50 cases related to motorcycle parking and the placement of various objects in evacuation paths have been completed.
Considering that Macau is currently found at the time of typhoons, the CB states that it has “actively” coordinating educational activities to disseminate civil protection, “in order to strengthen awareness of security in disaster reduction prevention with community residents”. In June, the authorities performed a simulacrum of evacuation in conjunction with the “relevant services” and the associations and organizations of low zone residents - the most affected by the passage of typhoons.
In a note directed to the general population, the CB appeals to citizens to maintain “good habits” to use electric equipment or gas appliances, always paying attention to “safety consciousness” and “eliminating the risks in order to prevent accidents.” In case of fire or accident, the CB should be informed “as soon as possible” through the aid lines 119, 120 or 28572222.</description><pubDate>2025-07-16 02:12:41</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
