At the meeting, mechanisms were discussed to “deepen collaboration between the police and schools, modernize crime prevention work and, together, guarantee safety in the school environment and the healthy development of young people”.
Sit Chong Meng, director of the PJ, stated, in his speech, that the PJ has been actively implementing the Macao SAR Government's youth policies, adopting the principles of modern policing, and strengthening communication and collaboration with the educational sector and the youth community.
The communication mechanism “Rede de Comunicação com as Escolas”, launched in 2008 and extended to higher education in 2015, has become “an essential platform for collaboration between the police and schools in the prevention of crime”, stated the director of the PJ, highlighting that this mechanism has allowed the “comprehensive implementation of criminal prevention educational campaigns aimed at young people, an effective intervention in situations involving young people, and the creation of a working model such as early prevention, coordinated intervention in situations crisis and post-occurrence follow-up”.
Furthermore, Sit Chong Meng said that, given the “complex challenges of the growing environment and crime that young people are currently facing”, the PJ will adjust its crime prevention strategy based on the principle of problem-centered approach. The aim is to “respond to the concerns of young people and meet their needs, paying particular attention to the increasing risks of exposure to sexual crimes, drugs and fraud”. “Efforts to combat crime will be redoubled, helping young people to develop correct values, to consolidate a civic awareness of respect for the law and to reinforce their capacity for self-protection”, stated the director of the PJ, quoted in the statement.</description><pubDate>2025-10-30 23:40:01</pubDate></item><item><title>All About Macau announces closure due to “increasing pressure and risks”</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/10/30/all-about-macau-anuncia-encerramento-devido-a-crescente-pressao-e-aos-riscos/</link><description>The publication All About Macau, which in recent months was prevented from covering several official events and whose reporters were detained, announced its closure yesterday. The October print edition will be the last and the website and social media will no longer be updated from December 20th. The closure is due to “increasing pressure” and “risks”, says All About Macau.
 
All About Macau, an online newspaper with a monthly paper edition, announced its closure yesterday. The October print edition will be the last to be published. Furthermore, the publication will also stop updating its website and social networks from December 20th of this year. On social media, All About Macau explains that the decision is due to the “increasing pressure and risks” that the newspaper faces.
Remember that All About Macau reporters have been prevented from covering official events since October last year. In April, two reporters from the publication were prevented from entering the plenary room of the Legislative Assembly to provide journalistic coverage of the presentation of the Lines of Government Action, and were later detained by police authorities on suspicion of “disrupting the functioning of bodies in the Macau Special Administrative Region”.
All About Macau also says that, this month, the Social Communication Office (GCS) notified the publication that, according to the Macao SAR press law, the newspaper “no longer meets the legal requirements to carry out activity”. PONTO FINAL asked the GCS if it had, in fact, sent this notification to All About Macau and why it considered that the publication did not meet the legal requirements, but had not received a response by the time this edition was published.
In the statement, All About Macau points out that “it has always depended on limited advertising revenue, reader subscriptions and small donations to maintain its minimal operations”. “Faced with the scarcity of resources, increasing external pressure and the legal proceedings faced by its reporters, the team found it difficult to maintain the quality of its reports and, therefore, had no alternative but to make this difficult decision”, the statement read.
All About Macau began operations in 2010, having started as a weekly newspaper. The website was launched in 2012, followed by the publication of its first monthly printed edition in May of the following year, also maintaining an online news platform.
Describing itself as “one of the few independent media outlets in the city”, All About Macau was committed to “diverse coverage on topics such as social issues, culture and arts, and environmental protection”, reads the post made on social media, which adds: “We have always adhered to journalistic ethics and carried out in-depth investigations when reporting controversial social events, defending justice and pluralistic values”. “All team members remained dedicated to their duties, defending the public’s right to information and freedom of expression guaranteed by the Macau Basic Law, maintaining the professional spirit of journalists, reporting responsibly and moving forward”, highlights All About Macau, thanking readers and asking them to “continue to safeguard civil society, promote pluralism and freedom of expression”.
The newspaper's team also says that it is preparing to launch a book, without revealing any further details. Finally, All About Macau clarifies that readers can continue to make donations through the Patreon platform, with donations being used for the publication of the book, for legal advice and for “possible legal costs”.</description><pubDate>2025-10-30 23:45:57</pubDate></item><item><title>“O desfufador”, by Valério Romão: transformative and “a breath of fresh air”</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/10/30/o-desfufador-de-valerio-romao-transformador-e-uma-lufada-de-ar-fresco/</link><description>Adopting a more comical tone, Valério Romão's new book, “O desfufador”, comes to shake up the current literary panorama. At a launch in Portugal, which featured a presentation by the director of the publishing house Tinta-da-China, Bárbara Bulhosa, and the comedian, Ricardo Araújo Pereira, there was talk about the Portuguese writer's new work, which even includes a chapter on Macau.

“I was a little worried because I hadn't found a good way to present this book, but now I realized that it will be standing up and in the dark, so that I won't even be able to look at my notes”, said the comedian, Ricardo Araújo Pereira, at the launch session of the book “O desfufador”, at the Lisbon nightclub Incógnito, on the 23rd of October, immediately drawing laughter from the audience. With a full house, there was space for a few words from the comedian, the author of the work, the publisher, as well as readings of excerpts from the book, by Paula Cortes, the female voice of the Lisbon Poetry Orchestra project, Gonçalo Waddington, actor, and Rosalina Marshall, poet.
In the first volume of “O desfufador”, with the subtitle “O contagion”, the action takes place in an apocalyptic world caused by a “Great blackout”, an event that turned off the electrical systems for half an hour. Its protagonists are Alejandro, who embarks on a cruise, leaves Lisbon in a strange world and meets Alex, a revolutionary dwarf, as well as Hélder, a conspiratorial sociologist, and Catarina, a woman in search of a mysterious man.
“It is a book that I consider transformative, absolutely necessary and a great breath of fresh air in Portuguese or Portuguese-language literature”, said Bárbara Bulhosa, founder and current director of the publishing house Tinta-da-China.

A surreal idea
 
The first time Valério told him about the book, they were both in Brazil, for a literary meeting, and Ricardo Araújo Pereira thought it was a joke. “I'm writing a novel in which a dwarf has an intimate relationship with a dolphin, then there is a huge blackout that gives rise to an epidemic of lesbianism, and there is a man, who is the bastard son of Julio Iglesias, operating the blackout”, the author told him, at that time. In Incógnito, with the mission of presenting Valério Romão's novel, the comedian confessed his difficulty in the task. “It has to do with its bizarreness, but also with the fact that I want to preserve your sensation when you open it and read it,” he said.
Leafing through the pages of “O desfufador”, the comedian refers to the “sources of comedy in this absolutely hilarious book”, highlighting the importance of the narrator’s personality and the way he expresses himself. “The fact that he has a vocabulary that is typical of the tavern, but of the Grémio Literário tavern, this produces a comical effect”, he says, referring to placing two such antagonistic characteristics side by side.
In addition to the narrator, the writer also praises the “vividness of the language”, which makes it seem like “you are on a boat going down rapids”, also declaring that it is a “viscerally Portuguese” book, which will lead to some difficulties when trying to translate it into other languages.
At the end of the presentation, he reflected on the beginning of the book. “It’s a curse from João César Monteiro [Portuguese director], which is at the origin of the ailment that afflicts the first character [Alex]”, he says. “I don’t know what methods Valério Romão uses to invent these characters and this plot, but I imagine that some are forged right here in this room [Incógnito]”, he concluded, once again making the audience laugh.
For his part, Valério Romão wanted to first thank his partner, Paula Cortes, and then highlight the publisher's boldness and madness. “Thank you to Bárbara [Bulhosa], because only a crazy person like her could accept [publishing]”, she recalls. Aware that the title may bother some, Valério responds: “Within this whole story of what can or cannot be said, people forget one fundamental thing: what can or cannot be said, after reading.”
The session continued with readings of excerpts from the book, by Gonçalo Waddington, actor, Paula Cortes, who is part of some professional poetry recitation projects, and poet Rosalina Marshall. It is worth remembering that Valério Romão was in Macau, at the invitation of the Literary Festival, to present his poetry book “Mais uma disilusão”, as well as Paula Cortes, who participated in the event, as part of the Lisbon Poetry Orchestra.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Taiwan's new opposition leader rejects raising defense spending to 5% of GDP</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/10/30/nova-lider-da-oposicao-em-taiwan-rejeita-subir-despesa-com-defesa-para-5-do-pib/</link><description>The new opposition leader rejected the Taiwan Government's proposal to increase defense spending to 5% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 2030, in the face of growing tensions with China.
Cheng Li-wun said on Wednesday that the island needs a “reasonable defense budget”, as “excessive” military spending could compromise public finances, reported Taiwanese public news agency CNA.
Cheng will assume the presidency of the Kuomintang (KMT) on Saturday, after winning the primaries of the largest opposition party, with more than 50% of the votes.
The former Taiwanese Government spokesperson (2012-2014) highlighted that Taiwan “is not an ATM” and stressed that defense spending should not increase indefinitely nor fuel an “endless arms race”.
In August, the Government proposed increasing the military budget to 949.5 billion Taiwan dollars (26.7 billion euros) in 2026, corresponding to 3.32% of GDP, and gradually increasing it to 5% of GDP by 2030.
The increase, which includes the development of a new advanced air defense system, is aimed at countering growing military pressure from China and sending a clear message to Washington that Taipei is serious about defending the island.
However, this will require approval from Parliament, currently controlled by a majority of lawmakers from the KMT and its ally, the Taiwan People's Party, who oppose the political agenda of government leader William Lai.
Executive spokeswoman Karen Kuo said on Wednesday that Cheng's position was incompatible with that of democratic countries, adding that the increase in defense spending aims to "maintain Taiwan's democratic and free status quo." Cheng Li-wun later reiterated opposition to any defense budget that “has no upper limit” and urged William Lai to be “more cautious and wise” in relations with Beijing to prevent Taiwan from being “dragged into an unnecessary conflict.”
After winning the KMT's internal elections, Cheng said he was available to meet with Chinese leader Xi Jinping to resolve differences and promote cooperation between Taiwan and mainland China. Cheng did not rule out the possibility of visiting mainland China: “I am willing to do any work and meet with anyone necessary,” he declared, rejecting, however, that the KMT would adopt a pro-reunification position under his leadership.
After Cheng's victory, Xi Jinping sent him a congratulatory message, in which he expressed the hope that the KMT and the Chinese Communist Party will “strengthen their common political foundation” and unite “the vast majority of the Taiwanese people to deepen exchanges and cooperation, boost joint development and move towards national reunification”.</description><pubDate>2025-10-30 23:38:13</pubDate></item><item><title>Lusofonia Festival</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/10/30/festival-da-lusofonia/</link><description>And, in the blink of an eye, we are in Autumn again. Autumn in Macau is both nostalgic and comforting. The temperature range of the days increases and, consecutively, we finally manage to make use of the light knitted jackets that are at the mercy of moths in the wardrobes for more than half the year. With Autumn also comes the Lusophony Festival, which has been held annually since 1998 and which, in addition to the host Macau and the famous Portugal, has the participation of nine other Lusophone communities present in the region: Angola, Brazil, Cape Verde, Goa, Damão and Diu, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, São Tomé and Príncipe and Timor-Leste. A breath of fresh air for Macau's Portuguese-speaking community!
The picturesque area of ​​colonial houses on the island of Taipa is the setting for dozens of exhibitors from different communities. There we can enjoy traditional snacks, delicacies and drinks, appreciate typical costumes, art and even purchase genuine handicrafts.
Every year, with the exception of pandemic years, the stage is filled with guest artists from Portuguese-speaking countries. The audience, with an insatiable thirst for Portuguese-speaking culture, vibrates with emotion at each show. The fierce crowd at the table football championship, the lively audience at the samba parade, the delirious crowd of people at the capoeira circle and the endless queue for caipirinhas, are examples of what is never missing from this festival. Lusofonia is also a meeting point for friends and acquaintances. In a single weekend it is possible to catch up on a year of disagreements. We didn't agree to go to Lusofonia, we simply met at Lusofonia.</description><pubDate>2025-10-30 23:35:20</pubDate></item><item><title>“Macau, for a Westerner, always has a surreal aspect”</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/10/30/macau-para-um-ocidental-tem-sempre-um-aspecto-de-surreal/</link><description>The premise of “O desfufador” is comical-absurd: there is an epidemic of lesbianism and there is a main character who comes to fight it. In conversation with PONTO FINAL, writer Valério Romão, who has come to the territory so many times, talks about his most recent book. Among comments about the idea, the comical tone it had to engender and the various characters that populate this surreal universe, there was also talk about Macau and its inclusion in one of the chapters.

It is a story that starts from an epidemic of lesbianism. How did the idea come about?
I once read an article about a dancing epidemic, in Strasbourg, in 1518, and I was fascinated by the idea that there could be epidemics of behavior or personality, and not exactly viral or bacteriological or with any type of pathogen involved. I thought: to take this to the absurd, it was a lesbian epidemic.

How, from this main idea of ​​the pandemic, do these comic-surreal characters and plot evolve?
It started with this idea and then trying to find a tone to write this, because the comic tone was quite different. I was used to it, or I thought I was already more or less swearing in the absurd tone, but the comic was new. It was about finding a tone for this and then trying to understand which characters existed. From then on, I started to get excited and this was supposed to be just one book and, after all, it ended up being two. One is a kind of 'origin story' (as they would say at Marvel) — where the characters come from, how they gained their power or whatever — and another that begins when the epidemic is underway.

When will this second book be ready?
Ideally it should be released next year, but it depends. It's multifactorial. It depends on many things, the most important of which is money. This is something that takes time to do.
 
But has the writing already started?
Not yet, I'm resting from this first one.

The chosen theme and title are somewhat controversial and will probably give rise to some comments. What do you respond to less positive reviews that may exist?
When you publish a book with a title like that, it's also a provocation, but it's not just that. What can I say to people who have some kind of sensitivity to the title? Until now, I have not been asked this question, unfortunately. I don't know what else I have to do to be canceled [irony], but obviously it hasn't arrived. People who don't want to read, don't read.

How do you deconstruct this pre-made idea that people might have just by seeing the title? Just read?
That's a bit of it. When you see a title like “Salò or the 120 days of Sodom”, it’s not exactly the most neutral thing in the world either. Much longer ago, “The Flowers of Evil” [by Charles Baudelaire], just because of the title, people might not have been reassured about the content. The truth is that, regardless of the artistic value it may have — and I, nor our contemporaries, will not be able to definitively judge its value, time will do so — if you are in a profession that is writing and you are afraid of what others will think, you might as well not be. You can't please everyone.

Is the act of writing itself a major exhibition?
It's already a big exhibition, because there is criticism — there are people who will say bad things, there are people who will criticize everything and anything. If we go on the side of caution, we are not doing literature a great service.

Returning to the comic tone, was it difficult to find that record?
It was very difficult at the beginning and I had several false starts. I sent a lot of documents for recycling, but then, when I found it, it was more trouble than difficult, because by then I already knew what I wanted.

Are these rather surreal characters in the book inspired by real people?
I stole Alex from Alface [João Alfacinha da Silva] in the book “Cá vai Lisboa”, which has an Alex, who is a dwarf, and who has several similarities with this character. This was clearly stolen from Alface. Otherwise, it was more or less invented, stealing here and there elements that were mine or those of people around me, because it's easier not to invent everything and it's more realistic.

There is a chapter dedicated to Macau. How does territory come into this story?
I wouldn't say to pay homage, because it's too short to be a tribute, but, by going there so many times, and being, in a way, part of my life, and being a foreign body in the imagination of Portuguese people who haven't been there or don't know, to give a little perspective, from someone who could go there, like Catarina, the character who is in Macau, for the first time, and give a description, more or less humorous, or from a very distant point of view, of what the streets, the people, the customs are like.

Does Macau, considering the spirit of the book, absurd-comic, fit into this line of action?
Yes. Catarina also ends up passing through Paris and writing things when she is in Paris and the tone is much more normal and standardized. Macau and, above all, much of Asia and Southeast Asia, for a Westerner, always has an absurd or surreal aspect, due to cultural differences and customs. In this case, when you take a Chinese territory and add the layer of casinos and gambling, then it becomes even more surreal.

Of the comments you have heard from people who have read, are there some that stand out?
I'm glad I'm not being a pushover. With that title and that premise, people go into reading it with less reservations than they thought and end up, from what I've heard, liking it a lot and I'm happy with that. On the other hand, I feel sad, because I would also like to have some 'hate mail' or some more or less shameless things, in messages on social networks or email, but it hasn't happened. The second will be more open.

In this, the reader is contextualized. In the second, what can we expect?
It's a massacre. In the second, the lesbian epidemic materializes and then it's all about dealing with it, plus the idea of ​​the defuser, which is that character who, just by appearing, is capable of sexually reorienting any woman, whatever she may be. It will be much more controversial. The first introduces the slipper controversy, due to the title and theme, and the second goes into full BDSM.

How long did it take to complete this first book? Was it written at night, during the day?
During the day, because I'm not old enough to write at night. It's something to be done, after the structure is aligned, in perhaps eight months.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>FC Porto with a difficult task against Braga, Sporting and Benfica on the lookout</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/10/30/fc-porto-com-tarefa-dificil-perante-o-braga-sporting-e-benfica-a-espreita/</link><description>On Sunday, FC Porto faces the second consecutive test of Minho's leadership of the Portuguese Football League, when they host Sporting de Braga on the 10th round, which can be taken advantage of by the pursuers Sporting and Benfica.

The two-time national champion plays at home against Alverca, this Friday, three days after beating the Ribatejos 5-1, in the League Cup, but the reds will have a predictably more arduous task on Saturday, at Vitória de Guimarães' home.
With eight wins and just one draw (0-0 against Benfica), FC Porto has a three-point advantage over Sporting, second placed, and four over the 'reds', who are in the middle of the electoral process, with Rui Costa, current president, and João Noronha Lopes competing for leadership of the club in the second round, on November 8th.
The team coached by the Italian Francesco Farioli will face the second of three opponents from Minho in a row, after having come from behind at Moreirense to prevail by conceding 2-1, in the previous round, and before visiting Famalicão, in the next round.
In theory, the 'arsenalistas' will be the most complicated of the three, despite only occupying seventh place, behind Famalicão (fifth) and Moreirense (sixth), and only last Sunday they broke a series of six consecutive games without winning in the championship, with a 4-0 home defeat to Casa Pia, plus a creditable 1-1 draw in Alvalade.
When they enter the field, the 'dragons' may even be joined by Sporting at the top of the I Liga, as the 'lions' kick off their journey against Alverca, the team they defeated on Tuesday at the José Alvalade Stadium, in the quarter-finals of the League Cup, with an alternative formation.
Coach Rui Borges should promote the return of the usual starters for the second clash in a row with Alverca, 12th in the I Liga, including Colombian Luis Suárez, second top scorer in the competition, with seven goals, only surpassed by the Greek Vangelis Pavlidis, Benfica forward and scorer of eight accurate shots.
The Lisbon rival, one of the two undefeated teams in the championship, along with FC Porto, will not expect an easy trip to Guimarães, where Vitória has not yet tasted defeat (they have two wins and two draws), despite the 'reds' performance away from home being close to perfection, with three wins and a draw, relatively tasty, at Estádio do Dragão.
Benfica found some stability with the replacement of Bruno Lage by José Mourinho as coach, but good performances took a while to appear, as happened on Wednesday, in the 3-0 victory over Tondela, in the quarter-finals of the League Cup, setting up a meeting in the semi-finals with Sporting de Braga, who beat Santa Clara 5-0.
The Azoreans, who occupy ninth place in the I League, close the round on Monday, at the stronghold of Gil Vicente, sensational fifth placed, which Famalicão and Moreirense will try to put under threat when they visit, respectively, Nacional (10th placed), on Saturday, and Arouca (13th), on Sunday.

Only with consensus between society, family and school, responds DSEDJ</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/10/30/mais-ferias-para-alunos-so-com-consenso-entre-sociedade-familia-e-escola-responde-a-dsedj/</link><description>In a written statement, deputy Che Sai Wang had suggested reducing students' teaching load and adding more vacation periods throughout the year, particularly in spring and autumn. The authorities ruled out this possibility, justifying that this would require reviewing the “students’ travel needs” and taking into account the schedules of those in charge of education.

Che Sai Wang argued, in a written statement sent to the Government, that students should have more vacation periods throughout the academic year, in order to rest properly and improve their mental health. The deputy suggested another vacation period in the spring and another in the autumn. However, in its response, the Directorate of Education and Youth Development Services (DSEDJ) closed the door to the possibility.
“Experiences obtained in various regions in the interior of China demonstrate that it is necessary to consider the travel needs of students, also take into account the schedule of guardians, as well as coordinate well with their vacation regime, which is why it is necessary to reach a consensus between society, the family and the school”, responded the authorities, adding that they will continue to pay attention to “suggestions for optimizing the educational system”.
The deputy linked to the Association of Public Service Workers of Macau (ATFPM) said, in the interpellation, that “in the middle and before the end of the school period, students feel mentally exhausted, lose concentration and the pace of learning, and some even suffer from excessive psychological pressure, which affects their physical and mental development”. Che Sai Wang warned that winter and summer holidays alone are insufficient to “adjust the pace of learning”.
In its response, the Government began by indicating that it “continuously collects information on the performance and pressure felt by students in learning” and, according to the results of the respective studies, “the educational system of non-higher education in Macau was recognized for its quality of continuous excellence and equity by international organizations”.
Regarding student needs, DSEDJ says that, in the 2025/2026 academic year, there was an increase of more than 20 student counseling agents, bringing the total counseling team to more than 410 members. In addition, a 24-hour student counseling hotline and online consultation platform were launched, “allowing students and young people to share their feelings with career counseling agents, without the need to reveal their personal details”.
On the other hand, current curriculum legislation allows schools to define the school calendar for themselves, as long as they carry out, in each school year, teaching activities for no less than 195 days. “Schools can, according to their pedagogical characteristics and students’ development needs, autonomously organize specific school days in the school year, the schedule of their educational activities and students’ holidays”, explain the authorities.</description><pubDate>2025-10-30 23:47:31</pubDate></item><item><title>Review of the Master Plan should be completed in the first half of next year</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/10/30/revisao-do-plano-director-deve-ser-concluida-no-primeiro-semestre-do-proximo-ano/</link><description>The Directorate of Land and Urban Construction Services (DSSCU) has progressed with the periodic assessment of the implementation of the Macao SAR Master Plan (2020-2040), the results of which should be published in the first half of next year.
Lai Weng Leong, director of DSSCU, revealed that the work also includes the possible need to make changes to the Master Plan, due to the launch of four “iconic and important works projects”, a plan announced by the Government of Sam Hou Fai.
Quoted by Ou Mun Newspaper, Lai Weng Leong, who spoke yesterday on the sidelines of a plenary meeting of the Urban Planning Council (CPU), said that he has already started preliminary analyzes for the periodic review, having also presented the work to CPU members.
It is recalled that the four iconic and important construction projects comprise the Macau International Education (University) City and Hengqin, an integrated international tourist and cultural district of Macau, a Macau International Air Transport Hub on the west bank of the Pearl River, and an industrial park for research and development of science and technology in Macau.
Lai Weng Leong emphasized that the periodic evaluation report only addresses the implementation status of the Master Plan, but does not directly predict changes or the start of change procedures.
According to the official, if changes to the Master Plan are necessary, a separate review process will be carried out and, if the issue is subsequently submitted to the CPU for consideration, the process will be conducted openly to the public.
On the other hand, the Sociedade para o Desenvolvimento dos Parques Industriais de Macau, Limitada declared the withdrawal of the concession of land next to Rua do Parque Industrial and Avenida do Parque Industrial, announced yesterday in an order published in the Official Bulletin. The land, which has an assigned value of 1.1 billion patacas, was reverted to the State to become part of its private domain.
Lai Weng Leong explained that it was a “voluntary return” of the company and the industrial buildings on the plot were also transferred, free of charge, to Government administration, with registration in the property system of the Directorate of Finance Services.
The official said that, in the short term, the land and buildings will maintain their current use, and the Government does not yet have a definitive plan regarding adjustments to the land's purpose or the designation of the site as reserve land.</description><pubDate>2025-10-30 23:40:52</pubDate></item><item><title>China's Fourth Plenary Session and its Political-Economic and Military Implications</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/10/30/a-quarta-sessao-plenaria-da-china-e-as-suas-implicacoes-politico-economicas-e-militares/</link><description>The four-day Fourth Plenary Session of the 20th Central Committee (CC) of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) lasted from October 20 to 23 and released a statement on the 23rd, pointing out various directions for China's economic modernization and endorsing some personnel measures for the CC and the Central Military Commission (CMC).
According to the Xinhua agency (October 24, 2025), participants heard and debated a report presented by the General Secretary of the CPC, Xi Jinping, on the work of the Politburo. They deliberated and adopted the Central Committee's recommendations for formulating the 15th Five-Year Plan for China's economic and social development, from 2026 to 2030. This five-year plan will be important as it is expected to lay the foundation for China's pursuit of socialist modernization by 2035.
The statement reaffirmed “Comrade Xi Jinping's central position in the Party Central Committee and the Party as a whole, and the establishment of the guiding role of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era (Xinhua, October 24, 2025).”
The statement also reiterated the Party's overall leadership in China's economic development. He highlighted the importance of prioritizing the interests of the people with high-quality development, the need to deepen reforms, promoting a dynamic relationship between an efficient government and an effective market, and maintaining development and security.
The main elements of China's socioeconomic development, according to the statement, are as follows:
First, China should strengthen its scientific and technological self-sufficiency while pushing forward the process of comprehensive reform. Society must progress culturally and ethically, improve the quality of life, promote the initiative to build a Beautiful China and consolidate national security.
Second, China must build a modern industrial system and strengthen the foundations of the economy.
Third, the country must achieve greater self-sufficiency in science and technology and direct the development of new high-quality productive forces.
Fourthly, it must build a robust internal market and foster a new development model much more quickly.
Fifth, China should develop a high-standard socialist market economy, boost high-quality development and promote a high-standard opening-up process, aiming to create a win-win scenario.
Sixth, it should accelerate agricultural and rural modernization and promote the revitalization of the countryside.
Seventh, regional development, cooperation and coordination must be improved. Eighth, the creativity of all ethnic groups needs to be stimulated and revitalized so that all people can enjoy prosperity together.
Ninth, the economy and society must become green and environmentally friendly so that Beautiful China becomes a reality.
Tenth, China must continue to modernize its national security system and national defense, and achieve the centenary goals of modernizing the People's Liberation Army (PLA). In this way, the objective of establishing a peaceful China will be achieved.
The plenary session also decided to add Zhang Shengmin as vice chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC). In addition, vacancies on the Commission will be filled by alternate members Yu Huiwen, Ma Hancheng, Wang Jian, Wang Xi, Wang Yonghong, Wang Tingkai, Wang Xinwei, Wei Tao, Deng Yiwu, Deng Xiuming and Lu Hong.
The plenary session adopted the report of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, which stated that Tang Renjian, Jin Xiangjun, Li Shisong, Yang Fasen and Zhu Zhisong violated party discipline.
The session also deliberated and adopted the inspection report of the Central Military Commission (CMC) on violations of party discipline and state laws involving military generals such as He Weidong, Miao Hua, He Hongjun, Wang Xiubin, Lin Xiangyang, Qin Shutong, Yuan Huazhi, Wang Chunning and Zhang Fengzhong.
The session confirmed the Politburo's decision to expel Hei Weidong, Miao Hua, Tang Renjian, Jin Xiangyang, Qin Shutong, Yuan Huazhi, Wang Chunning, Li Shisong, Yang Fasen, Zhu Zhisong and Zhang Fengzhong from the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).

Implications for Hong Kong and Macau

The statement contains a brief paragraph about Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. It states that Mainland China will promote the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong and Macau. Furthermore, the peaceful development of cross-strait relations will be promoted, while the task of reunifying the motherland will be further promoted. China will promote the process of establishing a common destiny for humanity, which means that peace and sustainable development will continue to be global initiatives of the Chinese government.
The main emphases of the 4th Plenum have direct relevance for Hong Kong and Macau. As special administrative regions of mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau should develop scientific and technological progress, such as Hong Kong's use of the Northern Metropolis as a high-tech hub for its future development, and Macau's closer cooperation with Hengqin to develop Information Technology (IT), moving away from its traditional dependence on casino-driven capitalism. The economic base of Hong Kong and Macau should be strengthened, with the former based on financial and monetary development, while the latter diversifies its economy into areas such as securities and bond development, convention and exhibition centers, and a hub for Chinese medicine and cruise tourism. Both Hong Kong and Macau seek to develop high-quality productive forces, with better IT and Artificial Intelligence infrastructures and more robust software, aiming to attract more talent from mainland China to the two cities. Therefore, the regional integration of Hong Kong and Macau in the Greater Bay Area is necessary to reinforce the competitiveness and quality of the two cities' productive forces.
Although Hong Kong and Macau have already strengthened their national security systems through the enactment of their national security laws, related legal reforms and their implementation, their governments seek to improve the environment and involve ethnic groups and their members in more active participation in society.
The statement has brief relevance to the issue of Taiwan, whose peaceful reunification with mainland China remains the ultimate objective of the 4th Plenum. In fact, cross-strait interactions are maintained constantly, even though official contacts between mainland China and Taiwan have deteriorated and practically ceased since the election of Tsai Ing-wen as president of Taiwan in 2016. Still, mainland Chinese authorities have stated that, following the recent election of Cheng Li-wen as the new chairman of the opposition Kuomintang (Nationalist Party), they are willing to promote exchanges with the KMT under the consensus of 1992. Thus, it becomes crystal clear that the CCP is still committed to resolving the issue of Taiwan's future peacefully.

Personnel Changes and Political Implications

The approval of Zhang Shengmin as vice chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC) by the plenary means that the Armed Forces are maintaining their anti-corruption campaign to root out corrupt elements and bad elements, aiming to improve the fighting capacity of the People's Liberation Army (PLA). For the CMC, improving the PLA's combat capability is a necessary step to protect China's territorial integrity and national security. Zhang Shengmin is deputy secretary of the Central Committee for Discipline Inspection and a general in the Rocket Force, previously plagued by corruption scandals. Thus, his role as CMC Vice Chairman is politically and militarily significant, working hand in hand not only with CMC Vice Chairman Zhang Youxia, but also under the leadership of CMC Chairman Xi Jinping to combat military corruption and improve the combat capability of the PLA, especially the Rocket Force. Zhang Shengmin is also expected to strengthen all procurement procedures and ethical conduct within the Armed Forces and ensure the integrity of the PLA's top leadership.
Before the plenum, rumors circulated outside China that one or two of the positions of the Chinese president, the CPC general secretary and even the CMC presidency could change. It turns out that Xi Jinping continues to occupy the three important positions, dispelling the rumors. As President Xi will meet with US President Donald Trump in South Korea next week to discuss a range of issues, including China's control of rare earth exports and Washington's threat to increase tariffs on Chinese products, the CCP needs to stabilize Beijing's political summit to form a united front against the Americans at the negotiating table.
After all, from now until the 21st Party Congress, more young CPC members will be prepared to take on high-level positions in the Central Committee, the Politburo and even the Politburo Standing Committee. Therefore, it can be predicted that internal politics and discussions will continue until the 2027 Party Congress, which will witness more leadership changes. In short, succession planning is underway, but observers outside mainland China have exaggerated and overestimated the extent of personnel changes in the Fourth Plenum.
What draws attention is the composition of the eleven new members of the Central Committee. Eighty-four percent of the members of the Central Committee (168 of the 205 effective members) attended the plenary session. Ten members of the Central Committee were expelled from the Chinese Communist Party, probably due to corruption issues. Interestingly, when eleven members were added to the Central Committee, their names were ranked higher than seven Central Committee members, four of whom are military generals. News reports in Hong Kong claimed that the reasons why the new members of the Central Committee “overtook” seven existing members were unknown. Furthermore, the eleven new members of the Central Committee come from different provinces, cities and departments nationwide, demonstrating a variety of knowledge and experiences, without any fixed factional grouping. Therefore, the selection of eleven new Central Committee (CC) members seemed strategic, leaving the remaining vacancies to be filled later, during the transition to the 2027 Party Congress.
Speculatively, the eleven newly elected CC members were more popular than seven members, some of whom might be considered less competent by voters. The CC has a total of 376 members, of which 205 are full members and 171 are substitutes. Absences at the plenary session represented 16%, implying that some were being investigated on corruption charges, while others were simply expelled from the PCC after investigation and revelation of their corrupt acts. In short, the party discipline of CC members needs to be reinforced in the current transition to the 21st Party Congress, which perhaps explains the fact that only eleven members were elected as members. The fight against corruption will likely be a persistent crusade as long as Xi Jinping remains supreme leader of the presidency, the CCP and the Central Military Commission (CMC). Meanwhile, a more cautious approach to the selection of new Coordination Committee members was adopted at the plenary session.

Conclusion

The Fourth Plenary Session of the CPC endorsed the basic principles of the 15th Five-Year Plan direction, with important implications for Hong Kong and Macau. The upcoming policy speech by the Chief Executives of Hong Kong and Macau, along with their financial budgets, is expected to reflect the plenary's main emphases applicable to the two cities. Specifically, the development of IT, regional cooperation, regional coordination with the Greater Bay Area (Hong Kong with Shenzhen, Macau with Hengqin), the consolidation of the economic base and the development of high-quality productive forces are imperative for Hong Kong and Macau. The emphasis on peaceful reunification with Taiwan is a positive sign, simultaneously coinciding with mainland China's display of cordiality to Cheng Li-wen, the newly elected chairman of the Kuomintang in Taiwan. The selection of Zhang Shengmin as the new vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission is a politically and militarily significant move, indicating the continuation of the anti-corruption campaign within the People's Liberation Army. Last but not least, before the meeting between President Xi Jinping and President Trump in South Korea, maintaining political stability and leadership, as well as the importance of political unity, became central themes at the CPC's fourth plenary session. From now until the 21st Party Congress, we can expect a gradual process of reforms, step-by-step personnel changes and progressive leadership succession. Thus, the fourth plenary session had great political importance in the era of President Xi Jinping.</description><pubDate>2025-10-30 23:34:12</pubDate></item><item><title>Government studies daycare services for children aged 2 years and under</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/10/30/governo-estuda-servico-de-creches-para-criancas-com-idade-igual-ou-inferior-a-2-anos/</link><description>The Government will study the possibility of daycare services for children aged 2 years and under. There are currently 7,700 places in daycare centers, a number that already meets the demand for children up to 3 years old in Macau. The Social Action Institute guarantees that it will improve services and added that there are 22 local daycare centers providing urgent or temporary child care services to help parents with urgent needs.
The need and possibility of daycare services for children aged 2 years and under will be analyzed by the authorities, with a view to providing adequate support for families with children.
The Institute of Social Action (IAS) revealed that there are now around 7,700 places in local nurseries, representing 69% of the population under the age of 3. The number shows that the offer of places for children aged between 2 and 3 years old already corresponds to the entire population in this age group, stated the organization, thus opening up the possibility of extending the service to younger children.
In response to a written question from Ngan Iek Hang, in which the deputy questioned the improvement of the childcare environment, the IAS also said that it is preparing the development plan for daycare services for the next five years. Having collected, between June and August, opinions from entities managing subsidized daycare centers, the organization said it intends to enact the plan later this year.
According to current provisions in Macau, daycare centers generally allow the enrollment of children under the age of 4, with the majority of minor users being between 2 and 3 years of age.
According to the IAS, families do not necessarily have to place their children in daycare if there is childcare at home, but if parents wish to improve their children's capacity for personal autonomy, coexistence and social adaptability, they can consider placing them in daycare when they are 2 years old, “which is a preferable solution for their physical and mental development”, he analyzed.
"In general, children over the age of 2 will have the ability to adapt to collective child care services, especially the ability to deal with the fear of separation. At the same time, the health of children over the age of 2 will also be more stable and the ability to resist disease will also be greater," he pointed out.
The issue of allowing children aged 2 years or less to opt out of the daycare service had already been addressed by some deputies in the past, due to the fact that many families have both parents working.
On the other hand, in the same response, the IAS stated that, until September this year, there were a total of 22 daycare centers that provided urgent or temporary child care services in Macau, whose service fee was charged for a full day or half day. The service can “help guardians with urgent needs and who require temporary care support to provide care to children for a short period of time”, he highlighted.
The IAS assured that it will maintain “close communication” with daycare centers regarding requests for services, the evaluation process, and methods of charging fees, to address the various possibilities for improving services.
However, the organization added that the recipients of urgent or temporary child care services in daycare centers continue to be children who do not reach 4 years of age, ruling out the possibility of expanding the age ranges of recipients. “It is considered that children of different age groups have different physiological or care needs, and taking care of children of school age and those in daycare centers must consider factors such as care needs and safety risks”, he explained.
With regard to home safety, the IAS highlights that it has been cooperating with social facilities, including daycare centers, to raise awareness among guardians about the importance of children's safety at home, using infographics and educational videos. The IAS, furthermore, indicated that it will promote, in the future, social facilities to use “diverse ways” to disseminate information about child care, in order to help guardians obtain knowledge and ways of caring for and training children.</description><pubDate>2025-10-30 23:46:48</pubDate></item><item><title>Xi says he has reached consensus with Trump and calls for a speedy conclusion</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/10/30/xi-diz-ter-chegado-a-consensos-com-trump-e-apela-a-conclusao-celere/</link><description>Chinese President Xi Jinping said yesterday that he had reached consensus during the meeting with his North American counterpart, Donald Trump, and called for the “finalization as soon as possible” of the results of the negotiations. “We had an incredible meeting”, said the North American President.

“The economic and trade teams of China and the United States held in-depth discussions and reached consensus on solutions to problems,” said Xi, quoted by the official Chinese news agency Xinhua.
“The two teams must now improve and complete the follow-up work as quickly as possible (…) and present concrete results, in order to reassure the economies of China, the United States and the world,” he added.
Trump and Xi concluded yesterday a bilateral meeting lasting around two hours at an air base in Busan, in the south of South Korea, marked by promises of cooperation, gestures of detente in the trade war and an agreement for a new meeting in 2026.
Trump announced that, following the meeting, he will reduce the tariffs he imposed this year on China from 20% to 10% in response to its role in fentanyl trafficking.
China and the United States have reached a consensus on anti-drug cooperation and expanded trade in agricultural goods, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce announced, after the meeting between the Presidents of the two countries. A spokesperson for the Ministry indicated that the agreement also includes the “management of individual cases involving certain companies”, without specifying which ones, can be read in a statement published on the institution's portal.
“We had an incredible meeting,” declared the Republican, aboard Air Force One, on his way back to Washington. “I believe they will help us with fentanyl,” he said, referring to commitments made by Beijing. Also according to Trump, an agreement was reached for China to resume purchasing North American soybeans, suspended since May in the context of the trade war between the two countries. The issue has particular political weight for Trump, who has strong support among rural US voters.
The North American leader also said that he will meet Xi Jinping again in April 2026, this time on Chinese territory. The Chinese Government avoided confirming the visit of the President of the United States, Donald Trump, to China in April of next year, after the North American leader stated, following the meeting with Xi Jinping, that they both agreed to this meeting. “What I can say is that both heads of state agreed to maintain regular exchanges,” said Chinese diplomacy spokesman Guo Jiakun yesterday, during a press conference in Beijing.
Guo indicated that Trump “expects to visit China early next year” and that he “invited Chinese President Xi Jinping to visit the United States soon”, without providing further details.
In accordance with usual practice, Chinese authorities do not usually announce visits by foreign heads of state – nor trips by Chinese leaders abroad – until close to the respective date.
The meeting between Trump and Xi, the first since the Republican leader returned to power, took place at the Gimhae air base, in the South Korean city of Busan, and lasted for around two hours.
During the meeting, Xi called on Washington to focus on a logic of long-term cooperation, warning against the risk of “falling into a vicious circle of reprisals”, after several months of worsening trade tensions between the world's two largest economies.

One-year suspension of restrictions on rare earths

China announced the suspension, for one year, of restrictions on exports of rare earths and other strategic materials, following consensus reached with the United States. Reciprocally applied port taxes were also suspended for one year. The measures in question had been adopted on October 9, in the context of the trade war between the two countries, and covered a group of essential minerals for industries such as electronics, defense or electric vehicles, whose global processing is dominated by China.
In response to these obstacles, US President Donald Trump threatened to apply a new 100% tax on Chinese products from November 1st, pressure that was eventually withdrawn after the summit with Xi Jinping. “China will suspend the application of the export control measures in question, announced on October 9, for a year, and will study and improve specific plans”, announced the Ministry of Commerce, in a statement.
Trump declared, after meetings with his Chinese counterpart, that an agreement had been reached for Beijing to suspend restrictions on the export of rare earths – crucial materials for global industry. These measures had provoked outrage from Trump, firm reactions from the European Union and concern among global economic actors who depend heavily on Chinese supplies of rare earths.
An understanding on this point was reached during preparatory talks between North American and Chinese negotiators, held a few days ago in Malaysia, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce also confirmed.
China is the world's largest producer of rare earths, essential elements for sectors such as digital, the automotive industry, energy and defense. These raw materials have become one of the main fronts in the current trade confrontation with the United States and also a reason for friction with Brussels.
The United States announced that it will negotiate with China the sale of North American energy to Beijing, said US President Donald Trump, after meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping. "China has agreed to commit to a process of purchasing American energy. A large-scale transaction could occur regarding the purchase of oil and gas from Alaska," Trump said on the Truth social network. Trump added that teams from both countries will meet to “study the feasibility of such an agreement”.
The meeting between the Presidents of the United States and China resulted in a series of decisions aimed at easing trade tensions, but ended without an agreement on the ownership of the social network TikTok. “China will work with the US to adequately resolve issues related to TikTok,” declared the Chinese Ministry of Commerce after the meeting, without giving details on any progress regarding the future of the popular video-sharing application in the United States. Donald Trump's administration indicated that an understanding with Beijing could be close, allowing TikTok to continue operating in the country.

The supernatural does not only live in cemeteries, but also in running paths, apartments and, above all (and even more surprising) in apparently ordinary school bathrooms.

Both Portugal and China are countries with rich and abundant folklore, resulting in superstitions that have persisted for millennia without anyone knowing exactly how or where they arose. Some are well known: Friday the 13th is an unlucky day, the Portuguese say; on the other side of the world, it is the number four that is avoided due to its phonetic similarity to the word “death” in Mandarin. Others, especially stories about ghosts, demons and other supernatural beliefs, are less documented and echo in conversations between family and friends or on cyber forums.
Macau, as a point of convergence between these two cultures, tells stories that draw on the sources of both and that reflect the city's colonial past. An example of this is the popular narrative that tells of a conflict between Portuguese soldiers and Chinese specters at Portas do Cerco, mirroring the tensions between both peoples in the mid-19th century. The times of scarcity during the Second World War, caused by the sudden overpopulation of the territory and the lack of access to basic food products, are still remembered today in the myth of Calçada do Amparo, where (supposedly) several people disappeared to serve as food in a local restaurant.
Regarding Halloween, PONTO FINAL selected some of the chilling stories that are told on the coldest and cloudiest nights in Macau. Professor Jenny Lao-Phillips, dean of the Faculty of Business and Law at the University of São José (USJ) and enthusiast on the topic, helped to contextualize the cultural traits and symbolism of some of these stories, revealing how fear, more than a universal sensation, can also be a cultural product shaped by history itself.
Although there are no records proving that the legends actually happened, that doesn't make them any less sinister. True or not, their true power lies in their ability to give form to humanity's deepest fears: death, darkness and the unknown.

THE GHOSTS OF GUIA HILL

The Guia Fortress, perched on the highest point of the Macau peninsula, seems to convey a sense of security with its granite walls, the bomb shelters left behind and the constant supervision of the Guia Lighthouse. Legend has it that, on a dark, stormy night, Portuguese ships lost on the high seas only managed to find their way home thanks to a mysterious light source at the top of Guia Hill. The phenomenon, attributed to a miracle of the Virgin Mary, served as a pretext for the construction of the first modern lighthouse in the Far East.
ELOI CARVALHO PHOTOGRAPHY
However, as the philosophy of 'yin' and 'yang' describes, everything that emits light also has an opposing fundamental force within it. This is the case of Guia Hill, one of the most mentioned spots in Macau in stories told from parents to children or whispered among friends on Halloween nights. During the day, it is an oasis of greenery and fresh air in an increasingly cosmopolitan city. As night falls, however, the trees that surround the athletics tracks become darker and more intimidating – and the scene of inexplicable phenomena, according to one of the narratives associated with the hill.
Athletes who dare to run at night must obey a golden rule: never look back, even if they hear mysterious footsteps following them. Still, there are those who claim to have glimpsed human shadows hanging themselves from the trees and then disappearing into thin air, as if it were an optical illusion. For the more gullible, perhaps the ideal solution is to schedule the races in the morning.
The explanation for these macabre stories could be related to the not-so-distant past of the area between Colina da Guia and the Hotel Royal, as Jenny Lao Phillips theorizes. "The area where the hotel now stands was used as a mass grave. People used to throw the bodies of the deceased down the hill, which may have given rise to so many ghost stories", he explains.

HAUNTED BUILDINGS

Cemeteries seem to be the most obvious places to interact with the spirits of those who have departed. In the case of the urban legend of the Sá Kong Cemetery, in Taipa, it was not quite like that: the alleged apparition did not occur on the cemetery grounds itself, but in a nearby residential building.
Chinese superstitions and 'feng shui' strongly advise against purchasing houses near cemeteries, claiming that excess 'yin' energy (that is, dark and negative) can lead to feelings of discomfort and paranoia and seriously impact the physical and mental health of those who live there. Even so, the protagonist of the story in question expressed interest in an apartment close to the cemetery and asked the owner for the keys to visit what, perhaps, could become his next home.
ELOI CARVALHO PHOTOGRAPHY
When opening the door, instead of an empty space, the man found four people playing mahjong in the living room. The players turned in unison to face the intruder, who quickly apologized, closed the door and left the place. He returned later, accompanied by a friend, but this time the scene was very different: the house was completely empty and uninhabited. The identity of the four mysterious mahjong players is, to this day, a mystery to be solved.
Speaking of haunted residential buildings, let's return to the Macau peninsula to remember a case with true roots. The story dates back to July 1966, when a naked and bloody woman burst onto Rua da Madre Terezina asking for help from those passing by, claiming to have been raped by the same man who had murdered her husband.
From this factual episode, a series of rumors emerged about the harmful influence of the building on its residents: it is said that some families' pets died suddenly during the night and that at least one person died for no apparent reason, remaining for days to decompose inside the house until found by the landlord.
After a few years of abandonment, the building underwent a thorough renovation and opened to the public again in 2021. Although the architects responsible for the project guarantee that there are no problems with the 'feng shui' of the space, the truth is that the religious ceremonies that took place on the first day of construction fueled the popular imagination and gave new life to these legends.
Contrary to what is common practice in Macau, the works began with two religious rituals, one Catholic and the other Buddhist, which seem to give credence to the theory that the building was under the influence of some dark energy. In any case, the paranormal activity seems to have calmed down: “all the apartments are occupied and, so far, no new reports of hauntings have emerged”, says Jenny Lao Phillips to PONTO FINAL.

BATHROOMS: THE MOST HAUNTED PLACES IN MACAU

Cemeteries, places naturally associated with death and the supernatural, are far from being the most common settings for the territory's urban legends. As unusual as it may seem, this title belongs to the bathrooms of schools in Macau.
The legend is consistent across all educational establishments, regardless of level of education or location. It all starts with a group of students who stay on the premises until late, as night falls – perhaps studying or working on a group project, as is justified in most versions of the story.
ELOI CARVALHO PHOTOGRAPHY
They believed they were the only people at school, until one of the students walked away to go to the bathroom and heard a lonely cry. All the cubicles were empty except for one. The young woman bent down to look through the lower opening and came across emptiness: there was absolutely nothing and no one inside, apart from a pair of red embroidered shoes.
Jenny Lao-Phillips reveals that she heard this urban legend “from primary to secondary school”. As an adult, when she began teaching at the University of São José, she once again heard identical versions circulating by word of mouth among a new generation of students. “I started to wonder: after all, why are all the bathrooms supposedly haunted and why is there always a pair of red shoes?”
The university professor establishes a bridge between history and two specific aspects: the naturally dark nature of bathhouses and the symbolism of red in Chinese culture. Bathrooms are dark and damp (hence, ‘yin’) spaces where people generally go alone – and are therefore more alone and vulnerable to unwanted encounters. On the other hand, just as stories are told in the West about women in white, Chinese “ghost brides” choose to wear the color red.
“In Chinese culture, if a woman dies wearing red clothes, it means she will return as a vengeful ghost,” explains Jenny Lao-Phillips. Furthermore, the fact that the embroidered shoes are more reminiscent of past eras (like the 'xiuhauxie', used since Antiquity) gives an even more dark edge to the legend, suggesting that the invisible figure crying in the bathroom came from another distant time. Hong Kong cinema has also contributed to the perpetuation of these symbols in the collective imagination, as evidenced by films such as “Blood Stained Shoes”, from 2012, or “Jing Hun Xiu Hua Xie”, from 2017 – both about red embroidered shoes and female spirits thirsting for revenge.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>China says it is on track to send astronauts to the Moon by 2030</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/10/30/china-diz-estar-no-bom-caminho-para-enviar-astronautas-para-a-lua-ate-2030/</link><description>China guarantees that it is on track to send astronauts to the Moon by 2030, by presenting the next team that will head to the Chinese Tiangong space station. The astronauts will also take four rats on this trip, two males and two females, to study the effects of weightlessness and confinement on the animals.

China said yesterday that it is on track to send astronauts to the Moon by 2030, as it presented the next team that will head to the Chinese Tiangong space station. “Currently, each research and development program to land a person on the Moon is progressing smoothly,” said the spokesperson for China’s Manned Space Program.
Zhang Jingbo mentioned the Long March 10 rocket, spacesuits and the exploration vehicle as examples of fruitful efforts in this direction: “Our fixed goal of landing a person on the Moon by 2030 remains unchanged.”
China is also preparing to send the latest team of astronauts, who are part of the ongoing mission to complete the Tiangong space station, as part of broader space exploration plans.
Each team stays at the station for six months, carrying out scientific experiments.
The latest crew to travel to the station, departing from the Jiuquan launch center on Friday at 23:44, will be Zhang Lu, Wu Fei and Zhang Hongzhang.
Zhang Lu had already participated in the Shenzhou 15 mission to the station. For Wu Fei and Zhang Hongzhang, this mission, Shenzhou 21, will be their first in space.
The astronauts will also take four rats on this trip, two males and two females, to study the effects of weightlessness and confinement on the animals.
China began work on Tiangong after the country was excluded from the International Space Station due to US national security concerns about the Chinese space program's direct link to the military.
The Tiangong (‘Heavenly Palace’) space station orbits the Earth at around 400 kilometers altitude and is designed to operate for at least another ten years. With the eventual withdrawal of the International Space Station, led by the United States, Tiangong could become the only operational space station.
China has invested heavily in its space program, having achieved milestones such as the first landing of a probe on the far side of the Moon (with the Chang'e 4 probe) and the arrival on Mars, becoming the third country — after the USA and the former Soviet Union — to manage to do so.
Beijing also plans to build a scientific base at the moon's south pole, in cooperation with Russia and other countries.
In July, Chinese scientific authorities revealed new details about the design and objectives of the Tianwen-3 mission, which is expected to be launched around 2028 to collect soil samples from Mars and bring them to Earth by 2031.

Vietnam's central coastal provinces have been hit by heavy rain since Sunday, with record rainfall reaching 1.7 meters in 24 hours.
At least ten people died and another eight are missing, the Ministry of the Environment reported in a statement released yesterday.
More than 128,000 homes in five central provinces were also flooded, with water levels reaching three meters in some areas, the ministry said.
Residents walked through waist-deep flooded streets in the ancient city of Hoi An, an important tourist center that is on the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage List, while the ground floors of shops were submerged, noted a journalist from the France-Presse news agency.
Several kilometers of roads were damaged or blocked by floods and landslides this week, with more than five thousand hectares of crops destroyed and more than 16 thousand head of cattle killed, the Environment Ministry added.
The river in the city of Da Nang, about 20 kilometers north of Hoi An, burst its banks, reaching an alarming level and surpassing a 60-year record. More flooding is expected in the province over the next two days, the ministry warned on Wednesday.
At the beginning of October, parts of northern Vietnam had already been flooded due to the passage of typhoons Bualoi and Matmo.
Natural disasters, mainly storms, floods and landslides, have already caused the death or disappearance of 187 people in the Southeast Asian country this year. Total economic losses were estimated at almost 525 million euros.
Global warming is making tropical storms stronger and rainier, according to experts, due to rising ocean temperatures, causing more intense winds, heavier rain and changes in precipitation patterns across East Asia.
Vietnam is among the countries that record the most floods in the world, with almost half of the population living in risk areas.</description><pubDate>2025-10-30 23:37:04</pubDate></item><item><title>Interest rate falls for the second time in two months</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/10/30/taxa-de-juro-desce-pela-segunda-vez-em-dois-meses/</link><description>The Macau Monetary Authority (AMCM) yesterday approved a 0.25 percentage point cut in the main reference interest rate, the second cut in two months, following the North American Federal Reserve (Fed).
AMCM set the rediscount rate at 4.25%, the amount charged to banks for short-term capital injections, with immediate effect, according to a statement.
The financial regulator of the Chinese special administrative region thus followed the cut announced on Wednesday by the Fed.
AMCM said that the decline was inevitable, as Macau's currency, the pataca, is pegged to the Hong Kong dollar, so “the interest rate in Macau is consistent with the interest rate in Hong Kong”.
AMCM's decision came shortly after the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) announced the reduction in the reference interest rate, due to the cut imposed by the US central bank. The Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the US dollar.
After the announcement, the Hong Kong stock exchange traded lower, with the main index, the Hang Seng, losing 0.26% until 3:56 pm.
The executive director of the HKMA said yesterday that the cut will help ease the burden of payments on property owners and revive real estate businesses. However, Eddie Yue Wai-man admitted at a press conference that the pace of future interest rate cuts remains uncertain. “Renewed tariff uncertainties and the unavailability of certain key economic data have added complexity to the assessment of labor market and inflation trends in the United States,” said Eddie Yue.
On Wednesday, the Fed, the central bank of the United States, decided to cut interest rates again, by 25 basis points, in what was the second time it reduced key rates this year.
The interest rate drop comes at a time when non-performing loans have been falling in Macau, after reaching a historic record of 57.8 billion patacas at the end of June.
At the end of August, overdue credit represented 5.4% of Macau banks' loans. A percentage that reaches 6.3% in the case of credit to institutions or individuals outside the Chinese region.
Even so, the percentage of overdue bank credit in Macau is far from the record of 25.3% reached in mid-2001, in the midst of the global economic crisis caused by the bursting of the speculative bubble of companies linked to the Internet.
The European Banking Authority, the EU regulatory agency, for example, considers that banks with at least 5% of non-performing loans have “high exposure” to risk and must establish a strategy to resolve the problem.</description><pubDate>2025-10-30 23:41:32</pubDate></item><item><title>MGM's third-quarter profit grew 20% year-on-year</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/10/30/lucro-da-mgm-no-terceiro-trimestre-cresceu-20-em-termos-anuais/</link><description>Gaming operator MGM achieved record results in the third quarter of this year.

The adjusted profit margin was 26.9%, compared to 26.4% in the previous year. According to the group, as of September 30, 2025, MGM had total liquidity of approximately 22.3 billion Hong Kong dollars.
Quoted in the statement, Kenneth Feng, president and CEO of MGM China, said: “We are delighted to see MGM China achieve a record third quarter.” “We are proud to participate in the evolution of Macau as a diversified tourist destination, including the Macau2049 show at MGM Cotai and the Poly MGM Museum at MGM Macau”, said the official, adding that, “with more events not related to gaming and entertainment taking place in Macau”, more visitors will arrive in the territory in the future, boosting the growth of the local market.

The military junta's newspaper, Global New Light of Myanmar, said the men — a filmmaker, an actor and a comedian — were detained in their homes “for publishing false and misleading reviews on social media” of other artists, who produced a film in support of the elections.
The film, shown repeatedly on state television, contains scenes in which a village doctor urges opposition fighters to lay down their arms and support the elections, which are due to begin on December 28.
The law, introduced in July, prohibits “any speech, organization, incitement, protest or distribution of leaflets with the aim of undermining any part of the electoral process.”
Those convicted can face a sentence of three to seven years in prison, which can be increased to five to ten years for those involved in conspiracies.
Parties authorized to present candidates in Myanmar's parliamentary elections began campaigning on Tuesday.
Myanmar has been plunged into a bloody civil war since the military overthrew the democratically elected government of Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi in 2021.
Rebel groups announced a boycott of the elections in the main enclaves they control, while human rights defenders denounced restrictions on freedoms during the campaign in areas controlled by the military junta.
The international press will be able to cover the elections in Myanmar, subject to approval of requests by the government, authorities announced on Wednesday.
The Ministry of Information “will review and approve requests from eligible international press organizations,” according to a statement. The details of the process and which press organizations will be authorized are not yet clear.
On Wednesday, the UN special rapporteur for human rights in Myanmar, Tom Andrews, reiterated the position that the “elections are a sham, a fraud”. “You cannot have a free and fair election when the leaders of the political opposition are arrested, detained, imprisoned and tortured, when dozens of political parties are dissolved, (…) when it is illegal for journalists to report the truth about the situation in Myanmar, when it is illegal to criticize the junta and, in fact, to criticize these elections”, reinforced the leader.
At a press conference at the UN headquarters in New York, Andrews also accused the military junta in power in Myanmar of turning the strong March earthquake into a humanitarian catastrophe by trying to take advantage of the situation.
The UN rapporteur stressed that humanitarian conditions in Myanmar are worse than in 2024 and stated that the international community has failed to respond to this “invisible crisis”. Lusa</description><pubDate>2025-10-30 23:37:43</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
