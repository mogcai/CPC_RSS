Until July 19, the Rui Cunha Foundation will host the “Diligently” exhibition, signed by NG Sok Chan, where the artist explores the various facets of her identity as a woman.
 
The Rui Cunha Foundation inaugurated yesterday, at 6:30 pm, the art exhibition “Diligently”, a project that brings together several works signed by Macao artist Jane NG Sok Chan. The show will remain patent to the public until July 19, with free admission.
The selection of the works for the exhibition was the responsibility of curator Cinny Leong Sin Teng, described in a statement from the foundation as a featured “longtime friend”. In addition to demonstrating their artistic skills, the works on display mirror NG Sok Chan's multidimensional character as a mother, daughter, teacher and domestic, accumulating different archetypes that coexist and survive despite the overwhelming force of the meaning of responsibility.
This is a situation common to many contemporary women, as curator Leong Sin Teng points out: "[With this exposure] we not only acquire a perspective on its life history, but we also develop a deeper understanding of the strength and resilience of modern women."
Cited in the Rui Cunha Foundation statement, also NG Sok Chan deepens this theme and the impact that this overloaded existence has on its work. "I am part of the working class, but I am also a painter. Like many people in society, I conciliate several roles and identities and effort to manage the responsibilities that each one brings. The burden can be overwhelming and often I wonder: Why can't things be simpler?"
Simplicity is attainable precisely with the act of painting and developing its artistic expression. It is through creative catharsis that restores "sanity" and finds "peace," according to the Rui Cunha Foundation. "I believe my paintings express more than my words could ever," he says, stressing two of the topics highlighted in the exhibition: "Bound For Love", a "register of maternity", and "We Need a Break", a reflection on the "limitations of Macao in the global context."
NG Sok Chan was born in Macao in 1984, when the territory was still administered by Portugal. His passage through the United States between 2016 and 2021 contributed to accentuating his mixed cultural identity, influenced by both Western and Eastern thinking. Graduated in drawing from the Normal University of Shanghai and a master's degree in Education from the Normal University of Southern China, the artist is mainly dedicated to the area of ​​artistic education and pictorial creation, having exposed her work around the world and collaborated with various art associations. Currently, he is a member of the Macao Youth Art Association and Number Five Studio artists society, a project centered on oil paintings, acrylic and watercolor he founded after returning to Macao.
Over the years, his works have been selected for various exhibitions and contests, including Macao's Annual Visual Arts Exhibition, the exhibition of paintings with comprehensive Guangdong materials and the Hiii International Illustration Competition, among others.
The “Diligently” exhibition is co-organized by the Rui Cunha Foundation, the Macao Youth Art Association and the Macao Fine Artists Association.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>38 candidacies received for five commercial public housing spaces in zone A</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/07/09/recebidas-38-candidaturas-para-cinco-espacos-comerciais-de-habitacao-publica-na-zona-a/</link><description>Complementary facilities

In its quarterly report, the Macao University of Science and Technology (Must) justifies this data with the “current complex and volatile economic conjuncture”, marked by uncertainties and potential risks.
 
Springs of economic growth and labor market challenges impacted Macao consumers' confidence in the second quarter of 2025, according to an inquiry conducted by the Macao University of Science and Technology (Must). The results now disclosed point to a decrease of 2.11 points-or 2.03%-in the consumer confidence index compared to the previous quarter, now setting in a score of 101.71.
Of the six inquiry into the inquiry, only one rose: “actions and investments”, with a quarterly growth of 3.42% in the period under analysis. On the other hand, classifications related to “quality of life”, “purchase of houses” and “price levels” had homologous decreases of 1.13%, 0.93% and 0.29% respectively. The reference indicators to the “local economy” and the “employment” were the ones that regressed the most, with respective descents of 6.96% and 6.83%.
It should be noted that, according to the criteria established by Must, a score of less than 100 points means that consumers show “little confidence” in the indicator in question. Although the institution notices that the general index goes beyond this goal-therefore maintaining the “optimistic interval over 100 points”-there is greater pessimism compared to “local economy”, “employment”, “housing acquisition” and “price”, all with classifications between 93 and 99 points.
In a statement sent to the newsrooms, the university explains that these results mirror the current economic situation at the international level, where “the weakening of the dynamics of global economic growth, the increase in commercial barriers and the differences in the performance of major economies” arouse “uncertainties” about the trend of inflation and the stability of the world market.
"The economy of mainland China has an upward trend, with social confidence to increase and high quality development to progress constantly, but continues to have difficulties and challenges such as insufficient internal demand, low price persistence and the appearance of potential risks and dangers," the report says. Identically, although the confidence of Macao consumers is generally maintained, above the “positive” level, concerns about the real estate market and the labor market have recorded a growing tendency.
Must's conclusions are clear: "Given the current complex and volatile economic conjuncture, the government and various sectors of the community have to work together and take practical and effective measures to face potential risks." These results can be achieved through measures such as “encouraging innovation and business activities”, stimulating “market vitality” and “promoting diverse economic development”, while reinforcing “vocational training and global labor quality” in the region. "Proactive answers and political adjustments at the political level will help stabilize consumer confidence and promote sustainable and healthy development of Macao's economy," the report concludes.
The consumer confidence index aims to quantify consumers' opinions as to current economic and economic performance and is often used as an indicator to predict economy trends and consumer habits.
The Institute for Sustainable Development of Must has been conducting this quarterly study since 2008, with the sponsorship of the Macau Foundation. In this quarter, response questionnaires were collected from 809 residents aged 18 and over, between 1 and 10 June.</description><pubDate>2025-07-09 03:40:59</pubDate></item><item><title>Government is already treating data to compile senior consumer price index</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/07/09/governo-ja-esta-a-tratar-dados-para-compilar-indice-de-precos-no-consumidor-senior/</link><description>The government had already expressed the intention of creating a price index in the senior consumer, in order to improve the mechanism of adjusting pensions. Yesterday, Tai Kin IP said that the Directorate of Statistics and Census Services (DSEC) is already proceeding to the final treatment of the data and the synthetic analysis of the results of the inquiry that was previously performed.
The information emerged in the secretary's response to the economy and finance to Deputy Ho Ion Sang, which focused on the “senior industry”. Tai Kin IP said that "the search for industry related to elderly, and" Big Health "and traditional Chinese medicine products and services has been increasing, which represents a certain potential for market development for these sectors, so the government" is creating a more favorable business environment for the development of the elderly industry and related sects. "
Tai Kin IP also recalled that with the growing aging of the population of Macao, there is a progressive demand from caregivers to the elderly. Thus, the Directorate of Services for Labor Affairs organizes, in collaboration with the sector entities and professional institutions, specific courses for elderly care, “allowing trainees to master care and care techniques through modules of theoretical knowledge and training of technical skills in real context”.
"The Government of MSar will continue to optimize the various works necessary to support the elderly, creating conditions favorable to promote the healthy development of the senior industry and related sectors," concluded the ruler.</description><pubDate>2025-07-09 03:42:59</pubDate></item><item><title>US Treasury Secretary provides a meeting with Chinese counterpart in the “next weeks”</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/07/09/secretario-do-tesouro-dos-eua-preve-reuniao-com-homologo-chines-nas-proximas-semanas/</link><description>United States Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has announced that he should meet with the Chinese counterpart in the coming weeks to talk about issues such as trade between the two largest economies in the world.
 
"I will meet with my Chinese counterpart in the coming weeks," Bessent said in an interview with CNBC broadcaster on Monday. "We had good meetings in Geneva, London. We both approached the subjects with great respect," he added.
"I think there are things we can do together if the Chinese want to do it," said the American ruler. "Let's discuss whether we can go beyond trade and enter in other areas," he added.
Although Bessent did not identify the homologist by the name, the Treasury Secretary previously maintained negotiations with Chinese vice-minister He Lifeng, who headed the country's delegation for negotiations in London in June.
The China Ministry of Commerce did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Earlier this year, the United States and China announced the imposition of customs rights that threatened to suffocate world trade and had strong repercussions on financial markets, which feared that a global recession.
Negotiations in Geneva and later in London led to the two countries to reach a truce agreement, as Beijing agreed to facilitate the export of rare land minerals, essential to a series of US industries, from the chip industry, clean energy and transport, in exchange for the survey of some of the restrictions imposed by the US.
These minerals have assumed enormous importance in discussions between the two countries. Last week, Bessent warned that the flows of critical materials had not yet returned to the levels recorded in April.
On the other hand, the framework of commercial negotiations between the United States and China is far from comprehensive and there are still complicated questions to resolve, including concerns manifested by US President Donald Trump about fentanyl trafficking, as well as efforts to ensure an agreement to alienate operations in the United States of Tiktok short-video application of Chinese capitals.
This agreement requires Beijing's signature, which gives the country a source of influence to potentially extract US concessions on trade and other issues.
Trump has announced since he has a potential buyer for Tiktok - an investor consortium that includes Oracle Corp technology, asset manager Blackstone and risk capital company Andreessen Horowitz.
 
Taiwan expects to reach trade with US in negotiations
 
Taiwan leader expressed confidence that tariff negotiations with the United States reach a “trade balance” and serve to “strengthen bilateral cooperation” in national technology and security.
During a video conferencing with the Taiwanese negotiation team in the United States, William Lai stressed that, in view of US President Donald Trump's trade policy, Taiwan has always insisted on “deepening bilateral economic and commercial relations with mutual benefits and complementaries”.
"The president encouraged the negotiation team to have as its central mission the defense of national and industrial interests, as well as the protection of public health and food safety, in order to obtain favorable tariff conditions for the country," said the government spokeswoman Karen Kuo, in a statement.
The content of the video conferencing, which was attended by the leading leaders of the Taiwanese government, was released after Trump announced on Monday, which will postpone from July 9 to August 1 the end of the tariff truce granted to business partners. However, the US President sent letters to some of the partners, with the new rates, unless they eliminate their taxes and commercial barriers, highlighting Japan and South Korea, which would apply 25%rates.
The Taiwanese executive indicated yesterday that he had not received any notification from the United States and that Cheng Li-Chiun continues to negotiate on behalf of Taipé.
Following the announcement of the so-called “reciprocal tariffs”, which in Taiwan's case ascended at 32%, Taipei proposed to start commercial negotiations with Washington based on the premise of “zero tariffs”, accelerate the acquisition of US products, increasing investments in the US and “eliminating non-tariff trade barriers”. If the negotiation fails and the US imposes taxes on the semiconductors - the island's main export asset - or reactivate the so -called “reciprocal tariffs,” the impact on the Taiwanese economy would be significant. Taipe has already admitted that he would have difficulty growing above 3% this year if this scenario is materialized.

Among the measures to be adopted, there is an extra attention to environmental hygiene, the use of mosquito networks or the preference for places with air conditioning.
If symptoms of dengue fever appear (namely fever and rash), patients should immediately resort to medical institutions and share information about accommodation or relevant displacement places.</description><pubDate>2025-07-09 03:41:55</pubDate></item><item><title>Sam Hou Fai met with religious associations and reiterates freedom of religion</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/07/09/sam-hou-fai-reuniu-se-com-associacoes-religiosas-e-reitera-liberdade-de-religiao/</link><description>The chief executive, Sam Hou Fai, had a meeting with representatives of six local religious associations, praising the contributions of religious groups to the development of Macao and reiterating respect for religious diversity.
"According to the basic law, the residents of Macao enjoy freedom of religious belief, and that the government of the masters has always respected the various religions," he said.
According to a statement issued by the Social Communication Office, the meeting took place yesterday at the government's headquarters, during which the parties addressed “the development of religious affairs, harmony and social stability”, among other topics.

Sam Hou Fai stressed that religious organizations “have always adhered to the spirit of fraternity, inclusion and mutual respect”, thanking their support for government work, as well as for the dedication to maintaining harmony and social stability and social development.
The government leader said he hoped that the various local religious associations will continue to transmit “actively positive energies” to the local population.

"This demonstrates the ideology of peaceful coexistence and mutual respect practiced in Macao, a great uniqueness of the religious sector in Macao, and the strong support provided by the Government of Masters," said Sam Hou Fai.</description><pubDate>2025-07-09 03:42:57</pubDate></item><item><title>EU wants to rebalance relations with Beijing and avoid threats to safety and competitiveness</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/07/09/ue-quer-reequilibrar-relacoes-com-pequim-e-evitar-ameacas-a-seguranca-e-competitividade/</link><description>The president of the European Commission yesterday insisted that it is necessary to rebalance relations with China, asking Beijing “predictability and confidence” to avoid threats to “security and competitiveness”, “predictability and confidence”, expresses Ursula Von Der Leyen during a debate on the European Union (EU) and China, in the European Parliament (PE) in France.
The president of the community executive anticipated the summit between the political-economic bloc and a country that in five decades is no longer "a country of agriculture and today is an industrial colossus," and "one of the greatest global powers."
Last week, Ursula Von Der Leyen met with China's Foreign Minister in Brussels (Belgium), a city that houses the EU's main institutions, including the European Commission. "We are two of the three largest economies and powers in the world […], but we only exchanged about two billion euros a day [with China]. Although the market is huge, our access is limited," he said.
The president of the European Commission has described a country that made “more than 8,000 million people out of poverty” but which in the international geopolitical panorama has “real risks” to the EU, which are “strategic and systemic” and “harm the safety and competitiveness” of 27 community bloc countries. "China has a completely different system from ours and tools at your disposal that allows you to" throw "the margin of the rules […], subsidies not only to assist its industries, but also to suffocate competition," said Ursula Von Der Leyen.
Demanding the rebalance of the economic balance between EU and Beijing, the “unambiguous condemnation” of the Russian invasion of Ukraine - which to this day has not done, although insisting that the sovereignty of all territories has to be respected - and containment in any “influence operations”, the president of the European Commission considered that the relationship between the two sides can only move, it is only “if it has to be“ rebalancing ”. “We have been doing together for a long time, if China is ready to work with a spirit of predictability and trust,” he insisted.</description><pubDate>2025-07-09 03:43:56</pubDate></item><item><title>Seul promises to improve customs policy after Trump's threat</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/07/09/seul-promete-melhorar-politica-alfandegaria-apos-ameaca-de-trump/</link><description>The South Korean government promised yesterday to improve tariff policy after US President Donald Trump threatened Monday to impose a 25% rate on South Korea imports.
 
The South Korea Ministry of Industry has ensured that it will "improve national systems and regulations, areas of particular interest to the United States, in their efforts to reduce the commercial deficit."
"We will take this opportunity to boost key industries through the partnership to revitalize industry between our two countries," the ministry added in a statement.
Trump sent letters to 14 countries, including South Korea, Japan, South Africa, Malaysia, Cambodia, Thailand and Bangladesh, to warn that exports to the United States will have additional 25% and 40% rates from 1 August.
Later, at the White House, Trump said he was pleased to simply impose customs rights, "mostly," but stressed the negotiations, including conversations with India that could soon end. "We made an agreement with the UK, made an agreement with China, made an agreement - we are close to making a deal with India," said Trump. "With others we have gathered with, we think we won't be able to make a deal. So we just send them a letter."
The South Korean Ministry of Industry considered Trump's letter "as a" de facto "extension of the grace period for the imposition of reciprocal tariffs until August 1st."
In April, the head of state had announced the suspension of the so -called “reciprocal tariffs”, which caused panic in financial markets, and the negotiation of new commercial pacts until July 9.
Trump signed a executive order on Monday that delays new rates by August 1 to all nations facing so-called “reciprocal” tariffs, effectively offering each affected country another three weeks to close an agreement with the White House. "Perhaps adjusting a little, depending on," Trump said, indicating that he would welcome countries that continue to offer additional concessions. "We are not going to be unfair," he said.
The South Korean Ministry of Industry has promised to accelerate negotiations to achieve a mutually beneficial trade agreement with Washington.
In the letter, quoted by the Bloomberg Financial News Agency, Trump also required Seoul not to adopt retaliation tariffs, and threatened to add the value of these eventual rates to the 25% already announced by the United States.
The US President described the country's commercial deficits with his Asian Allies as unsustainable and "serious threats" to the US National Security and the economy.
The United States is the second largest destination of South Korean exports, following China, representing 18.7% of international remittances, worth $ 127.8 billion (108.85 billion euros) by 2024, according to Bloomberg.
On Sunday, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent considered that the pressure being exerted by the White House will help "many agreements be reached quickly."
The European Union (EU) reported on Monday that, the day before, the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, had had a "positva" telephone conversation with Donald Trump.
Indonesia, another of the addresses targeted by Trump's letters, has announced that it will import at least one million tons of US wheat per year, during the next five years, worth $ 1.25 billion.

According to the Public Security Police, continental China residents represented most of the visits, while foreign tourists occupied a percentage of 6.9%. Helena de Senna Fernandes, director of tourism services, said the balance sheet was “encouraging” and could lead to a review of the annual visitor estimate.
 
The number of visitors to Macao yesterday reached the 20 million, according to the statistics advanced by the Public Security Police Corps (CPSP). This year, the record was reached 26 days before last year, when the same value was reached on August 3. The daily average of tourist entries, so far, counts 106,000 people.

In an interview with the newspaper or Mun, the ruler said she was aware of the trend of summer holidays travel, showing a “conservative and optimistic” attitude about the situation. "The arrivals during the summer holidays are affected by the weather conditions. They are guaranteed if time is favorable, while tufts and other factors will impact tourist travel," he noticed. The leader revealed that she is collecting data on the hotel reserves of these two months.
The CPSP, in a note released yesterday, provides for an increase in the number of visitors from Macau during the summer holidays and indicated to have reinforced cooperation with the border control authorities in the interior of China and Hong Kong to ensure the safety and order of the transionic tickets.

The government has asked operators to improve projects with “unsatisfactory results” and encouraged the continuation of “beneficial to future development” activities.</description><pubDate>2025-07-09 03:43:28</pubDate></item><item><title>Detained six suspects of Vietnamese trafficking in downtown Mozambique</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/07/09/detidos-seis-suspeitos-de-trafico-de-vietnamita-no-centro-de-mocambique/</link><description>Mozambican police detained six citizens suspected of trafficking and sexual exploitation from a Vietnamese citizen in the province of Manica, downtown Mozambique.
 
"The police detained these six citizens indicted in the crime of human trafficking. These enticed a Vietnamese citizen in order to offer a job here in Mozambique. The citizen, after arriving in the national territory, was held in captivity and sexually exploited," said the spokesman for the Police of the Republic of Mozambique (PRM) in Manica, Mouzinho Manasse, quoted yesterday by the media.
According to the spokesman, among the six accused are four citizens of Chinese origin and two Mozambicans. "Mozambican citizens work with these Chinese. During the detention period, they were with them, so they are also suspected of being involved in this crime," said the police source, explaining that at the time of detention, the suspects were in possession of cash, as well as a computer and three guns.
Mozambican lawyer and activist Inácio Mussanhane said in September that the situation of trafficking in people in the country "is much more serious" than the official data reveals, defending a "structural organization" to combat these offenses. "Obviously, [the situation] is much more serious, we have people who are trafficked every day, from various parts of the country," he told Lusa.
That social lawyer and activist against human trafficking spoke on the sidelines of a meeting in Maputo between authorities in Mozambique and Angola about "people trafficking: sharing good practices and means of cooperation."
In 2011, Inácio Mussanhane contributed to the conviction to life imprisonment in South Africa of Mozambican citizen Aldina dos Santos, after reporting to the authorities that the defendant forced three minors to engage in child prostitution in that country. The activist also warned of the existence of evidence of human trafficking on foreign migrants detained on international flights to ground in Mozambican cities.
Mussanhane defended a “structural organization” of judicial and police entities against trafficking in persons, warning of impunity caused by the inability of researchers and magistrates to understand the complexity and dynamics of the networks involved in trafficking in persons. "Many prosecutors [who have the legal power to deduce the accusation] are not familiar with this type of crime and eventually say that there is nothing and died the subject, has much to do with [lack of] training," he said.
Speaking during the meeting, Francisco Cardoso, a magistrate of the Mozambican PGR, said the Mozambican authorities have registered 15 criminal proceedings for trafficking in persons over the past 10 years, but admitted that the number of cases may be higher, taking into account the challenges in identifying this type of crimes.

"Since Russian President Vladimir Putin] said last week, we are waiting for a proposal on the Ukrainian side of a possible date. When we reach an agreement, and we hope that will happen immediately," Russian Presidency spokesman Dmitry Peskov said at the daily press conference. The previous two rounds took place in mid -May and early June and resulted only in humanitarian agreements to exchange prisoners of war and bodies of the dead in combat. Russia - which is involved in a new offensive in Donbass and northern Ukraine (Sumi and Kharkiv) - does not seem to be in a hurry to call a new round of negotiations. Putin recently said that Russia is willing to participate in a third round, but immediately admitted that "the Russian and Ukrainian memos are diametrically opposite." The point of discord continues that Ukraine is proposing to cease hostilities before addressing the most delicate political issues, while Moscow refuses to hear about a truce, suspecting that it will only serve as a strategy for pressure relief over enemy troops.
On Monday, Russian Foreign Minister Serguei Lavrov said the third round is being agreed, but without details. However, in an interview with Hungarian press, Lavrov again put obstacles in the way of negotiations by proposing maximalist conditions that are unacceptable to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Lavrov insisted that Moscow defends a political and diplomatic solution, but warned that without eliminating the roots of conflict, there will never be lasting peace between the two countries. The Russian minister requested the elimination of the threats represented by the expansion of the NATO and demanded international recognition of the Annexations of the Ukrainian Peninsula of Crimea and the regions of Donetsk, Lugansk, Kherson and Zaporijia and insisted on the demilitarization and "disinalization" of Ukraine, as well as in the survey of sanctions against Russia and the return of Russian goods and the return of Russians frozen in the West. Lavrov also considered crucial that Ukraine returns to the principles established when it declared independence in 1991: neutrality, which excludes the sending of foreign troops, as well as the entry into military blocks such as the NATO.
However, US President Donald Trump, who has criticized excessive gun supply to Ukraine authorized by predecessor Joe Biden, said Washington will send new weapons shipments to Kiev. "We have to send more weapons. We have to do so to be able to defend themselves. They are being attacked with too much strength," Trump told reporters during a dinner with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday in the White House. "I'm not pleased with President Putin," Trump confessed, who had already expressed similar opinions last week after a telephone conversation with Russian leader before another telephone call to Kiev. Zelensky has announced - after what he called the best telephone conversation he had with Trump since January - arms arms agreements with the US and Denmark for mass production.</description><pubDate>2025-07-09 03:43:34</pubDate></item><item><title>Caeal received 13 complaints about illegal propaganda related to elections</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/07/09/caeal-recebeu-13-queixas-sobre-propaganda-ilegal-relativas-as-eleicoes/</link><description>The Commission of Electoral Affairs of the Legislative Assembly has received 13 suspected cases of illegal propaganda and defamation since the beginning of the period of prohibition of electoral campaign.

The employment situation of the places dominated yesterday's debate, with Tai Kin IP to reiterate that the government wants to protect residents, but warning of the city's international competitiveness.
 
The region's employment situation dominated much of yesterday's plenary meeting of the Legislative Assembly (AL). There were several deputies who questioned Tai Kin IP about government measures to prioritize places in access to employment. The secretary for the economy and finance reiterated that the executive protects the places, but argued that setting a maximum limit of non-resident workers (TNR) could limit the ability to correspond to jobs and the operation of the MSAR market.
The secretary indicated that the government wants to adjust the proportion between residents and TNR through a “flexible mechanism”, which allows us to dynamically evaluate the demand and offer of each job post to readjust the boundaries.
Tai Kin IP pointed out that the employment promotion coordination group, created just over a month ago, is collecting information about the employment needs of areas such as civil construction, administrative and retail selling, having collected, for now, a thousand vacancies involving 300 positions.
In addition, this group has already prepared guidelines to oblige public services and entities to establish priority hiring requirements for workers residing in the award of works and public services, "in order to further increase employment opportunities for residents."
In response to the oral interpellations of deputies Leong Sun Iok, Nick Law, Ngan Iek Hang and MA IO Fong, the secretary for the economy and finance also stressed that "the government of the MSAR has strictly observed the principle that the hiring of non -resident workers is only used to supply the insufficiency of local human resources." Thus, “whatever the situation, provided that residents are interested and fulfill the requirements for the performance of the position, companies should always give priority to their hiring,” said Tai.
On the other hand, the secretary also stated that the government will continue to create favorable conditions to promote the hiring of local residents for mid -level positions of six game dealers. However, he pointed out that, taking into account the project “a center, a platform, a base”, which MSar wants to build, large companies also need managers of different sources in order to contribute to the city's international competitiveness.
Responding to the interventions of Pereira Coutinho and Lo Choi In, the ruler also assured that he will not change his position in relation to the non -authorization of TNR imports to the functions of Croupier, game table supervisor and professional driver. The secretary said that the executive "persists to demand at the six integrated tourism and leisure companies a high percentage of medium and superiors of local management, continuing with the creation of conditions favorable to the exercise of these functions by residents."
During the debate in the Hemiciclo, Tai Kin IP indicated that, currently, more than 60% of the unemployed population is in temporary unemployment, ie for a period of time between one to three months. The ruler said that the time needed for residents to change their careers is identical.</description><pubDate>2025-07-09 03:42:30</pubDate></item><item><title>Eight detainees after detection of lead in the blood of 233 children in Chinese day care</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/07/09/oito-detidos-apos-deteccao-de-chumbo-no-sangue-de-233-criancas-em-creche-chinesa/</link><description>The authorities of the Chinese city of Tianshui, in the northwest of Gansu province, arrested eight people under an investigation into a case of lead poisoning, which affected 233 children from a private day care.
The investigation concluded that those responsible for the nursery will have authorized the use of inappropriate substances for human consumption in the preparation of food for children, the CCTV state television said yesterday.
Two people, with the nicknames ZHU and LI, responsible for the management and financing of the Center, respectively, are among the detainees.

Authorities reported that the 251 children attended the center were underwent blood analysis, of which 233 had abnormal lead levels and 18 were within the normal parameters. The intoxication led to the hospitalization of 201 children, CCTV said.
In recent days, some parents of affected children have told local press that their children had suffered for months of symptoms such as nausea, diarrhea, leg pain or abdominal cramps and that in many cases they thought it was light diseases until blood analyzes revealed the presence of lead.
Private day care, inaugurated in 2022, charged about 6,000 yuan monthly enrollment for each child.
At the beginning of the past decade, several cases came across the country involving thousands of lead -intoxicated children to reside near mining production areas or polluting industries - battery factories or recycling and casting plants, for example - with studies demonstrating that one third of children in Yunnan province had high levels of this heavy metal in the blood.</description><pubDate /></item></channel></rss>
