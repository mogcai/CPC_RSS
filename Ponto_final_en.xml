This is the first public appearance of this missile, which some experts say could have multiple warheads, allowing it to attack multiple targets simultaneously and overcome anti-missile systems.
Although the Hwasong-20 seeks to increase the range and destruction capacity of its predecessors, it has not yet been tested, so its operational capabilities cannot be confirmed.
The event was attended by Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang and Vice President of the Russian Security Council Dmitri Medvedev. However, the President of China, Xi Jinping, and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, were not present, despite speculation that Pyongyang had invited them.
Kim Jong-un presided over the parade from the central tribune of Kim Il-sung Square, where, during a speech, he stressed that the North Korean armed forces must “continuously evolve into an invincible force” that eliminates any threat, according to KCNA, cited by the South Korean news agency Yonhap. Kim did not mention Seoul or Washington in his speech, limiting himself to referring to the fight against hegemony in general.
Recently, the White House left open the possibility of negotiations with Pyongyang without preconditions, which seems to imply that the issue of denuclearization could be removed from the initial talks, in accordance with North Korean demands. Seoul, for its part, has continued to send signals of openness to dialogue, which the North Korean regime continues to ignore.
Medvedev said North Korean units sent to Kursk to support Russia in the war against Ukraine marched in the parade, as cited by Russian news agency TASS.
Hypersonic missiles, long-range strategic cruise missiles, anti-aircraft systems, new-generation Chonma-20 tanks and multiple launchers were also displayed during the parade, according to KCNA.</description><pubDate>2025-10-12 22:20:13</pubDate></item><item><title>Chinese exports to Portuguese-speaking countries fall 1.4% until August</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/10/12/exportacoes-chinesas-para-os-paises-lusofonos-caem-14-ate-agosto/</link><description>Chinese exports to Portuguese-speaking countries fell 1.4% in the first eight months of 2025, compared to the same period last year, according to official data.

According to information from the Chinese Customs Service, goods sold to Portuguese-speaking markets until August reached 57.6 billion dollars.
This value represents a drop of 1.4% compared to the same period in 2024, the year in which Chinese exports to the countries set a new record: 85.5 billion dollars.
Data compiled and released on Wednesday by the Forum for Economic and Trade Cooperation between China and Portuguese-Speaking Countries (Macau Forum) reveal that Brazil was the main reason for the drop.
Despite a year-on-year decline of 5.3%, Brazil continues to be the largest buyer in the Portuguese-speaking bloc, with Chinese goods reaching US$46.9 billion.
Second on the list – and in the opposite direction – comes Portugal, whose imports from China increased 8% to 4.52 billion dollars. Angola also purchased products worth US$3.4 billion from China until August, a year-on-year increase of almost two thirds (64.4%).
In the opposite direction, exports from Portuguese-speaking countries to China fell 11.3%, to US$86.6 billion in the first eight months.
According to official data, this is the lowest value for the period between January and August since 2020, at the beginning of the covid-19 pandemic.
The decline was mainly due to Brazil – by far the largest Portuguese-speaking supplier in the Chinese market – whose sales fell 10.9% to US$72.6 billion.
Furthermore, the second largest Chinese trading partner in the Portuguese-speaking bloc, Angola, saw exports fall 13.1%, to US$10.5 billion.
Sales of goods from Portugal to China decreased by 6.9% to US$1.94 billion. In fact, seven of the nine Portuguese-speaking countries saw their exports to the Chinese market fall.
Mozambique's sales to the Chinese market fell 5.2%, to US$1.1 billion, while Equatorial Guinea's exports shrank by almost half (44.6%), to US$464.9 million.
Cape Verde's remittances fell by 87.5%, although the country only sold around two thousand dollars worth of goods, while Timor-Leste's exports shrank by 72.2%, to US$139 thousand. The only exception was São Tomé and Príncipe, whose sales grew nine times, to 44 thousand dollars (38 thousand euros).
Guinea-Bissau did not export any goods to China in the first eight months of 2025, as in the same period last year.
China continues to record a trade deficit with the Portuguese-speaking bloc, which reached US$29 billion in the first eight months of 2025.
In total, trade between Portuguese-speaking countries and China reached US$144.3 billion, 7.6% less than in the same period last year.</description><pubDate>2025-10-12 22:26:34</pubDate></item><item><title>NBA makes peace with China on return to Macau after six years of rupture</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/10/12/nba-faz-as-pazes-com-china-em-regresso-a-macau-apos-seis-anos-de-rutura/</link><description>Around 14 thousand people watched in Macau the first game between teams from the North American Basketball League (NBA) in China after six years of rupture and despite tensions between Washington and Beijing.

More than an hour and a half before the start of the match between the Brooklyn Nets and the Phoenix Suns, hundreds of fans were already queuing up to enter the Venetian Arena, which will host NBA pre-season games for five years.
Although basketball is one of the most popular sports in China, the main motivation for those who came early was the various performances by musical groups from mainland China and neighboring Hong Kong before the opening whistle.
Neither team is tipped to succeed the Oklahoma City Thunder as NBA champions, but in the completely full stands, there seemed to be more fans of the Nets, who have Zeng Fanbo on their squad.
The 22-year-old left the Beijing Ducks, from the Chinese capital, to sign in August with the Nets, owned by the president of Chinese technology giant Alibaba, Joe Tsai Chung-Hsin.
Zeng was chosen to speak to the fans before kick-off and received one of the biggest ovations of the night when he first came on with three minutes remaining in the first half.
With the ball rolling, the Nets dominated, reaching the break with an advantage (71-59), in a lukewarm match, despite a lot of noise made by the fans, especially with each 'dunk' or triple shot.
The organizers did their best to keep the atmosphere buzzing, even launching souvenirs attached to mini parachutes from the roof of the arena and the football world lent a helping hand, with former England international David Beckham sitting in the front row, alongside Hong Kong actor Jackie Chan, Joe Tsai and Alibaba founder Jack Ma.
Timeouts were used to bring Chinese celebrities to the floor, including members of Hong Kong's most famous band, Mirror, or former NBA legends, including two former rivals: Shaquille O'Neal and Chinese Yao Ming. "I remember watching Yao Ming play for the [Houston] Rockets when I was little. But this was the first time I saw the NBA live. It was crazy!", she told Lusa Fang, 33 years old.
This Suns fan, who flew two thousand kilometers from Beijing, was still hoarse after watching the team come back in the second half and win 132-127, after extra time, after more than three hours.
More important than the result was the return to China. The NBA has not played games in China since 2019, when Daryl Morey, then general manager of the Houston Rockets, demonstrated support for anti-government protests in Hong Kong on social media. “Most of these fans unfortunately didn't have the opportunity to watch [NBA] games, but we gave them a show here and we felt supported,” said Nets coach Jordi Fernández after the game.
The NBA refused to punish Daryl Morey, but Chinese state television CCTV stopped broadcasting American league games, a hiatus that cost $400 million in lost revenue. But the passion for basketball in China has not faded, said Suns star Devin Booker: “I haven't felt this level of passion in a long time (…). It was important for the NBA to come back here.”</description><pubDate>2025-10-12 22:19:13</pubDate></item><item><title>Japanese city challenges residents to limit smartphone use to two hours a day</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/10/12/cidade-japonesa-desafia-habitantes-a-limitar-uso-de-smartphones-a-duas-horas-diarias/</link><description>A Japanese city has launched a directive that asks residents to limit smartphone use to two hours a day, in a measure that, although it does not result in a fine, aims to promote a healthier relationship with screens.

Masafumi Kouki, mayor of this town, explained to France-Presse (AFP) that he had been concerned for several months about the “negative effects of the excessive use of smartphones, particularly the sharp decline in direct human communication”. "Even on trains, everyone is looking at their cell phones, no one talks to others anymore. I wanted to create an opportunity for our residents to reflect", he confided during an interview.
A “local law” on the proper use of cell phones, laptops and tablets was approved by the city council by 12 votes to 7, before coming into force last week — applying to both adults and children.
In this suburb of Nagoya, an industrial metropolis in central Japan, the aim is not to impose penalties for exceeding the limit, but rather to encourage self-regulation.
When the law was first proposed, “opposition was almost unanimous” in the city, but many citizens changed their minds when they learned that the “daily limit” does not include work or study time and that it is a recommendation, says the mayor. Not enough to convince all of the approximately 68,000 inhabitants of Toyoake. “Nowadays, we do everything — study, entertainment, communication — with a single smartphone,” argued Shutaro Kihara, a 22-year-old law student, who considers the regulation “quite useless or ineffective” for young people.
Councilor Mariko Fujie, 50, voted against, considering that, although the excessive use of smartphones is a social problem that deserves to be addressed, she has “strong reservations about the idea of ​​regulating people's free time through a decree”.
Primary school student Ikka Ito, who plays video games near a local train station, says he uses his cell phone four to five hours a day. “I started voluntarily reducing my screen time since the announcement”, without my parents asking for it, he assured.
With the aim of improving sleep, the bill recommends that primary school students avoid screens after 9pm, while primary school students and older are encouraged to turn them off after 10pm.
Research has revealed that Japanese people sleep less than people in other developed countries, often due to long working hours.
Studies also show that, in addition to interfering with sleep, which can affect mental health, intensive use of social media is associated with loneliness, depression and anxiety.
The mayor has two children, aged 10 and 7, who do not have a smartphone, although the older one sometimes borrows his mother's, and his family now avoids screens during meals.

In a statement, DST revealed that participating companies from the Philippines and mainland China placed second and third, respectively, in the 33rd edition of the competition.
The competition ended on Saturday with two shows: the winner, from the British pyrotechnic company Pyrotex Fireworx, and another from the Vision Show team, from Florianópolis, in Santa Catarina, which marked Brazil's debut in the competition.
The end of the competition, which was scheduled for October 6, was postponed due to the passage of Typhoon Matmo, which led Macau authorities to issue tropical storm signal 8, the third highest level. The third night of the contest also had to be postponed, from September 20th to October 2nd, due to the impact of super typhoon Ragasa.
The director of DST, Maria Helena de Senna Fernandes, highlighted at the awards ceremony that, despite the impact of weather conditions, the event allowed companies from various parts of the world “to deepen contacts and dialogue with industry partners”.
The 33rd edition featured 10 shows, each lasting 18 minutes, combining fireworks and music, including the show by the Portuguese company Pirotecnia de Barbeita, based in Monção.
The competition had a budget of 18.1 million patacas, a figure that represents a drop of around 1.1% compared to last year.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>China tightens controls on imports of advanced chips</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/10/12/china-reforca-controlos-a-importacao-de-chips-avancados/</link><description>China has tightened controls on the import of advanced 'chips', in an attempt to stop the acquisition of processors from the North American Nvidia by the country's large technology companies, reported the Financial Times.
According to the British newspaper, in recent weeks teams of Chinese customs officials have been mobilized to carry out “rigorous inspections” of semiconductor shipments at the country's main ports.
The operations began with the aim of preventing the entry of specific Nvidia models developed for the Chinese market, such as the H20 and RTX Pro 6000D – created to circumvent export controls imposed by Washington and maintain the presence of the company led by Jensen Huang in China.
According to a source cited by the FT, controls have now been extended to all advanced chips, as a way of combating the smuggling of high-performance semiconductors that violate United States restrictions.
In addition to customs actions, some officials initiated investigations into possible false statements made in the past by Chinese companies regarding the import of advanced chips.
The Financial Times revealed last month that the Cyberspace Administration of China asked the country's largest technology companies, such as ByteDance and Alibaba, to suspend purchases of artificial intelligence processors from Nvidia.
According to Chinese regulators, the locally developed 'chips' already offer performance comparable to the North American company's authorized products.
These measures are part of Beijing's efforts to guarantee China's technological self-sufficiency, in a context of intensifying rivalry with the United States.</description><pubDate>2025-10-12 22:23:57</pubDate></item><item><title>National Games reflect “the confidence and expectations that the Central Government has for Macau”</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/10/12/54228/</link><description>The Chief Executive participated, on Saturday, in the flag handover ceremony to the Macau sports delegation that will participate in the 15th edition of the National Games and Special Olympic Games for the Disabled and in the Commitment Ceremony of Volunteers from the Macau Competition Zone. Sam Hou Fai took the opportunity to encourage athletes and volunteers.
“I would like, on behalf of the Macao SAR Government, to express my sincere congratulations and high tribute to all members of the Sports Delegation and volunteer friends for the selfless efforts they make to this great national event”, stated the Chief Executive in his speech.
Remember Macau will host five types of competition in this edition of the National Games, namely table tennis (all groups), 3-a-side basketball (all groups), 5-a-side basketball (men's under-18s), volleyball (women's adults) and karate (all groups). The men's individual cycling event will be co-organized by Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau in November, making this the only National Games event to cross the borders between the three regions.
In his speech, Sam Hou Fai stressed that the event “expresses the confidence and expectations that the Central Government has for Macau”. “We must unite and do our best to compete at a high level and to organize the competition with the highest quality”, asked the leader of the Macao SAR Government.
Macau sends a sports delegation of more than 400 people to these Games and a delegation of more than 180 people to the Special Olympic Games for the Disabled. “We hope that on this stage at the highest national level, all athletes will take the opportunity to show their best in full competitive form, be able to surpass themselves, and gain friendships to simultaneously promote the sporting spirit of Macau athletes: unity, collaboration and persistence, transmitting the unique charm of Macau to friends across the country”, said Sam, adding that “these Games materialize a great event both for athletes and volunteers.”
The Chief Executive highlighted that the Macao SAR will ensure the “great success of the 15th edition of the National Games and Special Olympic Games for the Disabled, as well as the success of the work to be carried out in the Macau Competition Zone”. “We will dedicate our efforts to achieving a double gain in the performance of competitions and in demonstrating the civilized spirit that demonstrates to the entire world Macau's determination, integrated capacity and urban charisma to transform itself into a City of Sports”, he concluded.</description><pubDate>2025-10-12 22:30:05</pubDate></item><item><title>Questionnaires to public servants did not interfere in the elections, says Government</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/10/12/questionarios-aos-funcionarios-publicos-nao-interferiram-nas-eleicoes-diz-governo/</link><description>The secretary for Administration and Justice denied that the questionnaires given to civil servants about whether they intended to vote affected the September 14 elections.

Less than a week before the vote, Macau public entities and services questioned workers and demanded written justifications from those who admitted that they did not plan to vote for the Legislative Assembly (AL).
At a press conference, Lusa asked secretary André Cheong and the director of Administration and Public Service Affairs, Leong Wen In, who had ordered the interrogations of the officials. André Cheong did not respond directly, but guaranteed that the Macau Government only, “as recommended by the electoral commission, called on [public service] workers to go and vote”.
The Legislative Assembly's Electoral Affairs Commission (CAEAL) “issued a recommendation according to which public employees must actively participate in the election,” said the secretary.
André Cheong said that, according to the electoral law of the Chinese semi-autonomous region, voting “constitutes a right and a civic duty”, which also applies to public service workers. “We must enjoy our rights and fulfill our duties”, said the still secretary, who will leave his post on October 16, after being appointed by the leader of Macau, Sam Hou Fai, as one of the 33 AL deputies.
On September 1, Sam Hou Fai had already sent a circular asking all public servants in the region to vote in the elections, to prove their patriotism. In the document, the Government leader recalled that the new civil service statute will require all workers to swear an oath of defense of the Basic Law and loyalty to China.
The revision of the statute, which only comes into force on November 1st, provides that public servants, including those of Portuguese nationality, may be dismissed if they carry out “acts contrary” to their oath.
Sam Hou Fai argued that voting "is, precisely, a relevant demonstration of the defense of the Basic Law and loyalty to the Macao SAR. Still, on September 6, the president of CAEAL, Seng Ioi Man, guaranteed that "the issue of disciplinary responsibility" would not arise for public officials who did not vote.
Asked about the interrogation of public officials and whether the circular sent by Sam Hou Fai could be seen as a threat and have had an influence on the outcome of the elections, André Cheong did not respond.
The civil service population – which, according to the latest available data, at the end of 2023, had just under 34,300 workers – will currently represent around 10% of the total number of registered voters in Macau.
A lista mais votada foi a liderada por José Pereira Coutinho, que é também o presidente da Associação de Trabalhadores da Função Pública de Macau (ATFPM). Na noite de 14 de Setembro, após o anúncio dos resultados, Coutinho elogiou a circular de Sam Hou Fai como “uma excelente medida, muito positiva” para “elevar o número de votantes”.
Quase 53,4% dos eleitores foram votar, mais 11 pontos percentuais do que em 2021, mas aquém do recorde de 59,9%, fixado em 2009, quando concorreram três listas pró-democracia. The number of invalid or blank votes more than doubled, exceeding 13 thousand. Dias mais tarde, José Pereira Coutinho defendeu, numa entrevista à Lusa, que a vitória eleitoral da lista apoiada pela ATFPM “não tem nada a ver com o Chefe do Executivo”.

At least 14 children up to the age of 14 attempted to end their lives in the first half of the year in Macau, double the number recorded in the same period in 2024. Between January and June there were at least 101 suicide attempts, including 14 children aged 5 to 14, reported TDM – Macau Television.
According to data from the Macau Secretary for Security's office, the largest number of suicide attempts (30) occurred in the age group between 15 and 24 years old, while two thirds (67) were carried out by women.
Despite this, the numbers released by Wong Sio Chak's office reveal a decrease, since, in the first half of 2024, 125 suicide attempts had been recorded.
Throughout last year there were 249 suicide attempts in the territory, eight fewer than in 2023. In the first half of last year, the Health Services (SSM) recorded 44 deaths by suicide, three fewer than in the same period of 2023, including a 12-year-old young man. At the time, the SSM said that “the possible causes of suicide are mainly the result of mental illness and problems related to gambling or finances”.
The head of the Division of Prevention and Treatment of Problem Gambling at the Institute of Social Action (IAS) reminded journalists that a survey on young people's participation in games of chance is almost finished.
Social organization Sheng Kung Hui launched a survey among young people aged between 13 and 35 in June, which is running until October 17, said Bonnie Wu I Mui.
On the sidelines of an academic forum on gambling addiction, the director admitted that the IAS does not have “the exact number of suicides related to compulsive gambling” and forwarded the question to the Health Services. However, since the data on suicides between January and March came out at the end of May, the SSM has not released this statistic, usually published quarterly, again.
In the most recent balance, Macau recorded 18 deaths by suicide, four fewer than in the first three months of 2024. According to a count made by TDM, based on messages sent to the press by the region's Judicial Police, there were at least 60 deaths that can be attributed to suicide until the beginning of October.

The Financial Information Office (GIF) reported that the six casino operators in the territory submitted, in total, 2,751 reports of transactions suspected of money laundering or terrorist financing.
In a statement released on Thursday, GIF pointed to “the decrease in the number of reports of suspicious transactions reported by the gaming sector” until September as the main reason for an 8.9% drop in the total number.
Between January and September, the office received 4,118 participations, 73.3% of which came from casino concessionaires, while 21% came from banks and insurance companies and 5.7% from other institutions and entities.
The referenced sectors, including pawn shops, jewelry stores, real estate agencies and auction houses, are obliged to report to the authorities any transaction equal to or greater than 500 thousand patacas.
In 2024, GIF had received 5,245 participations, the majority of which came from the territory's casinos: 3,837, 11.8% more than in the previous year and a new record.
In March 2022, the US State Department designated Macau as one of the main money laundering hotspots worldwide, pointing out high rollers and the “illicit activities they often facilitate”. This is despite the arrest, in November 2021, of Alvin Chau, leader of Suncity, then the largest VIP bet raiser in the world.
According to GIF's annual report, Macau was the only member of the Asia-Pacific Anti-Money Laundering Group (FATF) that complied with “all 40 international standards” on preventing money laundering and the financing of terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
The office signed agreements to exchange information with 33 countries and territories, including the Financial Information Unit of the Judicial Police of Portugal, in 2008, the Financial Information Unit of the Central Bank of Timor-Leste, in 2018, and, in 2019, the Financial Activities Control Council of Brazil and the Financial Information Unit of Cape Verde.
In July, GIF said that it had finalized the procedures to sign, also with Angola, an information exchange agreement to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
The office said that the agreement was on the table at a meeting with representatives of the Financial Information Unit of the Republic of Angola, on the sidelines of the Egmont Group meeting between 6 and 11 July, in Luxembourg.
The Egmont Group is an international anti-money laundering organization, which brings together 181 information units from around the world.
Angola was added to the FATF “grey list” in October 2024, after falling short of its legal and financial regulatory regimes. Mozambique is also on the FATF “grey list” and the country was admitted to the Egmont group in July.
The FATF, an intergovernmental organization, establishes international standards on combating money laundering, terrorist financing and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
The “grey list” identifies countries that are actively working with the FATF to address strategic deficiencies in these areas.

The regulations governing the general organization of public services and entities, for example, will limit the number of service management positions.

The Government presented on Friday a series of administrative regulations that aim to advance the Public Administration reform plan. One of the diplomas presented is that of the general regime for the organization and organic structure of public services and entities, which aims to “further simplify the organic structure of the Government and increase the effectiveness of its functioning”. This regulation “will serve as a legal basis for mandatory follow-up in future restructuring of public services and entities”.
This administrative regulation defines that “a new service can only be created when a new function arises that is difficult to pursue, even through the adjustment of the organic structure of existing services, thus establishing express restrictions on the creation of new services”, says the Government statement.
Within the scope of the internal structure of the Administration, the diploma will define the principles on the creation of subunits at the department and division level for services, for example, the principle of the rational division of work and the management of procedures, concentrating in the same subunit the functions and work of an identical nature, similar or with a close relationship to the procedures, to be carried out. On the other hand, department-level subunits are responsible for pursuing the political objectives and core functions of the service to which they belong, and can only form division-level subunits when necessary.
This regulation also limits the number of management positions and internal subunits of the services: for a service with less than 200 people, the limit is now two management positions, two department-level subunits and four division-level subunits; for services with between 200 and 1,000 people, the limit is now three management positions, six department-level subunits and 12 division-level subunits; and for services with more than a thousand people, the limit is now four management positions, eight department-level subunits and 16 division-level subunits.
Also within the scope of the Public Administration reform, the Government presented the administrative regulations for the organization and functioning of the Directorate of Justice Affairs Services (DSAJ), which will incorporate the Official Press (IO) into this service.
After the merger, the new DSAJ will be responsible for the functions previously performed by them, including study of justice policy in general, legislative coordination, legislative production and respective technical support, legal dissemination, editing of the Official Bulletin and printing of work necessary for the functioning of the Government.
A proposal to amend the law creating the Institute for Municipal Affairs (IAM) was also presented, which aims to “rationalize and simplify the organic structure, optimize functions and reinforce management, making municipal management more precise and efficient”.
“Taking into account that some of the functions currently assigned to the IAM overlap with those of other competent services and that there are situations in which closely related matters are managed by different entities”, this proposed law establishes “the transfer of the IAM to the competent transport and public works services, of the powers relating to the naming of public spaces, the attribution of police numbers, as well as the maintenance and repair of roads and traffic networks. drainage, with a view to clarifying the division of responsibilities and optimizing administrative procedures”.

Executive wants to simplify the process of granting licenses for restaurants

The Executive Council also finalized the proposed law on restaurant and beverage activities and related establishments. This diploma aims to “flexify, simplify and improve, as much as possible, the procedures for requesting, assessing and approving licenses for food and beverage establishments and dance halls located in urban buildings not intended for hotel activity purposes, in order to reduce operational costs and optimize the sector's business environment”. It is stipulated, for example, that there will only be a single type of establishment, “food and beverage establishments”, instead of “restaurants”, “bars”, “drinking establishments” and “food establishments”. After approval of the proposed law, the Government will “reformulate the complementary legal diplomas, optimize and perfect the administrative licensing procedure, as well as adequately relax the technical requirements that establishments are subject to observe, without neglecting public health and safety, depending on the real needs arising from the regulation of different types of establishments”.

Term of use of ossuary drawers and ash chambers reduced to 25 years

On Friday, authorities also presented an amendment to the administrative regulations on the operation of cemeteries. This review changes the initial period for using ossuary drawers and ash chambers to 25 years, replacing the current period of 50 years, without changing the respective rate. On the other hand, the renewal period will be extended from the current five to ten years. Furthermore, this regulation will also standardize the deadlines for requesting exhumation and its eventual postponement, improve the regime for charging fees associated with the exhumation of mortal remains, and regulate the recording of the names of the deceased.

Changes to the gold and platinum trading regime

The Government also decided to make changes to the proposed law on the marketing of gold and platinum. The Executive Council explains that the amendment to the regime is to add new definitions of platinum, gold plated and gold-plated articles, and the ringing standard of “足金” will be raised to not less than 999‰, while the ringing standard of “足鉑金” will be set to not lower than 990‰. It is also stipulated that gold and platinum articles must have a mark that identifies their touch, and all types of goldsmith articles must also be marked in accordance with the regulations. On the other hand, establishments must post notices about gold or platinum touch standards, issuing invoices or receipts that contain information legally required when selling these items. Furthermore, this bill proposes to increase the value of fines for administrative infractions.</description><pubDate>2025-10-12 22:37:14</pubDate></item><item><title>Macau launches alert for rising cases of chikungunya fever</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/10/12/macau-lanca-alerta-para-subida-dos-casos-de-febre-chikungunya/</link><description>Macau authorities yesterday issued an alert to the population, given the increase in local infections with the chikungunya virus, following an outbreak in the neighboring Chinese province of Guangdong.
On Saturday night, the Health Services (SSM) revealed the detection of two more local cases, bringing the total to eight. 24 cases were also recorded in people arriving from abroad.
The head of the SSM Center for Disease Prevention and Control, Leong Iek Hou, said at a press conference that there is “a continued risk of importing cases” and that the risk of transmission in Macau “is very high”.
Transmitted by mosquitoes, chikungunya causes fever and joint pain, with symptoms similar to dengue, affecting children, the elderly and people with pre-existing illnesses more seriously. Even so, the director of the SSM, Alvis Lo, argued that “there is no need to panic”, because local cases of chikungunya “continue to be sporadic” and “there is still no collective infection”.
In mainland China, almost 16,500 cases of chikungunya were registered by the end of September, in an outbreak concentrated in the cities of Foshan and Jiangmen, close to Macau and Hong Kong, which registered 32 cases.
Foshan authorities have imposed strict preventative measures, including the use of mosquito nets, drones and disinfectant, with threats of fines and electricity cuts for those who do not eliminate standing water.
Alvis Lo said he prefers to count on “the cooperation of residents”, not only to eliminate stagnant water, but also to use mosquito nets and mosquito repellent.
Infectious disease specialist Tian Yakun highlighted that the four infected people currently admitted to Macau hospitals are “mild cases”, but stressed that the fever can lead to “chronic joint pain for months or years”.
The specialist also recalled that, according to a recent report from the World Health Organization, chikungunya infections caused 155 deaths worldwide this year, until the end of September.
In Foshan, those infected are forced to remain in hospital for at least a week and authorities even imposed two-week home quarantines, which have since been suspended because the virus cannot be transmitted between humans.
Leong Iek Hou confirmed that in Macau “measures similar to those in mainland China” were taken to prevent patients who still have the virus in their blood from being bitten by mosquitoes that transmit the fever to other people.
At the end of August, the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control highlighted that 27 chikungunya outbreaks were recorded this year, a new record on the European continent.
In Portugal, the Aedes Albopictus mosquito (known as the “tiger mosquito”), which transmits diseases such as dengue, zika and chikungunya, was found, just this year, in Condeixa-a-Nova (Coimbra), Covilhã (Castelo Branco) and Pombal (Leiria).</description><pubDate>2025-10-12 22:29:33</pubDate></item><item><title>Number of companies at Sino-Lusophone trade fair in Macau increases by 60%</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/10/12/numero-de-empresas-em-feira-comercial-sino-lusofona-em-macau-sobe-60/</link><description>A Sino-Lusophone trade fair that opens on October 22 in Macau will feature more than 480 exhibitors from China and Portuguese-speaking countries, an increase of 60%, said the organization.
The Macau Trade and Investment Promotion Institute (IPIM) said that the second edition of the China and Portuguese-speaking Countries Economic and Trade Exhibition (C-PLPEX) has the theme of “creating new opportunities for cooperation”.
The inaugural edition of C-PLPEX, held in 2023, after six editions of the Exhibition of Products and Services of Portuguese-Speaking Countries, featured 300 companies, of which 260 came from Portuguese-speaking markets.
In a statement, IPIM highlighted that exhibitors come from sectors such as agriculture, food and beverage, new energy, marine economy, cross-border e-commerce and professional services.
In the case of agriculture, “innovative technologies will be presented, such as ‘drones’ [unmanned aircraft] and the use of waste”, along with “characteristic agricultural products and derivatives”, including coffee beans and cashews.
Between October 22nd and 25th, C-PLPEX will also include “other links in the industrial chain, such as storage logistics and sales by agents”, highlighted IPIM.
The new energy sector will prioritize “innovative products and services, including electric motorcycles, new energy space capsules, energy storage and solar energy systems”.
The so-called blue economy will bring together “reference companies” from the two blocs “in the fields of maritime logistics, oceanic renewable energy, marine biotechnology, aquaculture, research and development in blue technologies”.
The C-PLPEX program includes the launch of 13 new projects, the announcement of the winners of awards for wines and spirits and coffee from Portuguese-speaking countries and a networking session between agricultural entrepreneurs.
The second edition of C-PLPEX will take place simultaneously with the 30th Macau International Fair (MIF) and the 2025 Macau Franchise Exhibition.
This year, IPIM invited Guangzhou as an MIF partner city and will organize more than 50 economic and trade promotion sessions, including regional cooperation forums and conferences.
The organization said that 20 new products and technologies will be launched during MIF, which this year features new themed pavilions dedicated to the robotics industry as well as a pavilion dedicated to Macau's healthcare brands.</description><pubDate>2025-10-12 22:28:56</pubDate></item><item><title>Academic forum on gambling prevention and treatment brings together 180 participants</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/10/12/forum-academico-sobre-a-prevencao-e-o-tratamento-do-jogo-reune-180-participantes/</link><description>The University of Macau (UM) welcomed nearly two hundred local and international participants and experts on October 10, united under the common theme of preventing and treating compulsive gambling. Although this is still a very present topic in the region, statistics show that the rate of residents' perception of responsible gambling has been growing significantly, going from 16.2% in 2009 to 64.9% in 2023.
The 2025 edition of the academic forum on the prevention and treatment of compulsive gambling took place last Friday morning, at the University of Macau (UM), with the presence of 180 participants.
This year's initiative consisted of a discussion on the topic “the evolution of gambling disorder prevention and treatment services over the last two decades”, to which several local, international and Hong Kong academics contributed. Together, the experts dedicated themselves to analyzing the “results of the development of services for the prevention and treatment of gambling disorder and relevant studies”, according to a press release from the Institute of Social Action (IAS).
The vice-president of the IAS, Hoi Va Pou, said on the occasion that the year 2025 “marks the 20th anniversary of the creation of the counseling services for the problem gambling area of ​​Casa de Vontade Firme”, a support center for the treatment of gambling addiction under the IAS.
Taking stock of these two decades, the official stressed that “the Macao SAR Government has been paying a lot of attention to prevention and treatment actions for gambling disorder”, namely through the regulation of responsible gambling, the provision of training for workers in the area of ​​social services and the gambling industry and the creation of an open advice line, accessible 24 hours a day. A set of financial management courses was also created for students, from pre-school to secondary education.
The consequences of these measures are evident in the most recent statistics on the gaming sector, according to the head of the IAS, who draws attention to the rise in the rate of perception regarding responsible gaming among Macau residents: from 16.2%, in 2009, to 64.9%, in 2023. Hoi Va Pou stated that these results only came to fruition “thanks to the efforts of all parties involved”, which contribute to ensuring a “healthier and more sustainable development” of the gaming industry in the region.
From a long-term perspective, the vice-president of the IAS said she foresees the continued “carrying out of studies and educational and awareness-raising actions”, while at the same time promoting “awareness about gambling disorder among citizens and high-risk groups”, with the aim of “providing timely support to people and families in need”.
The forum also featured three presentation sessions led by Wu I Mui, head of the Division of Prevention and Treatment of Problem Gambling at IAS; Robert Ladouceur, professor emeritus at Laval University, Canada; and Davis Fong, professor and director of the UM Gaming Industry Studies Institute.
According to the IAS press release, the three experts “covered a range of topics, from the evolution of prevention and treatment services in the Macao SAR” and “strategies for promoting responsible gambling to studies on evaluating the effectiveness of prevention and treatment of gambling disorder”. The results of these studies were presented in the Wu See Sun library space at UM, followed by a series of thematic workshops on the topic.
The forum ended in the afternoon with the “symposium on prevention and treatment services for gambling disorder in Macau and Hong Kong”, in which representatives of various social service organizations from the two regions discussed and promised to deepen cooperation. “The organization hopes that holding this forum can give new impetus to the Macao SAR and neighboring regions, thus creating a healthier and more sustainable future in terms of the prevention and treatment of gambling disorder,” wrote the IAS in a statement. IAS is one of the organizers of the initiative, together with UM, the Macau Polytechnic University (UPM) and the Sheng Kung Hui Macau Social Services Coordination Office.
Last month, the IAS published a report on gambling addiction in which it reported an increasingly aging population of players made up, for the most part, of non-residents. Between January and June this year, only 48.94% of players had a Macao SAR Resident Identity Card – less than half, therefore, making up the lowest percentage since there has been registration.</description><pubDate>2025-10-12 22:32:24</pubDate></item><item><title>Gustav Mahler honored in Macau in the voice of Thomas Hampson</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/10/12/gustav-mahler-homenageado-em-macau-na-voz-de-thomas-hampson/</link><description>Gustav Mahler's work will be highlighted in the recital “Thomas Hampson Canta Mahler”, taking place at the Macau Cultural Center this Thursday. Award-winning North American baritone Thomas Hampson will give voice to some of the most famous compositions of the late 20th century, accompanied by pianist and frequent collaborator Gustav Mahler.

Baritone Thomas Hampson will perform at the Macau Cultural Center this Thursday, October 16th, at 8pm. The show, dedicated to the work of composer Gustav Mahler, is part of the program of the 37th edition of the Macau International Music Festival (FIMM). Tickets are available for sale with prices ranging from 150 to 400 patacas.
The recital, entitled “Thomas Hampson Sings Mahler”, also features the participation of German pianist Wolfgang Rieger, who will accompany the renowned baritone in interpretations of Gustav Mahler's work. Thomas Hampson is, in fact, one of the greatest interpreters of the Czech-Austrian composer's work, with a vast career of live performances, studio recordings and even academic studies dedicated to Mahler's art. In total, he has performed more than 80 operas and recorded more than 170 albums.
His work in this field earned him not only the “reputation of a ‘classical singer’”, as described by the Cultural Institute (IC) in a statement, but also the award of numerous musical awards at an international level, such as the Grammy Award, the Edison Award and the “Grand Prix du Disque”. The IC emphasizes that “the numerous international honors” that the artist received “for his unique art and cultural leadership” “fully reflect his illustrious status in the classical music circle”, which he consolidated over a career spanning more than four decades.
The concert is expected to last one hour and 25 minutes, with an intermission. In this space of time, the public will embark on a “thematic journey” through the “intricate poetry and complex psychological landscapes that define Mahler’s art”, divided into three thematic chapters: “Fables and Parables”, “Humoresques and Ballads” and “Ballads and Allegories”.
The selected themes cover a period between 1880 and 1901, including the cycle of old songs “Lieder und Gesänge aus der Jugendzeit” (“Songs and Rhymes of Youth”) and the cycle of songs “Des Knaben Wunderhorn” (“The Magic Horn of the Young”), focusing on themes such as “pastoral charm” and “satire on existential depth and metaphysical longing”. At the same time, the public is provided with “the opportunity to experience a blend of life wisdom and esteemed musicianship through the sound of [Hampson’s] voice at age 70”.
Thomas Hampson's career has resulted, over the years, in the awarding of titles such as “Kammersänger of the Wiener Staatsoper” or “Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters”, the latter awarded by the French Republic. More recently, in 2017, he received the Hugo Wolf Medal. In addition to being a musician, he is also co-founder and artistic director of the Lied Academy Heidelberg, founder of the Hampsong Foundation and consultant for Opera for Peace.
Wolfram Rieger, the pianist invited to participate in this session, is “in great demand as a recital partner and chamber musician”, and is a frequent collaborator of Thomas Hampson. Like the North American, his recordings earned him distinctions such as the Hugo Wolf Medal and also the Medal of the Franz Schubert Association of Barcelona.
 Tickets for the recital are available for sale at the Enjoy Macao Ticket Office, with various discounts available for seniors, students or customers of various banks.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>China defends new control of rare earths with “very limited” impact on supply</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/10/12/china-defende-novo-controlo-de-terras-raras-com-impacto-muito-limitado-no-abastecimento/</link><description>China's Ministry of Commerce yesterday defended the legitimacy of the new restrictions imposed last week on the export of rare earths, ensuring that the impact on supply chains will be “very limited”.

The measures are “a legitimate action by the Chinese government to fine-tune the export control system in accordance with laws and regulations,” a spokesperson for the Ministry of Commerce said in a statement.
“China’s export controls are not export bans and licenses will be granted for eligible requests,” the spokesperson said, adding that Beijing informed trading partners of the measures in advance, “through bilateral dialogue mechanisms.” “Companies should not be worried”, stressed the spokesperson.
Beijing argued once again that the restrictions aim to prevent rare earths and their transformation products from being used to produce military or defense items, in order to “defend world peace, regional stability and fulfill its international non-proliferation obligations”.
The ministry indicated that China has thoroughly assessed the potential impact of the new restrictions on industrial and supply chains and that this “is very limited”.
Chinese authorities announced, on Thursday, a new round of restrictions on the export of rare earths, essential for the manufacture of advanced technology, and added five new metals to the list of controlled products.
China, which controls more than 70% of world production and almost 90% of the transformation of this strategic material, has imposed restrictions on exports as a bargaining chip since the United States began the tariff war in April, although it has recently eased the measures as part of the trade truce between the two powers.
Rare earths have been a point of friction in recent Sino-US trade negotiations, with Washington accusing Beijing of deliberately delaying the approval of export licenses.
US President Donald Trump announced on Friday the imposition of a 100% surcharge on imports from China, starting in November, in response to “extremely hostile” trade measures by Beijing.
Starting November 1 – or even earlier, “depending on any future actions or changes taken by China” – the United States will impose “a 100% tariff on China, in addition to any tariff they are currently paying,” Trump said on the Truth social network.   Also at the beginning of next month, the Republican said, Washington will impose export controls on Beijing on “any and all critical software”.  Donald Trump's announcement is a typical example of 'double standards'”, reacted China.
The Chinese Ministry of Commerce considered that Washington's actions “seriously harm China's interests and undermine (…) the climate of economic and commercial discussions between the two parties”. “Constantly threatening high customs duties is not the right approach to cooperating with China,” the ministry added in a statement.
The new measures come shortly before the meeting of the leaders of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) in South Korea, where a possible meeting between the presidents of the two countries was expected, but which has now been called into question.

Secretaries André Cheong, Wong Sio Chak and O Lam heard proposals on national security, social security, training qualified personnel and recreational facilities, among others.
 
To prepare the Governing Action Lines (LAG), which should be presented next month, the Executive is already listening to the opinions of some local associations. Last Friday, three secretaries – O Lam, André Cheong and Wong Sio Chak – heard several proposals for their guardianships.
The Secretary for Security met with representatives from the General Association of Women of Macau, the General Association of Fukien Countrymen of Macau, the Macau Institution People's Alliance, the General Association of Overseas Chinese of Macau, the Federation of Workers' Associations of Macau, the Commercial Association of Macau, the General Union of Macau Residents' Associations and the General Union of Macau Residents' Associations. During the meeting, Wong Sio Chak heard suggestions on issues related to defending national security, crisis prevention and disaster response and reduction, prospective law enforcement strategies, smart policing, community policing and others.
According to a statement released by the Government after the meeting, representatives of the associations “recognized that the Security team has further consolidated issues related to national security, in the deepening and management of local society, creating, together with the different sectors of society, an effective cooperation mechanism that makes Macau one of the safest cities”.
The associations also presented opinions on national security, deepening the facilitation of the border crossing between Macau and Hengqin, the circulation of vehicles from Macau in Guangdong, national security education, preventing and combating fraud, border crossing, traffic, cybersecurity, intelligent policing, fire protection in buildings, drugs and careers and training actions for security force personnel.
It is recalled that Wong Sio Chak, in the role of Secretary for Security since 2014, will move to the Administration and Justice portfolio. The Security portfolio will be held by Chan Tsz King. Wong said, on this occasion, that the opinions collected will now be passed on to the new secretary.
André Cheong, who will leave the Administration and Justice portfolio precisely to Wong Sio Chak, also heard opinions from several associations, including the Federation of Workers' Associations of Macau, the Commercial Association of Macau, the General Union of Residents' Associations of Macau, the General Association of Women of Macau, the General Association of Overseas Chinese of Macau and the General Association of Fukien Countrymen of Macau. At the meeting, André Cheong also guaranteed that the transition of his portfolio is going well.
The opinions given to André Cheong had to do with improving municipal services, community governance, increasing recreational and leisure spaces and facilities, urban afforestation, channels for presenting suggestions from the population, electronic government, quality of life for residents, business environment, functioning of public services, careers for public servants and increasing administrative efficiency and strengthening legal education and civic awareness, for example. The secretary, who will become an appointed deputy in the Legislative Assembly, promised that the Government will take these opinions into account when implementing the LAG.
Finally, O Lam met with representatives from the Macau Education Association, the General Association of Fukien Countrymen of Macau, the Macau Institution People's Alliance, the General Union of Residents' Associations of Macau, the Federation of Workers' Associations of Macau, the General Association of Overseas Chinese of Macau, the General Association of Women of Macau, the Kong Mun Countrymen's Association of Macau, the Macau Youth Federation and the Macau Commercial Association.
Among the topics discussed at this meeting were the needs of the most disadvantaged groups, social security measures, population aging, family support measures, the educational system, medical services, medicine services, qualified staff training policies, major events, construction of the “show city” and the Macau and Hengqin International Education University City, and financial measures to support the development of industries, among others. Lam also promised that he will take the associations' suggestions into consideration.</description><pubDate>2025-10-12 22:35:41</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
