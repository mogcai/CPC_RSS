According to communications published on that ministry's website, Wang Yi spoke on the phone with the Pakistani counterpart, Ishaq to give, and India National Security Counselor Ajit Doval. Wang declared, in the conversation with Ishaq to give, Beijing's support to "Pakistan, to protect his national sovereignty and dignity."
The Chinese guardian said he hoped Islamabade "deal with the situation calmly and make a decision that corresponds to his fundamental interests in the long run." "Whenever a ceasefire is declared, both parties must respect him to prevent a conflict from re-appearing," he noted.
China "is willing to continue to play an active role in this regard," he said, adding that a ceasefire would not only benefit the two nuclear powers, but would also "help regional peace and stability." "And that's what the international community expects," he said.
In the telephone conversation with Doval, Wang welcomed the statement of India, who assumed that "war is not his choice," and said he hoped both sides "maintain calm and containment, correctly managing differences through negotiations and avoiding a climb of conflict."
Der expressed the availability of Pakistan to sign a ceasefire, but warned that “it will not reduce surveillance” and “will respond to any violation of territorial sovereignty” of the country. Doval said it was necessary to carry out anti -terrorist actions after the attack of Pahalgam, who killed 26 tourists -mostly Indians -and that was what led to the current crisis.
Other world leaders, such as United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres, and US President Donald Trump greeted the ceasefire agreement achieved between the two countries, and the latter stated that that was due to US mediation. However, just three hours after the covenant, India accused the pakly of violation of the truce by shooting the border and announced a "proportional response" of Indian troops. Islamabade assured that it was India to violate the signed terms and reaffirmed the commitment to the ceasefire.</description><pubDate>2025-05-12 03:14:44</pubDate></item><item><title>Ron Lam proposes tobacco tax increase</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/05/12/ron-lam-propoe-aumento-do-imposto-do-tabaco/</link><description>Deputy Ron Lam suggests increasing tobacco tax in Macao from 60% to 75%, as the World Health Organization recommends, in order to reduce the percentage of the people who smoke, especially the number of young smokers in the territory. He also asked the government to establish a calendar for a total ban on the use of electronic cigarettes in Macao.
 
Deputy Ron Lam presented a written interpellation to the executive where he defends the increase in tobacco tax in Macao, which has not been adjusted since 2015 and has been kept by about 60% of the tobacco retail price for ten years. The legislator understands that the effectiveness of smoking control “is increasingly weakened” and asks the respective tax to be high to 75% of the retail price of tobacco products.
"Tobacco tax in Macao is not yet in accordance with the 75% recommended by the World Health Organization as the most effective and profitable rate, and that, in fact, the increase in the tax is particularly effective in reducing the number of young smokers and is the most effective way to reduce the proportion of the smoke population," he said.
Ron Lam also recalled that the increase in tobacco tax was not a theme in the government agenda, since a report of monitoring and evaluation of the prevention and control regime of smoking in 2021 had proposed the adjustment of this tax, and the government also assumed that it was going to increase the tax “in a timely” while reviewing the smoking law in 2022. However, there is no news on the subject.
In questioning, the deputy said that although the government did not compromise the increase in tobacco tax, in the report on monitoring and evaluating the prevention and control regime of smoking, the authorities admit the “immediate decrease” of cigarette imports.
"After the government has substantially increased to the tobacco tax in 2015, the cigarette import volume this year decreased immediately. Import volume in 2016 of about 460 million cigarettes decreased by 42.5% compared to the 2015, and the cigarette import volume in the following years remained at a lower level," he said. The deputy added, however, that the cigarette import volume went down to 210 million by 2022, having recovered to 340 million cigarettes by 2023.
Regarding the reinforcement of tobacco control measures, the deputy also proposed the revision of the smoking control law, to refer to other international jurisdictions and stipulate that people born after a given year are expressly prohibited from buying tobacco products in order to “prevent young people from being exposed to the risks of smoking”.
It is recalled that the government has announced the plan to widen the banning zones in the outer space, as in the immediate vicinity of the entrances of schools and day care centers. At the same time, the possibility of designating the largest banning zones in squares or streets and the creation of smoke points in these zones will be studied. According to what had revealed Alvis Lo, director of health services, is also being considered the standardization of cigarette packaging to be “generic and neutral” without promotional elements.
Ron Lam considers that, in addition to the measures now proposed, the government must be on alert to the consumption of electronic cigarettes by the youngest generation. The deputy cited government data to point out that the rate of consumption of electronic cigarettes among young people aged 13 to 15 in Macau significantly increased 53.8% in 2021 compared to 2015.
The government has changed the law twice in 2018 and 2022 for the control of electronic cigarettes, but "it did not obviously not have looked at the popularity of electronic cigarettes among young people, even if the government prohibits the transport of electronic cigarettes in Macao," he said. In this sense, the deputy considers that the authorities must establish a period of transition and a deadline for prohibiting the use of electronic cigarettes in the city, rather than just prohibiting their production, distribution, sale, import and export.</description><pubDate>2025-05-12 03:17:34</pubDate></item><item><title>Government says that exclusion of the press 'online' and monthly is common practice</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/05/12/governo-diz-que-exclusao-de-imprensa-online-e-mensal-e-pratica-comum/</link><description>The government said it is “common practice” to exclude the online and monthly press from a public event. The message followed by the arrest of two journalists from an online newspaper recently, as well as a Fund press conference for the development of science and technology to which the online press has not been invited.
 
Macao authorities described as “common practice” the exclusion of the online and monthly press from a public event, two weeks after the arrest of two journalists from an online newspaper.
"The organizer defines the appropriate provisions for the news coverage of the event according to nature, content and place (…), giving priority to television and radio stations, publications with more frequent pereity and news agencies," said the Macao Government Communication Office (GCs) in a written response.
On Thursday, the GCS spread a note about the signing of a agreement between Macao and France for the creation of a joint scientific research program. “Only daily and weekly newspapers reporters, TV stations, radio stations and news agencies are invited to interview,” said the Fund for Science and Technology Development (FDCT) note.
Lusa asked FDCT the reasons for excluding the 'online' and monthly press from the ceremony, but has not received any response so far. The GCS said that "it is noteworthy that the media professionals must fulfill the laws and regulations in performing their functions."
Asked by Lusa, the cabinet gave no reason to, after the signature ceremony of the agreement, chaired by the secretary for the economy and finance, Tai Kin IP, the journalists present not entitled to ask questions.
On April 17, two All About Macau journalists, an online newspaper with a monthly paper version, were detained by police while trying to enter the local parliament hall to attend the presentation of the political program in the area of ​​administration and justice to 2025.
On Tuesday, in the first public comment to the incident, the Legislative Assembly claimed that there was a "great influx" of journalists and that "the space for interviews, as well as the places available in the Plenary Room are limited." A justification that had already been rejected, as early as April 17, by All About Macau, since "apparently there were still vague places" for the media in the main hall.
On Tuesday, the newspaper accused the Legislative Assembly of preventing "repeatedly All About Macao journalists from doing their normal reporting work under false pretexts." Also the Macao Journalists Association (AJM) stated that it “deeply regrets” the detention of reporters, including the president of this organization, Ian Sio Tou.
This group of Chinese journalists had previously expressed concern about the increase of official events without coverage of social communication and “discriminatory practices” with the sector. "The unprecedented situation that occurred is sad and worries us, because we consider that it opens a precedent-at least-embarrassing," also reacted to Lusa the president of the Macao Press and English Press Association (Aipim), José Miguel Incarnation.
The Society of Journalists and European Communication Professionals in Asia (JOCPA) told Lusa that Portugal should have made “a discrete gesture or an expression of concern” in the face of the arrest of journalists. "We consider the silence of Portugal worrying, given its deep historical and cultural bonds with Macao," lamented the president of the JOCPA, Josep Solano.

“We wanted to show the relationship with the ocean in Portugal,” says Kengo Kuma, when asked what was the project's inspiration.
Portugal participates in Expo Osaka with the theme “Ocean, Blue Dialogue” and is located in the “Empowering Lives” zone, in a lot with 1,836.75 square meters, being close to the Japan Pavilion.
The Kuma Kuma project expresses the dynamics of the ocean moment, using 9,972 suspended cables weighing more than 60 tons, and recycled networks to create a perennial effect and exposed to natural elements such as sun and wind, according to the organization.
The life of Portugal and Japan is “very linked to the ocean”, in the sense that “we eat fish, we travel a lot through the oceans and history and life are closely linked to the ocean,” adds the architect.
There is this “uniqueness of Portugal and Japan and we want to show” this similarity between the two countries.
The volume of the Portugal Pavilion is characterized by a scenic facility that symbolizes the upper square suspended as a wave. "This design is very, very new to the history of art. We have long tried to use lines as a resource for navigation. With these lines, we try to show the beauty of natural phenomena," in the sea "we see natural light and breeze," he explains. “We tried to bring this kind of natural phenomenon to the Expo, perhaps the first attempt in the history of the expo to bring its own nature to the pavilion,” says the architect.
Asked if Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a friend or enemy of architecture, Kengo Kuma opts for the first option. "Yes, it's a friend", because in fact in the design process "we are working with AI".
Artificial intelligence “is a very strong team between us” and “we like to work” with this technology, he says.
About what will happen to the pavilion after finishing the Expo, the architect says he wants to bring the diversity of the project (which includes cables of various diameters and lengths) to different places. “I want to bring this diversity to different places” and “now we are planning to work with some artists” about it.
Kengo Kuma said that the Slaughterhouse Project in Porto is concluded and has two more projects in Portugal.
The architect says worship the large cities in Portugal, but also the mountainous side and the ocean of the country. “We want to enjoy the diversity of Portugal,” he says.
Asked how can the architecture more sustainable today, Kengo Kuma considers that "the most important for sustainability is to leave the memory of architecture forever." That is, "architecture, life, basically, are not so permanent."
However, “we can leave the memory of architecture forever, which is the connection between architecture and humanity” and this “is the most important for sustainability,” he says.
Used to comment on the controversy around his choice to design the Portuguese pavilion, the architect points out that he has an international office working in Portugal. "Maybe that's why we were invited," he concludes.
Regarding the challenges that architecture currently faces, Kengo Kuma states that its cost is increasing “dramatically” and that everyone wants to reduce it. "But at the same time, people want to create a new monument" for this pillar. "And the cost and monumentality must walk together" today.
Expo 2025 runs from April 13 to 13 from Yumeshima's artificial island, located on the edge of Osaka, Kansai, Japan.

In this visit, which follows the Moscow, where he watched, Friday, the celebrations of the day of victory over Nazism and met with Vladimir Putin, Lula da Silva will meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping, and will attend the fourth meeting of the China-Celac Forum (Latin American and Caribbean Community).
China has been Brazil's largest commercial partner since 2009 and the government has in advance an entourage consisting of ministers to prepare Lula da Silva's visit, whose announced objective is to attract investments from the Asian giant in infrastructure projects, as well as creating alternatives in global trade.
Leonardo Trevisan, professor of economics and international relations at the Pontifical Catholic University (PUC-SP) and the School of Advertising and Marketing (ESPM), stressed that the visit happens at a delicate moment and that China is a fundamental partner for Brazil, but recalled that entrepreneurs and the Brazilian government also work not to lose proximity to the Americans.
"Brazil has never had a concentration in a single country in all Brazilian economic history. China today owns 35% of Brazilian exports and 80% of our main product, which is soy, and practically 70% of oil products (…). China occupies a space in the very relevant Brazilian economic scenario," he said.  "However, even with this space, for various reasons, even for a cultural identity with American reality, today there is also a formal request for Brazilian business leadership with productive structures, with US productive chains," added Trevisan.
Asked if China would today be a partner in the most reliable global scenario for Brazil than the United States, an assessment by the Brazilian international advisor, Celso Amorim, the expert stressed that in the relationship with the Chinese prevails the idea “friends, friends, business apart”.
"Friendship with China is a situation, it is a reality, but business aside. China is today the great buyer of Brazilian exports," he said. "But taking into account what we have, our history, all our experience, everything we have with American culture, maybe it's a little difficult for us to say that we will suddenly make a spin in this regard," he added.
Trevisan pointed out that Brazil did not join the new Silk Route, an international infrastructure project launched by Beijing for over a decade, and noted that, although smaller, Brazilian exports to the United States have higher added value. "While we sell commodities to China, to the United States we sell products that have value added, products that generate employment here, products that consume technology, products that somehow make Brazil more updated in global production chains," he explained.
In a recent movement, China has increased Brazilian soybean purchases due to the tariffs imposed against the United States, another major soybean exporter. The replacement of US soybeans has been quoted by US producers' associations that fear losing the Chinese market irreversibly.
Asked if this hinders the Brazilian position in 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum tariffs imposed by the United States, Trevisan assessed no.
"The United States understand that we are selling soy, but our industry made it very clear that it intends to continue like this, even with quotas, very close to the American industry," he repeated. "The United States will probably understand that they are momentary business and that China has offered to buy. Another thing is well -built economic ties over decades with productive chains," he concluded.

The PPP-Party in Power-was made with the National Election Commission, after the General Assembly of Political Formation rejected a motion on Saturday, which wanted the candidate for the June 3 elections to be former Prime Minister Han Duck-Woo.
Han and Kim tried unsuccessfully over the past week to reach consensus and unite the candidacies to avoid fragmentation of the conservative party's votes, which is expected to suffer at the polls the consequences of the deep political crisis triggered by the declaration of martial law in December by the deposed President Yoon Suk-Yeol.
Han Duck-Woo has been interim president of the country on two different occasions after Yoon's dismissal, and has sought to dissociate himself from the controversial leader and the brief statement of martial law.
Kim, for his part, was Minister of Labor, having been appointed presidential candidate in the PPP primaries. However, the former minister's candidacy was found with the appearance of Han, who had the support of the PPP board. "This presidential election is crucial, as it will define a leader capable of overcoming the crisis our nation faces and working for the happiness of the people," Kim told reporters after registering the candidacy in the election agency's offices in Gwacheon, southern Seoul.
Prior to the presidential election of June 3, the party candidate in power has announced that he will focus the strategy in building a large coalition, both inside and outside the party, with the aim of reaching national unity and listening to the voice of the people.</description><pubDate>2025-05-12 03:19:14</pubDate></item><item><title>Macau companies participated in the Guangzhou Fair</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/05/12/empresas-de-macau-participaram-na-feira-de-guangzhou/</link><description>The 137th China Import and Export Fair was recently held and was attended by 19 companies from Macau, with the support of the Institute for the Promotion of Commerce and Investment (IPIM).

The first exhibition “The Lisbon, Stories of Macao” honors over 500 years of cultural exchange in Macao with eight interactive games thematic zones, resident testimonies and immersive artificial intelligence experiences. The entrance is free.
 
Grand Lisboa Palace's first art gallery opened to the public last Thursday, May 8, with the inaugural exhibition “The Lisbon, Stories of Macau”, centered on more than 500 years of evolution and multiculturality of the territory. The event was attended by several relevant personalities of the political, cultural and artistic panoramas of Macao and the interior of China, including the first head of the Executive of Masters, Edmund Ho, and the Portuguese Consul General in Macao and Hong Kong, Alexandre Leitão.
SJM's new creative space is a celebration of contemporary artistic expression in all its forms, from the collection of historical artifacts to the creation of interactive experiences using state-of-the-art technology. The objective, recognizes the director of SJM, is to boost the artistic scene of Macau and contribute to the promotion of local culture among the millions of tourists who enter the territory every month.
“Through the inaugural exhibition 'The Lisbon, Stories of Macau', we created an inclusive cultural platform that feeds Macau's Soft Power and strengthens the city's heritage connection to the city's heritage, telling the story of Macau through our voices,” says Daisy Ho, quoted in a press release. "The gallery also brings together indigenous creative talents, to promote diverse and high quality developments in the creative cultural landscape."
The first point of attraction of the space, located on the second floor, serves as a tribute to the diverse mosaic of Macau, a region fueled by oriental and western influences from the Ming and Qing dynasties. Visitors are invited to enter a circular room and admire a five -minute panoramic film where Macau's trajectory is narrated, traveling the origins as Chinese Commercial Port, the influence of Portuguese administration and, finally, the return to the homeland.
Already within the exhibition, there are eight thematic zones leaning over different points of interest in Macao: the Kun Iam temple (one of the oldest Buddhist temples in the region); Hotel Lisboa Macau (which “captures the golden age” of Macau, reads the SJM press release); The Dom Pedro V Theater (as a symbol of the fusion between Chinese and Western art); Tap Seac Square (representing community life); The ruins of São Paulo (one of the most relevant historical icons in the territory); Casa Garden (proof of the city's cultural exchanges); The A-Má Temple (older monument than the city itself, included in the UNESCO World Heritage Site list); And finally, Avenida de Almeida Ribeiro (or “San Ma Lou”, one of the most influential areas in Macao).
Each of these zones presents their own specific narratives, including reports from macanese citizens of different origins and professions. Visitors are invited to integrate the exhibition through interactive technologies sensitive to movement and voice, creating an immersive sensory experience in which it is even possible to “dialogue” with stories through artificial intelligence.
Inside the Greater Lisbon Palace gallery, there is still a smaller space - “The Lisbon Collection” - where several temporary thematic exhibitions will be presented, starting with the current “Chinese Treaster: Qing Dynasty Court Art”. Both in this exposure and the main, the figure of the dragon appears recurrently as an ancient symbol of Chinese identity.
The gallery can be visited every day, from 11:00 to 19:00, in the 213 store of the second floor of the Greater Lisboa Palace. The entrance is free.

The exercise, held on Thursday, mobilized 600 mm multiple rocket launchers, known internationally such as KN-25, and Hwasongpho-11ka tactical missiles, or KN-23, aiming to train participating units in the operating procedures of these systems, under the National Nuclear Armament Management System.
Kim Jong-un stated that continuous modernization of artillery and tactical nuclear weapons is essential to reinforce the deterrent and expand the operational capabilities of the popular army.
Exercise demonstrates the capacity of the North Korean Armed Forces to quickly react to changes in the military situation, noted KCNA, in reference to the joint nuclear exercises that the United States and Allies performed in the region.
In April, Seoul and Washington carried out Iron Mace 25-1 to coordinate a joint response to nuclear threats.
Although the Pyongyang regime has presented exercise as a response to external tensions, it is possible to be a technical test to improve missiles. The presence of high employees involved in the development of weapons reinforces this hypothesis, wrote the Spanish news agency Efe.
The South Korean army detected several short-range ballistic missiles from Wonsan's eastern coastal town on Thursday, between 08:10 and 09:20, which ran up to 800 kilometers before they fell into the east.
In a statement, South Korea, Japan and the United States considered the launch a “threat to peace and regional and international security” and recalled that this type of tests violates the UN Security Council resolutions.</description><pubDate>2025-05-12 03:19:12</pubDate></item><item><title>Mother's Day: Associations call for more support for mothers</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/05/12/dia-da-mae-associacoes-apelam-a-mais-apoio-as-maes/</link><description>Yesterday was signaled in Macau Mother's Day, occasion of several traditional local associations to appeal more support for mothers.

Mother's Day was celebrated yesterday in Macau, the second Sunday of May, a celebration height dedicated to honoring mothers and motherhood. Several traditional associations in Macao, besides thanking mothers for their contribution to families and society, took the opportunity to request policies to support mothers, namely working mothers. Among the requests, we highlight the increase in the days of parental license, raising days off for parents to take care of children and accompany their children to medical appointments, as well as greater support for pregnant and newborn.
The president of the General Association of Women, Lau Kam Ling, admits that, in traditional Chinese family culture, mothers “always take responsibility” to take care of their family, so they face different challenges when they work in their careers. In this sense, the official stressed that the whole society is necessary, including the government, companies and social organizations, to work together so that women have “full choices and opportunities” in participation in society and professional development, as well as in the construction of their families.
The center of collective wisdom policy, linked to the general union of Macao's residents' associations, also said it was aware of women's working pressure in Macau, suggesting additional parenting licenses and flexible working hours for workers working on shift regime. It was also proposed that the government grants subsidy to private companies to create “fully equipped” breastfeeding rooms to facilitate the care of babies by the newborn.
Quoted in a press release, the center of collective wisdom policy has urged the government and non-governmental organizations that pay greater attention to the physical and mental health of newly members and pregnant women.
“They should create a direct support line for social workers to provide psychological support for residents during their pregnancy and after delivery, organizing more seminars and courses on psychological adaptation and parenting,” said the entity. He also suggested that he “encourages future parents to participate in seminars or workshops on postnatal psychological problems and create postnatal rehab training courses with private medical institutions or social organizations” so that women receive better physical and psychological care.
The Federation of Macao Workers' Associations, in turn, renewed the request to the government about the increase in the number of paid maternity leave and the number of mandatory holidays, in order to relieve the workload of the families in which both parents work.
At the same time, the Macao Establishment Povo Alliance, a Fujian community association, stressed that, in addition to financial support, Macao workers still need more protection of labor rights and interests at the legal level. Also sharing the same request with other social service associations on the extension of maternity leave, the alliance of the people also expects “breastfeeding licenses” and “parental holidays” to be referenced by neighboring regions, so that working mothers can ask for clearances to deal with family issues or take care of children.
It is recalled that in Hong Kong, civil servants who have children up to three years old can have three days off a year in the care of children, while in Taiwan workers can have up to seven days off for family matters.</description><pubDate>2025-05-12 03:18:38</pubDate></item><item><title>Intercalary elections in the Philippines are test for President Marcos Jr.</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/05/12/eleicoes-intercalares-nas-filipinas-sao-teste-para-o-presidente-marcos-jr/</link><description>Monday's interchange elections in the Philippines are seen as a referendum to the management of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., with the polls showing that the coalition of former head of state Rodrigo Duterte is well positioned.
 
At stake there are half of the 24 seats of the influential Senate, whose results dominate most of the attention, as well as the entire low of Congress Chamber, as well as 18,000 places in the main municipalities of the country.
Marcos Jr., or Bongbong as he is known, has been at the front line of the campaign, with a list of 11 Senate candidates.
Among them are renowned names of Philippine Policy, such as Erwin Tulfo, a member of the House of Representatives and the most supported candidate for a senator place, according to a Social Weather Stations (SWS) inquiry, and the world's presidential candidate Manny Pacquiao.
Candidates supported by the alliance for the new Philippines (Alyansa to Sa Bagong Pilipinas) by Marcos Jr. “continue to lead the polls just a week before the elections”, with eight of them well placed to win a senator place.
"Since we took office in July 2022, the Philippine economy is recognized worldwide as one of the fastest growing. That's why the Philippines are known today," Marcos Jr. said in a 'preview rally' in Manila, as they are known in the Asian country the great electoral events in which the parties end the campaigns.
However, polls also show the strength of other candidates supported by the coalition of former President Rodrigo Duterte, accused of crimes against humanity by the bloody drug war and detained since March in The Hague waiting for trial.
Senator Bong Go, who seeks reelection, is the second candidate in the polls, while at local level a poll held by the University of Mindanau pointed out that Duterte could win the presidency of the Davao Chamber, his stronghold in the south of the country, despite not being in the archipelago of more than seven thousand islands.
The campaign began marked by the dispute between Marcos Jr. and the Philippine Vice President, Sara Duterte, an alliance formed to gain power in 2022, but shortly after victory began to collapse.
Duterte's arrest came to feed the confrontation between the two fields, surpassing the political lines. Senator Filipina Imee Marcos, the president's older sister and Duterte supporter, took the break with Bongbong's electoral list.
About 68 million Philippines are called to choose 12 senators, 254 district representatives, 63 party representatives and 17,942 governors, members of provincial assemblies, mayors and counselors.
The scrutiny will also cover the legislative seats of the Bangasamoro Muslim Autonomous Region, on the island of Mindanao, the second largest in the archipelago in the south. The Portuguese MEO Marta Temis (PS) will lead the EU electoral observation mission to these Philippine Legislatures.

At a unusual meeting held on Friday on the sidelines of Russian Victory Day celebrations, Xi Jinping pledged to provide the necessary assistance to the reconstruction of the neighboring country and to contribute to Myanmar's development and stability, the Daily controlled by the military New Light of Myanmar reported.
MIN AUNG HLING, which has been promoting the Burmese international agenda since the earthquake, has grateful to Beijing, who has significant investments in Myanmar, a country immersed in a deep crisis following the 2021 military coup.
This was believed to be the first time that the Chinese leader and the Burmese general have met in person since the revolt.
The military coup isolated the country from the international community and Min Aung Haling was forbidden to participate in the summits of leaders of the Southeast Asia Nations Association (Asean), of which Myanmar is a member. On the other hand, it has made some trips to Russia, the main arms supplier of the military junta.
Since the magnitude 7.7 earthquake, which hit the country's center on March 28, the Burmese general has moved to Bangkok twice, to participate in a regional summit of Bengal Bay countries, and to meet the Prime Minister of Malaysia, a country that holds Asean's rotary presidency this year.
During the meeting with XI, the Burmese military reiterated the often postponed plan to hold general elections before the end of the year. This plan is considered a scam by independent opponents and groups.
Burma UK, an anti-dim organization, said in a statement that the Burmese regime is “exploring in its own benefit” the post-12th catastrophic situation in an attempt to gain “international legitimacy”. "The media controlled by the military and social networks were full of photographs of Min Aung Hlaing talking to the phone with presidents and prime ministers in the region, several of whom rejected it from the coup," the group director Mark Farmaner said in a statement.
The coup of February 1, 2021 ended a decade of democratic transition in Myanmar and deepened the guerrilla war that has lasted for decades in the country.</description><pubDate>2025-05-12 03:14:44</pubDate></item><item><title>Chinese Central Bank calls for coordination between policies to strengthen economy</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/05/12/banco-central-chines-pede-coordenacao-entre-politicas-para-fortalecer-economia/</link><description>The Chinese Central Bank has requested greater coordination between monetary, tax and social policies to boost prices and strengthen consumption in a prolonged pressure scenario over the main infacting indicators.
 
In the monetary policy report in the first quarter, Banco Popular da China recorded that the country is going through a phase marked at low prices due to low internal demand, excess capacity in some industries and intense competition between companies, said EFE.
The Chinese Central Bank pointed out that it is due to a high price containment to the prevention of persistently low levels and a focus on expanding the economy dimension to higher quality development.
To reach these goals, the bank announced a loan mechanism of the 500 billion yuans (about 61,495 million euros) for various sectors, such as accommodation, restoration, culture, education and elderly, details the Spanish news agency.
The measure will cover 26 financial institutions, including state entities and commercial banks importance in the system.
The report also suggests the issuance of guidelines for consumer financing, increasing the granting of loans to specific sectors and reinforcing support for small businesses and technological innovation.
Banco Popular da China also noted that it will maintain a “moderately accommodary” monetary policy, with sufficient liquidity and open market instruments, reserve ratios and re -programming programs.
The document also addressed the bond market, where interest rates have been shown, despite sustained growth.
At the end of 2024, the market reached a total volume of 177 billion yuans - the second largest in the world, but in which there are imbalances in price formation and institutional participation.
The Chinese bank reiterated that the expansion of public debt continues within the sustainable margins, supported by the size of public assets - especially with public companies to represent a participation equivalent to 119% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
Despite the 5.4% climb of GDP in the first three months of the year, recovery faces risks associated with low demand, geopolitical tensions and slowly departure from the real estate crisis.
In addition to customs tariffs, low internal and external demand, as well as the risk of deflation and the real estate crisis that has not yet ended have pressured Chinese performance, with analysts seeing the world's second largest economy to have a lower than expected recovery after COVID-19 combat measures.
