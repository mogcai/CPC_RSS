With fewer online sessions and an increasing focus on young academics, today, in Lisbon, the Spring 2025 conferences and end on March 28th. The event is organized by the Macao Scientific and Cultural Center (CCCM) and intends to have increasing utility in the investigation developed by the Portuguese scientific community, especially in relations between Portugal, the territory, the mainland China and the Asia.
The idea began to germinate during the Covid-19 pandemic, when half the world was confined at home. After a workshop for Zoom, in the spring of 2021, with different researchers in Portugal and worldwide, it was then decided to create a greater event dedicated to the Portuguese scientific community to work on Asia. Since then in a hybrid format, between online and the face -to -face, the bet is to have the academics, increasingly, in CCCM, to create calls in Lisbon. "This year, foreign investigators no longer talk about zoom," said CCCM president Carmen Amado Mendes, to the end, highlighting one of the news of the 2025 edition. "The fact that the focus is on an increasingly face -to -face environment will make this environment conducive to networking, which has been feeling even more evident this year," says the leader.
Another novelty concerns the participation of young academics. With the spring conferences to be always preceded by sessions directed to this group, there was something different in the 2025 edition. In addition to the 40 doctoral students of the CCCM, with the Foundation for Science and Technology scholarship, which presented their work, between March 10 and 12, also participated yesterday, external researchers. "The idea is to attract young researchers to this house, which, traditionally, was always much more dedicated to seniors," he says.
Also in the field of program changes this year, the leader highlights the institutional day, which this year takes place on March 24, dedicated to institutions that have Asian studies in her program. “Last year, the theme was Asian studies in the Iberian Peninsula and we had a large participation of Spanish researchers. This year, the focus is on publications, that is, the publications that these institutions that have Asian studies have to offer and the editorial opportunities that exist for researchers, ”he says, stressing that“ the goal is whenever the conferences are the utmost use for those who study the area ”.
 
The program
 
The opening of the event begins with this year's guest's speech, the Dean of the University of Lisbon, Henrique Leitão. The range of speakers also includes the president of CCCM, the president of Camões-Institute of Cooperation and Language, Florbela Paraíba, the director of the Diplomatic Institute-Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ana Paula Zacarias, and the director of the National Agency Erasmus+ Education and Training, Cristina Perdigão. Also open the session of the president of the Foundation for Science and Technology, Madalena Alves, and the coordinator of international affairs of the National Innovation Agency, Mafalda Dourado. “The perspective of this opening session is always to talk about research opportunities, career opportunities for researchers and other people's experience sharing in this context,” says Carmen Amado Mendes.
The session ends with the inauguration of the exhibition “A China Multissecular View through Forms and Colors”, by José Manuel Duarte de Jesus. "He was our ambassador in Beijing and has been doing a lot of research and published on China, but he is also a great painter and will present us with some works that reflect his travels and experiences through China," he says.
Spring 2025 conferences will continue with the sessions dedicated to Macao, starting tomorrow and until March 17.

At the time, the chief executive promised to transform the central authorities' guidelines into "concrete actions", but warned that there are economic problems that persist and said "the financial revenues of the current year may not be as high as expected."
 
Yesterday, at the headquarters of the Central Popular Government Cabinet in the MSAR, a transmission session of the Spirit of the “two sessions”-meetings of the National People's Assembly (APN) and the Chinese People's Political Advisory Conference (CCPPC) were held at the headquarters. In the speech he gave at the time, the chief executive assured: “We will transform the spirit of the 'two sessions' into concrete actions, tirelessly open new development horizons to Macau in the context of participation and support for Chinese style modernization, thus contributing even more significant to the construction of a large country and for national revitalization”.
Sam Hou Fai stated that since he took office in December last year, the government "has led the various sectors of society in learning" and implemented the "spirit consecrated in the important speeches of Mr. Presidente XI during his visit to Macao."
The Chief Executive assured that it will be safeguarded “firmly” to “sovereignty, security and interests of the country's development, consolidate the safeguarding of national security and defend social peace and stability”. It will also be implemented “fully” the “Macao Macao governed by Patriotas” principle to “ensure successful realization” of the legislative elections that are held in September.
Under the public administration reform, Sam said that “coordination mechanisms will be created to solve communication obstacles, coordination and the guilt between public services”. The boss also indicated that the executive will "reorganize his functional structure and reform workers management."
Sam Hou Fai also took the opportunity to leave some demands to civil service workers, saying that they must have “a conjunctural view, act with pragmatic spirit, notion of responsibility, solidarity and integrity”. According to the government leader, civil servants, in particular medium and high level leaders, should "equate the relationship between the good performance of their own functions and innovation and reform, liberalize thinking and innovate with courage." It has also been suggested to equate "the relationship between acting strictly under the law and effectively use discretionary power, and must be firmly ensured that the omission of acting under the law is not allowed."
Regarding the integrated development of Macao and Hengqin, Sam Hou Fai promised to “enhance Macao's leadership” and increase the investment of MSAR. "We will do bold renovations, brave exploration of opportunities and bold advances," he said.
 
“Complex and volatile” economic environment
 
In the speech, Sam Hou Fai pointed out that "the internal and external environment of Macau's economic development is complex and volatile, the global economy faces factors of instability and uncertainty" and "the structural problems of Macau's internal economy persist."
The chief executive even said that the postpandeia recovery dynamic "has slowed down" and "the financial revenues of the current year may not be as high as expected, so it is necessary to study the future economic situation prudently."
Still, it has guaranteed, "the government will increase investment, optimize the business environment and accelerate the cultivation and development of diverse emerging industries." In addition, it will reinforce "coordination and effectively implement the plan for the development of the proper diversification of the economy" and "will apply a global approach to support small and medium enterprises and reinforce the economic vitality of the community."
Sam reiterated that “the well-being of the population is an absolute priority”, promising support for the elderly, young people, people with disabilities and disadvantaged groups.
Finally, the boss stressed that efforts will be intensified for cooperation with the interior of China, as well as expanding to Southeast Asia markets, southern Asia and Northeast Asia and cooperation and exchange with Portuguese and Spanish -speaking countries. The aim is that Macau is a “higher quality opening platform”, and “an important window for exchange and mutual understanding between Chinese and Western civilizations,” concluded Sam Hou Fai.</description><pubDate>2025-03-14 05:18:43</pubDate></item><item><title>Filipino drug war mentor seeks to avoid detention by international court</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/03/14/mentor-de-guerra-as-drogas-filipino-procura-evitar-detencao-por-tribunal-internacional/</link><description>The mentor of the war against drugs in the Philippines, Ronald of her Rosa, wants to protect the state to avoid possible detention on accusations of humanity crimes by the International Criminal Court (ICC).
 
“I am sad in the name of all the Filipino people because we have a president who does not comply with his word,” said Rosa-Senator and former police officers during the term of former Chief of Staff Rodrigo Duterte (2016-2022)-in an interview with Filipina DZBB radio station, accusing Ferdinand Marcos Jr. de Traction for allowing Duterte detention.
From her Rosa said she hoped the Philippine authorities will protect him from a possible ORDER ORGANIZED by the TPI, due to your position as a senator. “As long as the Senate president can, he must protect me first and not surrender me, even if an arrest warrant is issued. I also hope that the executive branch respects this, because there are protocols for that, ”Dela Rosa told the Philippine media on Wednesday.
On Tuesday, when Rodrigo Duterte was unexpectedly arrested on arrival at the Philippines coming from Hong Kong, lawyer Israelito Torreon tried to force the Supreme Court to force the authorities to release Duterte and to protect the former police chief.
The Supreme Court ruled on Wednesday that the petition did not justify the urgency of the matter, but did not completely reject it. "They gave us ten days to send our arguments" about the case, "said her Rosa.
The ICC did not publicly comment whether to order the detention of the former police chief, while from her Rosa is campaigning for the interchange elections of May 12, in which the senator attempts his reelection.
However, while from her Rosa tries to prevent a still hypothetical warrant of detention, on Wednesday she also stated ready to join Duterte as detained in The Hague, Netherlands, "hoping to be able to take care of former President Philippino.
Duterte, 79, was handed over to the ICC on Wednesday, following a mandate issued against the former chief of state, who led to his detention on Tuesday during his arrival in Manila.
TPI judges have indicated that “there are reasonable reasons” to believe that members of the so -called Davao Death Squad (DDS) and the Philippine Authority agents “attacked a large number of individuals allegedly involved in criminal activities” between November 1, 2011 and March 16, 2019.
Considered the mentor of Duterte's drug war, her Rosa was also under investigation by the ICC and claimed last October that she ignored the requests to be interviewed by the ICC.
About 6,000 people died in anti-drug operations and extrajudicial executions during Duterte's violent campaign, according to police data, although local non-governmental organizations estimate the number in over 30,000 people.

The exhibition includes works by four Ukiyo-E renowned masters. The first, Katsushika Hokusai, famous for his iconic sea representations, such as "Chie in UMI: Miyatogawa naganawa", the iconic wave of Hokusai. Another Master Utagawa Hiroshige, recognized by the portraits of Japanese landscapes, which include the work “Koganei-hi Yūshō”. The third master is Kitagawa Utamaro, famous for his portraits of feminine beauty, such as “Utamaro’s Selected Masterpieces: Flowers of Language In Full Bloom - Ochhappi” and finally, Suzuki Harunobu, who innovated the world of wood prints with his multicolored impressions, especially “The Heron Maiden”.

Last year, foreign investors bought $ 5.9 billion (5.4 billion euros) of space for offices, hotels, industry and retail, the lowest value since 2014, according to data from the sector compiled by the MSCI financial group.
During the same period, investors sold $ 6.9 billion (6.3 billion euros) of assets, setting the net sale of $ 969 million (890 million euros). This amount raised accumulated output flows between 2021 and 2024 to 11.2 billion dollars (10.3 billion euros), exceeding the net inputs of the combined previous two years.
Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, global funds have been liquid sellers in all segments except industrial active. "The office market has received a new product, which means that the existing offer faces descending pressure on occupation and lace," said Benjamin Chow, Asia's head of real estate research at MSCI. “Investors have also been less purchasing” since interest rates have increased to counteract inflation from the end of 2022, he added.
Office spaces, once favored by investment funds that bet on China's rapid economic development, suffered the impact of withdrawal as occupancy rates fell. Net alienations rose to $ 1.9 billion (1.7 billion euros) last year, the highest value among all classes of commercial assets.
Blackstone, the world's largest asset manager, sold three logistics projects in the Great Bay area, the megameropolis that brings together nine cities in Guangdong Province, Macau and Hong Kong, to Chinese group Ping at Insurance Group, in February, according to information advanced by Bloomberg. Canada Pension Plan Investment Board sold its 49% stake in four commercial complexes to the public company Dajia Insurance in January.
The Hong Kong promoter ParkView Group has set for sale its Fang Cao Di Complex in Beijing in December, due to the weak profitability of income.
These transactions suggest that market recovery should not occur anytime soon, as trust in China's commercial real estate market remains fragile, analysts according to analysts. "This was partly driven by a drop in market liquidity and overall investment, with major investor groups such as listed real estate funds and corporate buyers, significantly retreating due to the aggravation of macroeconomic conditions," wrote Chow do MSCI.
Beijing launched a package of stimuli to try to boost domestic consumption and the real estate sector. However, due to over -supply, more time will be needed for the favorable winds of policies to translate into a better operating environment for companies, as well as higher income for owners and investors, analysts.
This year, about 6.4 million square meters of office space will be sold in the main cities of China, which represents a 70%increase, compared to the previous year, according to real estate consultant CBRE. This situation may rise the average vacancy rates to 26.7%, by the end of the year, against 23.5% in the previous year, he added.
Although industrial and logistical properties have been the most resilient assets in the last five years, demand from e -commerce companies began to decrease, by the end of 2023. The vacancy rates were designed to increase to 21.7% this year, 21%, in 2024, according to the CBRE.
In the retail trade segment, vacancy rates in 11 first and second level cities of China are expected to increase to 10.5%, an average of 10.4% in 2024, according to real estate consultant Savills.

South Korea, an important metal producer in Asia, has refrained from taking any immediate retaliation measures after the rates on Wednesday.
Instead, Seoul sent the Minister of Commerce to Washington to accelerate negotiations with US President Donald Trump's administration. "Choi asked for maximum effort in negotiations with the US and ordered employees to ensure that a rapid influx of steel materials that could not be exported to the US and other countries would not cause interruptions in the domestic market," Choi's office said through a Bloomberg statement.
Trump's new rates are added to trade measures introduced in their first term, which included the removal of exemptions to multiple countries, and extend to new product categories.
The risk for steelmakers around the world is that tariffs aggravate excess supply, pressing producers and governments, at a time when searching for the metal league is already in trouble. Shortly after the tariffs are entry into force, South Korean Minister of Industry, Ahn Duk-Geun, called a meeting with business leaders and discussed ways to reinforce a joint response to US tariffs.
Seoul will submit contracted in response to new US rules for steel trade and other imports related to imports, which will include reinforced control of imports and dropout efforts, said the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Energy in a statement. "We will protect the interests of our industries as much as possible, further reinforcing the response system before reciprocal tariffs come into force in early April, as announced," said Ahn. The South Korean ruler urged companies in the country to contact the US stakeholders and to share details of these discussions with the government in real time.
Last week, Trump quoted South Korea as a country with more unfair tariffs against American products than China, criticizing the use of subsidies to support chip manufacturers such as Samsung Electronics.
South Korea refuted the statement, saying that its tariffs on imports from the United States ascended to 0.79% last year, in the framework of a free trade agreement that came into force in 2012.
South Korean Minister of Commerce will be in Washington this week to meet with US leaders to discuss commercial issues.

In addition, AMI has advanced to have renewed the military hill tunnel. “The hill of the guide is the highest hill of the Macao Peninsula and has always played the most important role in military defense. In addition to the famous headlight and several fortresses, there are also a series of well -interconnected military tunnels, ”said Tam Wai Fong.
The official said that AMI proceeded this month to renew the tunnel painting due to the antiquity of the facilities and the deterioration of the painting of the walls of the tunnels.
In this case, AMI added and improved the ventilation equipment in the space, and inscribed and replaced the damaged surveillance system and emergency phones.

The rule of age and social hierarchy prevails: adults present children as auspicious gesture of health and success; bosses present subordinate as a sign of respect and thanks for the dedication and services provided; Newlyweds present singles as an appeal to prosperity in the new life for two. The principles associated with this tradition are clear: the monetary value must be a pair number (prosperity symbol), no coins should be placed within the envelope and, the label, it is advisable to accept the envelope with both hands expressing gratitude, and it should never be opened in the presence of the offers. An interesting practice is to give two envelopes at the same time, representing the multiplication of blessings.
In the days before New Year's holidays lunar the banks are filled with queues to raise new notes and notes. Each bank has its own envelopes that kindly offer customers so that they can fill them and later use in their festive "mission". Although, traditionally, the envelopes are red (color that evokes happiness), creativity and marketing strategies have taken possession and it is fun to analyze and comment on the annual aesthetics of local bank envelopes, renowned companies or even be careful to reserve those of Mickey mouse to the younger ones.
During the fifteen days that succeed the Chinese New Year, it is essential to provide several envelopes prepared for rapid distribution throughout the routine. Porters, building cleaning employees, coffee or restaurant employees we attend daily, children of neighbors and co -workers, thus reinforcing important community ties and the spirit of generosity. These days and, through this traditional millennial gesture, the intention and act of giving and receiving becomes a title of love and connection.
As generations change, the tradition of “Lai See” reinforces the link between the past and the present, and in this digital world the delivery of an envelope represents a tangible memory of the fundamental role of affection and the community in our lives. So when you receive or give a “lai See”, remember that each envelope is a small capsule of love and optimism, bringing with it the desire of an auspicious future.</description><pubDate>2025-03-14 05:20:24</pubDate></item><item><title>Macau's child who was injured in the Taichung explosion eventually died</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/03/14/crianca-de-macau-que-ficou-ferida-na-explosao-de-taichung-acabou-por-falecer/</link><description>The two-year-old child who suffered serious injuries to the explosion that occurred in Taichung, Taiwan, eventually died at the Conde de S. Januario Hospital last Friday. Health services confirmed yesterday that the child had died after the information was made public in Taiwan.
 
The child from Macao who had been seriously injured after a gas explosion that occurred on February 13 in Taichung, Taiwan, died last Friday in Macao, at Conde de S. Januario Hospital.
Information on the death of the child had already been released on Wednesday afternoon by the Taiwan press, citing family sources. The confirmation of health services came last night and the body clarified that the information was publicly shared “after obtaining the two -year -old family's consent”.
"Health services expressed deep regret for the girl's death and presented the deepest condolences to her family," reads the statement of the MSAR authorities, which adds that "emotional support and counseling services were also provided and their needs in time."
The explosion, which took place following a gas leakage, took place on February 13 at the Shin Kong Mitsukoshi shopping center, causing dozens of injuries and a total of five dead, three of which belonged to the same family as Macao. The grandfather killed instant and his grandmother died a few hours after the explosion. The mother, the father, an uncle and the great -grandmother of the child also suffered some injuries.
The girl had been in serious condition, with head trauma that caused a hemorrhage and a cerebral edema. On February 26, the child returned to Macau, having been admitted to the intensive care unit of the public hospital of the territory. At the time, the hospital had revealed that the girl was in a coma, with stable vital signs, and needed the support of the respiratory fan to maintain breathing and heartbeat.

What hides behind these pregnant bad words is not the name of the next pandemic virus, but rather the very common exchange of V's for B's, which is often used in humor situations, although for some people this may bring some irritation. There is no one who does not know this idiosyncrasy of Portuguese from certain regions, but few, including those who exchange the V's for B's, know the origin of this linguistic phenomenon.
In Portuguese the use of B instead of V is a regional or dialectal phenomenon, usually considered as a mere issue of pronunciation; For many, of incorrect pronunciation of the language. In Spanish, this neutralization of the distinction between these two sounds is absolute, so that sound, which in Portuguese is represented by the letter V, does not exist in Spanish-Castilian. It is necessary to do the specification here in relation to Spanish-Castelhan because, in certain parts of Andalusia and in some varieties of Spanish of the Americas, this sound yes exists, as there is also in certain dialects of Catalan, especially island and also in Valencian varieties.
To try to understand why V is replaced by B in certain regions of the national territory, it is necessary to detract from first that scientific jargon with which your attention has been immediately captured or, we hope that is not the case, immediately diverted to the next text in this newspaper.
 
The production of sounds
The official name of the sound represented by the letter V in Portuguese and the symbol [V] in the phonetic alphabet is a labeiodental sounding. (By convention, sounds are always transcribed in rear parentheses [].) Let us begin for the end. I already explained here once the consonant sounds can be deaf or sound depending on the opening of glottis; If the glottis is open, the air passing by does not vibrate the vocal cords - the other name for the glottis - and the sound results, if the vocal cords are closed, the air by passing vocal cords and the sound is sound.
Regarding the labiodental classification, it refers to the organs or parts of the mouth that intervene in the final configuration of the sound. In the case of [V], to produce this sound, the upper jaw teeth are fixed on the lower lip. If we stop for a moment in the other sound that interests us here, the sound represented by the letter B in Portuguese and the symbol [B] in the phonetic alphabet, this sound is bilabial because to produce the two lips touch, close; Bilabial because both lips interact in the configuration of this sound. [B], like [V], is also a sound sound, that is, produced with glottic vibration.
The first element in the classification of [V] is Fricative; What this word describes is the way air, which is the matter that sounds are made, comes out through mouth. The [B], in turn, is an occlusive sound, sometimes also called explosive. The difference between these two types of consonant sounds is that, in the case of the occlusive, the air finds an obstacle, an occlusion, to its passage and the sound results from an "explosion" of the air that erupts against the obstacle it finds, in the case of [B], closed lips. In Fricative Sounds, as in the case of [V], the obstacle that the air finds does not prevent its complete passage, the air causes a friction against the organs that intervene in its configuration. We can take the test. If we pronounce a [v], we notice the vibration between the upper teeth and the lower lip and we can produce this sound as long as we air in the lungs. In the case of [B], the air forces the lips to open so that the sound is only produced at the moment and that the lips, pushed, open. If we try to continue to pronounce [B], what we pronounce is the sound [E], because [b] exists only the moment when the lips erupt to let the air pass; Occlusive sounds are like small explosions of air.
The consonant sounds usually come in pairs. The pair of [v] is the [f] that in Portuguese is represented by the letter f of pharmacy. The [f] is the deaf correspondent of [v], that is, it is a deaf labiodental fricative sound. We can test; If we pronounce a [f] the position of the teeth in relation to the lips is exactly the same and the vibration between these organs is also the same as in [V], only the final quality of the sound is different, it sounds more opaque, so deaf.
Arrived here, we see that the only trait that these two sounds share is their sound. Examples such as voting and putting (what the chickens do in Brazil) or boot and vote, show that the distinction between [V] and [b] is pertinent in the Portuguese language. How is the neutralization of the difference between these two sounds explained? And how to explain, then, that the second overlaps the first?
 
Romans and Iberians
They are often external factors to the language that determine the way we speak. Already here we talked about the diastaric variation, that is, how socioeconomic factors determine the way we speak, or the diapasic variation, that is, how the context in which we find ourselves forces us to adjust our way of speaking to situations. These are just some of the external aspects that influence the way we use the language.
Many other external aspects can influence the way of speaking. In the past was suggested, suggestion that nowadays finds no fit, that the way Brazilians speak Portuguese is caused, or perhaps better, influenced by its climate. If this were true, it would be interesting to try to predict what linguistic consequences that global warming would bring to Portuguese in the future.
Already factors of historical nature have all the appropriateness, because they have enormous relevance in the way we speak. Otherwise let us see if the Romans had not conquered us, we would not speak the Romance language that Portuguese is; Or, if the Moors had not been expelled from the peninsula, Portuguese could today be an Arab dialect, or, worse, Portugal and their language could never have come at all.
The exchange of V's for B's or, using a more scientific language, now perfectly clear, such neutralization of the distinction between [B] and [V], can find its Raison D'Etre in historical-linguistic aspects that have to do with the linguistic substrate of the Iberian Peninsula before the Romans and the introduction of Latin, first as a frank language, and later as a vulgar language.
Prior to the arrival of the Romans, other peoples already inhabited the peninsula, among them, our ancestors, the Lusitans, whose tongue was completely extinguished. (Some inscriptions in Lusitanian exist.) Lusitanians were the product of meeting two other races that also inhabited Iberia, namely the Iberians, to this and the Celts, northwest. The latter, the Celts, are very well represented on the European continent, people of Aria, or Indo-Europeia, extended from this the British islands to Anatolia, a geographic space today occupied by Türkiye. There are many celic languages ​​spoken today in Europe, namely the Breton in France, the Scottish Gaelic, the Gaelic, Irish, who alongside English is Ireland's official language, the Welsh Gaelic, or the connist, an extinct language recovered in the twentieth century, as we had the opportunity to see in this column.
Already of the Iberians, called Hiberi by the Romans, the people who name our peninsula,-Hiberia, later rebaptized from Hispania, was the land of the Hiberi-who is relatively little. Its origin is uncertain, as is the affiliation of its language, but it is believed that the Iberians would already be well distributed, in different tribes, through this and southeast of the Peninsula around the seventh century BC. At its peak the Iberians arrived south of France and downtown and southern Portugal. The Iberian language has been spoken in much of the Iberian Peninsula from the entrance of the Iberians into the peninsula until it was completely replaced by Latin, around the century first before our era. Although the Iberian language has completely extinguished, it left behind about two thousand inscriptions whose understanding remains the target of academic discussions.
These inscriptions are spelled in three types of deed, one of which derived from the Greek alphabet. Thanks to this, although the Iberian language has not been completely deciphered, its phonological system is more or less well known. Thus we know that the labiodental fricatives / V / E / F / were not contained in the phonematic inventory of the ancient language of the Iberians.
 
The case of F in the Castilian
Apart from the disappearance of Spanish Spanish Castilian, also its deaf counterpart, sound [F], was at risk of suffering the same fate. Many of the Latin words that began with [F] lost this sound in their evolution to the modern Spanish. See, as examples, the cases of ESP. Harina, in the face of the port. Flour, derived from the lat. Farina-, Esp. Hacer, in the face of the port. do, lat. Facere, or Esp. Hoz, in the face of the port. Sickle, from Lat. falce-, among many other cases. [There are some cases where this phenomenon occurs inside the words, e.g. ahumado to smoke, but in these cases the composition of the word may be after the loses of the simple word.]
In modern Spanish, these words are written with a H-initial that obviously does not sound, but which should point out that, in their origin, these words did not begin with vowel. The choice of this letter was not by chance. The relative difficulty in pronouncing the Flatine that the native speakers of the peninsula will have felt due to the Iberian substrate has made sound [F] replaced, even if not consciously, with a similar sound. Thus, the Latin F-Innial, a Fricative Sound that was not part of the inventory of the sounds of the Iberian language, was replaced by a pharyngeal aspiration that to the dismantling ear of the Iberians sounded like the [F] of the Romans. This does not mean that [F] was always replaced and that the difficulty of producing this sound was universal in the geographical space of Iberia. These two sounds, [F] and the pharyngeal or velar aspiration, represented in modern Spanish by H-, would be two alternative sounds whose choice was dependent on individual speakers; These two sounds would represent what in linguistics we call alophones. This is witness to the fact that they exist in modern Spanish pairs of words of the same family that are written, one with f-, others with H-; For example, the word deep, if it is substantive, as in 'El Fundo del Mar', is written with F-, but if it is adjective, then it is written with H-, for example, in 'El Mar Hondo'. Also the result of the smoking act, written in Spanish with F-, is the humor with H-. There are also words that have both spellings, among them, for example, the words Hermoso and Formoso or the nickname Hernández and Fernández.
Another aspect to be into account is that, although in some regions and in some social strata the F e was pronounced as a pharyngeal aspiration, the words continued to be written with their phytological until, by losing their aspiration in some words, they began to write with H, while those who did not lose their sound continued to write with F-Latin. This can be seen in the image that follows this text in which there are two pages of the Princeps edition of D. Quixote de la Mancha de Miguel de Cervantes. The two pages portrayed, pages four and seven, of chapter second, show two alternative spellings for the verb to make, in a modern Spanish Hacer. On page four, on the left side, you can see three forms of the Hacer Written Written with H, knowing Hizo 'did', unloving 'undo', and Hiziera 'made'; On page seven, on the right side, we see a shape of the same verb written with F, namely, to do it. The shapes of the Spanish verb hacer written with F always find in D. Quijote's lines. This suggests that this form would be considered more conservative at the time and, undoubtedly, its use is at the service of D. Quixote's characterization as an eccentric character. On the same page seven, also in a speech by D. Quixote, we find the Spanish Word Hermoreura Written Famousura.
From the sound relationship between [F] and a pharyngeal or guttural aspiration, it witnesses the Portuguese word fact (the dress) that derives from the word Arab Hatu, which also gave rise to Spanish shudder to the adjective palava that is attributed to someone well dressed.
In the historical question of the neutralization of the distinction between [V] and [b] and the replacement of the Latin Latin ethimologist in some words of the Spanish, the Iberian acts as a linguistic substrate. A simple definition of substrate would be a language spoken by a community that, when replaced by another language, as was the case of Iberian regarding Latin, influences the new language imprinting on its own characteristics.
In the case of the influence of the substrate language on sound production, it can be caused by two factors, namely, or the speaker's ear is not trained to recognize new unknown sounds, or the phonetic apparatus of it is not used to, or is not even able to produce these same sounds. In both cases the solution is to adopt, among the sounds that the speaker knows and is able to produce, a sound as close as possible to the sound unknown to the new language.
In Macao we can see how Chinese speakers have difficulty producing certain Portuguese sounds, such as the differentiation of semi -semi -semi -or simple vowels or simple R, in words as expensive. In the case of the latter, Chinese speakers, who are not able to produce the simple vibrant [R], rather produce a certain kind of [L], a sound that is organically close to the original Portuguese sound.
A more interesting case and much more pertinent to the theme here in discussion is the difficulty that the Philippines have to pronounce the sound [F] when they speak English. This is not to say that all Philippines are not able to pronounce this sound, which means, due to the influence of their mother language, which here acts as a substrate, when in informal or relaxed situations, the Philippines naturally replace [F] with the closest sound in their indigenous phonetic system. Thus, they replace the deaf labiodental fricative consonant sound or [f] with the nearest joint sound, ie the deaf bilabial occlusive sound or [p], the sound of the Portuguese word.
What the Philippines do is exactly what the Portuguese, who exchange the V's for the B's, and the Spanish do in relation to the sound [v], which, in fact, is, as we have seen, the sound sound of [F]. The closest sound to the sound labiodental [V] is the sound bilabial [B]. It is nonetheless interesting to see how on the other side of the world, we can find a phenomenon so similar to what is happening in the Iberian Peninsula. This, by the way, proves that the replacement of a labiodental fricative, such as [V], with a bilabial occlusive, such as [B], is a normal linguistic mechanism, as it is shared by different languages, not attached or in contact.
 
Iberian substrate
How do you explain then that the Latin has replaced by an aspiration, represented in some cases by the letter H-, and that would finally disappear? Because the Spanish Castilian did not choose a parallel solution to the [V] vs. [B] and replaced [f] with [p], how do you make Tagalo speakers? The answer is simple, according to the reconstructed phonological system for the Iberian, the phoneme / to was not part of its phonematic inventory. The Iberian occlusive consonant system consisted of deaf dental [t] and corresponding sound [d], deaf velar or guttural [k] and the corresponding sound [g], but when we reach the bilabial, the deaf [p], counterpart of sound [b], does not exist. Phonetic systems with imbalances like these are not unusual. The very phonological system of modern Spanish does not contemplate sound, only deaf, which in itself represents a form of imbalance.
One of the examples normally cited in favor of this interpretation of the facts is the word Basque Iko, imported from the Latin FICUL-, port. fig. Although the origins of the Basque language, another of the pre-Roman languages ​​of Iberia, is as enigmatic as those of the Iberian himself, efforts, based on similarities between certain suffixes and, above all, in numerals, have been made to relate the Basque with the Iberian. This linguistic association, however, is not peaceful.
Therefore, the Spaniard had to look for a sound that was equivalent. We cannot need that sound was this since Harina or Hacer's H today does not represent any sound. However, not only the H speech, he herself, suggests aspiration, but there are also words that are written today with J-, who in Spanish represents a deaf velar fricative whose origin points to an ancient f. Such is the case of the word I JOY that, in Spanish Andaluz, describes a kind of flamenco sing. The word deep, which, as we have seen, gives the adjective Hondo in Spanish Castilian, has been pointed out as possible for this word since the understanding of singing is that of a deep corner.
With the extent of the standard norm of Portuguese, especially through schooling and the media, as they were in the recent past television and radio, and today are the internet and social media, the distinction between V and B tends to (re) introduce into the spoken language. However, there are certain local varieties that enjoy a particular type of prestige, which could be described as barbarism, especially in the coastal Douro area and in parts of Minho, which will probably not allow this phenomenon to disappear totally.
The story does not explain, even the B's for V's!

Since its inauguration, on January 20, the United States and the whole world plunged into absolute chaos. Since that day, a presidential decree (designated by executive order) after another came to change just about everything.
Several decrees prohibited asylum to people who arrived at the US and Mexico border, effectively closing the southern border.  Another presidential decree ended the citizenship of birth right for the children of undocumented immigrants. This unconstitutional decree goes directly against the US Constitution.  The 14th amendment, promulgated after the Civil War, clearly states that: "All people born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to their jurisdiction, are citizens of the United States and the state where they reside." A historic decision of the Supreme Court, the United States against Wong Kim Ark, in 1898, confirmed the fourteenth amendment by deciding that Wong, the son of an undocumented Chinese emigrant, born in the United States, was an American citizen, and therefore could not be deported from the United States. Following the suspension of its decree by a US district court, the US government appealed to higher federal courts, which rejected all Trump's arguments.  However, Trump's regime continues to blindly advance to the US Supreme Court with this unconstitutional action.
Another decree ordered federal agencies to investigate commercial practices, sending the government to create the “external revenue service” to charge tariffs. Trump, a true eighteenth-century mercantilist, supported for decades the application of high customs rights and believes that the revenues can replace taxes, which was true in pre-war America, but not since. Customs currently represent about 2% of US budgetic revenues. Ten days after his inauguration, Trump voted in favor of applying customs rights of 25% on the goods of his three largest business partners: China, Mexico and Canada. Then, at the last minute, Trump announced a postponement of one month to Mexico and Canada, but not to China. Last week, when these tariffs would come into force, an exemption for cars announced; Then one more postponement of one month to Canada and Mexico; He then applied a 25% rate on steel and aluminum; And yesterday, Trump announced 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum in all imports, regardless of the country. Trump believes he can recreate the old US steel industry from the 1950s, which has died a long time ago.
This back and forth approach only scared the US scholarship markets and seriously harmed relationships with friends and neighbors closest to the United States. On Monday, the US stock exchange lost 900 points or about 2.7%, its largest drop since September 2022; And this fall follows a 1300 points drop last week, placing the US market, which had been very well under Biden, in Bull Market territory, as the index fell about 9% over the record last month. This huge daily fall, endless sight (on Wednesday there was a 500-point drop), followed by Trump's refusal to exclude that these aggressive tariff policies could cause a recession. The sale occurred at the time the largest Canadian province, Ontario, applied overwhelming overcrowding to the electricity that exports to US Michigan, Minnesota and New York, which would cost the average US family aggregate plus $ 100 a month. At the same time, Trump's trade war with China intensified, with Beijing to respond to its rates imposing 15% rates on American agricultural products such as chicken, wheat and corn, as well as 10% rates on soy, pork, cow and fruit. When Trump imposed an additional 25% rate on Canadian imports, Ontario postponed his retaliation surcharge.  Trump then kept the rate by 25%. Yesterday, Canada and the European Union responded with thousands of millions of dollars of customs rights to US products. Trump promises more rates next week.  The international tariff war created by a man continues, a tariff war that will only lead to economic chaos, recession and suffering.
Donald Trump came to power promising to lower prices and inflation, stating that he would "make America big again." Instead, Trump is leading the world and the US alone to a recession and a trade war. The last big American tariff, the 1930 Smoot-Hawley Law, only led the US and the world to the great depression. Will we be watching a repetition of the story?
In terms of foreign policy, Trump reversed more than 100 years of American foreign policy, dating back to the fourteen Woodrow Wilson points in January 1917 to create an international order free of great wars. Following its disastrous ambush to President Zelensky in the Oval Room on February 28; Last week, in pure retribution, Trump suddenly removed all military aid to Ukraine.  Even the routes on the route to Ukraine had to take a half turn with the weapons necessary to the battle. Then, on March 4, Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Saudi Arabia, without the involvement of any of the European countries or even Ukraine itself. The next day, without any explanation, Trump ordered Cia to immediately cease all the sharing of information with Ukraine, a scam perhaps worse than the cessation of military aid, since this cessation of information allowed Russia to bombard Ukrainian cities-buildings, hospitals, schools and infrastructure-almost unrestricted. The cessation of information sharing allowed Russia to resume much of the Kursk region that Ukraine captured last summer; Territory that Ukraine wanted to use as a bargaining chip in peace negotiations. Trump demanded that Ukraine sign an agreement to give the US its natural resources, a colonial measure to a desperate nation; However, he refused to include any security guarantees in return to protect Ukraine from future invasions and Russian attacks. Trump has made successive concessions to Russia without asking for anything in return for Putin. It is evident that Ukraine is being “delivered to the wolves”; Donald Trump's United States has changed sideways, accepting Kremlin's views. Europe is watching the destruction of NATO and its security umbrella. Ukraine agreed with an American plan for a 30-day ceasefire throughout Ukraine, but Americans did not mention any safety guarantees.  Now the world awaits Putin's answer. To stimulate the Russians, Trump restored military aid and sharing information with the Ukrainians. Putin remains silent.
Europe has reacted to this sudden but inexplicable reversal of 100 years of US politics in many ways. Britain is approaching the European Union. Britain and France are talking about gathering their nuclear weaponry and widening their nuclear shield all over Europe. No country in Europe can now believe that the United States would protect them from an external attack. Europe now realizes that it has to advance alone, as the continent cannot depend on safety against attacks provided by the United States. As a result, European countries are increasing their defense budgets, in some cases doubling them to about 5% of the total budget. There is talk of a European force of defense, a European army, as several European leaders believe that Donald Trump will remove US forces from Europe to save money for his promised tax reduction for billionaires. For many Europeans, the United States joined the "wickedness". An old ally has become a possible and non-reliable enemy.
Since January 20, the world has changed seismically. Under the presidency of Donald Trump, the United States began a tariff war against friends and neighbors, reversing 80 years of free trade. We are watching a return to the late nineteenth -century era of high tariffs, borders, spheres of influence and government by the powerful, not by the rule of law. Donald Trump has removed the United States from various international organizations, including the Paris World Health Organization and Climate Control. The US is challenging other international organizations, such as the World Trade Organization and the International Criminal Court.  The post-1945 era, which Donald Trump effectively ended, provided the world the longest period of peace and prosperity he ever knew. Almost alone, he entered the world in an unstable and multipolar era, ending an era of international cooperation, organizations and multilateral policies and a rule of law. We forget that the late nineteenth century led to the outbreak of the first and World War II. Will Donald Trump in his madness lead the world to a third world war? In eight weeks, instead of “making America Grande,” Donald Trump caused America to be hated by his neighbors and allies once friends, reversed 100 years of foreign policy, induced likely economic recession, causing only global instability, even chaos.  These actions are the mark of a crazy ruler, such is the "madness of King Donald." I leave you with this question: In your crazy driving of American foreign policy, will Donald Trump a foreign (Russian) agent, or even a “candidate of Manchuria”?</description><pubDate>2025-03-14 05:20:22</pubDate></item><item><title>Connecting cabinet expects the executive to raise the capacity for governance</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/03/14/gabinete-de-ligacao-esperaque-o-executivo-eleve-a-capacidade-de-governacao/</link><description>The central government's liaison office in the Mand has expressed hope to the Macao government of being more competent and efficient in governance and, at the same time, to be even more dedicated to economic diversification, in order to achieve “high quality development”.
Beijing's representation body organized yesterday a transmission session of the spirit of the “two sessions” - of the National Popular Assembly (APN) and the Chinese people's Political Advisory Conference (CCPPC). At the time, he also argued that Macau should “firmly safeguard” the national security and general stability of the territory and seek to better serve the conjuncture of national development, advancing the governmental work in a pragmatic way.
Zheng Xincong, director of the organism, indicated that local society must learn the spirit of the important speeches given by Chinese President Xi Jinping during his visit to Macao and "assume the important mission of implementing the" one country, two systems "principle in the New Age." The official also highlighted the "important position" and the "unique role" of the mashed to the country, so it should make "special contribution" in the development process.
Zheng Xincong also asked Macau to have a clear understanding of the current international and internal situation. "The world is going through a crisis and the external environment with which the country faces is becoming increasingly complex," he warned. Zheng thus understands that the society of Macao must maintain the determination to overcome challenges and be brave in making progress.

The exhibition “Portuguese, a Global Language”, organized by the 10 Marias Cultural Association, will be inaugurated on March 18, at the Glass House, at TAP SEAC. The event will explore the presence and influence of the Portuguese language in the world. Inspired by the book “Atlas of the Portuguese Language”, the exhibition will present an analysis of the evolution and the impact of language in various areas, from education to the economy.
 
In the world's linguistic landscape, the Portuguese language stands out as one of the most spoken and influential, the fifth most popular, serving as a vehicle of communication between various cultures and nations. The exhibition “Portuguese, a Global Language”, promoted by the 10 Marias Cultural Association, will be inaugurated on March 18, at 18:30, at the Glass House, located in Tap Seac Square.
Inspired by the book “Atlas of the Portuguese Language”, the exhibition will provide a comprehensive analysis of historical development, geographical expansion and the cultural importance of the Portuguese language. Atlas author, Luís Reto, will be present at the opening ceremony to present his work, which has been essential in documentation and reflection on the influence of the Portuguese language in the global context, and his participation will offer a significant perspective on the role of Portuguese spoken in the contemporary world.
Among the highlights of the exhibition, visitors will have the opportunity to understand the impact of the Portuguese language in various areas, covering from its demographic ancestry to its position as a language of education and, fundamentally, as a frank language in business and international trade. This practical dimension of Portuguese will reveal its utility, as well as its symbolic value as a means of connecting different cultures and economic powers.
In addition, the exhibition will address Portuguese as a diplomatic tool, a vehicle of artistic and scientific expression, as well as a key player in digital communication. According to the organizers, in an increasingly interconnected world, Portuguese is not just a language; It is also a dynamic heritage that goes beyond geographical borders, uniting communities and promoting intercultural dialogue.
In this context of “Portuguese, a global language”, Macau would be the ideal place for exhibition, as a space where the East is with the West, which serves as a cultural convergence point where the diversity and richness of Portuguese linguistic heritage is reflected.
The initiative of the 10 Maria Cultural Association will not only highlight the history and importance of the Portuguese language, but will also invite viewers to consider the future of this language, reinforcing their position as a unifying element in the contemporary world, says the organization.
Those interested in participating in the inauguration of the exhibition “Portuguese, a global language” are encouraged to visit the glass house, where they will discover a new dimension of the Portuguese language, exploring its wealth and diversity. For more information, the organizers, Marco Duarte Rizzolio and José Paulo Esperança, will be present during the opening.
This cultural initiative is supported by the Government's Culture Development Fund and also has the support of Casa de Portugal in Macau.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Central government report on Hong Kong and Macau: expectations and implications</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/03/14/relatorio-do-governo-central-sobre-hong-kong-e-macau-expectativas-e-implicacoes/</link><description>The Central Government report, presented by Prime Minister Li Qiang, stressed the importance of Hong Kong and Macau fully implementing the principles of “a country, two systems”, “The People of Hong Kong Government Hong Kong”, “The People of Macau Govern Macau” and “a high degree of autonomy”-four main aspects to which the two special administrative regions are expected to join.
In addition, the two special administrative regions must, according to Prime Minister LI, protect the Chinese Constitution and the Constitutional Order, in order to realize the principles of having “patriots” to govern Hong Kong and Macau.
Most importantly, both Hong Kong and Macau should develop their economy, improve the means of subsistence of their population, deepen cooperation and interaction with international society, integrate deeper into the Chinese nation development plan and protect economic prosperity and long-term stability of both cities (Wen Wei PO, March 6, 2025).
I read Qiang also added that the area of ​​the great bay should develop its potential and maximize its advantages of raising innovation and its side effects in other regions, such as the Beiji-Tianjin Nexus and the Yangtze River Delta.
In response to Li Qiang's report, Hong Kong's chief executive John Lee wrote about how Hong Kong would deepen his international cooperation with other countries and how he would reinforce “internal links and external communications” (Wen Wei Po, March 6, 2025). Specifically, Hong Kong will adopt several measures: (1) accelerate the process of developing an International Center for Innovation and Technology; (2) consolidate the International Center for Finance, Aviation, Maritime Transport and Hong Kong Trade; (3) attract talent and promote the work of innovation and technology in the northern metropolis and in the area of ​​Hetao; (4) Promote high quality development and infrastructures in the large bay area to accelerate Hong Kong integration with the continent; and (5) develop the role of Hong Kong as a “superconnector”, striving to join RCEP and simultaneously reinforcing relations with the Middle East, Asean, Central Asia and other European and American countries.
The central government report phrase that encourages Hong Kong and Macao reinforcing “internal links and external communications” is applicable to the Macao Special Administrative Region. Macao Executive Chief Sam Ho Fai met Xia Baolong, director of the Hong Kong and Macau affairs, and both underlined the importance of Macau's “adequate” economic diversification. Given the rapid development process of the Guangdong-Macau in-depth cooperation zone in Hengqin in the last two years, Macau should advance with the development of convention and exhibition centers in this area, along with the need to develop a faster process of creating a Chinese Medicine Center with the technological investigation of local universities, to expand cruise tourism connecting the macao island and more, more Late, we hope, to Hengqin parts, to build the center of titles and obligations in hengqin and to attract the investment of Portuguese -speaking countries and the continent companies. However, Macao should accelerate the assistance that his government provides to small and medium enterprises, transforming some local food products into regional and international food products. In this way, Macao's economic diversification will help the city grow even more with new physical spaces, new economic opportunities, new commercial enterprises and new investments from the continent and foreigners.
Macao's traditionally good relations with Portuguese-speaking countries and the European Union can also be used in the coming years, namely in the process of building the Guangdong-Macau in-depth cooperation zone in Hengqin and the attraction of more foreign investment. At the same time, the unique mix of Chinese and Portuguese food products from Macao has the potential to create new markets for the expansion of trade, thus freeing the potential of small and medium -sized local businesses as much as possible.
The challenges that are placed on Hong Kong, from an objective point of view, are huge. Given the constant departure of the local Hong Kong population to consume a lot in Shenzhen and in the area of ​​the large bay during the weekends, it is urgent that Hong Kong develops its tourist industry in a more innovative way. MegaEventos are just one of the options for renewing their tourist industry, but Hong Kong needs to be much faster in the development of the North Hetao and Metropolis area over the next five years, rather than staying in a planning phase. Xia Baolong's recent visit to Qianhai in Shenzhen and her meeting with a group of high Hong Kong government officials explain why the central government report presented by Li Qiang stressed the need for Hong Kong to reinforce their “internal connections” with the continent - which implies that central authorities were not very satisfied with the development of North Metropolis Zones and of Hetao, who apparently advance to a snail rhythm. The new Legislative Council, after its elections in late 2025, is expected to have to control the Hong Kong government in a more effective way and to press it to present the execution plan and the North Hetao and Metropolis Development calendar.
Another challenge for Hong Kong is the fact that it does not have a unique industrial base. From a critical point of view, given the rapid development of electrical vehicles in China, Hong Kong authorities should consider the way to bring the continent's electric vehicles and turn them into a single Hong Kong brand. To date, the Hong Kong automotive sector had no innovative idea of ​​this type.
On the other hand, Hong Kong should take the excellent opportunity for “internal calls” through his connection to Shenzhen's Yantia Port to revive and expand his shipbuilding industry. At the end of 2023, Hong Kong was the fifth largest market of shipowners in the world, with about 2,500 ships that fired its flag and represented 2.4% of the world fleet.
Although a recent Reuters report (March 6, 2025) has stated that the deterioration of US and China relations means that some navigation companies are discreetly transferring their operations outside Hong Kong and removing ships from their pavilion registration, the Hong Kong shipping industry has been traditionally led by the Chinese. As such, Hong Kong's sea transport sector must be more closely integrated with his continental China counterpart, so that an advantageous situation for both parties is more quickly fulfilled. Integration into the sector of maritime transport means not only mergers between local and continent maritime transport companies, but also the full use of the continent's ports as maritime transport routes. Together with the traditionally strong sector of Hong Kong aviation, rejuvenation and expansion of the Hong Kong sea transport sector are strategic - a strong logistics supply chain that connects the maritime Hong Kong to its ease of terrestrial transport to the large bay and its international aviation center status. Hong Kong's geopolitical and geopolitical potentialities should be maximized within the applying the central government's idea to strengthen their “internal links and external communications”.
In addition, in the process of liberating the potential of Hong Kong and Macao, the two special administrative regions should ideally exhort their tourism authorities to deal with collaborative tourism in a more innovative and much closer way, namely cruise tourism that can connect the two locations in a more dynamic way; Historical and cultural tourism that can connect the two unique cities that combine western cultures with Chinese cultures; and sports tourism where Hong Kong can cooperate with Macau in a much stronger and advantageous situation for both parties. The sister cities of Hong Kong and Macau are not competing with each other; On the contrary, their potentialities can and will be maximized to the fullest if they both exploit the way tourism can be driven in both cities, with the tourists of the continent and foreigners to come to both cities as a package in which historical, war and cultural places can be explored, cruises can be made to appreciate the island landscapes of both cities, and the mega events can be packed together in terms of advertising. regional and international.
In conclusion, the central government report about Hong Kong and Macau is brief but clear. Both cities should improve their “internal links and external communications”. As such, the central authorities expect a faster process of development in the Guangdong-Macau depth zone in Hengqin, the expansion of the North and Hetao metropolis in Hong Kong, and the spoil of the outer relations of Hong Kong and Macau under the leadership and diplomatic delicacy of the central government in Beijing. In this case, the authorities of Hong Kong and Macao should be more brave in the implementation of their faster and deepest integration policy with the great bay, using their external relations with various countries. Although Hong Kong's external relations with the other parts of the world can be widened, Hong Kong authorities should reflect on how to rejuvenate their shipping industry and establish a more strategic connection between the local and the continent. Similarly, Macau can take advantage of his good relations with Portuguese -speaking countries and the European Union and widen their trade relations with these countries. Finally, Hong Kong and Macao tourism authorities should make more talks and discuss how both cities could attract more continental and international tourism through a way of collaboration that emphasizes their historical, cultural, sports and cruise tourism in a more innovative way. If central authorities and central planners have been innovative in terms of planning and development, Hong Kong and Macau authorities have long been in terms of reflection groups to follow the example.</description><pubDate>2025-03-14 05:19:58</pubDate></item><item><title>CTM mobile services rise up 12.7%</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/03/14/receitas-dos-servicos-moveis-da-ctm-sobem-127/</link><description>Macau's main telecommunications operator again consolidated the leadership position in 2024, with significant increases in roaming and prepaid and postpaid plans. The mother company CETIC attributes the results to the 5G penetration rate-which already represents 98.4% of mobile subscribers in the region-and the recovery of the tourism sector.
 
Revenue from the Macao Telecommunications Company (CTM) increased 12.7% by 2024 over the previous year, ascending $ 1.09 billion from Hong Kong.
Data were released on Wednesday in a report by the mother company Citic Telecom International Holdings Limited, based in Hong Kong, where the financial results of 2024 from the subsidiary CTM were located. According to the report, the revenues of mobile services in Macau-local, roaming or prepaid-increased 12.7% compared to 2023, which is justified with the spread of the 5G network and the recovery of the tourism sector in the region.
In total, more than 771 thousand mobile subscribers were counted in December 2024, an increase of about 16.3% compared to 2023. Within this number, there is a growth of approximately 201 thousand prepaid customers (plus 31.4% compared to the same period) and 570 thousand postpaids (plus 11.8%).
At the same time, the “stable recovery” of the tourism industry and the implementation of measures such as “Northbound Travel for Macau Vehicles” (which allows the entry of vehicles without double enrollment in Guangdong) resulted in increasing revenue from roaming rates.
The sale of mobile phones also rose 7.8% over the same period, totaling 1,528 million dollars of Hong Kong, "due to a more stable offer of mobile phones and other factors, such as the growing trend of updating to the 5G network."
At the end of last year, the 5G technology penetration rate reached 98.4%, covering more than 759,000 mobile subscribers in Macao. In 2023, the percentage was 75.7%.
“We kept the growth dynamic of our 5G users base in the Macao market and intensified the promotion of 5G with the mass market. On December 31, 2024, the [CTM] market share in the Macao mobile market increased to 53.3%, remaining firmly at the top, ”reads Cetil's report, signed by the Chairman of the Board of Directors Luo Xicheng.
The document also emphasizes the “Development in Technologies and Services” of CTM - in particular, internet services. In this parameter, the market share in Macao was about 96.8% at the end of last year, a slight descent regarding the 97.1% verified in 2023. Still, the official points out that the CTM “continues firmly at the top of the Macao market”, cemented the “leadership position in the region's broadband”.
Cetil's report ends with the guarantee of additional efforts in 2025 to solidify the brand's “advantageous leadership position” in the Macao market, as well as encourage the “integrated development” of Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao zones “in the field of technology research”.
It is recalled that, currently, the MSAR has only three mobile operators: CTM, China Telecom and 3 Macau. A fourth competitor, Smartone Mobile Communications, abandoned the Macanese market in August 2024.

In an interview with the final point, Hong Kong's young natural coach has revealed the ambition to raise local football quality in a territory that, despite the less achieved results in recent years, has players with a lot of potential.

Kenneth Kwok debuted as a coach precisely against Macau, then in the service of Hong Kong, in a sports match in which he won comfortably 4-0. It now advocates the flag of the other special administrative region, in a reality at a completely different football compared to the former British colony. However, amateur football in Macau has potential, in the opinion of the coach, but to enhance it is necessary that there is a collective work that goes beyond the technical team itself and players, and it is also necessary to support other local entities and a greater investment to increase the competitiveness of the local championship, which will also be reflected in the selection.
 
Four months ahead of the Macao football team. What balance does it do?
I really like Macau, for several reasons. My father is from Macau, spent much of his youth here playing football until he caught the attention of South China, who is a professional Hong Kong team, and was, along with two brothers, to Hong Kong to play professional soccer. My license level to coach was made here in Macau, I always have a special feeling about Macau also because of my father's influence. My first game as an interim coach was in the service of Hong Kong against Macau in a sport. We won 4-0 and it was my senior debut. After getting my coach diploma in China, for which I studied about two years, I had an offer from the Macao Football Association in October and was a job I wanted. I still remember my first day at the office, I was there about six hours working without stopping because I knew what I had to do, I had a lot of things in my head, and I have enjoyed my time here.
 
What are your plans for selection?
I accepted this position not only to improve the players of the main selection, but at all levels, including U23, U20 and U17. And not just players, in my team I have only local people, and I want them to be the future selectors. My goal is not to arrive, achieve results and leave, I want to help Macau, help players and coaches reach another level. I communicate a lot with the players, I have had a lot of support from everyone. I am optimistic, but it is necessary to have patience and willingness to achieve the objectives.
 
And what feedback has you had from the players?
Very positive. Some of them are focused on their jobs, but they know that if they cannot be 100% focused on football, they can help other players do so.
 
A selecção de Macau não tem grande expressão a nível internacional, que tipo de motivação tem um treinador num cargo destes?
During my career I trained teams of various levels. I trained Taiwan's champions, who, despite being champions, would say it's a semi-professional team. When I arrived here I already knew that many of the players had an amateur status, trained once or twice a week and had their own jobs. It is not easy to train the selection because they are not professional players. But for my work, even being amateur players, they cannot define themselves as amateur players. When I arrived here, the goal was to change their mindset to believe they are semi-professional. There is a big difference between amateur and semi-professional, at a semi-professional level may not have a salary that allows them to live on football, but they train as professionals, have to organize their training and periods of rest, nutrition and mindset daily. They have to go to the gym every week. Although not professional, it is something they can do. When I arrived in Macao I tried to instill this mindset, the championship has to go from amateur to semi-professional status. If we look at the rest of the Asian championships, Macau is one of those who have not yet reached semi-professional status.
 
Can't you even consider semi-professional football?
I hope you will start to define themselves as semi-professional players. My job here is to make them semi-professional, and then make the transition to professional players. I see many quality players in Macao at the young man, but then the university end and have to find a job, and only then do they play soccer. There are quality players who could try to play at professional level, and this is also my job. I helped three players from Macau training in Hong Kong in a professional team for a week and the coach was very fond of them. My job is also to help in this sense, to make them professionals, and then we can talk about the transition from a semi-professional status to a professional. For me, this is the way Macau can move to the next phase.
 
How did this experience in Hong Kong run?
They were at Eastern FC a week to get an idea of ​​what it is like to work in a professional club. I hope in summer help 4 or 5 players become professionals and reach this status. There are many players here in Macao who talk about going to play for Portugal, but of what I heard, they just have to train, they don't have the opportunity to register as players. A more realistic expectation is to try other Asian championships, such as Hong Kong or China, or even in Philippines.
 
The team goalkeeper, for example, had an offer to play in Thailand.
Yes, it ended up not going, perhaps for familiar reasons. At the time I was twenty and such years, I probably no longer thought about leaving Macau if you already have a family or a stable job. Younger players, before entering the job market, should try soccer at professional level. I think parents also believe it. Visby [Cheng-Lam Law, a player at the University of Macau], for example, is only 20 years old and has been in the best team of the championship twice. I think I should bet on leaving Macau, I will try to help you get into a good team where he can play, this is also my work and the way we can make Macau's selection stronger.
 
It's a big jump, passing from an amateur league like Macau to play in a championship like Hong Kong or China. Are players prepared?
The level of Macao players is not lower than those of China. Local Hong Kong or China players play at a similar level. Macao players have no big chance of playing outside and there is no one who helps them make this transition from an amateur league to a professional, and I'm here to do this job.
 
What balance do you make of the games that have already advised the selection, also taking into account the training conditions that exist for Macao players?
It was hard to prepare the players because when I took the team there was no competition, they had just played the ball [7] football championship. When I started I had a meeting with the players to explain what I want from them. There was not enough time with them in the field, but we had many lectures. About the three games we held, the first was in the Guangdong Cup, tied to zero, but we had good opportunities to score, and then we lost in the penalties. In the second we played against Shenzhen's team and lost 3-2 in a match that was balanced. And then in Hong Kong, against Guam, we were the best team, but we lost 2-1. All games were 50-50, I was surprised by the capacity of the players, if they remain at a high competitive level, with a competitive mental capacity, then they will be able to do a good job. The next challenge will be against the Hong Kong selection [March 19], which will be a difficult game for them. I told the players when I arrived that I would give them a lot of challenges, now let's play against Hong Kong, and then we should play against a Chinese Superleague team. I want them to have more difficult games to continue progressing.
 
It also entered a difficult time due to the new rules that dismissed some experienced players from the selection because they did not have Macao passport. How did this affect the team?
It was a setback for me due to FIFA rules, which prevented players such as Vitor, Niki or Filipe [Vítor Almeida, Nicholas Torrão and Filipe Duarte], who could no longer represent the selection. But this also opened the possibility of seeing more young players. I remember the first game we played in which half of the team was under 23 years old. I currently have about 34 pre-selected players for the Hong Kong game and I think 15 of them are under 23 years old. I have fewer experienced players, but I also have more young players to develop, which is one of my added value because when I was working in Hong Kong I focused more on the U18 and U23. I am happy to be able to work with a lot of youth, but it is a job that requires time and patience. There are players with a promising future, I will try to develop them in three or four years. My goal is that the selection qualifies for the group stage of the next edition of the Asian Cup. The local championship is a good opportunity for them, so I have talked to the teams to see if they have more time.
 
How often does the selection usually train?
They currently have two gym sessions a week and a weekend training, because the championship has games during the week. I want to change their mindset and habits when they play in the championship.
 
One of the biggest challenges in Macau is having spaces to train. How does this affect your work?
It's one of the biggest obstacles I've found since I arrived because there are not enough fields to train. In Hong Kong there was also this problem about five years ago, all selection training was done in a government field. But then there was a training center for the Hong Kong Jockey Club -sponsored selection, and that solved all the problems. I think for Macao, in the long run, it takes a training center with a minimum of two fields, with artificial lawn. Only then will we be able to match the needs of the various layers of the selection, and it is also a way to develop the Macao Championship for the next level.
 
The issue of artificial lawns has been spoken over the years, but has never been implemented…
Yes, I think it has to do with the mindset, they need to explain the advantages that the pitch are artificial. The government thinks the selection plays on lawn outside Macao, so they don't need to move to an artificial lawn. In Hong Kong, for example, there are 10 teams in the championship and at least 8 of them regularly train in artificial lawn. In Macao, the lawn are constantly being used is more important than quality. I hope that in the long run the government can consider a training center for the selection.
 
He said there are several quality players to become professionals. Is this a feeling that players themselves have, to become professional?
Yes, one or two are already following my advice, one of them even said goodbye to your job to try to play professional in the summer, because it is aware that the priority is to try professionalization. It is not easy to leave their jobs to try to be a professional soccer player, but those who are still studying should consider this possibility.
 
And do they have quality for that?
Yes, they have already shown that they have the ability to do so.
 
And are there conditions in Macao to develop their abilities for this purpose?
In Hong Kong, for example, ruffy players work at banks, or companies, with great salaries, and get time to train at 6:30 am three times a week and go to the gym at night. They have a very organized life, and the Hong Kong Raguebi team is the best in Asia. This gives me inspiration, because even if people are busy, they can always get time to train.
 
But this is for them to train for themselves and stay fit. And as a team?
It's hard to get time for training together, but they have to start with themselves to be physically well. It's also one of my next goals, asking players to train with me at 6:30 am. It's not easy, but there is evidence they can do. And the positive part of this is that, knowing that they have a workout at 6:30 am, so they have to go to sleep at 9 pm without another type of activities at night. This will help them become semi-professional, they should not waste much time with another kind of night activities if they want to be professional soccer players.
 
How do you evaluate the quality of the Macao Football Championship?
It is a championship with many foreigners, but also local quality players. But other aspects, such as the organization, referees and certain regulations, such as transfers, should go to a higher level. I recently saw a game in which there was a discussion with the arbitration team and we see many people get up on the bank, and that's not good. There may be 20 players in the bank, and there are no place where to sit. There is a lack of organization. We have to better organize the championship and make it more professional, so that they can play in a more organized environment, because the level of the championship will also reflect on the Macao selection.
 
And who should take this responsibility?
It is the responsibility of everyone, the Macao Football Association, the teams and the government. Looking at Japan, for example, about 40 years ago they were in a similar situation, were amateur and disorganized. Then they started thinking about the future, getting sponsors, parents started supporting their children to play soccer, and now Japan is a great country in football. And in Macau we have to start thinking the same way.
 
The championship seems to live in cycles, teams can invest both in a year and close doors the following year, as happened now with Mount Carlo. Does this also create instability in the coach work?
Yes. The teams invest and then there is no big impact. That's why I think the championship itself has to expand, attract more investors to bring more people to the stadium. If the championship gets better, it will encourage teams to invest more. It is not a job of one or two people, it has to be everyone. The main responsible of the teams have to know that they are also part of the development of Macao football, so they have to invest. Benfica, for example, has several quality players, both local and foreigners, but no one under 23. There should also be a transfer system. If a player is registered by a team, he has to play this team all year round. I think there could be a transfer system after the first lap so that some of the quality players of the smallest teams can move to another better team. Some may say it wouldn't be fair, but I'm thinking of just two or three players so that all teams can make transfers at the end of the first round.
 
Who are the favorites this year in the championship?
I like the Macao University team, they play a very good football. Shao Jiang too, change the ball very well, but then they have to improve in conclusion, while the University of Macao changes the ball well and can make it realize. And it must be remembered that it is a team without African or Brazilian players.
 
Which is still strange, because it is the two teams that climbed the division…
Yes, exactly, but that's good.
 
And who is the best player of the championship?
I would say Visby [Cheng-Lam Law, a player at the University of Macau]. It's only 20 years old, I think it has a great future.</description><pubDate /></item></channel></rss>
