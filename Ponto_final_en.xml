Among the various books contained in the author's bibliography, those with the object of study are the oral Timorese tradition in the form of tales, legends and fables. The first work published on this area of ​​study was “Tamous Tamous and Legends” in 2014, which brought together 31 popular tales and legends in the region.

The 7.7 magnitude earthquake has reached a large area of ​​the country, causing significant damage to six regions and states, including the capital Nayphitaw, leaving many areas without energy and communications.
The shake also aggravated the humanitarian crisis triggered by the country's civil war, which internally moved more than three million people, according to the United Nations.

Thailand gives up looking for survivors in skyscraper
 
Thailand acknowledged that it could not find any survivor among the almost 80 people missing among the rubble of a skyscraper under construction in the capital, after the earthquake of March 28th. “We looked thoroughly every point we could reach, every breach and slot. We did not find survivors in these spaces,” said Banguecoque governor, Chadchart Sittipunt.
During a press conference, the politician noted that the rescue teams are no longer detecting any vital sign where he was heard on Thursday a noise attributed to a woman attached by the collapse. "It's a sad time for everyone, but we believe [the rescue teams] did the best they could," said the mayor.
Authorities estimate that 15 bodies have been recovered from the place where the future auditor's future office was being built, while 79 workers are missing, from the more than 300 who were at the workplace at the time of collapse. “As much as we excavated, everything we found were steel beams and narrow openings,” said the governor, highlighting the complex task faced by the operation after the collapse of the building of more than 30 floors located in the north of the city and near the Chatuchak tourist market.
Chadchart indicated that the mission will focus on the recovery of bodies and the demolition of parts of the project, resuming the use of heavy machinery, which was temporarily suspended after the detection of life signals.
This although an emergency team continues to monitor possible vital signs, the politician emphasized. "If we detect any [sign of life], we will send the rescue team. [The heavy machinery] will allow us to open more areas," said the governor.
According to experts, rubbish removal work can take up to 60 days.

Exports from Portuguese -speaking countries to China fell 30.7% in the first two months of 2025, compared to the same period last year.
According to information from China's customs services, in January and February the Lusophone Block sold goods of $ 17 billion to the Chinese market.
According to the data, gathered by the Forum for Economic and Commercial Cooperation between China and the Portuguese -speaking countries (Macao Forum), this is the lowest value for the first two months of a year since 2021, in the middle of COVID - 19 pandemic.
The descent was due mainly to the largest Lusophone supplier in the Chinese market, Brazil, whose sales fell one third (33.4%) to $ 13.7 billion. In addition, also the second largest Chinese commercial partner in the Lusophone block, Angola, saw exports decrease 16.4% to $ 2.37 billion.
Also sales of goods from Portugal to China decreased by 13% to $ 444.4 million. On the contrary, Mozambique exports rose more than one third (34.4%) to $ 332.2 million.
Equatorial Guinea exports to the Chinese market dropped 71.2%to $ 85.6 million, while Timor-Leste sales shrunk 98%.
The exports of Sao Tome and Principe also fell 53.3%, although the country did not sell more than 1,000 dollars in goods. Already Cape Verde and Guinea-Bissau did not sell any merchandise to China in the first two months of 2025.

According to the jury president, Gonçalo Lobo Pinheiro, this sixth edition of “We Are Images of Lusophony” was the “most memorable” and the one that had the largest number of participants in the history of the photographic contest.
 
A Mozambican photographer won, for the first time, the first place in the contest “We are images of Lusophony”, from Somos! - Portuguese Language Communication Association (Somos - ACLP), in what was the edition with the most participants ever. Marcos Júnior obtained first place with an image entitled “Where there is faith, there is light that guides”, being the podium of winners completed by the Portuguese photographers Adelino Meireles, with “Saudades”, and João Carlos, author of “Madonna da Wisdom Description”.
The sixth edition of the contest was subordinate to the theme “Man and the Divine”, inviting a reflection on the various religious traditions and theistic philosophies in Portuguese -speaking countries. The young Mozambican photographer Marcos Júnior raised the first prize of the contest, worth ten thousand patacas, with an image entitled "Where there is faith, there is light that guides", portraying a priest to bless a faithful in a church.
In a statement, the organizing association states that this gesture goes beyond a mere ritualist meaning, building “a symbolic bridge between humanity and the divine” that “connects the terrain to the heavenly”. The two figures, wrapped in the "Reverent Dim Church", contrast with "a light that emerges in the background," in a game of lights and shadows that refers to the "incessant search for the human being by the transcendent." In addition to the cash prize, the winner will also be entitled to travel and stay in Macao to ensure his presence at the inauguration ceremony of the subsequent photographic exhibition, at the end of May.
Second place was attributed to the Portuguese Adelino Meireles, with a photograph captured in Porto. Undoubtedly called “Saudades”, the work portrays a moment of prayer of the Ukrainian community in one of the various makeshift churches in the Portuguese city, where the faithful usually meet. “There, between prayers and traditions, they find comfort and recreate the sense of belonging, in a house that is now yours,” interprets Somos - ACLP, which attributed to photography a prize of seven thousand patacas.
Closing the podium is the photograph “Madonna da Wisdom Description”, a version of the classic iconography of Madonna and the boy reimagined by Portuguese João Carlos. The “simultaneously contemporary and timeless” figure of the mother, portrayed to read while breastfeeding, evokes “the Renaissance tradition that unites education to care” and reads “the duality between knowledge and maternal instinct”. The jurors rewarded this work with a prize of five thousand patacas.
In addition to the appointment of the three winners, the jury, composed of photojournalists working in Macau, Portugal and Guinea-Bissau and chaired by Gonçalo Lobo Pinheiro, also appointed a trio of honorable mentions. The highlights were for the Brazilian Ana Cláudia Talieri, with a portrait of a seropositive man who rediscovered the faith (“prayer in the open”), the Portuguese Bruno Taveira, with a photograph of a paschal compass in Trás-os-Montes (“Cross in the hands, faith in the heart”), and the Bruno Pedro, who competed with an image of an elderly man at the door of an elderly man ( Tradition ”).
The selection of the winners was hampered by the “high quality” of more than three hundred photographs submitted to the competition - the largest number already recorded throughout the six editions of the initiative. “The final choice of the winners, the honorable mentions and the photographs that will be part of the exhibition of the Annual Contest of Somos! It was not easy,” recognizes photojournalist Gonçalo Lobo Pinheiro. "This year, we hit all the records of participation, with images from different corners of the Lusophone world, revealing various looks and powerful visual narratives. The level of works submitted surprised the jury, which faced the difficult challenge of selecting among so many creative and sensitive proposals."
Although the maximum prize was attributed to Mozambican Marcos Júnior, whose photography “captured with strength and poetry the spirit of the proposed theme”, all participants are congratulated by the president of the jury “for the quality of the sent works”, who contributed to make this edition “the most memorable so far”.
The award -winning photographs, as well as a selection of “about four dozen other” selected by relevance and relevance criteria to the theme “The Man and the Divine”, will integrate an exhibition to occur in late May in Parisian Macao, in a date to be defined.

In parallel, it has taken "the benefit of the advantages brought by the" a country, two systems "principle in order to boost the proper diversification of the territory economy and accelerate in the integration of the national development conjuncture."

Calm, but attentive economists</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/04/07/abrandamento-das-receitas-tera-impacto-no-bolso-dos-residentes-economistas-calmos-mas-atentos/</link><description>To the ride of softening casinos gross revenues in the first quarter, which are below the government expected, the current management's current revenues have also fallen. What impact will this be in the resident wallet? Economists heard by the end point are not alarmed, but there are those who mashed in the pecuniary checks and in the increases in the civil service.
 
Gross game industry recipes have not been the one the government foresaw. This deceleration has impacted public revenues and the executive has already admitted that he is less optimistic than at the beginning of the year. Can these factors precipitate changes in pecuniary checks or prevent increases for civil service workers, for example? Economists heard by the end point say there is no reason for alarm. José Luís Sales Marques, however, says there may be adjustments.
At the end of last year, the Ho IAT SENG government presented the base budget for this year estimating that gross game revenues would reach, by 2025, 240 billion patacas, or an average of 60 billion per quarter. Now, between January and March, the casinos operating in Macao invoiced 57.6 billion patacas - a negative deviation of approximately 3.9%. In the first two months of this year, the current administration revenue was 15.9 billion patacas, 14% less than in the first two months of 2024.
Given this, and at a time when the governments are about to present the Governing Action Lines (LAG) for this year, both Sam Hou Fai and Tai Kin IP have already shown little optimistic compared to this year's public revenues. The current Chief Executive has warned that MSar will face many economic challenges this year and the Secretary for Economics and Finance said that “this year's financial revenues may not be as optimistic as expected”, there is a need to “seriously study the future economic situation” and “persist in the management of financial resources with caution” based on the principle of maintenance of expenses within the limits of revenue.
 
What impacts?
 
José Luís Sales Marques begins by commenting that this negative deviation from gross game revenues "is not, for now, a serious situation", but "requires adjustments to budget expenses, as other tax revenues are relatively small." On the other hand, "the International Economy Conjuncture is unstable and reflected in the Chinese national economy," so "the government will have to adjust its budget down, which will probably do when the government lines are announced." It is recalled that Sam Hou Fai presents the lag in precisely a week.
Can this impact the pecuniary reimbursement plan or make civil servants out of increases this year? "It is not likely that pecuniary checks or increases in the civil service will be suspended, but the amount of checks or percentage applied to the wage increase of the civil service can be adjusted in accordance with the expected reduction of public revenues," says the economist.
Sales Marques emphasizes that, even if a descent of public revenues of around 3.9%are confirmed, the administration will continue with a positive balance "not to move anything and yet maintain a balanced budget."
Henry Lei agrees that, with falling economic indices, "the government cannot be too optimistic." "It cannot be assumed that there is continuous growth of revenues from the game," otherwise "Macau may register a budgetary deficit due to eventual shocks in the game's recipes."
Despite the growth below expectations, “Macao's fiscal situation is still very healthy, with over 600 billion of tax reserves, which corresponds to more than five times the annual fiscal expenses of the Government of MSAR”, notes the associate professor of the Department of Finance and Business Economics at the University of Macao.
This means that, in practice, "the Government of MSAR has sufficient resources to maintain the distribution of pecuniary checks," but "must be careful before deciding to increase the amount." Henry Law also points to the social discontent that would cause the end of the attribution of the pecuniary check, noting that, therefore, "it is difficult to end this regime, reduce its amount, or change its model."
José Isaac Duarte only states that, despite falling short of government objectives, revenues are in line with last year's. However, the economist points out, "international instability - and the enormous associated uncertainty - is the most relevant factor about the future," but "this" movie "has already started."</description><pubDate>2025-04-07 03:35:22</pubDate></item><item><title>Closing of the voice of America reinforces China's influence in Africa</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/04/07/encerramento-da-voz-da-america-reforca-influencia-da-china-em-africa/</link><description>An analyst heard by Lusa considered that the US decision to end Radio Voz do América is “great news” for Beijing, which has invested heavily in recent years to shape international public opinion, especially in Africa.
 
João Pimenta, Lusa Agency
 
"The closing of the voice of America is a great news for China," said Dani Madrid-Morales, a global political communication expert at Sheffield University who has been following Beijing's efforts for many years, particularly on the African continent.
"In Africa, VOA was more popular than [Chinese state television] CGTN or other Chinese agencies," said the researcher, highlighting the "different journalistic values" of the vehicle so far supported by the US Federal Government: "Voa was known for giving voice to opposition parties, while CGTN gives, above all, voice to those who are in government," he said.
A VOA mantinha também um portal em língua chinesa que publicava histórias omitidas pela imprensa do país asiático. A China ocupa o 172º lugar entre 180 países no índice de liberdade de imprensa dos Repórteres Sem Fronteiras.
In editorial, the Global Times, the official newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party, greeted the decision of Donald Trump's administration. "The so -called Freedom Lighthouse, the fly, has now been discarded by its own government as a dirty rag," he said.
Voa was one of the oldest international radios and emitted in 48 languages, including Portuguese, so it played a relevant role in Lusophone Africa.
Trump's decision arises at a time when China is “more active” in efforts to influence public opinion in Africa, aiming to shake the influence of Western powers on the continent and assuming protagonism on international affairs, Madrid-Morales noted.
CGTN has a production center in Nairobi and the Chinese official news agency Xinhua has already opened about 30 delegations on the continent. Every year, dozens of African journalists participate in a six -month exchange in China organized by the country's authorities, which includes travel, accommodation and paid expenses.
Sharing or sponsored content publication agreements also allow Beijing bodies to diffuse in African countries information approved by the Communist Party propaganda with the local independent communication bodies seal.
Other efforts include providing equipment to African communication agencies, signing long -term contracts with newspapers to publish articles from ambassadors and other Chinese employees or the use of influencers on social networks.
Madrid-Morales noted that China has changed its approach to a "reactive" position, which defended itself from criticism of human rights violations, for example, for a "proactive" stance. "Now we see China to take leadership on certain topics and actively attack the United States, Washington 'hypocrisy', France or Western 'double patterns' in West Africa and French Africa," he said.
The transformation began with the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong and intensified during the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine.
The greater proactivity of Beijing's organs is in tune with a transformation in Chinese foreign policy, from a “discreet profile” to a more assertive stance. "It is the reflection of a change in China," said the researcher: "With [President] Xi Jinping, China began to claim more discursive power and to use this power more aggressively."

Promoted in cooperation with Ephemera Public Space Cooperative, the exhibition aims to use a huge digital "right" to convey the message that "we are all interconnected."
 
The work of Austrian artist Peter Kogler will be on display at Impromptu Storefront from Thursday, around 17:00, where he will remain until the end of the year. The inauguration ceremony will be attended by the Austria Consul General in Hong Kong and Macau, Gerhard Zettle.
The installation of art, the result of a joint initiative of Impromptu Projects and Ephemera Public Space Coopertive, aims to distort the boundaries between reality and illusion and comment on the interconnectivity between human beings and the world surrounding it, through a visual spectacle using computer -generated patterns and objects. The scale of this visual screen has been purposely conceived to give the feeling that the visitor is being “swallowed” by an infinite network, constantly transformation and repetition, inviting him to feel an integral part of the artistic space.
"The mission of Impromptu Storefront has always been to dismantle the traditional gallery space hierarchy. We believe that art should not be entrusted to the sterile environment of the white cube; it must be accessible to everyone, regardless of its formation or experience," said artistic directors João O and Rita Machado, in a press release. "The installation of Kogler perfectly embodies this philosophy. It is a work of art that thrives into interaction, which invites participation and which transforms everyday one into something extraordinary."
With a career of over four decades, Peter Kogler is internationally recognized by the “specific vocabulary” he uses in his space facilities, full of biomorphic and symbolic structures created with video projections, computer -generated creations and traditional interior design elements such as furniture or curtains. Born in Innsbruck in 1959, the Austrian was one of the first artists of his generation to explore the potential of computers as creative tools in their first individual exhibitions in the 1980s. Still today, four decades later, Kogler continues to challenge the traditional notions of space, time and depth and to create “illusion mazes” acclaimed in numerous art exhibitions around the world.
In parallel on the show, a talk titled “Storefront Design: Case Studies and the Scenic Transformation of the Shop Window” for May this year, co-organized with the Macao European Study Institute.
“This exhibition is more than a simple visual show; it is an invitation to reconsider our relationship with the world around us. It is a reminder that we are all interconnected, that we all part of a larger network, and that the boundaries between us and our environment are often more fluid than we imagine. Between the network, and discover a new perspective of the world,” reads the artistic communication of the directors Impromptu.

Supporters of the now former president of South Korea manifested themselves, demanding their immediate return and classifying opposition as an “anti-state cartel” that must be eradicated.
Thousands of conservative groups gathered in the Gwanghwamun area in downtown Seoul, despite the rain, a day after the court's decision, arguing that the dismissal is “invalid” and appealing to the dissolution of the Constitutional Court.
According to EFE agency, some protesters also appealed to the boycott of early elections, which must be held within 60 days after the dismissal.
Authorities closed Saturday to the streets near the Constitutional Court and also the presidential residence, which Yoon is expected to leave next week.
On Friday, the South Korean Constitutional Court confirmed the dismissal of South Korean President Yoon Suk-Youol, due to the declaration of martial law in December. The confirmation of Yoon's dismissal was adopted with the vote in favor of the eight judges of the Constitutional Court.
Yoon has been suspended for more than 100 days since the National Assembly approved the motion of dismissal. The process has been marked by strong social and political polarization, with mass protests across the country and polls showing that about 60% of citizens support dismissal.</description><pubDate>2025-04-07 03:35:29</pubDate></item><item><title>Real Estate Agency provides for a break by 20% in houses prices</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/04/07/agencia-imobiliaria-preve-quebra-ate-20-nos-precos-das-casas/</link><description>Real estate agency Centaline estimates that housing prices in Macau will still lower and register a decrease between 10% and 20% in the second quarter of this year, with a monthly average of 200 transactions.
"Residents and investors are in a conserved attitude due to uncertainties in the global economic environment and the pace of interest rates in the United States," the agency said in a recent report on the evolution of the real estate market, cited by the newspaper or Mun. Centaline has indicated that the persistence of the “low level” of the market will depend on the possible reduction in interest rates in the United States in the second half of the year and the eventual launch of real estate support policies by the Macao government.
According to a balance of the agency, the drop in prices and the volume of transactions were already registered in the first quarter of the year. The Centaline report indicated that the number of transactions in the housing market was 270 in January and 176 in February, and it is expected that in March 200 transactions will be made. The agency designs as soon as 646 transactions are carried out throughout the quarter, which represents a 13% break from last year's same period. The average price per square meter of service area of ​​the units intended for sale in the last three months was about 74,800 patacas, a break of about 12.6% in annual terms.
Centaline suggested that the authorities attribute a subsidy to residents in paying the entry and interest on housing acquisition, allowing more local people to acquire houses for their own use at the low level of real estate prices. He proposed, in addition, the introduction of measures in capturing foreign investment, such as extending the permanence authorization period for those who have bought a home in Macao.
On the other hand, the real estate agency stated that the purchase and sale of commercial and industrial real estate should also remain falling, and the volume of transactions registered a decrease exceeding 20% ​​by March, not predicting “a significant short -term recovery”.</description><pubDate>2025-04-07 03:34:37</pubDate></item><item><title>China imposes a 34% tariff on US imports from April 10</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/04/07/china-impoe-tarifa-de-34-a-importacoes-dos-eua-a-partir-de-10-de-abril/</link><description>China has announced that it will impose a 34% rate on imports from all US products from next Thursday of April 10. The new fare corresponds to the US's “reciprocal” fare rate imposed by President Donald Trump this week.
 
The Ministry of Commerce in Beijing also said, in a statement cited by AP, that it will impose more rare land export controls, which are materials used in high -tech products such as semiconductors and electric vehicle batteries.
The 34% rate announced for Beijing adds to the 20% already in force, raising the total to 54%.
Additionally, the Chinese government has announced that it has added 27 companies to the lists of companies subject to commercial sanctions or export controls.
Among them, 16 are subject to prohibition of export of “double use” goods.
High Point Aerotechnologies, a defense technology company, and Universal Logistics Holding, a publicly traded transportation and logistics company, were among those listed, according to AP.
Beijing also announced that he filed a lawsuit in the World Trade Organization (WTO) on the issue of tariffs. "The imposition by the United States of so -called 'reciprocal tariffs' severely violates WTO rules, severely impairs the legitimate rights and interests of WTO members and severely undermines the rules -based multilateral trade system and international economic and commercial order," the Ministry of Commerce said. "It is a typical practice of unilateral intimidation that endanger the stability of the global economic and commercial order. China firmly opposes this," he said.
In February, China announced a 15% rate on charcoal imports and US liquefied natural gas products.
Separately, it added a 10% rate on gross oil, agricultural machinery and large cars.
The latest tariffs apply to all products manufactured in the US, according to a statement by the Ministry of Finance Tariff Committee, cited by AP.
US President Donald Trump reiterated in press reiterations aboard Air Force One, will be willing to grant tariff relief to China, if Beijing approves a negotiating agreement to open the capital of Chinese Tiktok application in the country, an option previously rejected by Beijing.
Donald Trump answered questions about whether he is willing to reach a deal with several countries to mitigate the impact of tariffs he has announced against countries around the world, including China, which is now subject to a total tariff of 54%. “Since they offer us something positive [there is availability to reduce tariffs]. For example, with Tiktok. We have a situation where China probably will say: 'We have approved the deal, but what are you going to do about tariffs?'” He explained. "The rates give us a tremendous negotiation power. They always did. I used them very well in the first administration. Now we are taking it to a totally new level," he said.
Trump clarified that at this stage he is not having concrete conversations with Beijing on the subject.
On Wednesday, on a day that nicknamed “Liberation Day”, Trump imposed a 10% rate on 184 countries and territories, including the European Union (EU). In the case of China, the country announced a 34%rate, adding to the 20%already in force, increasing the total to 54%.

China wages Tiktok's sale in the US after Trump imposing tariffs
 
China's government has blocked an agreement to sell US investors from Tiktok, a platform controlled by the Chinese Bytedance, after the imposition of tariffs by the United States, a source said. The source, which asked not to be identified, told the Associated Press (AP) news agency that the US presidency believed the parties were close to an agreement. The agreement provided that Tiktok's operations in the US were separated in a new company, held in the country, detained and operated by a majority of US investors, with Bytedance to maintain a minority position. Optimism around the agreement will have led US President Donald Trump to say Friday that he would maintain an operational Tiktok in the country for another 75 days, the day before expiring the deadline for selling the platform. “My government has been working hard to save Tiktok, and we made a tremendous progress,” Trump, who said the business was imminent on Thursday. "The agreement requires more work to ensure that all necessary approvals are signed, which is why I am signing an executive order to keep Tiktok for another 75 days," he said. "We look forward to working with Tiktok and China to close the deal," said the US president.</description><pubDate>2025-04-07 03:29:49</pubDate></item><item><title>Verstappen is imposed in Japan and breaks record in Formula 1</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/04/07/verstappen-impoe-se-no-japao-e-bate-recorde-na-formula-1/</link><description>Waterlande Max Verstappen (Red Bull) won yesterday the Grand Prix of Formula 1 Japan, the third round of the season, and became the first driver to win four consecutive triumphs in Suzuka.

It happened when the Dutch and the McLaren stopped in the pits, while Mercedes delayed their pilot's change of tires waiting for a safety car that never emerged (there were no incidents). Antonelli was also the youngest to make the fastest rolling around running.
Monegasco Charles Leclerc was Ferrari's best representative in front of British George Russell (Mercedes). Antonelli was the sixth, beating British Lewis Hamilton (Ferrari), who was seventh.
Japanese Yuki Tsunoda (Red Bull) was the 12th in the first team debut, while New Zealander Liam Lawson was 17th on the return to Racing Bulls.
