The government announcement has not revealed, for now, the list of people included or the date of deposit of the money.
 
The government will return this year to assign seven thousand patacas to the holders of the individual central pension regime individual account that fulfill the legal requirements, announced yesterday an order signed by the chief executive, Sam Hou Fai, published in an official bulletin.
The attribution of the money as an extraordinary office of budget balances is, under the law, determined by order of the chief executive and “heard the direction of finance services”, he said.
The list of assignment of the money has not yet been disclosed by the Social Security Fund. However, according to the stipulations, when the situation of budgetary execution of prior economic years justifies it, a money may be attributed to the holder of the account that is survived on January 1 of the year in which the order, which has fulfilled in the previous calendar year the requirements of being permanent resident of the masters, being 22 years old and remained at least for 18 days.
The requirement of permanence in the MSAR for a minimum of 183 days will be exempt in the case of people who attend higher education courses abroad, have completed 65 years of age and usually reside inside China, provide work abroad because they are responsible for subsistence from their resident family members in Macao, or for receiving hospitalization, and may file a complaint because they are not included in the list of funds.
The non -mandatory central pension regime came into force in 2018, which is, according to the presentation of the Social Security Fund, the 2nd level of the two -level social security regime, aiming to “reinforce social protection in the old age of Macao residents” and complement the current social security regime.
This regime is composed of the contributory regime and the distributive regime, and the contributory is made through contributions jointly by employers and workers, while the distributive regime is realized through the transfer of funds to the residents of Macau qualified, as a basic incentive or extraordinary Budget Balances. In general, only the holders of accounts who have been 65 years old may require the raising of funds from their individual non -mandatory central pension regime.
The injection of money happens almost every year except during a three -year suspension between 2021 and 2023 due to the government's financial deficit in pandemic times.
Last year, it should be recalled, the amount distributed was also seven thousand patacas and a total of 389,346 people were considered eligible to receive the money, with 183,181 people were excluded from the list.
Despite the entry into force of the legislation in 2018, the government began the distributive regime of the non -compulsory central pension regime in 2010, and had previously advanced that, between 2010 and 2024, the total value of the appropriation was about 31.8 billion.</description><pubDate>2025-05-20 01:47:39</pubDate></item><item><title>Government has “ostrich policy” regarding suicides, accuses Ron Lam</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/05/20/governo-tem-politica-de-avestruz-em-relacao-aos-suicidios-acusa-ron-lam/</link><description>In recent days, six deaths suspected of suicides have been recorded. This was the starting point of the intervention before the agenda of Deputy Ron Lam. At yesterday's plenary meeting of the Legislative Assembly, the parliamentarian said that the government does not have adequate policies to respond to the population's mental health problems and even accused the executive of hiding his head in the sand.
 
A vacancy of suicides is hitting Macau. In just over a week, there were six deaths suspected of suicides, four more corpses and an attempt. This was the starting point for the intervention before the agenda of Ron Lam, at yesterday's plenary meeting of the Legislative Assembly (AL). The deputy criticized the government's approach and requested measures.
Last year, there were 91 cases of suicide, with their rate reaching 13.6 per 100,000 people, significantly higher than the international average of about nine to ten people, and the suicide rate in Macau increased 44 percent in the 10 -year space, compared to the 9.4 cases recorded in 2015. Of between 91 people who took their lives last year, four and nine years old and nine were between 15 and nine were between 15 years. “It's urgent to pay attention and deal with the suicide problem in Macau,” warned Ron Lam.
The deputy elected by Via Direct said that “the information disclosed currently by the government is limited”: “For example, the numbers of suicide deaths released by health services are quarterly and through press notes, with data classified according to sex, if it is resident of Macao and the ages, therefore, as this data is not complete, it is not possible to perform an analysis and comparison”. Note that he understands that there may be the contagion effect, Ron Lam said authorities use this as a "pretext" not to face the problem properly.
Ron Lam criticized the fact that the authorities hide information about the victims, namely the younger ones, which "makes society's analysis difficult on the psychological health of students."
The deputy criticized the secretary's recent statements for social affairs and culture, which he recently said that, to improve mental health, residents should focus on culture and sport. "These words have generated a lot of discussion in society, which demonstrates divergence between the government and the population," said the deputy, stressing that teachers, school staff, social workers, doctors and nurses have told him that the number of suicides have dealt with in recent years, and it is increasingly common to have young people with mental health and stress problems.
In Ron Lam's understanding, the front line staff are no way to act preventively in these cases, which "shows that the current mechanisms are not effectively responding to suicide trend cases."
Ron Lam thus suggested that the government “abandon the current ostrich policy” and create “specific and objective mechanisms, to, in full and rationally, to disclose the essential information on suicide cases”, providing “gross data in the publications and statistical studies, so that society and the sectors concern about mental health and suicide.”
"It is necessary to provide adequate information about prevention and how to ask for help, above all, to alert society to pay attention and support to people around," he said, also requiring the definition of clear objectives to reduce the number of suicides.</description><pubDate>2025-05-20 01:39:36</pubDate></item><item><title>Nohat, a cryptocurrency with NFTs, releases two songs</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/05/20/nohat-uma-criptomoeda-com-nfts-lanca-duas-musicas/</link><description>Macao artist and graphic designer, José Drummond, is, since the end of December, the CEO of Nohat, a cryptocurrency created from a viral image of the internet, which has a set of NFTs around him. With several initiatives associated with the project, among them are also two original songs just released.
 
It may have hair, sunglasses, headphones and everything that feels like its creators, but it is always the same inn -in -breed dog, like Dogwifhat, the memecoin that gave rise to it. Created from images that viralized on the internet, Nohat is a project that includes in its universe NFTS, unique and non -replaceable digital tokens recorded in Blockchain, which represent the property of digital actives linked to culture. CEO since December, José Drummond reveals that Nohat has a “huge” community: there are more than 5000 memecoin holders, above 4500 members on the Telegram conversation channel and 9000 followers on social network X.
Some years ago José Drummond began investing in cryptocurrencies. “I started by buying Bitcoin, Solana and a series of these coins,” he begins to say to the end. “I am aware that this is the future,” he says. In fact, he points out, just observe the evolution of Bitcoin over time. “10 years ago, anything was like 800 US dollars and today is worth 90000.”
It started as a curious mere, but quickly realized that this would be your way. First, we were involved in web3 issues, an idea for future internet evolution based on blockchain technology and controlled by the user community. "It is decentralization, just as Bitcoin is the decentralization of the currency," he says. Overall, they all settle in the same premise: that of greater control over what is on the internet, removing it from large companies.
Last year, when Bitcoin exploded, he also began to pay more attention to memecoins. “They are born from an idea, from a joke,” he explains. Particularly interested in the Nohat project, he began to invest and was later invited to create the images that were shared.
 
From investor to creator and CEO
 
With Nohat growing up, the community eventually asked José Drummond to be the CEO of the project. For the artist, it is different from other coins. "Power is given to the people, it is not through influencers or Crypto Whales [individuals or entities that have a large volume of cryptocurrencies]," he says, adding: "We all have the right to participate, we all have the right to our dreams."
In fact, if the current monetary system is already in trouble, considering that “the great continue to print currency and inflation continues to rise”, also the movement of cryptocurrencies is “spoiled”, with large companies to take over. Nohat aims to be a resistance movement. “Don't bake the barge, we are fighting for the idea that you can create your own future,” he says, alluding to the name of the project.
For Drummond, given its dimension, the Nohat project would have to be different from what already exists, “contributing to society otherwise, betting on the cultural aspect,” he says. Therefore, three series of NFTs were created. The first, paid, is the “Nohat Legends” and includes 2025 NFTs, 13.5 percent of which have already been listed. "NFT is in blockchain and, for obtaining, you have to make a transaction and, when they are first transactions, have visibility," he explains. “They are handmade, using techniques prior to artificial intelligence and are based on the image of an Inu Shiba dog.“ I created most images at first: a dog smiling, a dog with smaller eyes, with sunglasses, hair and NFTs follow these variations, ”he says,“ they are unique, these combinations are all different. ”
As for the other two series, “The Hat Stays Off” and “Universal Declaration of Dogs Rights”, Mint is free, ie the creation and registration of a unique token in blockchain. "They just require the money from the transaction, but they do not need to be bought. There is a part that goes to the author and, with NFTs, you can ensure that 10 percent of future sales always go back to the artist, when it goes to the secondary market," he explains.
 
Graffitis, websites and augmented reality
 
There are several other projects designed for Nohat, which go beyond its ability to reproduce money. Moved by the motto "The hat is still out of the head," Nohat started as a memecoin, but has expanded the activity. It also seeks to create graffitis, founding websites and is also working with an augmented reality program. "We are working with designers in Chinese to have an augmented reality program: I point the phone and have the element you want," he reveals.
They are also operating in the video field. “We created a narrative where, when the House points to the hero, it is our dog that is there, all done with Green Screen for animation,” he says.
Accompanying all this is also the creation of a series of products, which include clothing, bags, headphones, Rubik cubes, parrots, all made in China, which aim to promote the brand. “These are reproductions of our NFTs universe,” he says. To be discussed at this time is the possibility of selling these products in three shopping centers in mainland China.
 
The release of new songs and philanthropy
 
The project also encompasses the creation of music. “How can we differentiate from other memecoins that already exist?” Thought José Drummond. “Creating a strong narrative and its own identity around our project, and in this sense, music could be part,” says the DJ. By the way, considering that most memecoins use the sound of others ”or using AI”, José Drummond wanted to bring originality and released two musical adventures. “A more urban, from hip hop. We have an album whose composition process was all done by samples and sequencers, old -fashioned, before AI,” he explains.
The songs are yours, but it has the collaboration of other DJs. The project is named “A Tribe Called Nohat” and is “a tribute to the start of hip hop in the 1980s”. But there is another song, more focused on the progressive techno. “We created a label, NOH8T, and our idea is the regular release of songs, with distribution in stores,” he says.
In the specific case of Techno music, the idea is to bet on Beatport, a platform more dedicated to electronic music. “Anyone who downloads from Beatport gets a community reward,” he says. The songs are also for sale on over 150 platforms, such as iTunes and Amazon, and available for streaming on Spotify and, in mainland China, at Tencent.
Around music, the goal is also to create cultural events with DJs. “We want the parties on Twitch - it's the best platform for this at the moment,” he reveals. But these will not only take place in the virtual world. On the table is the possibility of organizing events in Hong Kong, Shanghai, Los Angeles and Lisbon.
To this cake, the philanthropic part is also added. Two of the causes that the project seeks to support is, for now, the end of the laboratory dogs and the support for neurodivergent persons. “More important than bringing profit to investors is to try to create any cultural impact and give anything back to society,” he says.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Indonesia issues maximum alert for volcano on Flores Island after a new eruption</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/05/20/indonesia-emite-alerta-maximo-para-vulcao-na-ilha-das-flores-apos-nova-erupcao/</link><description>Mount Lewotobi Laki-Laki volcano on Flores Island yesterday expelled a column of ashes more than one kilometer tall, after Indonesia placed the surrounding zone on maximum alert.
In a statement issued on Sunday night, the Indonesian Volcanology Department raised the volcano's alert to the highest level, on a four scale, citing an increase in activity, with eight weekend rashes, including one that launched ashes to a height of 5.5 kilometers.
Indonesian agency director Muhammad Wafid said that "there will be no activities within six kilometers [around the volcano], while in the West-Northeast Sector, the zone extends up to seven kilometers of the crater."
The expert asked communities that live near the volcano who keep calm, wear facial masks and be careful about possible lava flows.
In mid -February, during a similar increase in the activity, the authorities had ordered residents of six cities that abandoned their dwellings. Shortly thereafter, Lewotobi Laki-Laki expelled gray clouds about eight kilometers high, causing at least seven flights to Bali's tourist island.
Flores Island, from which many excursions depart, especially for the Komodo National Park, is approximately 800 kilometers east from Bali.
The 1,703 meters high volcano had erupted several times in November, causing the death of nine people, injuring 31 and forcing the withdrawal of 11,000 people.
Indonesia has over 400 volcanoes, of which at least 129 are still active and 65 are classified as dangerous.
The country is within the so-called Pacific Fire Circle, an area of ​​intense seismic and volcanic activity that is shaken by about seven thousand earthquakes a year, most of them of small magnitude.</description><pubDate>2025-05-20 01:50:37</pubDate></item><item><title>Rui Cunha Foundation explores the millennial culture of tea in China</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/05/20/fundacao-rui-cunha-explora-a-cultura-milenar-do-cha-na-china/</link><description>The second edition of the book “A Brief Cultural History of China Tea”, by author Rui Rocha, has the date of release chosen to finger: May 21, International Tea Day. The presentation session at the Rui Cunha Foundation will be conducted by the writer and gastroenterologist Shee Va, who, in statements to the end, explains that the theme is much more “broad” than it may seem superficially: from culture to economy, “there is a world around tea that has a lot of interest”.
 
The Rui Cunha Foundation presents the second edition of the book “A Brief Cultural History of China Tea”, by Rui Rocha, this Wednesday, at 18:30. The event will be conducted in Portuguese by writer and gastroenterologist Shee VA, with free admission.
The work, originally published in 2022 by Praia Grande editions, traces the millennial history of tea culture in China and its role and meaning in the most diverse dimensions, from politics to medicine. In the introduction of the book, the author - who is currently president of the Center for Study and Innovation on Blue Economy in the Greater Bay region, after performing director roles at the East Foundation and the Portuguese Institute of the East (IPOR) - begins by describing tea as “the oldest drink in human history”, except water and milk, having been introduced into the human diet for about four thousand years.
Tea plants, endemic to Chinese territory, intersect deeply with the country's political and economic history and, on the other hand, with the cultural and esoteric beliefs of civilization, still deeply rooted in Chinese medicine practiced in contemporary times. Ancestral tea ceremonies would later extend from China to the rest of the world, starting in the neighboring countries of Korea, Vietname or Japan and then spread at the time of maritime expansions to the European continent.
Today, according to the author, it may be possible to categorize tea as "the most appreciated drink in the world and the greatest impact and continues to have in cultures and peoples that, from the West, have adopted it as philosophy or simply as a drink of great subtlety and refinement."
 
Second edition is more “complete”
 
The choice of May 21 for the launch of the second edition of the book was deliberate: this Wednesday is celebrated, the International Day of Tea, stated by the United Nations General Assembly in 2019. The doctor and writer Shee Va, in statements to the end, assumes the symbolic dimension of the date: “We sought to hurry the launch of the second edition, precisely to coincide with this day.”
The first run, edited in October 2022, was “very well-received” by the Macao audience and ended up running out, originating the second edition that arrives this week to the newsstands. “He took the opportunity to clarify some subjects and add more information” to a work that, stresses Shee Va, was already “very complete”. And, more than complete, useful: "We know that there are many books about tea in English and Chinese, but in Portuguese do not exist. It is very positive that Rui [Rocha] has written the book and spread the theme with the Portuguese public."
The doctor emphasizes that while tea theme may seem circumscribed to the study of plants, leaves and beneficial properties to health, their branches cover the whole history of Chinese civilization. "The presence of tea in Chinese culture is very old. The relationship of tea with health; the relationship of tea with the arts, namely poetry and painting; the economic part… It is a very wide theme. Tea itself may seem little, but there is a world around tea that has a lot of interest.”
Tea also occupies a prominent position in the therapeutic plane, including - increasingly - in the West. In this regard, Shee Va assumes some reservations: “I consume a lot of tea, but it is more for pleasure and not exactly because of health. There are many concepts present in the book that we do not practice oriental medicine or Chinese medicine, we cannot decipher. There are many notions of Chinese medicine that the western does not reach, such as the relationship of zodiac or specific organs where the drink is supposed to act.”

The event starts today, at 18:00, with the launch of a commemorative book of the ten years since “Facing Light” was first aired in 2014. There is an opening ceremony on the same day at 18:30. On Thursday, between 14:30 and 16:30, the foundation receives a lecture on the theme of mental illness and the impact that the short film had on the population of Macao over the last decade.
Throughout these four days, it will be available to the public, with free admission, a show with more than 80 photos about the film's recordings, as well as reports on the role provided by MPMHPA volunteers in care for people affected by psychological disorders.
In a statement from the Rui Cunha Foundation, it is read that the film, lasting 48 minutes, “used realistic stories to reflect discrimination and the difficulties faced by people with mental illnesses, both in the context of the community (…) and still in the domestic environment of family relations”. Before arriving at the Rui Cunha Foundation, the film was already screened in several schools in Macao and organizations and obtained “very interesting results” in the promotion of discussions about the problem of mental health and the resulting social stigma.
This new opportunity to share the film fits in a context in which the incidence of suicides has increased and “the Macao citizens' happiness rate has decreased”, as MPMHPA explains. The association expects this story of overcoming, headed by the protagonist AH Sen, show “the citizens of Macau real stories of people who work hard in difficult circumstances and can achieve results”, providing a sense of hope for people who are in similar situations.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Sébastien Ogier Sum Seventh Victory in the Rali of Portugal</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/05/20/sebastien-ogier-soma-setima-vitoria-no-rali-de-portugal/</link><description>Toyota French pilot benefited from the bad luck of Estonium Ott Tänak, who lost leadership of the race after problems in the assisted direction of his Hyundai. Kalle Rovanperä (Toyota) closed the podium. And Adrien Fourmaux drank beer!
 
Sébastien Ogier has won for the seventh time the rally of Portugal, in the one that was considered one of the most demanding editions ever of the WRC calendar. Toyota's French pilot, navigated by compatriot Vincent Landais, has always been on the lurking of first place until he benefited from Ott Tänak's unlucky. Hyundai's stoner led the entrance to the latest Sabbath sections when they came across problems in the assisted direction of the i20 n rally1. The scenario was so dramatic that at the berth, he had to be co-pilot Martin Järveoja to put the Hyundai changes while giving navigation notes so that Tänak would focus on the weight of the steering wheel.
"It was a hard fight with OTT and I think we were not able to win without the problems it had. It was obviously faster. But the rally not only depend on speed. The conditions of the classifications on the second passages were very difficult. We managed to take advantage of the resistance of the car and a smart approach," said the French rider, eight times world champion in the World Cup.
"It is a fantastic feeling to win again in Portugal. It was a very demanding and tiring week, but getting this victory for the team and for us is something that was worth the effort," he added.
Tänak still tried to give everything on the last day, recovered ground, won until the mythical Wolf Power Stage from Fafe, but it was not enough to reach first place. The rally ended at 8.7 seconds from Ogier. "It was very frustrating. I hate to lose like this, especially in a rally that is very special to me. Maybe the car is a bit of reliability to earn. But it was undoubtedly a significant improvement in the rally of the cannaries," said Ott Tänak, referring to Toyota's overwhelming dominion at the previous event. It is recalled that the Japanese builder won the first five events of the year. “It's time to change the trend,” Hyundai's stoner promised, he who last year won the sardine rally, the next stage of the World Cup, between June 5 and 8.
Kalle Rovanperä (Toyota) completed the podium. The young finish, two -time champion of the world, never showed progress to win the race, but added precious points in the fight for the World Cup. Following the victory in the asphalt of the cannaries, Rovanperä and co-pilot Jonne Halttunen again showed problems of adaptation to Hankook tires, which replaced Pirelli in the WRC. "It was a long and difficult weekend, but ending on the podium is not bad at all," said Rovanperä.
 
Hyundai continues without winning
 
Thierry Neuville and Martijn Wydaeghe (Hyundai) finished the Rally de Portugal in fourth position. The current world champions lost some time after a top on Friday, a factor that never allowed them to threaten the front places. They continue without winning a rally in 2025, just like Hyundai. "It was a small mistake, but I think there was no great influence on our end result. My instinct tells me that we had no progress to fight OTT and SEB. There are some things where we know we can improve. I think we will be more competitive in Sardinia," Neuville suggested.
Japanese Takamoto Katsuta (Toyota) finished the rally on fifth while World Cup leader Elfyn Evans did not go beyond sixth place. The Welsh, who won the first special at Figueira da Foz, lost too much time opening the road on Friday and never recovered.  “We missed us some performance. And we didn't love the points we wanted. We have extra homework over the next rally,” confessed Evans who still maintains a comfortable advantage in World Cup accounts.
The young Sami Pajari (Toyota) ended in seventh. Two of the M-Sport Ford men, Joshua Mcerlean and Gerégoire Munster. Swedish Oliver Solberg, navigated by Elliot Edmondson, closed the Top-10, having secured another WRC2 triumph at the wheel of a Toyota Gr Yaris Rally2. Frenchman Yohan Rossel (Citroën C3 Rally2) was second in the category. Gus Greensmith (Skoda Fabia rs Rally2) closed the podium.
 
Adrien Fourmaux's beer
 
Note also for Adrien Fourmaux. The Frenchman, who exchanged Ford for Hyundai, was making a great rally until the bad luck knocked on the door. He departed the suspension in the second pass for Arganil, but was the protagonist of one of the most charismatic moments of the rally: he got out of the car, joined the thousands of spectators and was drinking a beer and seeing 'the band pass'. He still returned to try to add points in the Super Sunday, but abandoned with motor problems.
Armindo Araújo ended as the best Portuguese pilot. Also noteworthy is for Diogo Salvi, a businessman who was one of the protagonists of the weekend. He rented a Puma Rally1 to M-Sport and became better known for his jokes in quick interviews than for the road performance.
This edition of the Rally de Portugal was considered one of the hardest ever. Only Friday's stage had a record of 683 kilometers away, although only 146 kilometers corresponded to classifications. The distance between calls left marks, with the riders to spend about 14 hours inside the vehicles, with little time to eat and rest. The criticism of some riders have already led FIA to promise a review of the schedules.</description><pubDate>2025-05-20 01:47:42</pubDate></item><item><title>Appointed want reinforcement of investment in patriotic education</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/05/20/nomeados-querem-reforco-do-investimento-na-educacao-patriotica/</link><description>There were several deputies who, at yesterday's plenary meeting of the Legislative Assembly (AL), echoed the words of Xia Baolong, director of the Hong Kong and Macao affairs to the Council of State, when his recent visit to Macao. Iau Teng Pio, Pang Chuan and Kou Kam Fai, all appointed deputies, quoted Beijing's leader to request the reinforcement of patriotic education.
In an intervention before the agenda read by Kou Kam Fai but also signed by Iau Teng Pio and Pang Chuan, parliamentarians suggested “reinforcing the guidance of policies and increasing investment in patriotic education, the improvement of the curriculum by the educational sector, integrating patriotic education in their daily education and the development of thematic activities on the love of social associations.”
"It is necessary to create a co-formation mechanism with common objectives and concerted actions, guiding young people to consolidate the concept of state in cultural cognition and cultivate patriotic feeling in identifying values," said the deputies.
On the other hand, they proposed that “the educational value of the cultural and tourist resources of Macao”, in order to “inject vitality in patriotic education”. The deputies gave as an example the Lin Zexu Memorial Museum, the Xian Xinghai Memorial Museum and the former Ye Ting residence.
"Being Macau an example of success of the realization of the principle" a country, two systems ", their historical roots and cultural characteristics naturally have rich nutrients of patriotic education," they said, concluding that it is necessary to resort to cultural and tourist resources "such as connecting and joint formation as a canal, for the patriotic spirit to be integrated into the process of growth of young people."</description><pubDate>2025-05-20 01:39:12</pubDate></item><item><title>Fines for illegal work have exceeded seven million patacas since the beginning of 2024</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/05/20/multas-por-trabalho-ilegal-ultrapassaram-sete-milhoes-de-patacas-desde-o-inicio-de-2024/</link><description>The Directorate of Services for Labor Affairs has imposed fines of more than seven million Patacas on illegal work cases since January last year until March this year. In this period 738 cases were registered and the sanction was applied to more than 400 employing and 300 non -resident entities. The body said it had organized night inspections to reinforce the fight against illegal work.
 
From January last year until March this year, authorities have performed 741 illegal work inspection and combat operations, which helped identify 738 related cases. The Directorate of Services for Labor Affairs (DSAL) said that in the cases “Exercise of duties in place/to employer other than authorized”, “exercise of functions of the authorized”, illegal worker and work on their own.
In these 738 cases, DSAL applied administrative sanctions on illegal work to 428 employing entities and 310 non -resident people, with the total amount of fines reached 7.125 million patacas.
The body indicated that, in addition, three employing entities were punished with ancillary sanctions for hiring an illegal non -resident worker or due diligence to the non -resident worker to provide illegal work. Thus, the contracting authorizations regarding 10 non -resident workers were revoked, as well as private entities of the right to request new authorizations to hire workers not resident over a period of six months.
The situation of law enforcement was advanced by DSAL Director Chan Un Tong, in response to a written interpellation presented by Ella Law. The deputy, in his question, said she received reports from the convention and exhibition sector on “frequent cases” of illegal work.
"Considering that stand assembly occurs often in the night time until dawn, the government must intensify the inspections in these periods, checking the identity of workers and confirming whether the workers have their work authorizations or supervision visas, with the aim of combating illegal and unauthorized work," he said.
The deputy also noticed the "low costs" associated with hiring illegal workers and the "slowness" of sanctioning and judicial processes, which makes it difficult to hold law offenders difficult. In this sense, he asked to change the legislation to increase the deterrent effect.
Dsal, in the answer, guaranteed a vast approach to combating illegal work. According to the body, in addition to adopting measures to combat illegal work in different sectors, it has maintained a “close communication and connection” with their services, cooperating with each other in the development of inspection visits, as well as organizing night inspections, in order to reinforce the effectiveness of work.
"Regarding any suspected illegal work cases referred by other services to DSAL, it is certain that DSAL will follow and treat cases, as well as investigate the offender's responsibility for its practice of administrative infringement," he said.
As for the change in the legislation, Dsal said, as earlier, that he will continue to “heal cautiously” the opinions and suggestions of the various sectors and to “prudence” their analysis in articulation with the concrete situation of Macao.
Ella Law also regretted the increase in the number of illegal tour guides and workers unauthorized in the area of ​​tourist photography, as it adds the trip between Macao and the abroad.

The management of statistics and census services presented relevant data in the area of ​​energy production and importation, which reveal a slight increase in gas prices, but reduced fuels such as gasoline and diesel.
 
The data released by the Directorate of Statistics and Census Services (DSEC) reveal that, in the first quarter of 2025, total energy consumption in the region suffered a significant reduction of 6.9% over the same period last year. This decrease covers several energy categories, including electricity, liquefied oil gas (GPL), natural gas, gasoline and diesel, reflecting a trend of containment in the use of energy resources during the beginning of the year.
According to the official report, the electricity consumed during the first quarter fell about 2.5%, from approximately 1.258 million kWh (kilowatt-hour) in 2024 to about 1.227 million kWh by 2025. Sectors analysis shows that family aggregates reduced electricity consumption by 5.6%, while government institutions presented one slight increase of 0.7%. Commercial establishments also registered a decrease of 2.3%, suggesting a possible change in economic activity patterns or improvements in energy efficiency.
Regarding fuels, the consumed GPL decreased 5.7%, following the reduction in electricity consumption. More pronounced was the drop in natural gas, which registered a homologous reduction of 29.5%, attributed to lower energy production from this resource. GPL imports also suffered a low of 8.6%, aligning with the descending consumption trend.
In the scope of prices, the report indicates that liquefied oil gas from both the central reservoir and in cenja registered increases of 2.4% and 2.2%, respectively, compared to the first quarter of 2024. On the other hand, diesel for vehicles and gasoline without lead had a reduction of 3.8% and 1.4%, respectively, reflecting possible adjustments in fuel markets and policies and policies. tariffs.
Macao electricity production decreased 19.1% in this period, while electricity imports remained virtually stable, registering a slight reduction of 0.4%. It is also noteworthy that the importation of liquefied oil gas fell 8.6%, contributing to the reduction profile in the overall energy consumption of the region. The total volume of energy produced in Macao reached about 110 million kWh, while the total electricity import was approximately 1.117 million kWh, a homologous variation of 0.4 negative percentage points. These numbers indicate strong imported energy dependence, although local production has also shown a decrease tendency.
Consumer structure analysis reveals that electricity represents approximately 62%of the total energy consumed, followed by fuels used in transport, such as diesel (11.5%) and gasoline (8.6%). Natural gas represents 10.6 percentage points of total consumption. Other types of energy, including traelleum, common kerosene, make up the rest of the energy matrix, which remains diverse, although highly concentrated in electricity and liquid fuels. Per capita energy consumption also presented a reduction trend, suggesting improvements in efficiency of use and changes in population consumption habits.
Decreased energy consumption in Macau at the beginning of 2025 may be related to various factors, such as economic deceleration, improvements in systems efficiency or changes in fuel prices, according to DSEC. The lowest local energy production, coupled with the reduction in imports, reinforces the need for strategies that promote sustainability and diversification of energy sources in the region. The scenario highlights the importance of continuous monitoring of consumer and production standards in order to adjust public policies and ensure efficient management of energy resources, in a context of growing environmental and transition to more sustainable energy sources.</description><pubDate>2025-05-20 01:46:50</pubDate></item><item><title>Approved law that allows the creation of schools in hengqin under the regime</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/05/20/aprovada-lei-que-permite-criacao-de-escolas-em-hengqin-sob-regime-da-raem/</link><description>The Legislative Assembly (AL) approved yesterday, in the specialty, the change to the general staff of teaching staff of private schools of non -higher education and the statute of these schools. This change allows the creation of HEGQIN school regime schools. In the discussion, LAM, secretary for social affairs and culture, ensured that Macao residents will also preference in this type of schools in the deepened cooperation zone.
 
The deputies approved in the specialty, at yesterday's plenary meeting of the Legislative Assembly (AL), the general staff of teaching staff of non -higher education and statute of private schools not higher education, which allows the creation of schools in the deepened cooperation zone of hengqin with the same regime as the MSAR.
Private entities of non -higher education schools created in Macao may, after obtaining authorization from the Directorate of Youth Education and Development Services (DSEDJ), create schools with the Mountain Island of Mountain.
These schools apply to the Macao Education System that do not contradict the rules of the interior of China, including in terms of the perks, rights and duties of students and teaching staff.
These schools may have teachers resident of the MSAR, and it is necessary to guarantee the perks of the teaching staff resident of the MSAR that performs duties in these schools, says the note justification of the government. The new legislation provides that the provisions of the general staff of the teachers of the private schools of the MSAR is applied regarding the expenses with the remuneration of teaching staff and the contribution to the Social Security Fund. The change in the diploma ensures that the conditions of these teachers will not be “less favorable than the minimums of teaching staff at the same level of education”.
 
Priority to residents
 
During the discussion, Ron Lam and Ella Lei asked that in these schools, priority to hire, even if the school is in Hengqin. LAM, secretary for social affairs and culture, rested the deputies and assured that "Macao residents should be hired preferentially."
To teach in these schools, teachers have to sign new contracts in accordance with this legislation. On the other hand, the teaching staff of the hengqin mashed regime schools can, said the secretary, choose to use the labor legislation in the interior of China.
It is recalled that this academic year has already been operating the first school for Educandos da MGA in the new Macao neighborhood that is located in the deepened cooperation zone. This school includes 18 classes for primary students and 12 others for kindergarten students.
According to the objective of the authorities, there should be more than 5,000 residents of Macao working in Hengqin by the end of this year and it is estimated that by 2035, the number will increase to 80 thousand. On the other hand, there should be 20,000 people from Macao residing on Mountain Island by the end of this year, estimating that this number grows to 120,000 over the next ten years.</description><pubDate>2025-05-20 01:48:57</pubDate></item><item><title>China close to launching first mission to collect asteroid samples</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/05/20/china-perto-de-lancar-primeira-missao-para-recolher-amostras-de-asteroide/</link><description>The non -manned Tianwen 2 probe will be launched this month, according to the Chinese National Space Administration.

The non -manned tube Tianwen 2, designed to perform China's first mission to collect and bring samples from an asteroid, will be launched this month, according to the Chinese National Space Administration.
The device was transported on Sunday to the Launch Preparation Area at the Xichang Space Center in Sichuan province, where functional checks will be performed before taking off, the China Daily state newspaper said. The Chinese space agency said the launch will take place before late May, without further details.
Tianwen 2, consisting of an orbiter and a reentry module, was transported to the installation of Xichang in late February, and the coaching staff completed the supply and several inspections ever since.
The mission will target the 2016 Ho3, also known as 469219 Kamo'oalewa, which, although orbiting around the sun and not the earth, is the smallest and closest asteroid on the planet that has been identified so far.
The plan foresees that the probe orbits around the asteroid, where it will remain for several months, after which will approach enough to use a mechanical arm to collect surface samples.
After this phase, the probe will return to the orbit of the earth and free the reentry module, which will take the samples to the planet's surface.
The 2016 Ho3 Asteroid was first detected in 2016 by an asteroid observation telescope at the Haleakala High Altitude Observatory in Hawaii, United States.
Researchers believe they may contain important information about the early stages of the solar system, including aspects of its original composition and evolution.
China strongly invested in the space program and successfully landed the Chang'e 4 probe on the hidden side of the moon-the first time it was achieved-and became the third country-after the former Soviet and the United States-to reach Mars. In addition, China operates its own space station, Tiangong, which will operate for about 10 years and could become the only orbital platform in operation.
The International Space Station - an initiative led by the United States to which China is forbidden to access due to military ties with its space program - should be abandoned in 2030.

The event, in English, aims to foster a discussion about the impact of excessive use of screens-the mobile phone, in particular-on the well-being of younger generations and the Macao education system. In a context where artificial intelligence (AI) is being integrated, the accelerated pace, in the curricula of the schools of Macao, the Rui Cunha Foundation proposes the discussion of the measures to adopt for healthy screening of screen time and a balanced relationship of young people with this type of technology.
Guest speaker Jacky Ho, dean of the Faculty of Health Sciences of the University of São José (USJ) and director of the Macao Social Development Observatory, will present the theme and interact with the public during the session, encouraging the sharing of comments and opinions. The conversation will feature the moderation of António Monteiro, president of the Association of Young Macanese, and Jerusa Antunes, vice president of the same association.
It is recalled that, last March, the Directorate of Youth Education and Development Services (DSEDJ) announced that, from the next school year, Secondary Schools in Macau will have guidance to regulate the use of mobile phones in the campus. The guidelines will also cover the use of other electronic devices and specify the occasions and periods of time when students can use these devices.
Regarding the inclusion of artificial intelligence in the curricula of the schools of Macao, it was revealed at the plenary meeting of the Legislative Assembly on May 14 that AI teaching will integrate the curricula of primary and secondary schools. At the time, LAM, the secretary for social affairs and culture, detailed that teachers will also have training in this domain and that the classrooms will include this type of technology.</description><pubDate>2025-05-20 01:38:50</pubDate></item><item><title>Cyberataque compromises data from 27 million South Korean mobile phone cards</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/05/20/ciberataque-compromete-dados-de-27-milhoes-de-cartoes-de-telemovel-sul-coreanos/</link><description>A cybership against South Korea's largest mobile phone operator compromised information of almost 27 million SIM cards. According to authorities, the attack began on June 15, 2022, when the first 'malware' was installed on SK Telecom servers.
 
A cybership against South Korea's largest mobile phone operator compromised information of almost 27 million SIM cards, the equivalent of half of the population, according to the results of an investigation, released yesterday.
The results of the joint investigation to the incident by private sector authorities and experts determined that the attack began on June 15, 2022, when the first 'malware' (malicious programs or applications) was installed on SK Telecom (SKT) servers.
Since then and until anomalies were detected on 18 April 2025, the virus has spread at least 23 servers, some of which contained private information, such as names, birth dates, phone numbers, email addresses, and unique mobile devices (IMEI).
The analysis also revealed that infected servers allowed access to 25 different types of personal data, including SIM card authentication keys.
The results also indicate that the lack of records between June 2022 and December 2024 makes it impossible to rule out the possibility of personal data to have been stolen.
Private sector analysts suspect that RED Menshen is responsible for the attack, given the group's involvement in similar attacks against telecommunications companies in Asia, also using the BPFDoor infiltration program.
Red Menshen is an organization of computer pirates that, according to cybersecurity companies such as PWC and Trend Micro, is linked to China and allegedly supported by Beijing.
In the case of SKT, the use of a technique known as 'Web Shell' was detected, which allows strikers remotely controlled committed servers.
IM Jong-in, a professor at the University of Korea, believes that the scale and method of cyberathel execution may reflect a strategy that aims to disable the essential infrastructure in case of conflict, rather than simply stealing personal information, according to the South Korean public news agency Yonhap.
In total, 26.96 million SIM cards were compromised, according to the report, and SKT has replaced or cleared more than 1.9 million, a number that is expected to increase in the coming months, despite supply problems.
In addition, 2.5 million users enrolled in the fraud protection service, and more than nine thousand presented collective actions with South Korea, requesting financial compensation and greater transparency on the extension of the attack.
The company estimates potential losses of up to seven billions of wons (4.49 billion euros), said executive president Ryu Young-Sang in the South Korean parliament.
SK Group President Chey Tae-Won issued a public apology for the scandal earlier this month, recognizing communication and response failures.

The parks involved are the Qingmao Border Post, the Macau Union Hospital, the Public Health Specialty building and the residence for the elderly of Avenida do Nordeste.
With the change, motorcycle and moped rates will be reduced in three of these parks, being 1 pataca for half an hour during the day, from 8am to 6pm, and from half pataca at night after 18h. For light cars and other categories, the cost for half an hour will be 4 patacas during the day and 2 patacas at night, values ​​that exactly represent half the value applied at the time.
The only parking lot with different values ​​will be the Qingmao Border Post, which applies to light cars a value of 5 patacas during the day and 4 patacas for the night period, for every half hour of parking. For motorcycles and mopeds, the value is 2 patacas for the simple daytime ticket and 1.5 level for the night parking. The new tariff structure aims to encourage transport on two wheels, in an attempt to accelerate vacancies and facilitate circulation in the city, as the authorities pointed out.
DSAT states that it continues to monitor the operation of the system and collect opinions from society, considering its expansion to other parks of parking in the future, according to the body in a statement.</description><pubDate>2025-05-20 01:38:50</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
