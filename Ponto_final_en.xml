On February 14th, at Galaxy Entertainment Group's Broadway Theatre, classic music and famous movie themes will come to life through acrobatics, juggling and aerial performances by former Olympian performers. 

The fusion between symphonic music and circus art arrived in Macau on a special date. On the night of February 14th, Broadway Macau's Broadway Theater will have its stage occupied by a talented cast, an eccentric mix of violins and trapeze, who will create a new show to celebrate Valentine's Day in the city. The “Symphonic Circus – Film Melodies”, a joint production by the Cultural Institute, Sociedade Orquestra de Macau, Limitada, and Galaxy Entertainment Group (GEG), will be a unique activity for that couple who wants to celebrate in a different way.
At this event, the Macau Orchestra will share the stage with world-renowned artists from Cirque de la Symphonie, a company that has collaborated with more than a hundred symphony orchestras globally. Its cast is made up of gymnasts and circus performers from different countries, including Olympic medalists and world record holders.
The company is known for leaving a mark on the public and international critics wherever it goes. During his performance with the San Francisco Symphony, critic Cindy Warner described the moment as “a captivated hall”, highlighting the balance between elegance and danger. In turn, in a presentation at the Kennedy Center, critic Justin Schneider noted that the experience transforms the traditional ritual of a concert: “It leads audiences to applaud during the performance, to sigh audibly, to laugh and scream with delight”, and praised the way in which even the conductor “had to turn and observe the performances”, possibly as enraptured as the audience.
Cirque de la Symphonie was founded in 2005, designed specifically to perform on concert hall stages, as opposed to the large spaces of a traditional circus. This particularity requires artists to adapt their aerial acrobatics and choreography to spaces sometimes no larger than 4 meters wide. The philosophy of the show is minimalist, with a few artists on stage at a time and discreet costumes, so that symphonic music and circus movement share equal protagonism.
The concept of the show is based on the symbiosis between sound and movement. While the Macau Orchestra performs a repertoire that spans different eras and genres, from classic ballet and opera works to iconic Hollywood soundtracks, Cirque de la Symphonie artists will perform aerial choreography, acrobatics, magic acts, mime and dance, creating a visual narrative that complements and amplifies the musical experience.
This production is part of the “GEG Space Partnership Pilot Plan”, a project that hopes to boost the cultural offer in the group's spaces. The concert will last approximately one hour and thirty minutes, including an intermission. Tickets for the show are already on sale and vary between 300, 220 and 150 patacas, and reservations can be made via the Macau Ticket website.
The Macau Orchestra Concert Season 2025-26 is an initiative co-organized by several entities, including the Cultural Affairs Bureau, Galaxy Entertainment Group, Melco Resorts &amp; Entertainment, MGM, Sands China Ltd., SJM Resorts, S.A., and Wynn Resorts (Macau), S.A., with the support of BOC Macau. The main sponsor of the current event is the Galaxy Entertainment Group.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Transgressions to the regulation of public spaces decrease in 2025</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2026/01/28/transgressoes-ao-regulamento-dos-espacos-publicos-diminuem-em-2025/</link><description>The Institute for Municipal Affairs (IAM) recorded 16,102 violations of hygiene rules in public spaces in 2025, a number slightly lower than the previous year. The most common transgressions were those relating to the abandonment of solid waste and the placement or abandonment of materials and objects in the streets, with an annual decrease in water drops from air conditioning units. Throughout the year, the Government collected a total of more than seven million patacas in fines.
In 2025, there were 16,102 behaviors that violated hygiene and public health rules in Macau, 9.2% less compared to 2024. This is the lowest number since at least 2020, the year to which the oldest data on the Institute for Municipal Affairs (IAM) website dates back.
Over the past year, there were 168 cases of water dripping from air conditioning units, 8,646 of abandonment of any solid waste, 116 of uncollected pet waste, 2,123 of spitting or throwing nasal mucus, 2,289 of placement or abandonment of materials and objects and 2,760 cases categorized as “other”.
Among the six categories mentioned, the abandonment of solid waste in public spaces was, by far, the most frequent in Macau. Since 2021, in fact, not so many infractions of this type have been recorded, when the number of cases counted by the IAM reached 9,697. On the other hand, so few infractions relating to falling water drops from air conditioning units had never been recorded – the drop was 68.8% compared to the previous year of 2024 and 77% compared to 2023. The category relating to “other” infractions also registered a new minimum value since the data began to be compiled in 2020.
The 1,738 fines issued in January were the lowest of the year. This is, in fact, a trend that has already been seen in all previous years, with the sole exception of 2023. Conversely, the months belonging to the second semester are usually those in which fewer infractions are recorded. The year 2025 was no exception, with the month of August occupying the last position in the table with only 1,037 fines issued.
Analyzing the IAM data, some patterns related to the weather and climatic conditions can also be seen. Cases related to water falls from air conditioning units are rare or non-existent in the winter months (December and January have 0 cases, for example) and reach their peak in the summer months (39 cases in June). Regarding spitting and excretions of nasal mucus, the situation is exactly the opposite: cases are more frequent in winter (283 cases in February) and scarce in summer (89 in August).
According to available statistical data, the most common transgressions in Macau since 2020 have been the abandonment of solid waste, the placement or abandonment of materials and objects in inappropriate places and the occurrence of spitting or throwing nasal mucus, with emphasis also on the number of cases charged and archived in the general category of “others”.
In the years 2024, 2023, 2022, 2021 and 2020, 17,730, 17,046, 16,564, 19,461 and 19,353 assessments were processed, respectively.
FINES EXCEEDED SEVEN MILLION MOPATA
 
On its website, the IAM also specifies that 6,891 (around 42.8%) of the offenses were committed by local residents, while non-local residents were responsible for 9,211 cases (57.2%).
Regarding local offenders, 2,891 fines were paid over the counter and 2,727 were paid online, amounting to a total amount of 3,558,300 patacas. As for non-local residents, the vast majority of fines (4,138) were paid over the counter, while 1,830 were paid online. In this case, the fines totaled 3,593,100 patacas. Adding the two categories of offenders, it appears that the total value of fines paid due to transgressions of public health rules was 7,151,400 patacas in 2025.
The General Regulation on Public Spaces has been in force since 2004, covering fines ranging from 300 to 600 patacas for common infractions, 700 to 5,000 patacas for serious infractions and 2,000 to 10,000 patacas for very serious infractions. There is also the possibility of joining a civic service provision scheme, in which resident offenders can replace the payment of fines with participation in a community work program and training sessions. In 2025, 32 offenders joined this regime.</description><pubDate>2026-01-28 00:04:47</pubDate></item><item><title>Nipah Virus: Government calls for avoiding travel to India and admits strengthening inspections at border posts</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2026/01/28/virus-nipah-governo-apela-evitar-viagens-a-india-e-admite-reforcar-inspeccao-nos-postos-fronteiricos/</link><description>The Health Services appeal to residents to avoid traveling to India due to recent cases of infection with the Nipah virus, a zoonotic disease that can be fatal. The Government admits the reinforcement of assessment and medical examinations at border posts for those with relevant travel history and presenting symptoms. There are now five cases of Nipah in West Bengal, the infection of which causes flu-like symptoms in the initial phase.

The recent infection of the Nipah virus in India, particularly in the state of West Bengal in the east of the country, is worrying the Macau authorities. The Health Services say they are attentive to the evolution of the situation and have launched appeals to citizens to avoid traveling to that region.
As for residents already in India, the Government warns them to take preventive measures and, if flu symptoms appear after returning to Macau, they should consult a doctor as soon as possible and inform their travel and contact history.
In a note issued yesterday, the Health Services confirm that medical assessment and examinations will be reinforced at border posts for those with a travel history and presenting symptoms as “a matter of precaution”, despite there currently being no direct flights between Macau and India.
According to the Health Services, five individuals in West Bengal, India, were diagnosed with Nipah virus infection, and local authorities have already taken contingency measures and the situation is still confined there. Meanwhile, some bordering countries have already reinforced inspection and health control at airports and border posts.
Indian authorities, according to the Lusa agency, issued an epidemiological alert and confirmed a new Nipah outbreak, which has so far led to the quarantine of 190 people. They also admitted that more cases may appear later, since the incubation period of the Nipah virus extends up to 45 days.
Nipah virus is a zoonotic virus that can be fatal, having been first identified in 1999 and, in the last 20 years, several infections in humans have been recorded in Bangladesh and India.
Fruit bats are the natural hosts of the Nipah virus, and the infection has a mortality rate between 40% and 75%.
According to the Health Services, the disease can be transmitted to humans through contaminated food, generally fruit or fruit products, or through contact with infected pigs, or directly between people.
Contaminated foods refer to those that have come into contact with the urine, feces or saliva of infected bats, explained information from the Hong Kong health authorities, which warns the population to particularly avoid consuming raw date palm sap. They added that human-to-human transmission is possible through close contact with contaminated secretions and excretions from infected people, which has also been reported in the patient's family and healthcare settings.

NO VACCINE OR EFFECTIVE TREATMENT
 
After Nipah virus infection, patients may present asymptomatic or sub-clinical infection, acute respiratory illnesses, fatal encephalitis, among others. The first symptoms are similar to those of the flu, and in more severe cases they may present breathing difficulties, dizziness, drowsiness, mental confusion, among others. The incubation period generally varies between four and 14 days, with a maximum of 45 days.
Currently, there is no vaccine or effective treatment against the Nipah virus, emphasize the Health Services. The information indicates that, at the moment, treatment is based exclusively on supportive care.
Local authorities, therefore, call on citizens to remain alert and adopt good personal and environmental hygiene. “If it is not strictly necessary, traveling to that destination should be avoided”, they indicate.
Otherwise, citizens must adopt measures to reduce the risk of infection when traveling, such as “reinforcing personal and food hygiene, avoiding the consumption of unhealthy fruit or fruit products”, “avoiding contact with infected animals and going to farms, bat habitats, breeding farms, among others”, as well as “avoiding contact with local patients”, emphasizes the Government.

Hong Kong tightens controls on travelers from India amid Nipah virus outbreak

The Hong Kong Government announced a strengthening of health controls for travelers arriving at the airport in the Chinese region from India, following a new outbreak of the Nipah hemorrhagic virus. In a statement published on Monday night, the director of the Health Protection Service, Edwin Tsui Lok Kin, confirmed the deployment of teams to the airport. The objective is to “screen the temperature of travelers at relevant boarding gates, carry out medical assessments on symptomatic travelers and refer suspected cases with a potential impact on public health to hospitals for examination”, explained the director. Despite the measure, Edwin Tsui highlighted that, to date, no case of Nipah virus infection has been recorded in Hong Kong and that there are no direct flights between the territory and Calcutta, capital of the Indian state of West Bengal.</description><pubDate>2026-01-28 00:05:36</pubDate></item><item><title>Chef Gil Fernandes brings the gastronomic refinement of the Atlantic to Guincho a Galera</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2026/01/28/chef-gil-fernandes-traz-o-requinte-gastronomico-do-atlantico-ao-guincho-a-galera/</link><description>The Guincho a Galera restaurant, at Hotel Lisboa, will welcome chef Gil Fernandes, from the emblematic Fortaleza do Guincho, in Portugal, on February 7th. Holding a Michelin star for 25 consecutive years, the chef will bring to Macau a menu that celebrates the spirit of the Atlantic and refined Portuguese cuisine, in a collaboration that will then head to Hong Kong. Dinner, with an exclusive menu, costs 1,380 patacas per person. 

A new Michelin star arrives in Macau, coming directly from the Atlantic coast of Portugal to the city center, through one of the most prestigious names in the new generation of Portuguese haute cuisine. The Guincho a Galera restaurant, located in the iconic Hotel Lisboa, will welcome Gil Fernandes, executive chef of Fortaleza do Guincho, on February 7th. The renowned restaurant, located in a 17th century fortification in the Sintra-Cascais Natural Park, in Portugal, has maintained a Michelin star for 25 consecutive years, highlighting excellence in Portuguese cuisine on a global level.
The initiative aims to bring a “gastronomic trip” to the territory, organized by the Sociedade de Turismo e Diversões de Macau (STDM) group, which will then continue from the 11th to the 13th of February at L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon, in Hong Kong. The collaboration aims to unite the tradition and creativity of Portuguese and Macanese cuisine, focusing on the cultural connection between the two territories.
Gil Fernandes, appointed executive chef of Fortaleza do Guincho in 2018, is a rising figure on the European gastronomic scene. Its philosophy is based on sustainability, respect for ingredients and direct inspiration from the Atlantic Ocean, a central element of the landscape that surrounds the restaurant in Portugal. His talent earned him distinctions such as “European Chef of the Year” at the 2021 Aurum Awards and “Breakthrough Chef of the Year” at the 2023 Mesa Marcada awards.
“We are going to bring Portugal with us to Macau, in our gastronomy, in our culture and in our philosophy”, said the chef in a statement. The exclusive menu, designed for the evening of February 7th, aims to be an expression of this vision, using selected ingredients from Portugal to evoke the authenticity and elegance of the Portuguese Atlantic coast.
The experience will be complemented by the Hotel Lisboa's vast wine cellar, shared by Guincho a Galera. Recognized by Wine Spectator, World of Fine Wine and China’s Wine List of the Year, the winery houses more than 17,000 references and a collection of around 430,000 bottles. Personalized wine selections will be proposed to accompany the selection of exclusive dishes for the current event, in an attempt to “elevate the gastronomic journey”.
Dinner is priced at 1,380 patacas per person, with an optional wine selection available at an extra cost of 1,280 patacas. All prices on this exclusive new menu are subject to a 10% service surcharge.
Guincho a Galera, opened in 2012, is the first and only international extension of Fortaleza do Guincho, dedicated to reinterpreting the classics of Portuguese cuisine with a contemporary touch. The original Fortaleza do Guincho restaurant opened in 1998, with the Hotel of the same name. It received consultancy from French Chef Antoine Westermann, awarded three stars from the famous Red Guide, in its journey to become a restaurant of the highest cuisine, which is now a world reference from Portugal.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Macao SAR promises to follow Beijing's guidance and give primacy to the executive branch</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2026/01/28/raem-promete-acatar-orientacoes-de-pequim-e-dar-primazia-ao-poder-executivo/</link><description>Xia Baolong argued that the executive branch should have priority over the legislative and judicial branches, as the concept of “separation of powers” ​​can be used by “anti-China elements”. Following the words of the director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office at the State Council, both the Macao SAR Government and the legislative and judicial bodies themselves assured that they will comply with these guidelines issued by Beijing and give primacy to the executive branch.

Beijing asked the Macao SAR to give primacy to the executive power and the region's government agreed. All senior executive positions expressed support for this guidance and promised to comply with it.
It is recalled that Xia Baolong, director of the Hong Kong and Macau Work Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office of the State Council, recently stated that the concept of “separation of powers” ​​could be used by “anti-China elements” to undermine the authority of the Chief Executive of the Macao SAR, “thus damaging the authority of the Central Government”, which would be “absolutely unacceptable”. “Both the legislative branch and the judicial branch must defend the system led by the executive branch”, stressed the Beijing official.
The Chief Executive reacted to Xia Baolong's words by assuring that the Macao SAR Government will “further reinforce the 'master of the house' consciousness in the Chief Executive and the Macao SAR Government”, reinforcing the model of “predominance of executive power”.
Sam Hou Fai called for the “active support and cooperation” of the legislative and judicial bodies to “form a strong governance synergy, as well as define and implement policies and measures that are in line with Macau’s long-term interests”. “In the future, the predominance of executive power will continue to demonstrate its advantages in efficient and orderly governance”, highlighted the Chief Executive.

SECRETARIES SUPPORT “PREDOMINANCE OF EXECUTIVE POWER”
 
All Macao SAR Government secretaries made a point of releasing statements expressing support for Beijing's instructions. Wong Sio Chak, Secretary for Administration and Justice, highlighted that his department will “seriously study and act proactively” to implement the “predominance of executive power, implementing good governance and good administration”.
Wong Sio Chak also highlighted that his supervision will “improve the coordination mechanism between the executive and legislative bodies, build a solid barrier for national security, defend social stability and improve the Macao SAR's legal system”.
“Director In a statement released on Monday night, O Lam promised that his team will “make every effort” to “transform the spirit of the speech into concrete actions, focus firmly on the governmental actions of the Chief Executive and resolutely promote the achievement of tasks under the institutional framework of the predominance of the executive branch”. “We will unswervingly persist in the strategic orientation of the predominance of executive power”, guaranteed the secretary.
Tai Kin Ip also said that Xia Baolong's speech gives “clear guidance for government actions in the area of ​​Economy and Finance” and promised that the tutelage he leads “will take the spirit of the speech as a fundamental guideline, persisting and improving the predominance of executive power”.
The Secretary for Security also guaranteed that his department will comply with Beijing's guidelines, urging the Macao SAR to remain “vigilant” in the face of “external interference in relation to the predominance of executive power”. “Clear consolidation and improvement of the predominance of executive power are the key to realizing the ‘one country, two systems’ regime, requirements and objectives necessary for the long-term stability and prosperous development of Macau”, highlighted Chan Tsz King.
Raymond Tam, Secretary for Transport and Public Works, repeated that “the predominance of executive power ensures the efficiency of government action” and safeguards “sovereignty, security and the interests of national development”. The government official emphasized that his team will “take the spirit of the speech as a guide for action, giving full emphasis to the nuclear role of the predominance of executive power”.

LEGISLATIVE AND JUDICIAL BODIES AGREEMENT

In his speech given on Monday, Xia Baolong specifically addressed the deputies to the Legislative Assembly (LA) of the Macao SAR, asking them that their role involves “supporting and cooperating fully with the Chief Executive and the Government”. Deputies “should not only express support verbally, but also take concrete measures, strengthen research into policy implementation and offer more ideas, solutions and countermeasures to make government policies and measures more operational and easier to implement effectively”, urged the head of the Central Government.
André Cheong, now president of the Legislative Assembly (AL), agrees with this principle and says that the body he leads will “firmly implement and implement” the predominance of executive power.
The president of the AL promised that the legislative body “will implement the principle of the predominance of the executive power with real actions, continuously strengthen communication and collaboration with the Macao SAR Government, and proactively present constructive opinions and suggestions in the exercise of its legislative and supervisory functions, thus promoting an effective and virtuous interaction between the executive and legislative powers”.
André Cheong added that the AL will “give priority to legislative and supervisory work related to defending the security of the State, increasing the governance effectiveness of the Macao SAR, promoting adequate diversification of the economy and strengthening the articulation of rules between Macau and Hengqin, among other aspects”.
Song Man Lei, president of the Court of Final Appeal (TUI), was clear: “Judicial organs, as an important part of this system, must accurately master the constitutional meaning of the predominance of executive power.” The judge stated that, “under the assumption of carrying out the trial independently and in accordance with the law”, the judiciary must “actively collaborate with the Government’s governing action, thus providing a solid guarantee of the rule of law for the modernization of the Macao SAR’s governance”.
Song Man Lei said that “judicial bodies respect and defend the predominance of executive power, which, in fact, is respect for the organic combination between the full power of governance of the Central Government and the high degree of autonomy of the Macao SAR, constituting an integral part of safeguarding the constitutional order and protecting the rights and interests of residents”. “The predominance of executive power constitutes a political system option tailored to the Macao SAR”, stated the president of the TUI.
The Public Ministry (MP) also promised to “preserve the structure with a predominance of executive power”. At the same time, Prosecutor Tong Hio Fong stressed that the MP will “exercise the supervisory functions that are legally assigned to him, ensuring that administrative bodies act in obedience to the law” and “dedicate himself to executing the law and processing processes rigorously, precisely combating crimes that jeopardize national security, harm national interests and harm the stability of the Macao SAR”.</description><pubDate>2026-01-28 00:03:13</pubDate></item><item><title>Chief Executive wants the media to show “China’s peace, justice and kindness”</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2026/01/28/chefe-do-executivo-quer-a-comunicacao-social-a-mostrar-a-paz-a-justica-e-a-bondade-da-china/</link><description>Sam Hou Fai met yesterday with representatives of Chinese-language media outlets and stated that the Government “will continue to guarantee the rights and interests of the sector”.

Sam Hou Fai began by praising the Chinese-language press for having “always remained at the forefront” and ensured that the population of Macau, spectators and national and foreign readers understand “clearly and authentically” what he considers to be the “successful implementation of the principle of ‘one country, two systems'”.

According to the measures, university students will be provided with a subsidy for the purchase of school materials worth MOP3,300, and students attending schools in Guangdong can receive tuition and school material subsidies ranging from MOP7,700 to MOP9,150.

The Government will launch another round of subsidies aimed at higher education students, who will benefit from the allocation of an amount of 3,300 patacas to purchase school materials.
The online registration period for the program starts on the 1st of April and ends on the 29th of May, and applicants must be students holding a Macau Resident Identity Card who are attending, either in Macau or abroad, in the academic year 2025/2026, higher education courses that lead to an academic degree or that last no less than two academic years, taught by public or private higher education institutions accredited.
The information was announced yesterday by the Executive Council, which concluded the discussion on the respective draft administrative regulation. At the press conference, Iun Pui Iun, deputy director of the Education and Youth Development Services (DSEDJ), revealed that around 26,900 students are expected to benefit from the subsidy, with a total budget of 89 million patacas.
According to the authorities, the granting of this subsidy to eligible university students has been implemented since the 2011/2012 academic year, with the aim of demonstrating the “importance and attention” of the Macao SAR Government to higher education students and “supporting them in the acquisition of books, reference and learning materials”.
The regulation indicates that the requirements for granting the subsidy are basically the same as last year, with beneficiaries must present supporting documents regarding, in particular, the name of the course they are attending, the minimum number of years of normal duration of attendance set for the course and the academic year in which they first enrolled in the course.
Students who study in higher education institutions in Macau or abroad and who benefit from merit scholarships, scholarships and loan grants granted by public entities in Macau, as well as students who, in Macau, attend courses coordinated by local institutions and whose operation has been authorized by the Macao SAR Government, may be exempt from presenting documents proving their attendance at the courses.
The administrative regulation will come into force the day following its publication.

MACAU STUDENTS IN GUANGDONG
 
The authorities, in addition, will continue to grant subsidies for tuition fees and the purchase of school materials for non-higher education students attending schools in Guangdong province.
Under the draft administrative regulation presented by the Executive Council, the amounts of the tuition fee subsidy per student are defined in accordance with the tuition fees confirmed by the Education Administration Services of the location where the schools attended are located. In this case, the maximum subsidy limits remain at 8,000 patacas for pre-school education and 6,000 patacas for primary, general secondary and complementary secondary education.
The amounts for the subsidy for purchasing school materials per student remain fixed at 1,150 patacas for pre-school education, 1,450 patacas for primary education and 1,700 patacas for general secondary and complementary secondary education.
The project establishes that the application must be submitted between April 20th and May 15th to DSEDJ, which will pay the subsidy from October onwards. The organization estimates that the program's budget is 33.8 million patacas and approximately 5,890 students will benefit. The administrative regulation comes into force on the day following its publication.
It should also be noted that, in order to receive subsidies, students in complementary secondary education must attend, between June and August this year, a course organized by DSEDJ, “with a view to reinforcing knowledge, particularly in the political, economic and cultural spheres of the Macao SAR and the most recent development of the Cooperation Zone, among others”, can be read in the note from the Executive Council. The respective course has a minimum duration of 12 hours, and the student must have a minimum attendance rate of 80% to be eligible for the grant.
According to the Executive Council, students at the School for Students of Macao SAR Residents in Hengqin are not beneficiaries of the aforementioned subsidies, as they are already covered by the benefits of the Macau education system, namely the subsidy for purchasing textbooks, the free education subsidy or the tuition subsidy.</description><pubDate>2026-01-28 00:02:22</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
