The law that regulates the game sector, which came into force in June 2022, provides for tax reduction or exemption for concessionaires who can widen the sources of players, benefiting operators who attract more revenues from foreign gamblers. However, the Game Inspection and Coordination Directorate (DICJ) continues not to publicly reveal the slice of total revenues from foreign players.
The end point asked the body over a month ago, which percentage of revenues arising from foreign players in 2024 and 2023, but did not get any response, despite the various insistences with the DICJ. It was also asked how authorities oversee the value of gross game revenues generated by foreign players, but DICJ did not respond either. Already in January 2023, the end point tried to realize what is the weight of foreign gamblers in casinos recipes, but to no avail.
In December 2022, Adriano Marques Ho, the former director of DICJ, indicated that in 2019 about 3.6% of the game's gross gross revenues were due to foreign customers. Adriano Marques Ho was in the meantime appointed by the new government as Director-General for Customs Services, and the DICJ Substitute Director is Lio Chi Chong.
In 2024, gross game revenues rose to 226.7 billion patacas. By 2025, the government estimates that casinos reach the goal of 240 billion patacas. In January, the industry reached 18.2 billion in revenues. It is recalled that tax revenues from the game industry represent more than 80% of all of the MSAR tax revenues.</description><pubDate>2025-02-18T03:50:57+08:00</pubDate></item><item><title>TSI attenuates septuagenarian penalty that tried to set fire to the headquarters of PJ and MP</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/02/18/tsi-atenua-pena-de-septuagenario-que-tentou-atear-fogo-na-sede-da-pj-e-no-mp/</link><description>In January last year, a man tried to set fire to the headquarters of the Judicial Police (PJ) and the Public Prosecution Service (MP), allegedly to show dissatisfaction in the face of an investigation and the result of a trial in a case of burla that had been a victim . The septuagenarian had been sentenced by the Base Judicial Court (TJB) to a one -year and three -month prison sentence, but now the Court of Second Instance (TSI) has reduced the sentence to one year in effective arrest.
 
The Court of Second Instance (TSI) decided to reduce the prison sentence that had been applied to a septuagenarian convicted of trying to set fire to the door of the Judicial Police (PJ) and the Public Prosecution Service (MP).
The case dates back to January 14, 2024. The man would be dissatisfied with the decision to archive a criminal case taken by the MP, planning to set fire to objects in various public services as a form of revenge. That day, after buying a bottle of kerosene and prepared the instruments necessary for the plan, the man went first to the PJ building, pouring half the kerosene under a police car parked on the main door and placing newspapers underneath below of this car with the objective of damaging it. Shortly thereafter, security agents detected the situation and extinguished the fire.
Later, the septuagenarian went to the MP, poured the remaining kerosene in the gate of access roll to the building, set fire to a tissue towel, threw it to the roll gate, and then left the place. MP employees also turned out the fire with an extinguisher. The man later ended up being intercepted by police officers on the doors of the siege.
The TJB then condemned the man for practice, in material authorship and in the intentional and attempted form, of two qualified damage crimes in a one -year and three months. Both the defendant and the MP appealed from the decision to the TSI.
The TSI considered that, according to the news of the news and the Annex prepared by the Fire Department, there was no manifest dischargeability in the judgment of the facts imputed to the main door of the MP building, so it should not be condemned for practice of the crime of fire in tempted form. As for the conduct of setting fire to the police car, the TSI indicated that the man fired fire under the police car concerned, with a large amount of pipes under the car and gasoline in the warehouse, which naturally caused him danger, and if the Fire had not been extinguished in time, a fire could have occurred, so the man's conduct of setting the police vehicle already constituted the “act of execution” of the fire crime, so he should condemn him for the practice of a fire crime in tempted form. On the other hand, the TSI considered that the man practiced two crimes and not a single crime, that is, practiced, respectively, in the attempted form, the crime of fire and that of qualified damage.
Thus, the TSI granted a partial granting to the appeal of the MP and also to that of the defendant, condemning it, in legal cumulus, to the single penalty of one year of arrest.</description><pubDate>2025-02-18T03:46:51+08:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Convention and Exhibition sector loses visitors and revenues in 2024</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/02/18/sector-das-convencoes-e-exposicoes-perde-visitantes-e-receitas-em-2024/</link><description>Although Macau welcomed 31.4% of this genre events in relation to 2023, participants and visitors fell by 17.1%. Also the revenues generated by non-game economic activity are pessimistic, accusing a decrease of 8.2%.
 
The number of convention events and exhibitions held in 2024 increased by 2023, while the number of participants and visitors of the events and the revenues generated by them decreased.
In total, 1,524 events of this genre were held, 364 (31.4%) than in the last year 2023, and the most significant increase focused on those who focused on the themes “Trade and Management” and “Tourism” ( plus 140 and 78 events, respectively).
The number of participants and visitors did not exceed 1,332,000, a 17.1% reduction in homologous terms. In turn, the revenues of non-game economic activity generated by this type of events were 5.48 billion patacas, representing a decrease of 8.2% compared to 2023.
The Directorate of Statistics and Census Services (DSEC) explains that, analyzing conventions and exhibitions by theme, almost half (42%) focused on the theme “Trade and Management”, followed by “computer technology” (10.8%) and health (10.1%). Regarding the type of events, “Association/Organization Meeting” leads with 38.5%, closely followed by “society meeting” (38.3%) and, with a larger margin, “government meeting” (14.7%) and “exhibitions” (4%).
The second half of the year, especially between September and November, is traditionally the highest sector time. Considered the data through a quarterly perspective, it is found that the fourth quarter of 2024 welcomed 465 convention and exhibition events, an increase of 22% in annual terms. On the other hand, the number of exhibition participants and visitors fell 15.4% compared to the previous year's same year quarter, much due to the last group: if the number of participants in meetings and conferences increased by 8.2% compared to 2023, The number of visitors fell 20.5%.

Already this year, at the beginning of February, the Chief Executive, Sam Hou Fai, also stressed the importance of investing in the non-game sector in the MSAR, namely through the development of projects subordinate to topics such as culture, tourism and entertainment.</description><pubDate>2025-02-18T03:50:58+08:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Alex Chau Io Chong photographs immortalize the city's soul at the Rui Cunha Foundation</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/02/18/fotografias-de-alex-chau-io-chong-imortalizam-a-alma-da-cidade-na-fundacao-rui-cunha/</link><description>The Rui Cunha Foundation Gallery hosts Alex Chau Io Chong's latest construction collection, a simple tribute to Macau. The photographs that make up the exhibition show the evolution of the city, from its origins as a fishing village to its development in an international city, revealing the beauty of architecture, the richness of culture and the life of the people. The exhibition, curated by David Sit, offers a unique view of the city, combining history and contemporaneity.
 
The Rui Cunha Foundation (FRC) has marked today the opening of the exhibition “Macau in My Heart”, which celebrates the history of the territory through the lens of Alex Chau Io Chong, a photographer with over three decades of experience. The exhibition, curated by David Sit, art critic, painter and university professor, offers a unique perspective on Macao, combining his vast multicultural history with the contemporaneity of his latest economic growth, where tradition contrasts with modernity, through of a set of 30 carefully selected photographs. The inauguration is scheduled for today, at 6.30 pm, in the FRC gallery.
Born in Macao, Alex Chau Io Chong began his photographic journey as a teenager. Over the years, he has transformed his camera into a poetic instrument, capable of translating the emotions and profound transformations that Macao has experienced over the decades.
“As a native of Macao, I used the lens to transform deep emotions into a visual language, capturing different moments such as the transformation of this city, from a fishing village into a prosperous international city, and recording poetic images when intertwining history and modernity,” says the artist, in the statement of the exhibition.
The exhibition presents a selection of images that capture the essence of Macau through the ages, from its historical architecture, with the prominent Portuguese influence, to the modern skyscrapers that define its current urban landscape. The photographs portray the disturbing life of the city, revealing the intense colors, movement and quick pace of its population, using photographic techniques such as long exhibitions and use of reflexes. The exhibition is a celebration of the city's duality, where “Portuguese historical architecture and modern high buildings complement each other, while traditions and innovation go hand in hand,” as Alex Chau Io Chong observes.
Over the years, the artist witnessed the city's economic and social development, recording historical moments that marked its evolution. “Rapid economic development brought prosperity to the city and also made Macao a tourist attraction and a worldwide famous entertainment center. Throughout this process, I witnessed many important moments, such as the opening of international casinos, the construction of new milestones and the annual fire fire, ”says Alex Chau Io Chong, on some of the themes that can be seen in these new works.
Alex Chau Io Chong is a degree in Visual Arts, with special education and focus on photography and visual arts from the Polytechnic University of Macau. Throughout his career, he worked as a professional photographer at the former Mandarin East Hotel and was director of the photography studio at the Macao Polytechnic Institute. Its vast experience also covers the areas of visual design, book editing, printing, multimedia and exhibition planning.
“Macau in My Heart” will be evident to the public until March 1, providing visitors with an opportunity to discover, or rediscover, the beauty and complexity of Macao, through Alex Chau Io Chong's sensitive and artistic look.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>The turn of Elfyn Evans</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/02/18/a-vez-de-elfyn-evans/</link><description>Pedro Maia
 
Toyota's Welsh pilot responded to all competition attacks on Sweden's rally and confirmed that he is a candidate for the title. Japanese Takamoto Katsuta struggled to the last special and guaranteed double to the Japanese builder.
 
Ice, snow, cold… Sweden in the winter! The second stage of the Ralis World Championship promised a show and those who closely followed the event did not have failed expectations. At the entrance to the last day of the race were four pilots in a position to fight for the victory. Elfyn Evans (Toyota), Takamoto Katsuta (Toyota), Thierry Neuville (Hyundai) and Ott Tänak (Hyundai) were separated for 12.8 seconds.
Katsuta, navigated by Irishman Aaron Johnston, put pressure on Evans on Sunday's first special. The Japanese took the lead and was beginning to dream of the first victory in the WRC. But Elfyn Evans and co-pilot Scott Martin responded immediately in the second pass for Västervik, summarizing the history of the weekend: whenever he lost his lead, Evans recovered her right away. Wolf Power Stage was followed to close Sweden's rally and the Welsh shine again, placing his Toyota Gr Yaris Rally1 at the top of the Times Table. Evans not only beat Sweden's rally convincingly, but also the maximum points in 'Super Sunday' and the 5 Wolf Power Stage Extra.
“It was a fantastic weekend. We were often in the lead, but this morning Taka picked me up to sleep. He forced me to fight for victory. We went around and we also won the 'Power Stage'. I am very happy with the result, ”explained the Welsh at the end.
Evans is now leading the World Cup with 61 points, after being second in Monte-Carlo's rally. “It's been a very good start to the season. It's hard to dream of something better. It is usually complicated to keep the progress in Sweden after doing well in Monte-Carlo. But the conditions gave us a good opportunity and I feel that we enjoy it. ”
The title candidacy is officially presented, because the team colleague Sébastien Ogier (33 points), which won in Monte-Carlo, should keep the promise of a new season in 'part-time'.
It should also be highlighted the great rally of Takamoto Katsuta. The Japanese, one of the most praised personalities in the WRC, has never been so close to the first victory in the World Cup. Last year he was forced to leave in Sweden when he was in the lead. “It was an intense battle with Elfyn and the men of Hyundai, who were also close. I am happy for the team and congratulations to Elfyn who did a fantastic job in the penultimate special. Next time I will pull more. This result gives me great confidence for the near future, already thinking about Kenya. ”
 
Neuville minimizes damage
 
World Champion Thierry Neuville finished Sweden's rally in third place, 11.9 seconds of the winner. The Belgian, who is pair with Martijn Wydaeghe, was close to the lead but never put himself in a position to threaten Toyota's rivals. The podium is, however, a much better result than the sixth place achieved in the Monte Carlo Rally. “We are happy for the podium, but disappointed because we can no longer love points. The performance after the upgrade was there, but the tuning and the tires did not allow us to be 100%. Something lacked, ”confessed Neuville.
The upgrade in the Hyundai i20 n rally1 also did not bring to Ott Tänak a great advantage. The stoned, navigated by Martin Järveoja, even led the race on Saturday, but complained after problems in the car. He finished the rally in fourth at 16.8 seconds from Evans.
Kalle Rovanperä (Toyota) was fifth, there in a 'nobody's zone', 32.8 seconds of the winner. The young Finnish, two -time champion of the world, is facing some difficulties in this full -time return to the WRC. But beware that the game may be reversed when we enter the dirt events, starting in Kenya.
 
Sesks and Company
 
A note for Adrien Fourmaux and Alexandre Coria. After the Monte-Carlo podium, the Hyundai French duo returned to sight. But a road exit and consequent immobilization in a snow bench lay all off.
Highlight for the return of Martins Sesks to the WRC. The young Latto, in the company of Renars Francis, took the best of the new opportunity of M-Sport. It was the first of the Ford Puma Rally1, in sixth, more than two minutes of Evans.
Finn Sami Pajari ended in seventh. Toyota's young promise could have fought in other places, if it weren't for a hole to complicate her life on the second day.
Greegoire Munster (Ford Puma Rally1) showed once again as the weakest link in M-Sport, because Irish rookie Joshua Mcerlean was almost always faster than Luxembourg. Mcerlean just couldn't avoid a snow bank, where he got his puma planted.
 
Solberg dominates in WRC2
 
Oliver Solberg secured the first triumph of the season in WRC2. The young Swedish, who exchanged Skoda for Toyota, did not give a big margin of maneuver to the opponents. A convincing triumph beating Roope Korhonen (Toyota) for 42.5 seconds, with Mikko Heikkiläkristian (Skoda) finishing 25.8 seconds further.
The most demanding test for the WRC machinery follows. The Safari Rally of Kenya runs between March 20 and 23.</description><pubDate>2025-02-18T03:51:00+08:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Registered case of influenza infection in Macau</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/02/18/registado-caso-grave-de-infeccao-por-gripe-em-macau/</link><description>Health services were notified this Saturday for a serious case of flu infection in Macao.

The Investment Bank estimated that AI will begin to have an impact on the growth of the world's second largest economy, starting next year
 
The US investment bank Goldman Sachs said yesterday that Artificial Intelligence (AI) will give China's economy a slight momentum in the coming years, but warned the impact of industry on the job market.
In a note sent to investors, the Investment Bank, which is headquartered in New York, estimated that AI will begin to impact the growth of the world's second largest economy from next year, and that by 2030 will have Encouraged expansion between 0.2% and 0.3% - higher than previous estimates.
“DeepSeek's recent appearance as a credible global competitor of US-based AI leaders suggests a faster IA development and adoption in China than we predicted earlier,” reads the same note. "Recent developments have demonstrated the ability of Chinese companies to continually improve performance while reducing computing power requirements, paving the way for a faster AI adoption in China," he said.
DeepSeek, based in Hangzhou, East China, has launched two advanced open source AI models for a fraction of cost and computing capacity that major technology companies usually require for similar projects.
The adoption of AI in China is expected to encourage economic growth through automation of tasks, which saves labor costs and increases productivity, the investment bank said. At issue is the use of AI in humanoid robotics, a priority for Beijing.
The use of these robots, head, trunk, arms and legs, in factories and warehouses, aims to compensate for the rapid aging of the population of China.
Goldman Sachs warned that although AI and robotics could “respond to society's aging,” the use of technology could disturb China's labor market at a sensitive time.
The country already faces a “serious recession in the real estate sector” and a young unemployment rate greater than 15%, combined with reports of job losses in construction, finance and civil service. "Therefore, the pace of replacement of labor with technology has to be carefully managed," he said.

IA pediatrician starts working at the Beijing Children's Hospital
 
The first case that an artificial intelligence pediatrician (IA) received at Beijing Children's Hospital was from an eight -year -old boy who, over three weeks, had persistent spasmodic muscle contractions. A mass at the base of the skull was discovered two weeks earlier, presenting a complex medical condition for which diagnostics results in various hospitals proved to be inconsistent. Ni Xin, hospital boss, along with 13 experts from different departments, conducted a discussion about the child's condition and concluded that an additional magnetic resonance evaluation was required, and recommended to expedite the conclusion of the exams. Meanwhile, Ia's pediatrician was also working. After the engineers inserted the patient's main complaints and medical records in the model, the AI ​​pediatrician provided recommendations that aligned with those of the expert panel. This AI pediatrician, considered the first of his kind in China, has participated in multidisciplinary consultations for complex cases, pioneering a parallel model of two doctors that combines AI pediatrician with multidisciplinary human specialists - reaching the transformation of diagnosis and treatment of conditions challenging pediatric pediatrics. According to Ni, the IA pediatrician was developed by the hospital, in collaboration with several technology companies, leveraging the hospital's pediatric medical model, as well as its validation platform for this concept of innovative pediatric medical device.</description><pubDate>2025-02-18T03:50:15+08:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Air quality worsened in 2024</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/02/18/qualidade-do-ar-piorou-em-2024/</link><description>Last year, the number of “unhealthy” or “very unhealthy” days recorded by the Macau meteorological stations rose considerably compared to 2023. Last year's highest unhealthy level was registered in Ho Ho, on October 19, reveals the report released by the Meteorological and Geophysical Services (SMG) consulted by the end point.
 
Last year, more days considered “unhealthy” or “very unhealthy”. Under his whole, Macau's weather stations had two “very unhealthy” records-both at Ká-Hó station-and 136 “unhealthy” records. In 2023, there were only 91 unhealthy or “very unhealthy” records.
According to the statistical report on air quality in Macao in 2024, published on the website of the meteorological and geophysical services (SMG) and analyzed by the end point, the number of “good” or “moderate” records also lowered to 2,058. In 2023, there were 2,099 "good" or "moderate" records.
The highest unhealthiness rate of last year (216) was registered at the Berma Station of the Ká-Hó Road on October 19, with the ozone being the main pollutant. That same day, the Taipa Environmental Station index reached 200, from Coloane at 182 and at Macau High Density Station at 158. The highest index at Taipa's Housing Home Density station was recorded on the 26th of March, arriving at 128. The unhealthy rate at Macao Road Berma station reached the peak of 135 on December 30, and in this case the main pollutant was PM 2.5, or fine particles, not the Ozone.
Looking at the records of Macau Road Station over the last few years, it has been found that air quality has been getting worse since 2022, with the number of good days to fall and the number of unhealthy days to rise. At Berma Estrada de Ká-Hó station, for example, the number of unhealthy days has been growing since 2021.
In this report, SMG explains that the Macao air quality index is based on the data obtained through the automatic monitoring stations network. The pollutant sub-Index, namely suspension unchanged particles (PM10), very thinly inhaled in suspension (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), sulfur dioxide (SO2) and monoxide of Carbon (CO) is calculated using real -time pollutant concentration and the influence on human health.
Authorities advise that when the air quality index is “very unhealthy” or “unhealthy”, the general population should avoid strenuous activities and reduce the outdoor permanence time, namely in areas with intense traffic.
The SMG clarify that the classification of air quality levels and actions to be carried out were defined with reference to classifications from countries and regions, namely China, Hong Kong, United States, United Kingdom and Canada.</description><pubDate>2025-02-18T03:48:52+08:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Project “Culture to Your Door” took art and music through the city streets</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/02/18/projecto-cultura-a-sua-porta-levou-arte-e-musica-pelas-ruas-da-cidade/</link><description>The Cultural Institute (IC) successfully concluded, on February 15 and 16, the initiative “Culture to Your Door”, bringing art and culture directly to residents in 14 neighborhoods in the region.

Xi Jinping gave an “important speech” after listening to several business leaders, official news agency Xinhua said. The details of the speech have not yet been published.
The guest list has not yet been widespread. In the only photograph of the event released, entrepreneurs appear their back, which makes it difficult to accurately identify who is present.
The Hong Kong South China Morning Post newspaper has advanced that Jun, founder and executive director of Xiaomi, Jack MA, founder of Alibaba Group, Wang Chuanfi, President and Executive Director of Byd Electric Vehicle Manufacturer, and Ren Zhengfei, founder and director Executive of the Huawei Technologies group, are some of the names of the participants.
Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang and China's chief leading chief, Wang Huning, were also present.
Last year, China advanced with several measures to replace trust with investors as domestic consumption remained weak and the external environment brought new challenges, with the election of Donald Trump in the United States.
The meeting is interpreted as a Beijing's turnaround, which in recent years has launched a harsh regulatory campaign against major technology companies.
In December 2020, the regulatory authorities announced the opening of an anti -monopoly investigation into Alibaba and suspended Ant, Fintech's branch, which would be the largest in history.
This campaign included investigations to companies such as Tencent and Didi, “Uber Chinese” for alleged risks to users' data security.
For years, the digital sector has flourished in China, not only thanks to the huge market in the country, but also to a little rigorous regulation - or its application - to which Beijing wanted to end.
XI does not hold this type of meetings frequently. Although lower -level employees regularly met with entrepreneurs, the last time Xi attended a meeting of such a high level was in September 2018.

However, the percentage of residents who resorted to requests for help on the problematic game decreased to 58.65%, as in the percentage of croupiers in the recorded cases, which fell to 2.2%. Almost a quarter of cases pointed to financial difficulties such as the reason to play, but according to data from the Institute of Social Action, 72.12% remain in debt.
 
Macau registered 208 cases of game addiction disorder over the past year, updating the previous year's record, thus becoming the highest number since there is registration by the authorities in 2011. The figure corresponds to an increase 23% compared to the previous year, from 169 cases. The cases reached the lowest level by 2020 (77) due to the impact of the pandemic on the game industry.
The statistics were advanced by the Institute of Social Action (IAS) in a report of the central registration system of individuals affected by the game vice disorder. According to the report, the authorities have received a total of 1,871 cases in the last 14 years, and most of those involved are still male (72.63%).
Among the 208 cases of problematic game recorded in 2024, 58.65% of individuals were the holders of the resident identity ticket of Macao, which translates a decrease of 10.58 percentage points, in annual terms, in the percentage of residents in cases in cases . This percentage also verified the lowest in history, while the average set at 81.93%.
The IAS revealed that 41.35% of cases were non-resident: 22.6% were holders of travel authorization to Hong Kong and Macau for residents of the interior of China, 10.1% chin passport holders, while 4, 33% were non-resident workers. Hong Kong residents accounted for 1.92% and foreign passport holders contributed to 1.44% of the total cases, in addition to the 0.96% of “other identities”.
The age group of people aged 30 to 39 years occupied the highest weight among cases, with 23.56%, with the exception of 34% of individuals with an unidentified age. The youngest person who requested help from IAS was only 16 years old.
 
Less involved croupiers
 
It should also be noted the breaking of the percentage of Croupiers and gaming workers in the case of game addiction disorders. The newly used report indicated that 2.2% of individuals affected by the problematic game were Croupiers and 4.4% work in the game industry, a decrease of 1.13 percentage points and 0.93 percentage points, respectively. Most cases had employment and 15.87% were students, domestic and retired. Already 7.69% were entrepreneurs and 1.65% were public administration officials.
Almost half of the individuals registered in the IAS as affected by the game addiction is dedicated to the backed game, 7% bet on football and basketball and 4% play poker machines. About one fifth of the cases said they spend, on average monthly, between 10,000 and 50,000 patacas in the game, but 47% are unaware of how much money spent.
 
Majority have doubt
 
The document also noted that 23.99%of cases stated that the main reason for the game was “financial difficulties resolution”, followed by “entertainment” (19.71%) and “disagreeing” (18.76%). Other reasons that led people to bet include “search for fun” (17.34%) and “killing time” (9.5%), and 4.99%consider the game as “social activity”.
Although almost a quarter of cases want to “solve financial problems” through the game, IAS data prove that this approach is not effective. According to the body, 72% of registered game addicts are suffering debt problems, including 19.33% have debts between 100,000 and 250,000 patacas; 10.67% have debts between 250 thousand and 500 thousand patacas and 8.67% with debts of 50 thousand to 100 thousand patacas.
According to IAS, after an evaluation, 46.62% represent cases of game addiction disorder to moderate degree, 34.46% with severe grade and 12.84% with light degree.</description><pubDate>2025-02-18T03:49:58+08:00</pubDate></item><item><title>China condemns passage from Canadian frigate at the Taiwan Strait</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/02/18/china-condena-passagem-de-fragata-canadiana-pelo-estreito-de-taiwan/</link><description>The Chinese Armed Forces yesterday criticized the passage of a Canadian frigate through the Taiwan Strait, days after the passage of two US ships, which, according to Beijing, deliberately impairs peace and stability in the region.
The Eastern Command of the Popular Liberation Army (ELP), responsible for the military activities around Taiwan, mobilized the air and Naval forces to control the actions of HMCS Ottawa, “managing the situation effectively,” said the spokesman yesterday said yesterday. Of the Chinese Armed Forces, Captain Li Xi, in a statement. "ELP forces always remain on maximum warning and will respond resolutely to any threat or provocation," added the official statement.
In a separate statement, Taiwan's National Defense Ministry (MND) said the frigate sailed from the south and north through Strait on Sunday and that the situation remained “normal” at all times.
The ministry expressed gratitude to the Canadian government for "once again to defend, with concrete actions, freedom, peace and opening in the Taiwan Strait." "Given the various threats of China, our government will continue to reinforce its self-defense ability, resist resolutely resist the spread of authoritarianism and to deepen the exchanges and cooperation with countries that share the same ideas," reads in a statement. of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Taiwan.
The HMCS Ottawa crossing took place days after two US Navy ships crossed Taiwan's Strait, a sea range considered by Washington and his allies as international waters and claimed by Beijing as his own.
Coinciding with the traffic of Canadian frigate, Beijing again intensified military activities around Taiwan. In the last daily report, the Taiwan National Defense Ministry stated that a total of 41 Chinese aircraft flew over Taiwan between 06:00 Sunday and 6:00 am yesterday, a daily record so far this year.
Of these aircraft, which included fighters, bombers and unmanned air vehicles ('drones'), 28 crossed the middle line of the Taiwan Strait and entered the northern, central and southwest of the self -proclaimed Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) , the largest number of raids by 2025.
In 2024, the ministry detected a total of 3,067 incursions of Chinese war aircraft, 80% more than the year before and an annual record since these data began to be disclosed in a context of increasing tensions between Taipei and Beijing.</description><pubDate>2025-02-18T03:50:13+08:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Beijing says that USA severely retreated on Taiwan's issue after reviewing document</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/02/18/pequim-diz-que-eua-recuaram-gravemente-na-questao-de-taiwan-apos-revisao-de-documento/</link><description>The Chinese government yesterday contested the review of an informative document from the US State Department, which eliminated a line on the United States opposition to Taiwan's independence. The United States "retreated severely" in its position on Taiwan and sent the wrong message to the island's "separatist forces", said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun. "We urged the US to (…) to stop encouraging and supporting Taiwan's independence and avoid further harming relationships between China and the US and peace and stability in Taiwan's narrow," said Guo, when asked about the Review at a press conference.
The US State Department removed the phrase “we did not support Taiwan's independence” from the informative document last week. The US Document with the island is published on its official portal. The Taiwan government has settled with the measure. “The Taiwan Ministry of Foreign Affairs has made a note that the US State Department updated the page on the 'current state of US and Taiwan' relations with a positive and friendly text for us, reflecting the narrow and friendly partnership between Taiwan and the United States, ”he said.
This is not the first time the state department has removed the sentence. In May 2022, the State Department removed the sentence, but once again put it a few weeks later, after a strong protest from China. It is unclear why the State Department has changed the language again and if it signals some change in the policy of President Donald Trump, who returned to the White House last month. Taiwan's government fears that Trump may not be such a firm supporter on the island as his predecessor, Joe Biden. The US does not recognize Taiwan as a country, but are its strongest supporter and largest gun supplier.</description><pubDate>2025-02-18T03:50:11+08:00</pubDate></item><item><title>International boat tank torson runs in May-with news</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/02/18/regatas-internacionais-de-barcos-dragao-regressam-em-maio-com-novidades/</link><description>This year's edition of the International Macau-dragon boat tank tops will take place on May 24, 25 and 31, at the Nam Van Lake Nautical Center.

A video released by the CCTV state television channel shows the applauding, before the entry of Xi and other Communist Party leaders of China (CCP), at the beginning of an unusual symposium with private sector executives, including companies such as Tencent, Byd, Huawei and DeepSeek.
The fall of MA dates back to the end of 2020, when he gave a controversial speech, which attacked Beijing's strategy to minimize risks in the financial system and traditional banks, which, according to him, were managed as "pledge houses."
Days later, the Chinese regulators forced the suspension of Alibaba's Fintech subsidiary 'Fintech Scholarship, Ant Group, carrier of the popular Payment Platform Alipay.
The deal, which derailed only 36 hours before the expected date for its realization, should have been the biggest entry into history in history, allowing the company to raise $ 34.5 billion.
Until then, Ma was the richest man in China - is now the eighth with a fortune of $ 27.2 billion, 44% less than in 2021. The entrepreneur was not only the great visible face of private sector development In the Asian country, as it was also considered practically untouchable.
After the Beijing disputes, Ma remained discreet, to the point that the authorities would have forbidden him to leave the country or have been detained.
The change, according to the experts, arrived in early 2023, when Ant Group met one of Beijing's main demands: dissolve MA's vote power, which many analysts interpreted as the end of a regulatory campaign that had resulted in fines Anti -monopoly against Alibaba and other prominent companies such as Tencent or Didi, the "Chinese Uber".
In the words of consulting firm Trivium China: "The campaign started with Jack Ma and ends with Jack Ma".
In March of the same year, the businessman reappeared in China after news that he had moved abroad, and experts anticipated that Beijing hoped his return to stimulate government efforts to regain private sector confidence.</description><pubDate>2025-02-18T03:50:12+08:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Seoul removes deepseek from application stores while investigating data management</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/02/18/seul-retira-deepseek-das-lojas-de-aplicacoes-enquanto-investiga-gestao-dos-dados/</link><description>South Korea announced yesterday the withdrawal of Deepseek from local application stores, while investigating the way the Chinese company specializes in Artificial Intelligence (AI) manages users' data.
 
South Korea is one of several countries, including Italy, France and Australia, which have expressed concerns about the protection of DeepSeek's privacy and national security, since the resounding release of its great language model last month.
The ongoing procedure aims to “examine in detail DeepSeek's personal data processing practices, to ensure that they fulfill the law, said Choi Jang-Hyuk, vice president of the South Korean committee responsible for personal data protection at conference of the press.
By the end of January, the South Korean regulator had already announced that he asked DeepSeek to explain the processing of information provided by users. Since then, the Chinese company “recognized certain deficiencies” on privacy protection, the commission said yesterday.
The body stressed that "some time will be inevitably necessary" to rectify the situation, hence the decision to remove the application of the apps.
The platform is no longer available for unloading on Saturday night, but continues to work for users who already have it.
The South Korean regulator called on to users to “use the service with prudence while waiting for the final results [of the ongoing review], namely abstaining from introducing their personal information”.
In early February, several South Korean ministries, including Defense and Commerce, blocked access to DeepSeek in their computers. South Korean technological giants, such as Samsung Electronics and its rival SK Hynix, are the main suppliers of advanced microprocessors used on AI servers.
Deepseek's R1 model surprised by the ability to match US competitors, although it was developed at low cost and to work with less resources, in question the industry's business model. But it is worrying for many countries because the terms and conditions of Deepseek contain a section on personal data transmission to third parties.
Although this mention is very similar to that of OpenAi's chatgPT, experts were concerned about the risk of these data falling into the hands of the Chinese authorities. Beijing, for its part, said the Chinese government "will never require companies or individuals to collect or store data illegally."
Taiwan has banned government agencies from using chatbot, alleging risks to “national security”, while Australia ordered the removal of programs from the Chinese company from government devices.
In the European Union, the Italian authority for the protection of personal data launched an investigation into DeepSeek, which was prohibited from processing data from Italian users.
The French Cnil, responsible for data protection, and the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) - which regulates the technology giants on behalf of the EU - required DeepSeek explanations of data processing.
China has denounced restrictions recently imposed by various countries, qualifying them of “politicization of economic, commercial and technological issues”.

The judge considered the leader of the workers' party guilty of two accusations of lying under oath in December 2021, before a parliamentary committee investigating the then deputy of the same party Raeesah Khan, The Straits Times said. The prosecution calls for a maximum fine of $ 7,000 from Singapore (4,955 euros) for each accusation against Prinet Singh. The Singapore Law prevents citizens from receiving fines of at least $ 10,000 from Singapore (over 7,053 euros) or has been detained for at least one year for five years. The judge has not yet issued the sentence, which will determine whether or not it may apply for the elections that Singapore should hold by November.

The former candidate for legislative elections pointed out that the new executive's approach cannot respond to society's concerns, thus impairing the government's image.
 
The government of Sam Hou Fai should reinforce bilateral communication with society and fail to restrict access to official events of certain media, argues Johnson Ian, president of the Macao Synergy Association. The former election candidate criticized the way of “unidirectional communication” by the new government, which is making it difficult to transparency of governance and the answer to questions that concern society.
Johnson Ian, in statements to the All About Macau informative portal, indicated that the current executive depends a lot on the issuance of press release to publicize information to the public, whose content “is insufficient” and “lacks bidirectional interaction”, not satisfying the right to know of citizens.
The chief executive and the secretaries, in addition to speaking and sending announcements, according to Johnson Ian, have almost not interviewed on public occasions since his inauguration. "In the communications, the government conveys only what wants the public to know, however, this approach is ineffective in responding to the community's concerns, lacks explanations and in -depth clarifications," he lamented. "If this unidirectional communication model remains in the long run, it will undermine the prestige and government's image in governance," he warned.
In this case, the former journalist is concerned that government interaction with the media and society will deteriorate, impairing the administration, and "will repeat the error of the previous government" to lose contact with society. "If the government separates from society, the effectiveness of governance would be seriously affected and it would be difficult to implement any policy, aggravating the discontent of society," he warned.
The Macao Synergy Association, which is also led by Deputy Ron Lam, recalled that among the government's main positions, only the secretary for the economy and finance, Tai Kin IP, once spoke to journalists in questions and answers once , after the inauguration.
 
Press restrictions
 
In addition, Johnson Ian again appealed to the government to raise restrictions on certain media in access to official events. It is recalled that since October last year, several services have failed to invite some media to press conferences for “space limitation”.
"Just a photograph showing a large number of empty places in the event to prove that the limited space claim was a lie," said the official, pointing out that after the elections for the Chief Executive and the Mashely Birthday ceremony, The attention of the foreign media in relation to Macao has decreased significantly. "It is a mistake to refuse interviews with local media with the excuse that there is an increase in demand for foreign media," he said.
Johnson Ian argues that authorities should follow society's tendency and collect opinions and deal with different types of media, in order to contribute to policy formulation.
The association's leader also suggested that the executive learn to use social networks and adapt to the new modes of operation of the media, such as Europe, the United States and Hong Kong, in order to better communicate with society, well How to help policy promotion and improve image.</description><pubDate>2025-02-18T03:47:11+08:00</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
