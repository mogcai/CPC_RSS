Estimates are from Citigroup. If confirmed, this would mean an increase of around 1% compared to February 2025. The financial institution says that, during the Chinese New Year, Macau casinos had an increase in revenue of around 17% compared to the same period last year.

Casinos operating in Macau are expected to record gross revenues of 20 billion patacas in February, that is, 1% more compared to February 2025. The estimate was made by Citigroup, which, in a report cited by the GGRAsia portal, also indicates that during the Chinese New Year period, gaming revenues increased by 17% compared to the same period last year.
According to the banking institution, this Chinese New Year the total value of bets placed in casinos reached 24.4 million Hong Kong dollars, 17% more compared to the same period last year. The number of players in the 'premium' mass segment was 824, 3% more compared to Chinese New Year 2025.
The average bet thus grew 13% compared to the previous year, reaching a record of 29,625 Hong Kong dollars, which indicates a continuous and robust demand for the 'premium' mass segment. The average minimum bet observed in baccarat was 2,347 Hong Kong dollars, an increase of 5% compared to the same period last year, according to the institution, which “seems to indicate a recovery in the volume of bets”, noted the Citigroup report, adding that this month, so far, two players have already been registered who bet 800 thousand Hong Kong dollars.
In January, casinos generated total gross revenues of around 22.6 billion patacas, which means an annual increase of 24% and places January this year in the second position for the highest monthly revenues since the beginning of 2020. From the beginning of 2020 until now, the best month for casino revenues was October 2025, with 24 billion patacas.
The consultancy Seaport recently indicated that the first quarter of the gaming industry is expected to register an increase of around 14% compared to the same period last year and 7% for the whole of 2026. Forecasts made by other consultants, such as Deutsche Bank and JP Morgan, point to a growth in gross revenues of Macau casinos in 2026 of around 5%.
It is recalled that casinos operating in Macau obtained gross revenues of 247.4 billion patacas in 2025. This figure is 9.1% higher than the 226.7 billion registered in 2024. For this year, the Government believes that gross gaming revenue could reach 236 billion patacas.</description><pubDate>2026-02-24 00:00:11</pubDate></item><item><title>Case of Legionella infection recorded</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2026/02/24/registado-caso-de-infeccao-por-legionella/</link><description>The Health Services were notified on Monday by Kiang Wu Hospital for the detection of a case of Legionella infection, this being the first case recorded in Macau this year.
The case was diagnosed in an 89-year-old man, resident of Macau. During the incubation period, the elderly man was in Zhongshan and Macau. On February 13, the patient began to present symptoms of aggravated cough and hoarseness, without fever, and did not seek medical treatment as he was in Zhongshan. After returning to Macau last Friday, due to the persistence of symptoms, he went to Kiang Wu Hospital the following day, and a chest x-ray revealed a lung infection. On Sunday, a urine test was positive for Legionella pneumophila antigen. Currently, the patient is admitted to Kiang Wu Hospital for treatment, requiring oxygen therapy through bilateral nasal cannulas.
Legionella is a bacterium that lives in natural aquatic environments, such as the surface of lakes, rivers, thermal waters, as well as soil and can proliferate quickly in warm water and in wetter places with higher temperatures, especially when the temperature varies between 20 to 45 degrees Celsius. Legionella can also be found in artificial aquatic systems, such as central air conditioning system cooling towers, jacuzzis, fountains and home medical devices, especially in the presence of biofilm and sediment. A person can become infected by inhaling contaminated mist released by artificial aquatic systems, with the incubation period generally being two to 10 days.
This disease does not spread through human-to-human contact or food consumption. Generally speaking, drinking water contaminated with the virus does not infect people. Men, the elderly, smokers, alcoholics, people with weak immunity, especially chronically ill people, as well as patients undergoing treatment with steroids and immunity inhibitors are more likely to contract this disease. Symptoms of Legionella include fever, cough, dyspnea, fatigue, headaches, muscle pain, abdominal pain and diarrhea. The disease can be treated effectively with early administration of antibiotics.</description><pubDate>2026-02-24 22:32:15</pubDate></item><item><title>Government plans to expand the application of the people flow monitoring system</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2026/02/24/governo-planeia-alargar-a-aplicacao-do-sistema-de-monitorizacao-do-fluxo-de-pessoas/</link><description>The Government is studying improvements and expanding the use of its people flow monitoring system, in response to the need for crowd control, especially during holidays and after major events. The Office of the Secretary for Security revealed that it is considering expanding the application of the system to more locations and border posts, in addition to the current areas of Ruínas de São Paulo, Largo do Senado and Portas do Cerco.

The Office of Chan Tsz King, Secretary for Security, said that it will optimize the “People Flow Forecasting and Alert System”, a Government system that monitors the density of people in real time through sensor devices to better control crowds and traffic flow.
The statement came in response to a written question from Leong Pou U, a deputy who warned of the overload of the Cotai area and border posts during the New Year, due to the sharp increase in the flow of passengers participating in New Year's Eve activities. He therefore asked to expand the scope of the people flow forecasting system.
Specifically, when optimizing the system, authorities will integrate data from various detection equipment and optimize algorithm models. In conjunction with systematic analyzes by zones, the system will create a forecast of the density of the flow of people by zone, according to the Executive, with a view to providing more scientific foundations for controlling the flow of people and traffic.
The Office of the Secretary for Security also added that it is considering expanding the system to locations or border posts with greater flow of people, based on a general assessment of several factors, such as the feasibility of installing the system and the sufficiency of complementary environmental facilities.
Currently, the “People Flow Forecasting and Alert System” is installed in the areas between the Ruins of São Paulo and Largo do Senado, and at the Portas do Cerco Border Post, on the departure side.
The Public Security Police Corps (CPSP) began using this system in 2019, which processes and analyzes data by computerized means and issues alerts and provides scientific foundations for the police to implement timely control of the flow of people and management of order.
According to the organization's presentation, the system uses sensors to classify the density of people in an area into four levels: “Comfortable”, “Moderate”, “Slightly Crowded” and “Congested”. The system also includes information display screens and audio transmission devices to allow citizens and tourists to access information about the density situation of areas, especially tourist areas.
In relation to the increased travel needs of citizens and tourists during holidays and after major events, the Directorate of Services for Traffic Affairs (DSAT), cited in the response, said that it already has a permanent interdepartmental coordination mechanism, with contingency plans defined in advance.
The authorities assured that they had adopted measures to guide public transport, including extending service hours, increasing the frequency of routes, creating seasonal routes and temporary stopping points. DSAT indicated that it had coordinated with the companies, seeking to reinforce shuttle bus services to quickly disperse passengers in areas of greatest concentration. “At the same time, public transport capacity is dynamically adjusted based on real-time traffic data, the frequency of routes is reinforced and the organization of temporary routes is optimized”, he argued. The Executive also promised that it will review, with the competent services and Light Rail and bus operators, the provisional traffic arrangements and guidelines for pedestrians, thus increasing the overall efficiency of circulation.</description><pubDate>2026-02-24 22:33:56</pubDate></item><item><title>Authorities deny refusing work visas to Japanese artists</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2026/02/24/autoridades-negam-estar-a-recusar-vistos-de-trabalho-a-artistas-japoneses/</link><description>The Public Security Police (PSP) denied that it was refusing visas to Japanese artists, stating that it “did not receive any official request”, following the cancellation of a music festival in Macau.
On January 28, South Korean broadcaster MBC, which was organizing the ‘Show! Music Core in Macau’, a music festival in South Korea, which included bands featuring Japanese artists, canceled the event. The festival was scheduled for the 7th and 8th of February, at the Open Air Performance Site, in the Cotai area, created by the local government. MBC did not provide any explanation for the decision, saying only that it was taken “after a thorough analysis of local circumstances and general logistical conditions”.
Even before the official announcement by MBC, the South Korean press had already discussed the possible cancellation due to the alleged difficulty of Japanese artists in obtaining visas to perform in Macau.
In response to questions posed by Lusa, the police clarified that the Japanese artists' case never came under their jurisdiction. “This service did not receive any request or consultation from the competent entity”, the Directorate of Services for Labor Affairs (DSAL), in the response issued by the PSP.
Under the law, the authorities explain, employers who wish to hire workers without resident status for functions in Macau, including staff for shows, “must first submit a request for work authorization to DSAL. "If the request is authorized, the employer must subsequently request the Public Security Police Corps to issue a residence permit to the non-resident worker, granting him the status of non-resident worker. The non-resident can only begin working in Macau after the issuance of this residence permit", he adds.
On February 7 and 8, the South Korean boy group Riize performed in the city without one of its members, Japanese singer Shotaro, due to “unforeseeable circumstances”, said the organization of the two concerts, the company IME Macau.
On December 12, the president of the IC denied any interference in the cancellation of concerts with Japanese artists scheduled for the region and assured that these were solely commercial decisions by the organizers. "It is normal to have adjustments regarding concerts or different events. Situations of cancellation due to force majeure are common," said Leong Wai Man, at a press conference.
Asked by Lusa whether there were instructions from the Government not to hold cultural events with artists from Japan, Leong Wai Man assured that “this is a matter for the commercial sector, it is the organizer's decision”.</description><pubDate>2026-02-24 22:32:41</pubDate></item><item><title>New 15% US global tariff benefits China and Brazil and penalizes allies</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2026/02/24/nova-tarifa-global-de-15-dos-eua-beneficia-china-e-brasil-e-penaliza-aliados/</link><description>The new 15% global tariff announced by Washington is expected to benefit countries such as China and Brazil, while penalizing traditional US allies, after the Supreme Court blocked the White House's previous trade policy, according to an analysis.

According to data released by the trade monitoring body Global Trade Alert (GTA), Brazil will be the country with the biggest reduction in the average rate of tariffs applied by the USA, with a drop of 13.6%, followed by China, with a reduction of 7.1%.
In contrast, Washington's longtime allies are expected to bear the brunt of the new tax, announced after the United States Supreme Court found much of Trump's previous trade policy illegal.
The President had used the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose tariffs on US trading partners, but a majority decision by the Supreme Court invalidated that strategy.
Following the ruling, Trump announced that he would replace the tariffs imposed under IEEPA with a global rate of 10%, which he raised to 15% on Saturday. The measure came into force yesterday, being valid for 150 days, after which it will require new authorization from Congress.
On Sunday, US trade representative Jamieson Greer defended the new regime and promised to move forward with investigations into trade practices that could result in new tariffs.
Greer stated that, although the new legal basis does not offer the same flexibility as IEEPA, the US Administration intends to ensure “continuity” in the current tariff program, resorting to investigations that justify the imposition of additional fees.
According to the official, the increase in the global rate from 10% to 15% was due to the “urgency of the situation”, which requires the “full use of presidential powers”. Greer also assured that he has maintained contacts with commercial partners, including the European Union, stressing that no country has indicated an intention to abandon the agreements already concluded with Washington.
Quoted by the British newspaper Financial Times, economist Johannes Fritz, executive director of the GTA and author of the analysis, stated that countries such as China, Brazil, Mexico and Canada – previously targeted by specific executive orders under the IEEPA – were those that benefited most from the change in the regime.
Asian manufacturers such as Vietnam, Thailand and Malaysia, often criticized for recording high trade surpluses with the USA, should also benefit, especially in the clothing, furniture, toys and plastics sectors. But Greer said that his office plans to open investigations into unfair trade practices related to excess industrial capacity, which could cover several Asian countries.
The official added that the new global tariff should not affect the next meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, aimed at “ensuring stability and compliance with the commitments assumed” by Beijing, namely in the purchase of North American agricultural products, Boeing aircraft and the supply of rare earths.
Fritz warned, however, that the future of the tariff regime remains uncertain, as the US administration has signaled its intention to use Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 to impose additional country-specific measures. The US has already initiated investigations under this provision into Brazil and China.
The new global tax is expected to particularly affect allies whose exports to the US are concentrated in sectors such as steel, aluminum and automobiles, which are already subject to other tariffs that remain in force.
The European Commission demanded “complete clarity” from Washington, arguing that the current situation is not favorable to “fair, balanced and mutually beneficial” transatlantic trade, as provided for in the agreement between the EU and the US. "A deal is a deal. As the USA's largest trading partner, the EU expects the commitments made to be respected", declared the institution.</description><pubDate>2026-02-24 22:30:21</pubDate></item><item><title>Normality has resumed in the delivery service of postal objects between Portugal and the SARs</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2026/02/24/retomada-a-normalidade-no-servico-de-entrega-de-objectos-postais-entre-portugal-e-as-raes/</link><description>According to information received from Correios de Portugal, the postal delivery service, previously affected by adverse weather conditions in the country, has now returned to normal in Macau. The announcement was made yesterday in a statement from the Postal and Telecommunications Services Department
Hongkong Post also announced yesterday that letter and parcel services from the region to Portugal had resumed following the storms that affected Portuguese territory. In a statement, the department that ensures the postal service in Hong Kong reported that “mail delivery services previously affected by adverse weather conditions have returned to normal”, according to instructions from CTT – Correios de Portugal.
On February 2, the postal services in Macau and Hong Kong had warned that letters and parcels destined for Portugal could be delayed due to the destruction caused by Depression Kristin. Eighteen people died in Portugal following the Kristin, Leonardo and Marta depressions, which also caused many hundreds of injuries and displacement. The total or partial destruction of homes, businesses and equipment, the fall of trees and structures, the closure of roads, schools and transport services, and the cut of energy, water and communications, floods and floods are the main material consequences of the storm. The Centre, Lisbon and Vale do Tejo and Alentejo regions were the most affected. The calamity situation that covered the 68 most affected municipalities ended on February 15th.</description><pubDate>2026-02-24 22:29:17</pubDate></item><item><title>Pairing session will make 130 vacancies available in the technology area</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2026/02/24/sessao-de-emparelhamento-vai-disponibilizar-130-vagas-da-area-tecnologica/</link><description>The Directorate of Labor Affairs Services (DSAL) and the Directorate of Economic and Technological Development Services (DSEDT) will organize, on March 14th, a job matching session for technology companies.

According to a statement from the Chinese Ministry of Commerce, Chinese exporters are prohibited from selling dual-use goods – which can have civil and military purposes – to 20 Japanese companies.
Among the companies targeted are several subsidiaries of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries involved in shipbuilding and the production of aircraft engines and marine machinery, as well as divisions of Kawasaki Heavy Industries and Fujitsu.
Foreign organizations or individuals are also prohibited from providing the 20 entities with dual-use goods originating in China, the ministry added. “All ongoing related activities must cease immediately”, reads the note.
A separate list includes another 20 Japanese companies for which Chinese exporters will have to submit individual export license applications, accompanied by risk assessment reports and written commitments that dual-use goods will not be used by the Japanese military.
Companies on this second list include Subaru Corporation, Mitsubishi Materials Corporation and the Institute of Science Tokyo.
The Chinese ministry said the measures, aimed at halting Japan's militarization and nuclear ambitions, "are entirely legitimate, reasonable and legal."
The authorities stressed that the restrictions only target a “small number of Japanese entities” and focus exclusively on dual-use goods, ensuring that they will not affect normal economic and commercial exchanges between China and Japan.
The decision comes in a context of tensions between the two countries following statements made in the Japanese Parliament in November by Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, who suggested that Japan could intervene militarily in the event of a possible attack on Taiwan. Takaichi's party won a significant victory in the legislative elections held this month, reinforcing the possibility of a conservative turn in security or immigration policies in Japan.</description><pubDate>2026-02-24 22:30:49</pubDate></item><item><title>Cases of gambling addiction fell to 168 last year</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2026/02/24/casos-de-vicio-do-jogo-recuaram-para-168-no-ano-passado/</link><description>The number of people who asked for help for gambling addiction fell last year, after the record set a historic record in 2025. Last year, Macau recorded 168 cases, a drop of 19.2% in annual terms. Half of the cases came from non-residents, and requests for help among men were four times higher than those from women. According to the Social Action Institute, almost 70% admitted to having debts, with more than 60% having debts of MOP100,000 or more.

Last year, gambling addiction led 168 people to seek help from the Social Action Institute (IAS) and other community service entities. The number represented a decrease of 19.2% compared to the previous year, when 208 cases were registered, the highest number since there are records in Macau.
The IAS recently released the Central Registration System for Individuals Affected by Gambling Disorder for 2025. The updated statistics show that, although the moderate level disorder continues to lead in cases of requests for help, there was a drop in cases classified as moderate or severe, which went from 47% to 45% of the total, and from 34% to 32%, respectively. Cases of mild problem gambling rose from 13% to 15%.
The organization used the DSM-5 measuring instrument to assess the degree of severity of the cases, but not all of them were evaluated.
The report shows that the most frequently cited reason for gambling among gamblers with gambling addiction problems was “resolving financial difficulties”. Compared to the previous year, in this period of analysis more people, from 24% to 30%, were confident that they would make money through betting.
The situation reflects a “widespread misconception that gambling could alleviate financial problems”, highlighted the IAS. Players also pointed to “entertainment” (18%), “unwinding” (16%), “in search of strong emotions” (14%), “killing time” (10%) and “socialization activities” (3%) as reasons for betting.
Among the various types of gambling activities, those most frequently involved in requests for help were “Baccarat”, a category that registered an annual growth in participation of six percentage points and which was present in 55% of cases, exceeding the accumulated total of all other types of gambling. The other types of gambling involved include betting on football or basketball (8%), “Sic Po Cussec” (6%) and poker or Mocha machines (5%).
Furthermore, the number of players with debt has decreased, but remains high. Almost 70% of people seeking help admitted to having debts, with more than 60% having debts amounting to MOP100,000 or more. Among these, 11% had debts worth two million patacas or more.
A análise do IAS diz que os indivíduos com adição ao jogo têm competências de gestão financeira “relativamente fracas”, e que a maioria só procura ajuda quando já está endividada. According to the organization's data, almost half of the cases said they were unaware of the monthly amount spent on gambling. Furthermore, 16% said they spend between 5,000 and 10,000 per month on betting, followed by 14% who use a monthly amount of 10,000 to 50,000. There were 7% of registered cases who spent 100 thousand patacas or more per month on bets.

MORE NON-RESIDENTS AND LESS YOUNG
 
On the other hand, the profile of people with gambling addiction continues to change, with the proportion of non-resident help seekers increasing, reaching 50% of reported cases. This percentage marked an all-time high since there has been data in the IAS on gambling addiction since 2011.
Statistics reveal that, of the 168 cases, the vast majority (80%) continued to be male players, while 20% were women, with the difference between the parties being approximately four times.
The most representative age group among cases was between 30 and 39 years old (24%). The number of young people who requested help from the IAS and relevant entities reduced significantly, with a drop of six percentage points among young people aged 18 to 29, as well as a drop of one percentage point in the age group of 18 and under.
The IAS recalled that, in response to the expansion of services, social assistance institutions have progressively introduced online counseling services in recent years, which may not allow the gender or age of service users to be identified.
There were also more addicted gamblers who were married (42%) and who had academic qualifications of degree level or higher (26%).
Regarding employment status, the majority of cases involved employed individuals, with approximately 10% declaring themselves unemployed. It is worth noting that working players saw an increase of almost nine percentage points, while student, domestic or retired players fell by almost seven percentage points.
About 20% of cases required shift work. After excluding those who declared unemployment, approximately 9% of cases were involved in occupations related to the gaming industry.
The document also highlights the increase in the percentage of croupiers and workers in the gaming area in cases of gambling addiction disorders last year. A total of 3% of people who asked for help were croupiers and 6% came from workers related to the gambling sector.
Drivers represented 8% of gambling addiction cases, 5% were businesspeople and 6% were retired. The central registration system also found that almost 5% of cases were presented by Public Administration employees, a number that has skyrocketed in recent years from 0.67% in 2023, to 1.65% in 2024 and 4.67% last year.</description><pubDate>2026-02-24 00:00:27</pubDate></item><item><title>Hong Kong executive expresses “firm protest” after loss of ports in Panama</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2026/02/24/executivo-de-hong-kong-manifesta-firme-protesto-apos-perda-de-portos-no-panama/</link><description>The Hong Kong Executive yesterday sent a “firm protest” to the Panamanian consul in the semi-autonomous Chinese region, after the Panamanian authorities took control of two ports operated by the local group CK Hutchison, following a final court decision.

In a statement published on its official portal, the Executive expressed “firm disagreement and opposition to the forced seizure, by the Panamanian Government, of two ports” operated in the vicinity of the Panama Canal by the Panama Ports Company, a subsidiary of CK Hutchison, based in Hong Kong.
A day after Panama took control of the ports of Balboa and Cristóbal, Hong Kong's Secretary for Trade and Economic Development, Edward Yau, formally presented the protest to the Central American country's main diplomatic representative in the city.
The authorities of the former British colony consider that the decision by the Supreme Court of Panama to revoke the concession to PPC – in force since 1997 – constitutes “a disregard for the facts and a breach of trust”, in addition to “contradicting the spirit” of the contract. “The Hong Kong Government condemns this egregious act”, says the statement, demanding that Panama “respect the spirit of the contracts, provide an equitable and fair business environment for companies (…) and ensure that their rights and legitimate interests are not affected”.
The Executive added that the decision and the “disproportionate actions” of the Panamanian Government damaged the country's credibility and seriously affected international trade rules.
On Monday, the Panamanian authorities took control of the two ports – two of the five existing around the Panama Canal, through which 38% of the total containers handled by the country's port system pass – which will now be under transitional management by subsidiaries of the Danish Maersk and the Swiss MSC.
The PPC considers that the “illegal seizure” of the ports represents the “culmination of the illegal campaign initiated a year ago by the State against the PPC, its investors and its concession contract”, holding Panama responsible for “any losses or damages caused by the confiscatory actions”.
The CK Hutchison subsidiary stated that it reserves “all rights and legal remedies against the State” and reported, at the beginning of the month, that it had initiated arbitration proceedings against Panama at the International Chamber of Commerce (CCI), in an action that could amount to 2,000 million dollars, according to a company spokesperson.
The Supreme Court of Panama annulled the concession to PPC following two actions presented last July by the Comptroller General, Anel Flores, who classified the contract as “Leonine” and harmful to national interests.
Following criticism from US President Donald Trump regarding the alleged “Chinese influence” over the Canal, CK Hutchison had agreed last year to transfer the concession to a consortium led by asset manager BlackRock, but the transaction was blocked by Beijing in the context of geopolitical tensions with Washington.
Shares in Hong Kong conglomerate CK Hutchison Holdings fell 1.8% in the morning session on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, although they have still gained close to 17% since the beginning of the year.

Under the guidance of the director of the Faculty of Applied Sciences at UPM and the coordinating professor at UC, Choi Wan Chong, PhD candidate in Applied IT Technology, and Choi Iek Chong, PhD candidate in Educational Technology and Innovation, at UPM, presented the results of research on predicting student performance and explainable artificial intelligence (AI). According to a press release released by the Macau institution, this study “demonstrated the practical value of applying AI in the field of educational technology, which received great recognition from the conference jurors and academic experts”.
UPM explains that in the current field of educational data mining, traditional predictive models can estimate student performance but lack transparency, making it difficult to provide concrete suggestions for teachers and students. Therefore, the research team proposed an innovative method, combining the optimization of the XGBoost algorithm with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). Through SMOTE class balancing and hyperparameter tuning, the model effectively improves its performance across multiple metrics, enabling effective early predictions and timely identification of potential learning risks.
The research results, published under the title “Explaining Student Performance Prediction and Generating Personalized and Actionable Feedback Using Explainable Artificial Intelligence (AIE) with SHAP”, “will contribute to the development of personalized learning for students, as well as establishing an application framework for AI-assisted educational decision-making and learning analytics, combining academic depth with practical potential”, says UPM.</description><pubDate>2026-02-24 22:31:44</pubDate></item><item><title>Thailand accuses Cambodia of violating border ceasefire and Phnom Penh denies it</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2026/02/24/tailandia-acusa-camboja-de-violar-cessar-fogo-na-fronteira-e-phnom-penh-nega/</link><description>Thailand's army yesterday reported an exchange of fire with Cambodian forces along the border and accused the neighboring country of violating the December truce, an allegation that Cambodia categorically denied.

According to a Thai military statement, Cambodian forces yesterday fired a 40mm grenade at a patrol in the border province of Sisaket, triggering a response from Thailand. No injuries were reported among Bangkok troops, according to the statement cited by the news agency France-Presse (AFP). “Thai forces responded by firing an M79 [grenade launcher] in the direction from which the shots came, in accordance with the rules of military conduct, as a warning and in self-defense,” the army added.
Thai military spokesman Winthai Suvaree said in the statement that “Cambodia's actions violated the ceasefire agreement” of December 27, 2025, which ended three weeks of deadly border clashes. “These allegations are completely false, invented and grossly distort the facts with the deliberate intention of deceiving public opinion and causing tensions along the border between Cambodia and Thailand”, reacted the Cambodian Minister of Information.
Neth Pheaktra reiterated to AFP Phnom Penh's “unwavering commitment” to the December truce and to a previous, short-lived ceasefire agreement signed in October in the presence of US President Donald Trump. “Cambodia is deeply concerned that unilateral allegations, made without joint verification, consultation or factual substantiation, risk giving a false picture of the situation on the ground and damaging mutual trust,” he added.
According to the Thai statement, the incident may have resulted from a “rotation of Cambodian troops”, in which the new personnel, unfamiliar with the regulations, committed “operational failures”. The two Southeast Asian kingdoms have long disputed the layout of the 800-kilometer border, defined during the French colonial period.
The border conflict degenerated into clashes several times last year, which caused dozens of deaths on both sides, among soldiers and civilians, and caused the displacement of more than a million people in July and December. Since the truce, Cambodia claims that Thailand has seized several areas in border provinces and demands the withdrawal of Thai troops from territories claimed by both countries.
At the beginning of January, Thailand had already accused Cambodia of violating the ceasefire, alleging that mortar fire injured a soldier, while Phnom Penh spoke of an “explosion in a pile of rubbish” that would have injured two of its soldiers.

The data was released yesterday, on the same day that CAM – Macau International Airport Society revealed that the airport reached level 3 of an international program to reduce carbon emissions.

Macau International Airport recorded a “notable increase” in the number of passengers during the Chinese New Year celebrations, according to data released yesterday by CAM – Macau International Airport Society.
Between the 14th and 23rd of February, the airport received 267,235 passengers and operated 1,943 flights, which translates into respective increases of 11% and 9% compared to the same period last year. The 21st and 22nd of February were the busiest, with the daily number of passengers reaching 29 thousand and 28 thousand, respectively.
CAM data reveals that passengers on connections with mainland China represented 46% of the total, while international flights accounted for 39%. Passengers on air routes to the island of Taiwan accounted for 18% of the total volume.
In addition to these destinations, Southeast Asia was also highlighted during this festive season of the New Year of the Horse. Macau airport added around 60 additional flights on routes to and from countries in this region (including, for example, Thailand, the Philippines and Malaysia), in order to meet the increased demand from passengers.
“Macau International Airport actively coordinated with various departments to ensure smooth operations and orderly operation of flights during Chinese New Year,” writes CAM. The company adds that the airport will continue to “implement various measures to encourage airlines to increase international passenger capacity and launch new routes”, aiming to improve service quality and support the sustainable development of the tourist market in Macau.
In 2025, the airport received more than 7.52 million passengers, 55% of which were from the interior of China. International passengers represented 17% of the total, an increase of 8% year-on-year.

Macau Airport achieves environmental certification

In another statement also released yesterday, CAM announced that Macau International Airport achieved level 3 certification of the Airport Carbon Accreditation (ACA) program in November last year.
Macau airport has been included in level 2 of the program since 2014, having since then made “continuous efforts to reduce carbon emissions every year”. The airport's initial target, which was to reduce CO2 emissions per movement by 20% by 2018, ended up being exceeded with a 40% reduction in emissions in the year in question.
More recently, from 2022 onwards, the airport had been preparing for level 3 accreditation with the implementation of a set of actions that aimed to increase the efforts already developed until then, including “training, definition of carbon emissions reduction targets and corresponding actions”, as well as “the establishment of a carbon emissions platform”. The airport's efforts contributed to achieving level 3 of the ACA certification, made up of seven levels.
“We congratulate Macau International Airport for its significant process in reducing carbon emissions,” said Stefano Baronci, general director of the Airports Council International (ACI) Asia Pacific and Middle East, quoted in the CAM statement. “By positioning itself as a leader in efficient carbon management, the airport demonstrates a strong commitment to a more sustainable future.”
The official also highlights that the approach of the aviation sector in Macau is “fully aligned with the collective vision of the industry”, which aims to achieve “net zero emissions” by 2050. In parallel, CAM also guarantees that it will continue to work to “accelerate the sustainable and constant development of the aviation industry in Macau”, aligning itself with the national goals of the “double carbon target”.</description><pubDate>2026-02-24 22:33:52</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
