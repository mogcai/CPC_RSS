The bilingual work will be launched on November 29th at the Macau International Institute, marking the culmination of a vocational training project that promoted “a beautiful harmony” between gastronomy professionals and people in the rehabilitation process. 

The Macau Drug Rehabilitation Association (ARTM) will launch a new cooking recipe book as part of an unprecedented activity in Macau, the result of a collaboration between 25 renowned chefs from the territory and the residents of its therapeutic community. The launch is scheduled for November 29th, at 4pm, at the Macau International Institute, on Rua de Berlin.
Among the participants in the collaborative project are names such as Pedro Almeida, known for the tapas restaurant Três Sardinhas, Desmond, chef at the Artyzen Grand Lapa hotel, Herlander Fernandes, from Mesa, Macanese cuisine specialists Florita Alves and Antonieta Manhão, Martinho, from the Vicks restaurant, among other chefs from the main resorts such as Venetian, MGM, Wynn and Galaxy. The culinary diversity present in the images and recipes in this new book covers Portuguese, Macanese, Indian, French and Cantonese recipes, with the aim of illustrating the multicultural mosaic of good food in Macau.
“All the chefs visited the ARTM therapeutic community to cook together with our residents, as part of the vocational skills training”, revealed Augusto Nogueira, president of the association. The result was “a beautiful harmony between chefs and our residents”, culminating in a bilingual book, in English and Chinese, that focuses on the various flavors found in Macau.
The project also had the support of local photographers who documented the entire process and contributed to the high quality images for the publication. Interested parties can now pre-order the book, with payment possible up to the day of launch.
The project to create the book is part of a broader ARTM strategy to promote social reintegration through occupational activities and professional training. In addition to this culinary initiative, the association regularly develops training workshops that include artistic activities, training in social skills and professional mentoring programs. These parallel activities aim to rebuild self-esteem and create bridges with the community in general.
ARTM, which has been operating in Macau since 1993 (initially under the name “Ser Oriente”), follows the Therapeutic Community model, working with four pillars: Treatment, Prevention, Risk Reduction and Political Advocacy. The association offers detoxification and rehabilitation programs, in addition to risk reduction, reintegration and prevention projects aimed at adolescents (“Be Cool”).
Confirmation of presence at the launch event must be made by November 17th, providing an opportunity to learn more about the association's work and the results of this collaborative project, while presenting the recipes that make up the work.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Macau companies and associations present at trade and services fair in Zhuhai</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/11/05/empresas-e-associacoes-de-macau-presentes-em-feira-de-comercio-e-servicos-em-zhuhai/</link><description>The Trade and Investment Promotion Institute (IPIM) organized the participation of a delegation, made up of around 20 representatives of companies and trade associations from the 'big health', conventions and exhibitions, technology, finance and import and export sectors, at the 4th Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area Services Trade Fair, held in Zhuhai.

The book launch takes place on November 15th, at 4pm, in the village of Nossa Senhora de Ká-Hó, H2H live library, in Coloane.
This illustrated book published in Chinese focuses on the role of Italian artist Oseo Acconci in the urban development of Macau between the 1950s and 1980s, leaving a legacy of countless sculptures, architectural works, murals and other artistic creations. “Its architectural aesthetics are a crucial element in the formation of the cultural landscape and image of Macau during this period”, reads the IIM press release.
Oseo Acconci was born in a medieval village in the Arno Valley, Italy. “A Renaissance figure, he was proficient in painting and sculpture, possessing creativity and boldness”, describes the institute, noting that he was invited to work in Shanghai and Hong Kong, where he participated in the decoration of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation building, inside Casa Sassoon (current Hotel Peace), in Shanghai. Until the start of the war, in 1941, the family moved to Macau, where the then governor, Gabriel Teixeira, invited Oseo Acconci to work on municipal engineering projects.
This book aims to rediscover the work of “an artist who left important marks in the history of urban development and modern art in Macau, and who is currently little remembered”. “Through the study of the artistic characteristics, cultural context and symbolism of its sculptures, architecture and murals, the author analyzes its aesthetics and humanist spirit, complementing the history of modern art in Macau at the beginning of the 20th century and using it as a lens to reflect on Macau in current times”, can be read in the IIM statement.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>More than eight thousand have found employment through DSAL's matching service</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/11/05/mais-de-oito-mil-conseguiram-emprego-atraves-do-servico-de-emparelhamento-da-dsal/</link><description>530 residents obtained employment through the Labor Affairs Bureau's matching service, of which more than half were young people under 34 years of age.

At a press conference, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning expressed hope that “the parties involved will maintain their commitment to transparency, respect the principles of market economy and fair competition, and refrain from politicizing or placing excessive emphasis on trade and economic issues.”
Mao also indicated that Chinese authorities hope that “a fair, transparent and non-discriminatory business environment will be offered to companies from all countries”. “China consistently supports Chinese enterprises in pragmatic cooperation in various areas, based on the principle of mutual benefit and win-win results,” the spokeswoman added.
The company MMG, controlled by the Chinese state-owned group Minmetals Corporation, acquired the nickel business in Brazil from the multinational Anglo American, based in the United Kingdom.
Brussels indicated in a statement that it has “preliminary concerns” that the agreement could allow MMG to divert ferronickel supplies from European markets, leading to higher costs and “lower quality” in European stainless steel production.
The European Commission stated that, after being acquired by MMG, Anglo American's nickel division “may have an incentive to reduce supplies to European customers in favor of the group's own activities”.
In response to Brussels' concerns, MMG presented a set of commitments to the Commission, which did not consider them “clear enough to address the identified competition concerns”.
The Commission now has 90 working days, until March 20, to make a final decision on the agreement. “Ferronnickel is a fundamental material for European producers to manufacture high-quality, low-emission stainless steel at competitive prices, which is essential for many sectors,” said the European Commissioner for Competition, Teresa Ribera.</description><pubDate>2025-11-05 23:30:03</pubDate></item><item><title>Japanese group “Avantgardey” dances around Macau with Mak Mak in promotional video</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/11/05/grupo-japones-avantgardey-danca-por-macau-com-mak-mak-em-video-promocional/</link><description>A different artistic visit.

The plan stipulates that each commercial entrepreneur can be granted an interest subsidy for credits worth a maximum of five million patacas, with a maximum subsidy period of three years and the maximum limit of the annual subsidy rate is 4%. The maximum limit for the total amount of credits to be subsidized is 10 billion patacas.

Rafaelito Alejandro added that 49 of the 66 fatalities were recorded in the province of Cebu (center) and 26 people are still missing.
Entire cities in Cebu were flooded, with residents seeking refuge on rooftops to escape the muddy waters that swept away cars, trucks and even huge containers, as shown in videos verified by the France-Presse (AFP) news agency. "All the water from the floods has already receded. Our challenge now is to remove the debris blocking our roads", added Alejandro. In total, almost 400,000 people were preventively evacuated from the typhoon's path, he added.
Typhoon Kalmaegi hit the east coast of the archipelago on Monday, just before midnight (3 pm in Lisbon), in the province of Dinagat Islands, in the Visayas archipelago, according to the country's meteorological service.
Between Tuesday and Wednesday, 183 millimeters of rain fell in the Cebu city region, well above the monthly average of 131 millimeters, meteorologist Charmagne Varilla told AFP.
Provincial governor Pamela Baricuatro described the situation on the social network Facebook as “truly unprecedented”. “The floods are simply devastating,” he said.
After Kalmaegi, Charmagne Varilla predicts that three to five more storms will hit the Asian country before the end of the year.
Each year, around 20 storms and typhoons hit or come close to the Philippines, with the poorest regions of the country generally being the most affected.

The Philippines was hit in September by Typhoon Ragasa and Tropical Storm Bualoi, both deadly. According to scientists, climate change caused by human activity is making extreme weather events more frequent, deadlier and more destructive.</description><pubDate>2025-11-05 23:29:31</pubDate></item><item><title>Reorganization of the IAM will relocate 150 workers to the responsibility of Transport and Public Works</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/11/05/reorganizacao-do-iam-vai-deslocalizar-150-trabalhadores-para-tutela-dos-transportes-e-obras-publicas/</link><description>The Legislative Assembly (AL) approved unanimously yesterday a reorganization of the Institute for Municipal Affairs (IAM) which, as the secretary for Administration and Justice said yesterday, will see 150 workers join the services responsible for Transport and Public Works. Wong Sio Chak also indicated that IAM currently has around 2,200 workers.

Yesterday, in general, the proposal to amend the law creating the Institute for Municipal Affairs (IAM), which provides for a restructuring of the organization, was approved. The Government's proposal received the approval of all deputies to the Legislative Assembly (AL).
This was the first proposal presented by Wong Sio Chak in the hemicycle in his role as Secretary for Administration and Justice. The former Secretary for Security explained that this reorganization of the IAM comes as part of the attempt to reform public administration and establishes that the duties relating to the naming of public spaces, the attribution of police numbers and the conservation and repair of roads and drainage networks pass to services in the area of ​​Transport and Public Works.
During the debate, Wong Sio Chak explained that this restructuring will allow the number of divisions within the IAM to be reduced from 36 to 19. Furthermore, when this proposal comes into force, the number of departments will increase from 12 to eight. On the other hand, 150 IAM workers will join the Transport and Public Works department. The secretary said that the workers in question have already been informed and will continue in identical roles. In recent years, according to the government official, the total number of IAM workers was reduced from 2,700 to 2,200.
This restructuring also affects the IAM staff regime. Currently, the organization's workers are hired under an individual employment contract, with private staff status applicable to them. However, according to the Government, “the IAM staff statute in force has basically the same content as the general civil service regime”, therefore, this legislative initiative by the Executive proposes that the private IAM staff status should no longer be applied, with the general public service regime applying.
The bill also adds an attribution to the IAM: “contribute to promoting the population's quality of life, namely monitoring food security and water quality, urban beautification and afforestation, as well as the construction and renovation of facilities and public places managed by the IAM”. At AL, Wong Sio Chak also guaranteed that, after the restructuring, the IAM advisory councils will continue to exist.
After general approval, the document will now be debated in an AL committee. The Government wants this diploma to come into force on June 1st of next year.</description><pubDate>2025-11-05 23:48:05</pubDate></item><item><title>Taiwan detains 25 alleged members of group linked to fraud in Cambodia</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/11/05/taiwan-detem-25-alegados-membros-de-grupo-ligado-a-fraudes-no-camboja/</link><description>Taiwan yesterday announced the arrest of 25 people and seized assets worth 4.53 billion Taiwan dollars (127.3 million euros) linked to an alleged transnational online fraud network.

In a statement, the Taipei District Procuratorate of Taiwan's Public Prosecutor's Office (MP) said the seized assets included 11 houses, 48 ​​parking spaces, 26 luxury vehicles and 60 bank accounts linked to the Prince group.
This conglomerate, based in Cambodia and whose president, businessman Chen Zhi, is wanted by the United States, was the target of an investigation into money laundering, organized crime, gambling and fraud in Taiwan.
In September, the United States (US) and the United Kingdom imposed joint sanctions against the conglomerate and Chen Zhi, following the largest cryptocurrency seizure in history, with more than 13 billion euros in Bitcoin confiscated.
The US accuses Chen of running a criminal empire, forcing hundreds of victims of human trafficking to commit online scams “on an industrial scale” from closed, prison-like compounds in Cambodia.
The United States sanctioned nine Taiwanese companies and three Taiwanese citizens, prompting Taiwan to launch an investigation into the Prince group's operations on the island.
After two weeks of collecting evidence, searches were carried out on Tuesday in 47 locations, including the homes of senior executives and members of the group, resulting in the arrest of 25 suspects and the testimony of ten witnesses. “The Prince group, led by Chen, was involved in fraud in Cambodia and established a vast business network in several countries to carry out money laundering operations (…). The investigation is ongoing to clarify all the facts”, concluded the MP.
In statements released by the Taiwanese public news agency CNA, the head of Taiwan's foreign affairs department, Liu Shyh-fang, explained that Taiwan is cooperating with the US Department of Justice and the US Treasury Department in investigating international fraud networks, especially in the case of Chen Zhi, who traveled to the island on “several occasions”.
Liu Shyh-fang said that because Chen has “multiple nationalities” and did not use a Cambodian passport when he entered Taiwan, it has been difficult to determine the businessman's whereabouts.
However, Liu highlighted that, in coordination with US authorities, Taiwan will investigate “all flows of people and money, as well as related security aspects, to identify partners or local criminal groups”, acting “without leniency” and ensuring that those involved in these fraud networks “do not escape punishment under the law”.
In 2019, the Taiwanese police announced that they had dismantled in Cascais, in cooperation with the Portuguese police, a network led by a Taiwanese citizen, which allegedly defrauded victims in mainland China via telephone.

In September, public sector deposits in banking activity grew to 227.9 billion patacas, representing a growth of 3.2%. As a result, total deposits in banking activity grew by 1.4%, reaching 1,392.3 billion patacas. The proportion of patacas, Hong Kong dollars, renminbi and US dollars in deposits was 19.2%, 44.8%, 8.2% and 25.7%, respectively.
AMCM also says, in the September statistics, that domestic loans to the private sector decreased by 0.2% compared to the previous month, reaching 501 billion patacas. From the analysis of credit by economic use, it appears that in the third quarter of 2025, bank loans related to “manufacturing industries” and “information technology” increased by 9.3% and 7.4%, respectively when compared to the previous quarter. Loans granted to the “wholesale and retail trade” and “restaurants, hotels and similar” sectors recorded decreases of 10.1% and 4.2%, respectively.
Furthermore, loans abroad grew by 1.6% compared to the previous month, reaching 520.2 billion patacas. As a result, the total volume of loans from banking activity grew by 0.7%, reaching 1,021.2 billion patacas, while in patacas, Hong Kong dollars, renminbis and US dollars, the weights were reached 21.9%, 43.4%, 12.1% and 19.3%, respectively.</description><pubDate>2025-11-05 23:37:46</pubDate></item><item><title>More than 60 victims of fraudulent messages claiming to be banks</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/11/05/mais-de-60-vitimas-de-mensagens-fraudulentas-que-alegavam-ser-bancos/</link><description>At least 65 residents are said to have fallen victim to fraudulent schemes involving phishing messages in which the perpetrators pretended to be local banks. According to the Judiciary Police (PJ), complaints were received from October 1st until last Monday, with citizens reporting losses totaling 948 thousand patacas.
The PJ highlighted that fraudsters falsified the identities of Macau banks to send chain phishing messages to the population, and these messages could be disguised among authentic banking communications. The authorities therefore appeal to the public for extreme caution.
"Scammers not only send 'phishing' links, but also falsify official bank telephone numbers as identification of the sender. When cell phones receive these messages and identify the sender as a bank number, they are automatically incorporated into the existing conversation with the bank", explained Cheong Un Hong, spokesperson for the PJ Anti-Scam Coordination Center, quoted by the Chinese channel TDM Macau.
The official indicated that fraudulent phishing messages mix with genuine communications between banks and citizens, making it difficult to distinguish between messages sent by fraudsters and those issued by the bank.
According to the PJ, the aforementioned messages falsely claim the “expiration of special reward points”, leading recipients to click on the embedded ‘phishing’ links. And, when citizens click on these fraudulent links, they are redirected to fake banking pages where information is displayed that users can exchange their discount points for rewards at a reduced price, with the aim of tricking them into entering their credit card details.
Once this information is entered, fraudsters can carry out high-value unauthorized transactions, resulting in financial losses for citizens.
The PJ added that, during the four-day period alone, from October 31st to November 3rd, there were 30 cases of this type involving losses of almost 400,000 patacas.
The PJ reminds the public that, regardless of the sender, they should not click on unknown links in text messages without first verifying their authenticity with the competent official body, and should exercise extreme caution when entering personal, bank account or credit card details online, always checking the authenticity of the website.</description><pubDate>2025-11-05 23:41:45</pubDate></item><item><title>Former deputy prosecutor Kong Chi again accused of corruption in collusion with lawyers and businesswoman</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/11/05/ex-procurador-adjunto-kong-chi-novamente-acusado-de-corrupcao-em-conluio-com-advogados-e-empresaria/</link><description>The Court of Second Instance yesterday began the trial of yet another criminal case against Kong Chi, former deputy public prosecutor, who is already serving a 21-year prison sentence.

Kong Chi, former deputy prosecutor, found himself again in the dock of the Court of Second Instance (TSI), with charges of crimes of passive corruption for an illicit act and malfeasance.
Another case involving Kong Chi was judged yesterday by the TSI, which hears the case in the first instance. In addition to the then magistrate, the defendants include lawyer Ho Kam Meng, businesswoman Choi Sao Ieng and lawyer Kuan Hoi Lon. According to the accusing entity, the Public Prosecutor's Office (MP), the defendants received bribes to interfere in various criminal investigation processes.
Similar accusations in another court case have already led to Kong Chi being sentenced to a 21-year prison sentence, the final decision of which was handed down earlier this year, while the defendant Choi Sao Ieng was sentenced to 16 years in prison at the time. Kuan Hoi Lon was the only one acquitted in that case.
In turn, Ho Kam Meng was arrested last year and is in pre-trial detention, with his registration and duties suspended as a lawyer since September last year. Ho Kam Meng was also one of Kong Chi's representative defenders during his previous court case.
All defendants appeared at yesterday's first trial hearing, with the exception of Kuan Hoi Lon. According to newspaper Ou Mun, reading the indictment in this case took more than two and a half hours.
According to judge Choi Mou Pan, also substitute president of the TSI and judge reporting on the case, the prosecution points out that Kong Chi, in collusion with the other defendants, took advantage of his profession as a magistrate assigned to the Criminal Prosecution Service to “solve the criminal cases” of individuals under investigation in criminal investigations, mainly by archiving the cases.
The MP understands that Kong Chi and Ho Kam Meng, who also took advantage of his profession as a lawyer, formed a criminal group between 2008 and 2022, having helped people involved in criminal cases to escape justice or have favorable dispositions in investigations, in order to obtain financial gains.
The indictment adds that, during this period, Kong Chi collaborated with Ho Kam Meng and Choi Sao Ieng, or with Choi Sao Ieng and Kuan Hoi Lon, taking advantage of their respective professional statuses to coordinate in facilitating the resolution of certain legal cases, with the cases involved including illegal contracting, drug trafficking, theft and forgery of documents.
Thus, due to alleged illegal filing of the processes, Kong Chi and Ho Kam Meng are accused of committing, in co-authorship, ten crimes of passive corruption for an illicit act and 56 crimes of malfeasance; Kong Chi, Ho Kam Meng and Choi Sao Ieng are accused of committing, in co-authorship, two crimes of passive corruption for an illicit act; Kong Chi, Ho Kam Meng, Choi Sao Ieng and Kuan Hoi Lon are accused of committing, in co-authorship, three crimes of passive corruption for an illicit act; Kong Chi and Choi Sao Ieng are accused of committing, in co-authorship, eight crimes of passive corruption for an illicit act; and Ho Kam Meng was accused of being part of or supporting a secret association or society.
Information released by the court shows that the trial is presided over by judge Choi Mou Pan, with deputy judges Fong Man Chong, Tam Hio Wa, Chao Im Peng and Seng Ioi Man.
The TSI scheduled the continuation of the trial for next Monday, at 10 am.</description><pubDate>2025-11-05 23:44:51</pubDate></item><item><title>US sanctions North Korean bankers for laundering stolen cryptocurrencies</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/11/05/eua-sancionam-banqueiros-norte-coreanos-por-branqueamento-de-criptomoedas-roubadas/</link><description>The United States imposed sanctions on a group of bankers and financial institutions accused of laundering money from cybercrime, money that, according to the Treasury Department, finances North Korea's nuclear weapons program.
The US Treasury's foreign assets control office indicated, in a statement, that North Korean fraudulent schemes diverted more than 3 billion dollars, mainly in digital assets.
The same source stressed that the amount is unparalleled by any other foreign agent.
The new measures were aimed at eight people and two companies, including North Korean bankers Jang Kuk Chol and Ho Jong Son. They are accused of helping manage funds, including $5.3 million (4.6 million euros) in cryptocurrencies, on behalf of First Credit Bank, which is under sanctions.
An international report documented the scale of the problem in a 138-page document published last month. “North Korean state-sponsored hackers steal and launder money to finance the regime’s nuclear weapons program,” said Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, John K. Hurley, quoted in the statement.
The Treasury Department said, in turn, that North Korea depends on a network of banking representatives, financial institutions and shell companies in North Korea, China, Russia and other countries to launder money obtained through fraud, cryptocurrency theft and evasion of sanctions.
In 2022, the US Treasury warned US companies against hiring highly qualified North Koreans who hide their identities to gain access to financial networks, often posing as remote information technology professionals.</description><pubDate>2025-11-05 23:28:55</pubDate></item><item><title>PM of Timor-Leste says that 2026 will be the year of transforming the economy</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/11/05/pm-de-timor-leste-afirma-que-2026-vai-ser-ano-de-transformar-economia/</link><description>The Prime Minister, Xanana Gusmão, stated yesterday that 2026 will be the year to transform Timor-Leste's economy through the creation of jobs for young people, prudent fiscal management and the construction of capable institutions.

“If the year 2024 was a year of correcting the weaknesses found in the institutions, systems and processes of the public sector and 2025 a year of defining policies and strategies and implementing reforms and audits, 2026 will be the year of transforming the economy”, said Xanana Gusmão.
The Timorese leader was speaking at the Timorese National Parliament at the beginning of the debate on the general State Budget (OGE) for 2026, which will run until November 24, when the final global vote on the document should be held.
The OGE for 2026 has a value of 2.29 billion dollars (1.99 billion euros) and, according to Xanana Gusmão, there is a guiding principle underlying the spending of each dollar, which involves understanding whether the money will help a Timorese family to live better. “It is a national imperative to provide hope to our young people in their country, without them having to look for a future abroad”, stated the prime minister, highlighting that the OGE will support productive sectors that can grow quickly and hire on a large scale.
The 2026 OGE foresees an investment of 194.1 million euros in the Roads and Bridges program, 22.4 million for water and sanitation programs, 120.5 million euros for the electrical sector program, 40.3 million euros for the airport area, 37.7 million euros for agriculture and 32.3 million euros for decentralization.
In relation to creating stability through prudent fiscal management, the Timorese leader recalled that the Petroleum Fund, which finances most of the OGE, could be exhausted in the next decade and that, therefore, it is necessary to “expand internal revenues” without crushing taxpayers. “We must grow our private sector and broaden our tax base so that, in the future, a greater part of our budget is financed by prosperous Timorese companies and workers instead of by oil money”, highlighted Xanana Gusmão.
To this end, OGE 2026 plans to capitalize on the country's oil and mineral wealth with an investment of 168.9 million euros for crucial investments, according to the prime minister, in the Tasi Mane project, Greater Sunrise and the Bayu-Udan transition.
The 2026 OGE also foresees an expenditure of 158.1 million euros in the education sector, 120.3 million euros in health, 47 million euros in the social protection and inclusion sector, 11.1 million euros for professional training and 27.9 million euros to support the private sector, especially small and medium-sized companies and cooperatives. “We are investing in a healthier, more capable and fair society, fundamental conditions for the social and economic base of a developing country”, said Xanana Gusmão.
To build capable institutions, the Prime Minister highlighted the investment of 5.4 million euros for the management of human resources for a professional and responsible public administration. “I can only say that the Government will continue to implement structural reforms in the management of public finances, towards the modernization and transparency of the State's financial administration”, said Xanana Gusmão.
In his speech, the Timorese leader stated that “social cohesion is not just a promise”, but the basis of everything the Government is trying to build. “In a Government under my responsibility, I cannot fail to defend social inclusion and income redistribution in a country that would be nothing today without the sacrifices of the entire population”, he added.
