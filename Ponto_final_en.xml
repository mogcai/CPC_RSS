Among these cases, 15 constructions were illegal and existed on the terrace of a building.
In a statement, DSSCU explains that, after receiving the demolition order issued by DSSCU, interested parties requested voluntary demolition and carried out the works within the same deadline, in order to restore the terrace in accordance with the project. The Macao SAR Government applauds the cooperation of citizens in the enforcement of the law and considers that this cooperation not only safeguards the safety in the use of buildings, but also avoids the worsening of sanctions and the payment of expenses arising from the demolition of illegal works carried out by the Administration.
Noting that last year, efforts began to be made to jointly deal with illegal works, the DSSCU reiterates that “illegal works affect the structural safety of the building and calls on citizens to cooperate with the Government in the continuous elimination of them, join efforts in dealing with illegal constructions, in order to jointly safeguard the safety of buildings and create a good living environment”. “In order to encourage offenders to cooperate with the Government in the execution of the law, if the requirements are met, the law provides for measures to reduce or exempt fines for those who carry out the respective voluntary demolition”, reads the note.</description><pubDate>2026-01-18 23:09:02</pubDate></item><item><title>Liu Xianfa ends term as MNE commissioner in Macau</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2026/01/18/liu-xianfa-termina-mandato-de-comissario-do-mne-em-macau/</link><description>Liu Xianfa concluded his term as commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MNE) of China in the Macao SAR after five years of service in Macau, and returned to Beijing on January 15 with his wife Li Ping. According to a note published by the MNE Commissioner in Macau, during his farewell visits, Liu Xianfa met with Sam Hou Fai, Chief Executive; Edmund Ho, vice-chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC); Chui Sai On and Ho Iat Seng, former Chief Executives; as well as the main heads of the Macao SAR's legislative and judicial bodies.
Liu thanked the Government of Macau and all sectors of society for supporting the work of the MNE Commissioner, stating that it was an honor to participate in a series of significant events and celebrations in the region, witnessing new developments in the territory. He said he believes that Macau will achieve “an even brighter future” with the leadership of the Central Government and the “robust support of the people of the country”.
Sam Hou Fai and Edmund Ho, in turn, praised Liu Xianfa's work for his efforts in "actively promoting Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy", resolutely defending national security and supporting the SAR in expanding external exchanges and cooperation. They added that Macau will take advantage of its “unique advantages” to deepen economic, commercial, cultural and educational exchanges and cooperation with Portuguese-speaking countries and neighboring countries, serving integration and national development.
Born in 1963 in Qingdao, Shandong Province, Liu Xianfa holds a PhD in Management Science and a master's degree in Petroleum Refining. He held several positions in the management of state oil companies, namely SINOPEC and also served in national departments in the Resources area. He began his diplomatic career in 2011 as vice consul in Los Angeles, in the United States, and began working, between 2012 and 2013, as consul general of the PRC Consulate in Lagos, Nigeria.
From 2013 to 2018, Liu served as China's ambassador to Kenya, while also serving as permanent representative to the United Nations Environment Program and Permanent Representative to the United Nations Human Settlements Program.

Although the number of injuries and fatal accidents has decreased annually, irregularities committed by taxi drivers have soared: 1,898 infractions were recorded during this period, 118.16% more than in 2024.

In 2025, there were 14,638 road accidents, a drop of 5.62% compared to the 15,510 accidents in 2024. The data was published on the social media of the Public Security Police Corps (CPSP), which also highlights the drop in the number of injuries and fatalities.
According to information provided by the authorities, the most common causes of road accidents in Macau over the past year were “failure to maintain a safe distance” (responsible for 3,087 cases, 2.59% less than in 2024), “failure to control vehicle speed” (2,024, 1.27% less) and “reckless turns” (1,829 cases, 3.44% more).
As for the number of injuries, there was a small increase of 0.68% to 4,578, 31 more people than in 2024. There were also four fatal accidents in the second half of the year, responsible for seven deaths. The first fatal accident, at the beginning of August, involved a light vehicle and resulted in the death of four young people. The remaining three accidents of the year all occurred in December, in a period of just nine days, with all of the victims driving motorcycles.
Even so, the number of fatalities on Macau's roads in 2025 was 20% lower than last year, when there were five accidents with five fatalities. “The number of fatal accidents remained in the single digits, indicating that traffic safety is, in general, at a satisfactory level”, highlights the CPSP in the message published on social media.
However, the authorities appeal to the population to pay extra attention to road conditions, the daily weather situation and traffic signs on Macau's roads. They also mention having promoted road safety in Macau through awareness campaigns and “proactive inspection operations”, particularly incidents “around restaurants and bars” and during “holidays and important events”.
On these occasions, explains the CPSP, “random roadblocks are set up on the main roads and near border crossings to intercept vehicles and carry out alcohol tests on drivers, thus reinforcing repression and deterrence against driving under the influence of alcohol”.
The data now revealed indicates that the awareness and inspection campaigns have had an effect, with a 17.06% drop in the number of drunk driving crimes: 141, 29 less compared to 2024. Within this number, 86 cases (23.21% less) corresponded to drivers who were caught driving drunk - that is, with a blood alcohol level equal to or greater than 1.2 grams per liter – and 55 cases (minus 5.17%) were related to drivers who reported blood alcohol levels between 0.5 and 0.8 grams per liter.
The failure rate in alcohol tests also fell by 27.21% compared to last year. In 2025, 30 out of every 10,000 individuals tested had a blood alcohol concentration higher than the permitted limit, while last year the proportion was 42 people out of a total of 10,000.

MORE AND MORE COMPLAINTS AGAINST TAXI DRIVERS

The CPSP message also presents data relating to infractions committed by taxi drivers, which had exponential increases compared to the previous year.
The 1,898 infractions recorded throughout the year (an increase of 118.16%) were divided into different categories: 1,110 violations of queuing order at taxi ranks, 428 refusals to transport passengers, 110 cases of obvious deviations in the route, 52 cases of inappropriate speed, 43 cases of excessive charging, 19 cases of not activating or interrupting the taxi meter, 13 cases of haggling pricing and 123 other unspecified infractions. Violation of the taxi movement order within the ranks was the type of infraction that had the biggest increase: 306.59%.
In view of the multiple “taxi-related complaints” in the last year, the organization reveals that it made 3,247 requests for vehicle data to authorized departments, 142.68% more than in 2024, and reinforced surveillance at taxi ranks close to tourist attractions, border posts and resorts.
In a final section dedicated to offenses committed by pedestrians, the authorities report that they processed 7,651 cases of this type between January and December last year, which represents a slight increase of 2.56% compared to 2024. Here, the authorities acted by reinforcing the monitoring of “high incidence locations” and installing additional safety signs on Avenida de Almeida Ribeiro, Rua do Campo, Rua de Beijing and Avenida do Comendador Ho Yin. As future plans, it is proposed to install physical barriers, such as iron fences, on Rua de São Paulo, Avenida da Cidade Nova, in Taipa, and Rua de Ténis, in Coloane.
Preventing accidents in Macau largely involves educating and raising public awareness regarding road safety. In this sense, the CPSP Traffic Department (DT) organized 128 seminars last year with the participation of 12,218 people – an annual increase of 2.23% in the number of seminars held and 7.06% in the number of participants.</description><pubDate>2026-01-18 23:12:08</pubDate></item><item><title>New association wants to contribute to the study of law in Macau</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2026/01/18/nova-associacao-quer-contribuir-para-estudo-do-direito-em-macau/</link><description>The Association of Legal Studies of Macau and Portugal was created to give life to a mega undertaking, the publication of the annotated Macau Civil Procedure Code, and, later, of works “outside the most popular topics”.

David Sá Machado, a Portuguese lawyer working in Macau, is the ideologue of what will be the first annotated version, published in full, of the Civil Procedure Code of the semi-autonomous Chinese region.
The three volumes, with the contribution of around 60 authors, including “lawyers, magistrates, academic professors, advisors and other jurists from Portugal and Macau”, should see the light of day later this year, the person responsible explains to Lusa, noting that they are in the review phase. “If there are changes to the code planned, we may delay a little”, he adds.
To facilitate the publication of the work, “an added value” that aims to be a “contribution to law in Macau”, the Association of Legal Studies of Macau and Portugal was created. “Other projects will emerge later”, says Lusa Sá Machado, president of the association, indicating the intention of, in the future, organizing “more pedagogical and didactic initiatives”.
Still talking about this project of around three thousand pages and coordinated by two women – Maria José Capelo, associate professor at the Faculty of Law at the University of Coimbra, and Teresa Leong, retired magistrate from Macau – the lawyer notes that it will be produced in Portuguese, although a Chinese version is also planned, as “the target audience is jurists from Macau”. “An annotated code should serve to clarify the reader of the various interpretative meanings of the norms and, perhaps, add something from the point of view of the right to be constituted”, he indicates. “I think it always enriches any legal system”, he adds
Macau has annotated versions of the Civil Code, the Penal Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure, and between 2006 and 2008, the first two volumes of the annotated and commented Code of Civil Procedure were published, authored by Cândida da Silva Antunes Pires and Viriato de Lima. The work, however, remained unfinished, recalls the lawyer.
Sá Machado, also one of the authors, defends the importance of the project: "We are always using Portuguese codes, Portuguese notes. We are left with something of our own."
Still talking about the work, which will be published in Portugal by Edições Almedina – after making “some approaches in Macau, informally” -, the lawyer says that “I would like it to be a reference work”. “Having as many people associated as we do, who have a reputation, who have technical quality, who have a lot to offer, from Macau and Portugal, this is a beautiful project”, he considers.
The president of the new association, who studied at Macau High School in the 1990s and returned to the territory to work in 2017, believes that there is more that can be done locally in terms of legal studies. “With what would be desired for a territory like Macau, where there is a very dynamic functioning of justice, and now there have been several legislative changes, reforms, this part should be encouraged more”, he argues.
The Portuguese notes that it is still the association's intention to dedicate itself to other types of publications in the area of ​​local law, outside of “the most popular topics”, such as “mediation, arbitration and Greater Bay Area”. “Maybe more traditional, classic themes, or even different themes, but trying to avoid these common places”, he says. And he gives examples: “Mechanisms related to evidence, issues related to procedural assumptions, but there are also always current themes that are of interest and that can be mixed with these, such as artificial intelligence, civil liability, biomedicine”.

“The balance between professional and personal life is a key factor in boosting the fertility rate,” Lok Cheng, an academic at the Macau Polytechnic University who studies public policy, told Lusa.
Lok's research, which compares Macau's parenting policies with those of countries such as Germany, Sweden and the United States, supports this conclusion.
Macau recorded the lowest birth rate in the world in 2024 and the lowest number of births in almost 50 years in 2025, said, at the beginning of the year, the deputy director of the Macau public hospital, Tai Wa Hou, quoted by the Chinese language channel of the public broadcaster TDM Macau.
This decline has persisted despite a revised budget approved last year to strengthen social supports, including subsidies for parents with children up to three years old, increases in birth benefits and marriage subsidies.
Macau currently offers 70 days of maternity leave and only five days of paternity leave for workers in the private sector (in the public sector it is 90 days for mothers and five for fathers), recalled the expert: “Less than the 98 days recommended by the International Labor Organization”, she said.
This disparity, argued Lok, reinforces the idea that women have the main responsibility for newborns, which also has an impact on their professional career. “We have tacitly accepted that women have a greater responsibility for caring for newborns, and this is reflected in the workplace,” he continued.
In contrast, the expert, who is also a civil servant, points to European policies. “Sweden has a well-established parental policy and saw an increase in the birth rate in the early 2000s,” he said. “Both Germany and Sweden provide longer maternity leaves and are actively promoting fathers’ participation”, he reinforced.
Lok explained that Sweden offers more than 300 days of shared parental leave, with 90 days reserved exclusively for the father. “Macau currently has no relevant regulations regarding fathers”, noted the academic, suggesting that the region could learn from this model to implement equal parental leave and “promote gender equality in the workplace”.
Such a policy, he said, would help families share childcare and “eliminate gender bias that places women as the main caregivers”. “This prejudice is harmful to women’s professional development”, he assessed.
According to the latest official data from the Macau Women's Database, the average monthly salary of the female population in 2024 was 16,800 patacas, lower than the 19,300 patacas earned by men.
Lok explained that many women are hesitant to have children, fearing increased family duties and career stagnation. But when childcare is shared, “this can increase the desire to have children and reduce the associated costs”.
Such a change would also benefit women professionally, he added. If parental duties were distributed more equally, “companies would be less concerned about gender when hiring women of childbearing age, and women would be able to pursue careers on an equal footing.” Lok acknowledged that it may be a challenge for Macau to adopt a system like Sweden's, but it is necessary to “move forward gradually”. “The first step is to increase maternity leave to 98 days, in accordance with international standards”, he concluded.

At issue is a sign intended to prevent passers-by from entering the area designated for the work, which has errors in both Chinese and Portuguese. The information in Chinese, written in traditional characters, is translatable as “enter silently”, rather than “no entry”. The confusion may be due to the phonetic similarity between “silent” and “forbidden” in Mandarin, although both words sound different in Cantonese.
In Portuguese, the warning appears as “Proibido entr” and, in a following paragraph, “ar”. The information in English, “no entry”, is the only one that appears written without errors.
The image of the sign was shared on social media on Friday morning, where it quickly went viral and sparked a wave of criticism regarding the linguistic inaccuracies found in it. In a statement released the day before yesterday, the Institute for Municipal Affairs (IAM) said it had “investigated the error” and contacted the contractor responsible for the work, who “acknowledged having made and posted the notice without prior verification by IAM”.
The organization guarantees that it “immediately ordered the responsible construction unit to rectify and correct the error”, stressing the obligation that all fences and signs within the construction perimeter be implemented in “strict compliance” with the standards. “The IAM will apply sanctions to the company in question, in accordance with the works contract, and will intensify inspections at all construction sites”, highlights the statement.</description><pubDate>2026-01-18 23:07:30</pubDate></item><item><title>PJ arrests woman who allegedly transported 17 kilos of cannabis flowers to Macau</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2026/01/18/pj-detem-mulher-que-tera-transportado-17-quilos-de-flores-de-canabis-para-macau/</link><description>The Judiciary Police (PJ) seized more than 17 kilos of cannabis flowers at Macau International Airport this Saturday, having detained a Hong Kong woman on suspicion of drug trafficking. According to the investigation, the seized drugs have an estimated value of approximately 17 million patacas.
The 31-year-old woman, who declared herself unemployed, was intercepted at the airport at 10:30 am on Saturday when she arrived on a flight from Southeast Asia, but the PJ did not reveal her exact country of origin. During the police operation, the PJ found 30 packages, wrapped in aluminum foil, of cannabis flowers in the woman's luggage, totaling around 17,311 kilos.
The PJ's preliminary investigation indicates that the woman was hired by an international criminal drug trafficking network, and the cannabis flowers in question were intended to be transported through Macau to other destinations. Authorities will also investigate the aforementioned network and drug destinations, and identify possible accomplices.
The suspect was referred to the Public Prosecutor's Office and could be charged with the crime of illicit trafficking in narcotics and psychotropic substances. The PJ emphasizes that drug trafficking constitutes a serious crime, punishable by a prison sentence of up to 15 years under current law.
The police urge citizens not to risk suffering legal consequences by “getting involved in drug trafficking, nor trusting other people or accepting commissions to transport items of unknown origin to Macau”, can be read in the PJ note. Furthermore, the authorities guarantee that they will intensify their efforts to combat cross-border drug trafficking activities at all border control posts.</description><pubDate>2026-01-18 23:08:26</pubDate></item><item><title>The Legend of “Goodbye, My Concubine” finds a new interpretation at the Cultural Center</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2026/01/18/a-lenda-de-adeus-minha-concubina-encontra-nova-interpretacao-no-centro-cultural/</link><description>The tragic story of loyalty and sacrifice that defines the classical Chinese opera “Farewell, My Concubine” takes on a new dimension. The 1st Season of Chinese Culture Shows presents an immersive theatrical version of the work, with text by Nobel Prize winner Mo Yan and interpretation by the Beijing People's Theater, which invites the public to a sensorial experience of the historical drama.

The legend of Xiang Yu, the self-proclaimed “Hegemonic King of Chu”, and his final sacrifice with Consort Yu, which has populated the imagination of Chinese opera for more than a century, will now be rediscovered in the largest cultural space in the territory. From January 29th to February 1st, the Cultural Center hosts a theatrical production of the Chinese opera classic “Goodbye, My Concubine”, a version that hopes to redefine the relationship between the audience and the stage. This production marks an important moment in the first edition of the Chinese Culture Show Season, an initiative that seeks to present cultural heritage through more contemporary and updated formats for young audiences.
The play, with original text by writer and Nobel Prize winner for Literature Mo Yan, is a reinterpretation of the classic narrative. It deviates from the linear structure of traditional opera to explore, through temporal encounters and intertwined dialogue, the perennial themes of power, survival and responsibility that oppose the figures of Yu Ji and Lü Zhi. The immersively constructed set positions viewers in the heart of the Chu Army camp, seated on cushions and straw benches arranged on multiple levels, transforming them into up-close witnesses to the drama.
This production is brought to the stage by the Beijing People's Theatre, one of the most recognized companies in China, founded in 1952 by playwright Cao Yu. His arrival in Macau is part of a broader program of the Cultural Institute, which includes complementary activities. On January 27th, a dialogue will take place between young actors from Macau and the interior of China with the creators of this highlighted play, which will take place at the Macau Museum of Art. At the same time, enamel jewelry and calligraphy workshops are scheduled for the elderly, on January 31st and February 1st, respectively, allowing a practical experience of elements of traditional Chinese culture.
The classic “Farewell, My Concubine” has its roots in Peking opera, having first been performed in 1918 by Yang Xiaolou and Shang Xiaoyun in Beijing. The story narrates the final moments of Xiang Yu, who, surrounded by the forces of his rival Liu Bang (future founder of the Han Dynasty), finds himself faced with imminent defeat. In an act of desperation and honor, his consort, Yu, decides to share his fate, committing her own final act, with the king's sword, after he refuses to let her die at his side. This narrative of extreme loyalty not only became a pillar of the operatic repertoire, but also inspired other reference works, such as Lilian Lee's novel and the later acclaimed film adaptation made by Chen Kaige, which use the play as a central element of their stories.
Tickets for the immersive theater “Adeus, Minha Concubina” are available at the Enjoy Macao Ticket Office. Macau residents, students, teachers, elderly people and people with disabilities are entitled to a 50% discount on purchase, upon presentation of the respective supporting document.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Timorese public university regrets police action in detaining dean</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2026/01/18/universidade-publica-timorense-lamenta-actuacao-da-policia-na-detencao-de-reitor/</link><description>The National University of Timor-Leste (UNTL) yesterday regretted the actions of the security forces in executing a search and arrest warrant for several directors of that higher education establishment, in Dili, on Monday. “We state with deep sadness that we regret, repudiate and condemn the degrading and violent behavior of the security authorities against the rector and other leaders of UNTL, within the ‘campus’ and elsewhere”, stated Armindo Maia, former director of that public university and former Minister of Education.
Armindo Maia said that the National Police of Timor-Leste, through the National Criminal Investigation Service, executed, on Monday, a warrant from the Dili Judicial Court of First Instance to carry out searches, seizures and the arrest of the outgoing rector of the Timor Lorosa'e National University (UNTL), João Martins, the vice-rector for Administrative and Financial Affairs and the general administrator, including four other directors.
Those university leaders were detained for 72 hours, having been brought to court on Thursday and released yesterday with an Identity and Residence Term and periodic appearances.
The Police of the National Criminal Investigation Service executed the court warrant on suspicion of crimes of document forgery and abuse of power. “According to the universal principle of presumption of innocence, all people have the right to dignified treatment before the law and to the prevention of degrading treatment that violates human dignity, as long as there is no conviction by a court”, highlighted Armindo Maia. The former rector also recalled that, over 25 years, as an academic institution, UNTL has trained more than 30,000 graduates, contributing to the development of Timor-Leste in several areas.</description><pubDate>2026-01-18 23:04:26</pubDate></item><item><title>“Healthy and stable” relations serve the interests of China and Canada, says Xi Jinping</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2026/01/18/relacoes-saudaveis-e-estaveis-serve-interesses-de-china-e-canada-diz-xi-jinping/</link><description>The President of China, Xi Jinping, stated that the development of “healthy and stable” relations with Canada serves the interests of both countries, during a meeting with the Canadian Prime Minister.

Xi met in Beijing with Mark Carney, in what is the first visit by a Canadian head of government to the country in almost a decade and which aims to normalize bilateral relations, which have gone through periods of tension in recent years, due to diplomatic and commercial disputes.
During the meeting, held at the Great Hall of the People, Xi stated that the “healthy and stable development” of relations between China and Canada “corresponds to the common interests of both countries” and contributes to “world peace, stability and prosperity”, according to Chinese state television CCTV.
The Chinese leader highlighted that the previous contact between the two, in October, on the sidelines of a summit in South Korea, began a new phase of rapprochement. Xi called for the construction of “a new type of strategic partnership” capable of putting ties between Beijing and Ottawa on a “sustainable and lasting” trajectory.
Carney thanked the reception and expressed Canada's willingness to work with China “based on good past cooperation”, to develop a strategic relationship adapted to the current international context and promoting “stability, security and prosperity” for both countries and the Pacific region.
The day before, the Canadian Prime Minister met with his Chinese counterpart, Li Qiang. The two discussed topics such as economic cooperation, energy and trade, and witnessed the signing of several agreements in the customs and commercial areas.
According to CCTV, Carney reiterated Canada's interest in strengthening cooperation in supply chains and strategic sectors, as well as its commitment to multilateralism and the international trading system. Li Qiang advocated expanding cooperation in areas such as clean energy, modern agriculture, digital technologies and the aerospace industry.
Also on the sidelines of the visit, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with Canadian Foreign Minister Anita Anand, highlighting the need to eliminate interference and strengthen mutual trust to promote a “stable, solid and healthy” relationship.
Carney's visit is the first by a Canadian prime minister to China since Justin Trudeau's visit in 2017, and takes place in a context of growing instability in international trade, with Ottawa seeking to diversify economic partnerships.
Bilateral relations deteriorated in 2018, when Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of Chinese technology company Huawei, was detained in Canada at the request of the United States. In retaliation, Beijing arrested two Canadian citizens, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, accusing them of espionage, and imposed trade sanctions on Canadian products.
In 2021, the simultaneous release of Meng, Kovrig and Spavor partially eased tensions.
However, in 2023, the Canadian secret services accused China of interfering in the general elections, which led Ottawa to expel a Chinese diplomat, reopening a new cycle of diplomatic friction.

This is the first sentence against Yoon in eight criminal trials.

Yoon Suk-yeol was sentenced on Friday to five years in prison due to the imposition of martial law in December 2024. The most serious charge against him is that of having led a rebellion as a result of the imposition of martial law, a crime whose maximum penalty is death.
The capital's court found the former head of state also guilty of other charges, such as disobeying the authorities' attempts to detain him and falsifying official documents. Just over a year after the declaration of martial law, which triggered a political crisis that led to the dismissal of the conservative leader, Yoon, 65, received a sentence lower than the ten years in prison requested by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
The court found that Yoon excluded ministers from a meeting to discuss preparations for the imposition of martial law, and later obstructed police attempts to detain him. Yoon barricaded himself for weeks in the official residence in Seoul under the protection of bodyguards, even managing to thwart an initial police operation.
The leader was finally detained in January 2025 during a violent operation, which lasted several hours. He became the first sitting South Korean president to be arrested and imprisoned. “Although he had a duty, above all others, to defend the Constitution and the rule of law as president, the defendant, on the contrary, demonstrated an attitude that revealed contempt for the Constitution,” said the presiding judge, Baek Dae-hyun, when handing down the sentence. “The defendant’s guilt is extremely serious,” he added.
On December 3, 2024, Yoon announced on television the imposition of martial law, sending troops to parliament. The conservative reversed the decision hours later, after a sufficient number of deputies managed to enter the parliamentary building and approve the suspension of the decree. Yoon justified martial law, an unprecedented measure in South Korea since the military dictatorships of the 1980s, claiming that the parliament, controlled by the opposition, was blocking the state budget.
In the televised speech, the president stated that he was acting to protect the country from “North Korean communist forces” and “eliminate elements hostile to the State”. Yoon ended up being removed from office by the Constitutional Court last April, which triggered presidential elections, which gave victory to Lee Jae-myung, the left-wing opposition candidate. Yoon Suk-yeol has seven days to appeal.
In the final statement before the court closed the session for deliberation, the deposed president stated that he simply exercised his legal prerogatives as head of state. “This was not a military dictatorship repressing citizens, but rather an effort to safeguard freedom and sovereignty and strengthen the constitutional order,” he said, according to the South Korean public news agency Yonhap.

Currently, weather conditions in Macau continue to be characterized by afternoons with abundant sunlight and mild temperatures, interspersed with relatively cool mornings and evenings. As the temperature range between day and night is “quite significant”, authorities recommend that the population dress “appropriately” and pay attention to the most up-to-date weather information.
However, the weather forecast charts for this week show a sharp drop in maximum and minimum temperatures, especially from Wednesday onwards. On that day, thermometers will fluctuate between 12 and 17 degrees Celsius, dropping the following day to a minimum of 11 degrees and a maximum of 16 degrees Celsius. At the same time, the weather will remain “dry” and marked by “very cloudy skies”, with winds of intensity 4 to 5 on the Beaufort scale.
Temperatures will recover slightly from Friday until Sunday, rising again to minimums between 12 and 16 degrees Celsius and maximums between 18 and 21 degrees Celsius, although there is still “a certain uncertainty regarding the expected level of cooling”.
Meanwhile, a low pressure area formed to the east of the Philippines on January 13th evolved into a tropical storm category – the first of the year and also the first tropical storm to develop in January since Pabuk, in 2019. Named Nokaen, the storm is expected to continue to develop east of the Philippines and maintain a low probability of entering the South China Sea.
Authorities explain that, as sea surface temperatures remain at or above 28 degrees Celsius in some maritime areas of the Northwest Pacific, “there is always the possibility of tropical storms forming” even in the winter months. The occurrence of tropical cyclones in January is, therefore, not “rare”, although their probability of impact is quite low – especially in the southern region of China, influenced by high cold pressures coming from the interior.</description><pubDate>2026-01-18 23:09:05</pubDate></item><item><title>VIP gaming revenue in Macau increased by 24.1% in 2025</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2026/01/18/receitas-do-jogo-vip-em-macau-aumentaram-241-em-2025/</link><description>Revenues from the VIP game rose 24.1% in 2025, according to official data. In the last quarter alone, revenue from big bets increased by 45% compared to the period between October and December 2024, to 20.3 billion patacas.

Revenues from high rollers, a segment known in Macau as VIP gaming, rose 24.1% in 2025, according to official data. The so-called VIP baccarat game reached revenues of MOP68 billion last year, revealed the Gaming Inspection and Coordination Department (DICJ).
In the last quarter alone, revenue from big bets increased by 45% compared to the period between October and December 2024, to 20.3 billion patacas.
However, VIP gaming in Macau remains far from the historic peaks reached before the Covid-19 pandemic. In 2019, baccarat for this segment represented 46.2% of total casino revenues. But in 2025 it was left with a share of 27.5%.
Big bets were affected by the arrest of the leader of the largest VIP betting company in the world, in November 2021. The former executive director of Suncity Alvin Chau was sentenced, in January 2023, to 18 years in prison, in a case that saw the number of gambling promoter licenses issued in Macau drop from 85 to 18.
According to data from the DICJ, the number of licenses has been recovering and reached 30 at the end of July, a number that remained the same in the most recent update, on December 15th. Even so, it remains below the maximum limit set by the Government, which is 50.
Revenues from the most popular game in Macau, baccarat in the so-called mass market, also increased by 3.4% in 2025, to 137.9 billion patacas.
Mass baccarat represented 57.7% of total casino revenue in the territory last year, being by far the most popular game of chance among Chinese gamblers.
Gaming machine revenue increased by 7.3% compared to 2024, to MOP13.9 billion.
In 2025, Macau's casinos recorded total revenue of 247.4 billion patacas, an increase of 9.1%. The Macau Government had forecast, in the initial budget for 2025, gaming revenue of 240 billion patacas, which would represent an increase of 6% compared to the previous year. But, on June 11, the territory's parliament approved a new budget, proposed by the executive, which reduced the forecast for public revenue by 4.56 billion patacas.
The Secretary for Economy and Finance, Tai Kin Ip, admitted to deputies that the cut was due to the fact that the game's gross revenues in the first quarter of 2025 were “slightly below expectations”.

A source from the Ministry of Transport had previously said that there were eight crew members and three passengers on board.

Indonesian authorities announced yesterday that they found a fuselage that “is suspected to be” of the plane that lost contact on Saturday with the air control tower in the central-eastern region of the archipelago, with 10 people on board.
"We received information (..) that a small fragment of debris was seen from an aircraft window. At 07:49, we found a fuselage suspected to be from the aircraft", said Andi Sultan, from the Makassar division of the National Search and Rescue Agency (Basarnas), in a video released by the entity.
The plane, an ATR 42-500, departed Yogyakarta, western Indonesia, on Saturday, and was scheduled to land at Sultan Hasanuddin International Airport, in Makassar, central-east of the country, when Air Traffic Control (ATC) “lost communication with the aircraft”, which was carrying seven crew members and three passengers, the Indonesian General Directorate of Air Transport explained in a statement. A source from the Ministry of Transport had previously said that there were eight crew members and three passengers on board.
The search for the plane, which involved hundreds of people, resumed yesterday at 6:15 am, Sultan noted, after having been suspended overnight “due to cloudy skies”, as explained by Basarnas director Mohammad Syafii.
The search area covers the mountains of Bantimurung, in Maros, part of South Celebes, a province located east of the island of Borneo, famous for tropical forests.
The aircraft, operated by local airline Indonesia Air Transport, had been chartered by the Ministry of Fisheries, which is responsible for monitoring air resources, and three ministry employees were on board, according to authorities.
The chronology released by the General Directorate of Air Transport details that Makassar Air Traffic Control asked the aircraft to approach a runway at Sultan Hasanuddin Airport. Detecting that the plane “was not on the correct approach trajectory”, control asked the crew to correct its position. After the instructions, “communication with the aircraft was lost”, for reasons still unknown.
The weather conditions at that time were partially cloudy skies in the surrounding area, with visibility of approximately eight kilometers.

However, ambulance services remain excluded, given that many emergency services at the hospital “are still under development”, explained Lei Wai Seng, deputy director of the institution.
The operation of the Ilhas Emergency Station will be transferred to Hospital das Ilhas by the end of this month, after more than a year since the opening of this medical institution in Coloane. The Emergency Department, which is located on the ground floor of the General Hospital Building of the Islands Health Care Complex – Macau Medical Center of Peking Union Medical College Hospital, currently operates under the management of the Health Services.
Lei Wai Seng, deputy director of Hospital das Ilhas, indicated that the institution is ready to assume responsibility for the operation of the Emergency Room, having completed the preparatory work, including the recruitment and training of staff and system transition, which took six months.
Speaking to Radio Macau in Chinese, Lei Wai Seng highlighted that emergency services will maintain the current operating model. In other words, they will not provide ambulance services, since “many of the Hospital's emergency services are still under development”, said the person in charge.
In this case, if residents need to call an ambulance from the Fire Department for emergency services, they will also be transported to the Emergency Department of Centro Hospitalar Conde de São Januário or Hospital Kiang Wu, located on the Macau Peninsula.
The post will therefore continue to provide only emergency external consultation services. "For certain services such as major surgical operations, or for critical conditions and intensive care, such as heart disease and stroke, which require a green channel for immediate treatment, we are not yet fully able to launch the services. Therefore, we will not respond to ambulance services for the time being, and we ask for the public's understanding," the doctor also stressed.
On the other hand, Lei Wai Seng highlighted that Hospital das Ilhas continues to recruit staff in response to the healthcare needs of residents and the future development of the medical sector.
The Hospital now has 710 employees and expects the number to rise to 900 by the end of this year. According to the official, the planned expansion of the team will focus on healthcare professionals, including nurses, doctors and clinical technicians. The institution also intends to reach a total of 1,200 employees by the end of next year.
Lei Wai Seng assured that the hiring of professionals will give priority to local residents, but added that specialist doctors or technical personnel from abroad may be recruited at the “opportune time”.
Admitting difficulties in recruiting specialist doctors, Lei Wai Seng pointed out that the Hospital has been hiring doctors from the interior of China, at the same time as it is dedicated to training young doctors from Macau, in the hope that these local professionals can start working in specialties after six years of medical residency training.</description><pubDate>2026-01-18 23:16:05</pubDate></item><item><title>Working group for the Portuguese sidewalk is a “determining impulse”, says association</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2026/01/18/grupo-de-trabalho-para-a-calcada-portuguesa-e-impulso-determinante-diz-associacao/</link><description>The president of the Associação Calçada Portuguesa, António Proa, stated that the creation of a working group for this traditional art “is a decisive impulse in the valorization” of historical heritage and a profession at risk of disappearing.

“This initiative comes at an opportune time and demonstrates the Government's commitment to protecting a symbol of culture and national identity that also has international recognition”, said the person in charge, contacted by the Lusa agency.
The Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports announced the creation of a working group for Calçada Portuguesa with the aim of studying the situation of this professional and artistic practice and proposing measures that enhance it.
António Proa highlighted that the announcement comes “at a time when the candidacy proposal for the art and know-how of Portuguese pavement is being considered by the National Commission of UNESCO” (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization), submitted by the association in March 2025.
"The Government is preparing to create a Working Group for the Valorization of Cobblestone Makers and Portuguese Sidewalks. The initiative aims to protect, dignify and ensure the continuity of this intangible cultural heritage that is unique in the world and a candidate for classification by UNESCO as Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity", an official source from the ministry of Margarida Balseiro Lopes told Lusa.
For António Proa, measures to enhance and protect Portuguese pavement “will be essential to prevent the extinction of the profession that is at risk in most of the 300 municipalities where it is represented” in the country. “From the survey we carried out, the shortage can be seen in all municipalities, where it is worrying to conclude that the average age of these professionals is between 55 and 60 years old”, he told Lusa.
The main reasons for the decline of this ancient traditional craft – but which emerged as a specific technique in the first half of the 19th century, in Lisbon – is the advanced age of the master pavers and the lack of apprentices, who were little attracted by the hardness of the work, low pay and some associated social stigma.
The president of the association hopes that “it will no longer be a working group to be created, but that it will have an effective result, as the Government has announced a period of six months to present a report on legislative measures that must be taken to preserve something that is, after all, public art beneath our feet”.
According to the Government, “this group's mission will be to analyze the reality of cobblers, present concrete proposals and make legislative recommendations that ensure the safeguarding, valorization and sustainability of the profession and Portuguese Calçada”.
António Proa argues that “it is very important to involve the professionals themselves, the main players in the survival of this art, and the local authorities, due to their competences in the territories, as this must be a national cause”.
Registered in the national inventory of Intangible Cultural Heritage since 2021 and in need of urgent safeguarding, as proposed by the Associação da Calçada Portuguesa, this practice was the target of a resolution from the Assembly of the Republic, in 2018, which recommended the adoption by the Government, “in partnership with local authorities, [of] conservation policies for Portuguese pavement that minimize its degradation, without prejudice to the incorporation of materials that improve its mobility, grip and comfort, both in historic areas and in areas recent”. “Concrete measures are also needed to affirm this heritage as a strategic asset for the affirmation of Portuguese culture in the world”, reinforced the person in charge.
The UNESCO application (in its acronym in English) submitted to the National Commission involves the Associação da Calçada Portuguesa, with more than 50 pavers, the collaboration of eight municipalities – Braga, Estremoz, Faro, Funchal, Lisbon, Ponta Delgada, Porto de Mós and Setúbal -, and the support of more than 20 public and private national institutions.
The working group will be formed by representatives appointed by the Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports and the Ministry of Labor, Solidarity and Social Security, with a period of six months to present a final report, counting from the entry into force of the Government order.
In addition to Portugal, the Portuguese sidewalk is present in places in Spain, Gibraltar, Belgium, Czechia, China, with particular incidence in the territory of Macau, Malaysia, Timor-Leste, Angola, Mozambique, South Africa, Brazil, the United States and Canada.
