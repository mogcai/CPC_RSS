According to information from the Chinese Customs Service, between January and November the Portuguese-speaking bloc sold goods worth US$80.5 billion to the Chinese market. According to the data, gathered by the Forum for Economic and Commercial Cooperation between China and Portuguese-speaking Countries (Macau Forum) and released on Tuesday, this is the lowest value for the first 11 months of a year since 2020, at the beginning of the covid-19 pandemic. The decline was mainly due to Brazil – by far the largest Portuguese-speaking supplier in the Chinese market – whose sales fell 2.7% to US$105.4 billion. Furthermore, the second largest Chinese trading partner in the Portuguese-speaking bloc, Angola, saw exports decrease by 10.8%, to US$14.4 billion.
Sales of goods from Portugal to China decreased by 7.7% to US$2.66 billion. Six of the nine Portuguese-speaking countries saw their exports to the Chinese market fall. Mozambique's sales to the Chinese market fell 8.7%, to US$1.48 billion, while Equatorial Guinea's exports fell 27%, to US$710.2 million. Cape Verde's shipments to China decreased by 38.9%, although the country only sold around eight thousand dollars worth of goods. The biggest exception was Timor-Leste, whose sales soared, from just 636 thousand dollars in the first 11 months of 2024 to 27 million dollars in the same period last year. Exports from São Tomé and Príncipe more than tripled, reaching 54 thousand dollars, while sales from Guinea-Bissau went from one thousand dollars to eight thousand dollars. In the opposite direction, Chinese exports to Portuguese-speaking countries had the best start to the year ever, increasing 2.2%, to US$80.5 billion. This is the highest value for the first 11 months of a year since the Macau Forum began presenting these data, in 2013. The data reveals that Brazil continues to be the largest buyer in the Portuguese-speaking bloc, despite imports from China having fallen 1.6% compared to the same period in 2024, to US$65.4 billion. On the contrary, the second on the list, Portugal, purchased goods worth US$6.59 billion from China between January and November, an increase of 19%. Despite selling more and buying less, China continues to record a trade deficit with the Portuguese-speaking bloc, which reached 44.3 billion dollars in the first 11 months of 2025. In total, trade between Portuguese-speaking countries and China reached 205.2 billion dollars, 1.7% less than in the same period last year.</description><pubDate>2026-01-07 23:56:40</pubDate></item><item><title>China accuses US of intimidation after allegedly demanding Caracas to break with Beijing</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2026/01/07/china-acusa-eua-de-intimidacao-apos-alegada-exigencia-a-caracas-para-romper-com-pequim/</link><description>The Chinese Government yesterday considered the alleged United States demand that Venezuela break off economic relations with Beijing as an act of intimidation as a condition for exploring and selling its oil.

When asked at a press conference about the information provided by the North American television channel ABC News, Mao Ning declared that Venezuela “is a sovereign country and enjoys full and permanent sovereignty over its natural resources and all economic activities in its territory”.
According to ABC News, the Administration of US President Donald Trump demanded that Venezuelan interim president Delcy Rodríguez end ties with China, Russia, Iran and Cuba as a precondition for restarting the production and sale of crude oil. Mao described the alleged pressure as a “brazen use of force” and stated that the attempt to condition access to Venezuelan energy resources to a “United States first” logic constitutes a “typical case of intimidation” that “seriously violates international law, seriously infringes on Venezuela’s sovereignty” and “harms the rights of the Venezuelan people.”
The spokesperson also stressed that the “legitimate rights and interests” of China and other countries with economic relations with Venezuela “must be protected”. Mao reiterated that Beijing defends economic cooperation between sovereign states and highlighted that China “has always developed exchanges and cooperation with other countries based on mutual respect, equality and reciprocal benefit”.
The statements come in a context of growing international tension following the capture, on Saturday, of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro by US forces and in the midst of an intense diplomatic debate over the legality of the use of force and control of Venezuela's energy resources.

CNN reported that Maduro and his wife were injured during the capture

Former Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were injured while trying to escape the US forces that captured them on Saturday, CNN reported yesterday. The United States launched an attack against Venezuela on Saturday, having captured the Venezuelan leader, Nicolás Maduro, 63, and his wife, 68, and announced that they will govern the country until the process they classified as a transition of power is completed.
According to the North American television channel CNN, several officials from the Donald Trump Administration held a meeting with congressmen, informing them about the “capture” of the presidential couple and the injuries they may have suffered during the operation. Cilia Flores was injured when she hit her head while fleeing alongside her husband. Maduro and Flores ran and tried to hide behind a heavy steel door inside the residence where they were staying, in Caracas.
 According to the same sources, the United States military involved in the capture (Delta Force) provided first aid outside the presidential complex.
After the operation, Maduro and his wife were transported to New York, United States, and appeared in court on Monday. At the time, the defense lawyer told the judge that Maduro's wife suffered significant injuries. The same lawyer requested a complete physical examination because, he said, “it is believed” that Cilia Flores suffered a fracture or severe bruise to her ribs.
Flores staggered and dropped his head at times during the hearing, and Maduro had difficulty sitting and standing, according to reporters present. The sketches made by the illustrators present in court and who recorded the hearing showed Flores with bandages on his head.
Government officials who briefed deputies described Flores' head injury as minor, unidentified sources told CNN.
Some Delta Force members were also injured during the operation in Caracas, following a shootout with a Cuban quick reaction force positioned near the Venezuelan presidential complex. The US soldiers were hit by bullets and shrapnel and are expected to make a full recovery, authorities reiterated. Maduro and his wife remain detained in New York where they were accused of drug trafficking and declared their innocence.
 
Chinese Communist Party newspaper warns of “serious erosion” of international order

An editorial in a Chinese Communist Party newspaper warned yesterday that the United States military operation, which resulted in the capture of the Venezuelan president, represents a serious erosion of the international order established after World War II. The Global Times denounces the “subversion of fundamental principles of international law”, including sovereign equality, non-interference in the internal affairs of States and the prohibition of the use of force, by allowing “certain countries to unilaterally decide who is guilty, who should be punished and in what way”. “If such practices are tolerated, international law will be reduced to a selectively applied tool, and the collective security mechanism established by the United Nations Charter will be emptied,” reads the editorial. The newspaper emphasizes that the detention and transfer of a sitting head of state, without a clear warrant from the United Nations, is not only a violation of a country's sovereignty, but a direct attack on the predictability and authority of international law. “What is at stake is not just the security of Venezuela, but the future of the international legal order”, writes the English-language newspaper, recalling that several representatives expressed similar concerns at a meeting of the UN Security Council. The Global Times considers that the imposition of force over multilateral rules represents a return to the Hobbesian “state of nature”, where the strong dictate the rules. “The overwhelming majority of countries do not wish to return to an international jungle governed by the law of the strongest”, he states. The publication also criticizes what it classifies as “fabricated narratives” by Washington to justify the operation, stating that replacing legal norms with arbitrary political judgments only generates global instability and weakens the multilateral system.

China calls for respect for the UN Charter after US threats over Greenland

Beijing defended yesterday that relations between countries must respect the principles of the United Nations Charter, following statements by the United States about possible military action to take control of Greenland. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a press conference that Beijing's position has been consistent in defending that relations between States should be managed in accordance with the objectives and principles of the UN Charter, without commenting further on the case. The topic arose after Washington once again suggested the possibility of using military means in its strategy to acquire or influence control of Greenland, an issue that has generated opposition from European countries and the Danish government itself, which claim that the territory can only decide its future sovereignly. Mao's statements occur in a context of international tension amplified by the recent US military operation in Venezuela, in which US forces captured the Venezuelan leader, Nicolás Maduro, and which sparked debate about the legality of the use of force and respect for the sovereignty of States. China has intensified calls for respect for international law and state sovereignty following US external actions, stressing that any control of sovereign territory by another country must respect the norms and principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter.</description><pubDate>2026-01-07 23:57:39</pubDate></item><item><title>South Korean leader says he asked Xi Jinping for help to stop Pyongyang</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2026/01/07/lider-da-coreia-do-sul-diz-ter-pedido-ajuda-a-xi-jinping-para-travar-pyongyang/</link><description>South Korean President Lee Jae-myung said yesterday that he had asked his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, for help to stop Pyongyang's nuclear program, suggesting a freeze on that program in exchange for compensation.
"I would like China to play a mediating role in issues related to the Korean peninsula, including the North Korean nuclear program. All of our channels are completely blocked," Lee told Xi.
Lee Jae-myung met his Chinese counterpart in Beijing on Monday, a day after nuclear-armed North Korea launched two ballistic missiles into the Sea of ​​Japan. Lee was the first South Korean leader to visit the Chinese capital in six years.
Addressing journalists in Shanghai at the end of the visit, the South Korean official said he had asked for help from Beijing to bring Pyongyang back to the negotiating table.
According to Lee, the Chinese leader responded by urging Seoul to show patience with the neighboring country, given the deterioration in relations between the two. "And they are right. For a long time, we carried out military actions that North Korea may have perceived as threatening," admitted Lee Jae-myung.
The South Korean leader also presented a plan that includes freezing Pyongyang's nuclear program in exchange for compensation. “The simple fact of stopping at the current level — without additional production of nuclear weapons, without transferring nuclear materials abroad and without additional development of intercontinental ballistic missiles — would already be progress”, he assured. “In the long term, we must not give up on the goal of a denuclearized Korean peninsula,” he added.
The leader also stated that he had asked Beijing to convey this message to Pyongyang and added that “there was a consensus on these points on the part of China”. Algumas horas antes do encontro entre os dois líderes, Pyongyang anunciou ter lançado dois mísseis hipersónicos e preparado as forças nucleares para uma “guerra real.
Former President Yoon's party apologizes for declaring martial law
The leader of the South Korean opposition People Power Party (PPP) yesterday apologized for the declaration of martial law in December 2024 ordered by the then president and leader of the formation, Yoon Suk Yeol. At a press conference at the party headquarters in Seoul, and assuming that the declaration plunged the country into a serious political crisis, Jang Dong Hyeok, also the deputy of the main opposition force in South Korea, stated that the decision “was wrong and constituted an inadequate response to a situation that generated great confusion among the population”. “It caused a lot of suffering to the members of this party and we want to take responsibility, since we were the party in power at that time,” said Jang, quoted by the South Korean news agency Yonhap.

The Chinese Ministry of Commerce justified the measure based on a complaint from the domestic industry, which alleged a 31% drop in the prices of Japanese imports of dichloro silane between 2022 and 2024. “The ‘dumping’ of products imported from Japan has harmed the production and operations of our national industry”, reads the statement.
The decision comes after Beijing banned on Tuesday the export to Japan of goods considered dual-use – with possible civil and military purposes.
Relations between the two countries have deteriorated in recent weeks, after the new Japanese Prime Minister, Sanae Takaichi, suggested that the Japanese Armed Forces could intervene if China took action against Taiwan, which Beijing considers part of its territory.
Tensions rose further on Tuesday when Japanese lawmaker Hei Seki – previously sanctioned by Beijing for “spreading falsehoods” about Taiwan – visited the island and declared Taiwan an independent country. “I came to Taiwan to demonstrate this and tell the world that Taiwan is an independent country,” he said, according to Taiwan’s official news agency, CNA.
Asked about these statements, the spokeswoman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mao Ning, replied: “Hateful words from an insignificant villain do not deserve comment.”
The director for Asia and Oceania Affairs at the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Masaaki Kanai, called on China to lift trade restrictions and classified as “unacceptable” any measure aimed exclusively at Japan and outside international practices. Tokyo, however, has not yet announced retaliation.
However, speculation is growing that China may impose restrictions on the export of rare earths to Japan, similar to what it already did with the United States in the context of the trade war between the two countries.
China has most of the world's production of heavy rare earths, essential for the production of heat-resistant magnets used in the defense and electric vehicle industries.
Although the ministry did not mention new restrictions in this sector, the official China Daily newspaper cited anonymous sources according to which Beijing is considering limiting exports of certain rare metals to Japan – information not independently confirmed.
While relations with Japan worsen, China has sought to strengthen ties with South Korea. South Korean President Lee Jae Myung concluded yesterday a four-day visit to China – his first since taking office in June – during which he met with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, and oversaw the signing of agreements in the areas of technology, trade, transport and environmental protection.
During the visit, 24 export contracts were signed, worth a total of 44 million dollars (around 37.6 million euros), according to the South Korean Ministry of Commerce and Industry.
The Chinese press also noted that, during the New Year holiday, South Korea overtook Japan as the main destination for international flights from mainland China. Beijing has advised against traveling to Japan, claiming that statements by Japanese authorities about Taiwan pose “significant risks” to the safety of Chinese citizens in the country.

The retrospective “Helena Almeida: Somos Aqui – Presença e Resonância” can be visited until April 26th, as well as the parallel exhibition “Resonância – Corpo．Objecto．Reflexão”. The first focuses, chronologically and thematically, on the artist's work, from the first paintings to the final works in which she consolidated themes such as time and the body, constants in her artistic production.
In the “Resonance” section, six artists from Macau and the interior of China were invited to interact with the Portuguese artist’s work through works created by them, “opening new dialogues between geographies and generations”, as can be seen in a statement from the organization sent to the newsrooms.
Born in 1934, Helena Almeida began her prolific and multifaceted catalog in the 1960s, exploring the different arts of drawing, painting, photography, sculpture and performance.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Hong Kong leader cancels visit to the US four hours after announcement</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2026/01/07/dirigente-de-hong-kong-cancela-visita-aos-eua-quatro-horas-apos-anuncio/</link><description>Hong Kong's Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry, Sun Dong, canceled, without any explanation, a visit to the United States, four hours after the trip was announced. The secretary would lead the largest delegation ever from Hong Kong to the CES, made up of 61 companies.

Hong Kong's Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry, Sun Dong, canceled, without any explanation, a visit to the United States, four hours after the trip was announced. In a statement released at 12:00 on Tuesday, the government of the Chinese region said that Sun would participate in the Consumer Electronics Show (CES), one of the largest technology and consumer electronics fairs in the world, which is taking place in Las Vegas.
The secretary would lead the largest delegation ever from Hong Kong to the CES, made up of 61 companies, the statement highlighted.
The trip would include a visit to the city of San Francisco, where Sun would visit and “also exchange experiences with local technology companies and a university in the Silicon Valley region”. However, in another statement, published at 4:20 pm, with just one sentence, the Government announced that Sun had canceled his visit to the United States.
The secretary's office told Hong Kong media that the Government is constantly carrying out “dynamic assessments” on the desirability of international travel. “After an assessment, it was decided to cancel the trip,” said a spokesperson for the office.
The Government highlighted that the business delegation will participate in the Las Vegas fair, led by directors from the Hong Kong Trade Promotion Council.
The cancellation of Sun Dong's visit came on the same day that China accused the United States of placing its domestic legislation above international law, in reaction to the detention of the President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, during a US military operation. “The US actions seriously violate international law and the basic norms that govern international relations,” said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning at a press conference in Beijing. “No country can place its internal rules above international law,” insisted Mao, accusing Washington of “ignoring the concerns of the international community” and “arbitrarily trampling on Venezuela’s sovereignty, security and legitimate rights.”
Mao reiterated that Beijing “firmly opposes” the use of force to resolve international disputes, warning that “the abuse of military means only leads to greater crises.” "Large countries, in particular, should not act as if they were the world's police. No state has the right to proclaim itself the arbiter of international law," he added. Lusa</description><pubDate>2026-01-07 23:55:33</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
