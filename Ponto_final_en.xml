Still, the case was referred to the police authorities for the situation to be investigated deeper.
 
On Wednesday, two animal defense associations-Masdaw and Everyone Stray Dogs Macau Volunteer Group (ESDMVG)-denounced an alleged dog poisoning in Taipa's central park. The two organizations announced communicated on their social networks indicating that at least three dogs had been sick after strolling at the mud central park, ending two of them to die.
The associations drew attention to the fact that days before, that park was closed for disinfestation by the Institute for Municipal Affairs (AMI). The groups promised to send the situation to the authorities so that those responsible were brought to court, advising that dog owners avoid that zone.
The AI ​​reacted to the case with a statement released on Wednesday afternoon, which begins by confirming the death of the two dogs. The body says it is "very concerned about the incident", having sent "for prudence and security" to the park to investigate the case. However, "for now, no anomaly has been detected," says the AMI statement.
"We checked with the subcontracted personnel of cleaning, safety and gardening of the park the safety of the regular pest control zones and walking of dogs," says AMI, concluding that "the chemicals used in pest control are the same ones that were used in the past and were not changed." In addition, "relevant work was completed according to the established guidelines and work requirements, and the mouse boxes around the park were not broken."
According to AMI, the insecticide used in the parks is environmentally friendly and acts against a wide range of insects, such as mosquitoes, flies, bed bugs, cockroaches, etc., not toxic to humans or mammals such as dogs.
In addition, rats poison used by AMI has an agent that causes vomiting to humans and mammals such as dogs and cats, for example. The poison "is used by specialized personnel and distributed in closed boxes." Thus, "the possibility of poisoning humans and animals due to inadvertent intake is extremely reduced."
Finally, AMI also underlines that it referred the case to the police authorities to investigate this situation.</description><pubDate>2025-05-02 02:34:06</pubDate></item><item><title>China points to the United States as possible origin of the pandemic</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/05/02/china-aponta-estados-unidos-como-possivel-origem-da-pandemia/</link><description>The Council of State of China has published a white book about the origin of Covid-19 pandemic in which he defends Beijing's transparency and suggests that the virus “may have emerged earlier” in the United States.
 
The publication, released by the Chinese state press, includes two chapters dedicated to China's contributions to the study of the origin of SARS-Cov-2 and the global fighting against pandemic, and a third centered on the US "poorly managed" response to health crisis, especially in the early months.
The pandemic outbreak coincided with Donald Trump's last year of the first term of office, which, after returning to the White House in January, launched an unprecedented global trade war with China as the main target.
Beijing claimed to have cooperated with the World Health Organization (WHO) in the study of the origins of the virus “with a strong sense of global responsibility and transparency” and criticized the United States as “a weak link in global health governance”.
In the document, several studies are mentioned that the hypothesis of the city of Wuhan-where Sars-Cov-2 was initially detected-to have been the origin of the virus, considering “extremely unlikely” that it escaped from a local laboratory.
The Wuhan Virology Institute, established in 1956, is an installation classified with the highest level of biological risk where they are studying, among others, viruses of the same type of SARS-COV-2.
Beijing accused Washington of stigmatizing China, making her an "scapegoat", and "trying to divert attention" by politicizing the issue of the origin of the virus.
In the document, it is claimed that there is evidence of a possible circulation of the virus in the US before its official detection in Wuhan.
These signs include outbreaks of pneumonia and flu in several US states in 2019, cases of lung diseases associated with the use of electronic cigarettes, serological studies by US institutions and documents between 2006 and 2020 in laboratories that handle coronavirus and other pathogens. "An in-depth investigation should be conducted on the origins of the virus in the United States," reads in the white book, which appeals to Washington to "responsible response" to the international community in the face of this "reasonable concern."
The publication comes almost five months after WHO, on the fifth anniversary of the start of the pandemic, renewed the appeal to greater transparency regarding the origin of the disease. "We continue to appeal to China to share data and allow the necessary access to understand the origins of COVID-19. This is a moral and scientific imperative. Without transparency and cooperation between countries, the world will not be prepared for future epidemics and pandemics," the health agency said in a statement.
WHO missions visited China twice in order to investigate the origin of the disease. Experts recognize that all hypotheses remain open, including that of a possible laboratory escape or the hypothesis of a virus transmission to humans from other animal species.

The government announced on Wednesday the creation, together with the interior authorities of China, of a seismic monitoring station, as part of the authorities' plans to reinforce disaster prevention.
"The weather and seismic monitoring network will be optimized, and is foreseen, in collaboration with the competent services in the interior of China, the construction of a seismic monitoring station," said the secretary for public works and transport, by presenting, in the Legislative Assembly (AL), the guardianship line lines for this year.
Raymond Tam justified the new station with the intention of “increasing the capacity for analysis and evaluation in the scope of natural disasters”. The space, in hemicycle, has realized the head of the Directorate of Meteorological and Geophysical Services (SMG), will be located in Hengqin.
"Macao's earthly area is small and population density is very high, so it is difficult to find space for the creation of monitoring stations, and now with the favorable policies with Guangdong province, we have been able to build a joint monitoring station in the cooperation zone [deepened between Guangdong and Macau]," SMG director Leong Weng Kun told the deputies.
The official noted that the space should contribute to "increasing prevention capacity and public knowledge about weather information."
Macao and Zhuhai signed the “comprehensive and deepening cooperation project in the context of meteorology, to reinforce the cooperation and sharing of meteorological detection equipment, computer programs and data sharing, according to a statement released by SMG at that time.
Cooperation is also expected to reinforce the “joint prevention of weather catastrophs alert systems, promote scientific and technological research and the development of artificial intelligence applied to weather activity”.
Macao is often affected between May and November by the passage of Tuffons, being July to September the period in which the highest incidence of tropical storms is recorded. This year, the territory is expected to be affected by between five to eight tropical storms, SMG announced in March.
Tibet and other areas in western China are places where earthquakes often occur due to the proximity of the friction point of the Asian-Indian tectonic plate.
Earlier this year, a 6.8 magnitude earthquake in Tibet, with an epicenter about 85 kilometers from Mount Evereste, killed more than a hundred people, and the authorities registered more than 500 replicas. At the time, Chinese President Xi Jinping appealed to reinforce the “earthquake monitoring” and “early alert”. More recently, on March 28, an earthquake in Myanmar, which caused thousands of deadly victims in that country, was also felt in China.

In the Legislative Assembly, the secretary also admitted that the light meter will make available the electronic payment means to comply with public expectations.
 
The government is conducting a study to plan two additional lines from the light meter that will surround the periphery of the Macau Peninsula, the secretary announced for transport and public works, Raymond Tam, showing confident increase in passengers as the light metro network expands.
Raymond Tam, who was on Wednesday in the plenary of the Legislative Assembly, as part of the debate of the Government Action Lines (LAG), stressed that the government will give priority to the development of the so-called West Line, which will connect, according to the preliminary plan, the Qingmao station to Fai Chi Kei, then passing through the inner port to Barra.
Already another new line of the light metro is expected to extend to the border post of the artificial island of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau bridge, connecting the new landfills and Barra through the outer port. 
The secretary admitted that the light metro network should be updated according to the development of society and, with these two new lines, the Macau Peninsula will have a circular network of the light meter that can connect to the mud through the Barra da Barra.
"I believe that with the increase of lines, there will be a multiplier effect on passengers. The experience of other regions has inspired us that whenever a line is added, the increase in the number of passengers is relatively large.
In this last session of the debate of the first lag of the present government, several deputies questioned Raymond Tam about the service of the light meter, namely the planning of the lines, the maintenance and quality of the current services.
"How is the current situation of operating the slight meter? Good or not? I think residents can see for themselves and already have the answer in their mind. But the government is determined to face difficulties and exceed them. The lightweight metro company is also changing so that the light metro service meets the expectations of residents," he said.
Raymond Tam admitted that the form of payment in the light meter is “short of residents' expectations”, but the public transport operator will work to offer “as soon as possible” and “soon” more payment options.
The secretary explained that the first step is the launch of electronic payment in the light meter and the second is to adjust the discounts for those who change public transport on the same trip. In addition, Raymond Tam has revealed that he will promote the resuming of the light meter service as soon as possible after the occurrence of tufts.</description><pubDate>2025-05-02 02:33:36</pubDate></item><item><title>Bank of Japan reduces growth forecast, but maintains interest rates</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/05/02/banco-do-japao-reduz-previsao-de-crescimento-mas-mantem-taxa-de-juros/</link><description>The Central Bank of Japan has halfwayed the forecast for the country's economy growth for the 2025 fiscal year due to the impact of the commercial war launched by the United States.
In the quarterly report on economic perspectives, Banco do Japan (Boj) reduced expectations for the expansion of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), compared to the previous estimate, published in January, which provided for a 1.1% growth.
The forecast corresponding to the 2025 fiscal year, which began in Japan last April and will end in March 2026. Boj also decided to reduce growth forecast for the fiscal year from 2026 to 0.7%, compared to the estimated 1% in the previous report.
Regarding inflation, the Central Bank now foresees an increase of 2.3% by 2025, 0.2 percentage points above the January forecast and much above the annual goal of 2% established by the institution.
All of this is a consequence of the risks that the Japanese economy faces and the global situation arising from US tariff policies and other countries, according to Boj.
In particular, the Central Bank highlighted the weaknesses that affect the Japanese economy caused by tariff uncertainty, which are reflected in a possible fall in “stable exports and industrial production”.
In this context, Boj expects economic growth to be moderate due to the “slowdown in foreign economies and the decline of companies' profits.” "The introduction of broad tariffs will impact global commercial activity, and increasing uncertainty about these policies, in turn, will have a broad impact on business and family trust worldwide, as well as on financial markets," said the Central Bank.
Boj has decided to keep interest rates unchanged in the midst of the global economic uncertainty generated by the new US tariff policy.
At the end of a two -day meeting, the institution chose to maintain the reference rate at 0.5%, after being last increased it in January.
The Boj Monetary Policy Committee unanimously decided to maintain the strategy and stated that "the Japanese economy recovered moderately, although it has some weaknesses," according to the statement adopted at the end of its meeting.
The decision is in line with the expectations of most analysts, who did not foresee new interest increases in the fourth largest economy in the world after three climbs within 10 months.
To counteract the return of inflation in Japan after two and a half years, Boj began to squeeze the rates in March 2024, after ten years of ultra-compliant monetary policy at which rates remained virtually zero.</description><pubDate>2025-05-02 02:39:11</pubDate></item><item><title>Lilau wide</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/05/02/largo-do-lilau/</link><description>After winding streets, strenuous steep and challenging climbs designed to equilibrium, the reliable and picturesque wide of Lilau appears as elixir to the senses. Considered one of the first residential zones of the Portuguese in the region, Largo is an integral part of the Macao Historic Center, registered on the UNESCO World Heritage List since 2005. Lilau's Largo Toponimo in Chinese to P'ó Cheng Chin Tei (亞 婆 前 前) is relatively recent. Until 1995 the space was known as Bica, a source of Lilau, or simply Lilau, in Chinese Yân T'am Cheng (人 頭 井). Excellent example of fusion of urban and architectural concepts, the Lilau zone is surrounded by colonial buildings with art Deco influence notes, which contrast with buildings of traditional Chinese architecture. Largo refreshes, to this day, in the shadow of three imposing pagoda trees, and the Lilau kiosk serves the population with delicious snacks and comforting drinks. It develops around a natural spring used in colonial time for water supply. Lilau's groundwater was, in a while, the main source of natural water in Macau. 
In the Macaense community it was said that “Baby Water from Lilau, Nadi forgets Macau, Bica from Bica Lô Casa and returns to Macau” in Patuá, local Creole Language, which means “whoever drinks water from Lilau will never forget Macao, who drinks from the spout home and returns to Macao.” 
Whether with a cold, sweet lemon tea enjoyed in the shadow of one of the Largo's trees, or with a wet of lips in the fresh water of the Lilau source, Macau is impossible to forget both those who visit it and those who lived here. So it may never happen never to return to Macau, but "Nadi forgets Macau."</description><pubDate>2025-05-02 02:25:55</pubDate></item><item><title>Trump highlighted in the protests of workers in Asia</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/05/02/trump-em-destaque-nos-protestos-dos-trabalhadores-na-asia/</link><description>Workers throughout Asia yesterday pointed out May 1st with marches and protests that showed the growing discomfort with US President Donald Trump and the fear of global economic instability.

Tadashi Ito, a unionized construction worker, said he was concerned about increasing the prices of imported raw materials. "Everyone is fighting for work, so contracts tend to go where salaries are cheaper," he said, quoted by AP. "We think peace is first. And we hope Trump eradics conflicts and inequalities," he added.
In Taiwan, Government leader William Lai referred to the new tariffs imposed by Trump by promoting a proposal for expenses designed to stabilize the labor market and to support subsistence means. Under a cloudy sky, about 2,500 trade unionists marched in Taipé, representing sectors ranging from fisheries to telecommunications. Protesters warned that Trump fares can cost jobs in Taiwan. "This is why we hope the government can propose plans to protect workers' rights," said trade union leader Carlos Wang. A car sector workers union showed a cut car with a Trump photograph. In Manila, thousands of Philippine workers marched near the presidential palace, where police blocked access with barricades. Protesters demanded higher wages and greater protection from jobs and local companies. In Indonesia, President Prabowo welcomed thousands of workers who applauded him in the Jakarta National Monument Park. "The government Lidero will work to eliminate Indonesia poverty," the crowd told the crowd.

“Macao's land resources are limited. Are there conditions for the development of an Electric Center in Hengqin, so that our Autonomous Electricity Generation function is perfected?”, Asked in the Legislative Assembly (AL), the deputy, during the debate session of the 2025 governing lines, for the transportation and public works paste. "It is necessary to consider the integration of resources," said the deputy elected by direct suffrage.
The discussion at AL about the electric supply was launched by Deputy Ho Ion Sang, recalling the energy blackout that affected several European countries on Monday, especially Portugal and Spain.
One situation, he considered Ho, which "draws attention to the safety of electricity supply in Macao, where more than 90% of electricity is provided inside China."
The deputy recalled the “large interruption” in electric distribution in 2017, due to the passage of the hat, considered the worst typhoon in more than 50 years and caused in Macao ten dead and 240 injured. "Is there a response mechanism or not?" Asked the parliamentarian of the group of deputies elected by indirect suffrage.
The secretary for transport and public works, Raymond Tam, noted that “there are three cables”, originating in the interior of China, “for the transfer of electricity to Macao”, being a room in the plans of the authorities. "The northern, downtown cables and south guarantee the safety and stability of Macao's electricity supply, very highly safe," noted the leader.
The city, added Tam, works to "ensure that, in case of emergency, the stability of Macau's energy transmission can be safeguarded by mobilizing the company of the southern electric network."
During the session, Tam said that the distribution of electricity in Macao still “is insufficient” in an area in the north of the city. "The electrical distribution network in Macau is sufficient ... There is an area where it is insufficient, in the black sand. We are now building an electric distribution substation," he said.</description><pubDate>2025-05-02 02:23:25</pubDate></item><item><title>“In the food industry, we fought with a sword against tanks”</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/05/02/na-industria-alimentar-lutamos-com-uma-espada-contra-tanques/</link><description>Almost two decades since the opening of Don Alfonso restaurants in Macau, Alfonso Iaccarino returns to the region to present the best of Mediterranean cuisine. Despite being one of the most prestigious chefs in both native Italy and worldwide, the Patriarch of the Iaccarino Dynasty does not hide the disdain for 'rakings' (“do not tell me of Michelin stars”) and large corporations (“destroy us the palate”), taking to the end that the secret of their success is the authenticity and respect for the earth.

Less than twenty -four hours after landing in Macao, Alfonso Iaccarino receives the end point at Casa Don Alfonso restaurant, on the third floor of Grand Lisboa Macau. It is still under the effect of 'jet lag', although the symptoms are not obvious: it keeps a constant smile on the face and tells stories about the extensive professional life alternating between Italian and English, illustrating the words with effusive hand gestures. “I speak too much,” he laughs in the end when he has time to say goodbye.
He speaks in due course: his testimonies are rich and dense, proper to someone who grew up in the hotel world and soon discovered what, more than a profession, describes as a “mission” in life. The three generations that preceded him dedicated themselves to hospitality and spread the nickname Iaccarino from the humble origins of Sant'Agata de 'Goti, in the Campania region, to the rest of Italy and finally to the world. Alfonso and his wife, Livia, decided to take a look and make their lives a love letter to the Mediterranean diet with the Don Alfonso 1890 Restaurant, planted on the Amalfitana coast. The first location followed other spaces of name equal around the world, in locations as dispersed as Canada, Portugal or Macao-for now, the only Asian representation on the family map.
The decoration of the namesake restaurant at the Grand Lisbon Palace Resort was signed by Versace, ensuring a sophisticated environment to the "fine-dining" meals. Casa Don Alfonso, at Grand Lisbon Macau, lives up to the name with a more welcoming concept (“no less refined, just more relaxed”, rushes to rectify Francesco Magni, the young chef) and a greater connection to comfort food, such as pizzas made in the huge oven that immediately captures the look when entering the space. The disagreements in the aesthetics and presentation of the two restaurants do not change, however, the one that is the common philosophy of all the Iaccarino family projects: “pure” and organic food, slowly cultivated in soils that respect stations and persist, from firm roots, in a world dominated by multinationals and ‘fast food’ and ultra-processed foods.
“Don't tell me Michelin,” mutters Alfonso, through his teeth, when the conversation inevitably flows into the numerous distinctions he has received over the years - including the long -coveted stars. The patriarch of the family is proud of not fitting into the pre-established molds of the world of high school and resist the hegemony of the "large companies" that denounces several times throughout the conversation with the end point, including those who recurrently make offerings to acquire the family mark. "We are a small company and everything we do, we do it. The space, the team, everything belongs to us. I am very proud of it." Guarantees: Don Alfonso is and always will be a family business, including the family that is acquiring along the way.
The oldest family, beyond the biological, is the woman, Livia Iaccarino. Inseparable friends since children celebrate this year 56 years of a marriage that resulted in two children, Ernesto and Mario, also heirs of family business. Golden wedding has been marked on different continents due to professional commitments, which should never be repeated: “We can finally start to have some time for us,” he sighs now that Ernesto has succeeded his father as the main chef of Don Alfonso restaurants. Some of the dishes Ernesto Iaccarino signs today, such as Mozzarella's Soufflé, come precisely from this joint childhood that parents shared in the hotel kitchen at dawn after the whole team went to sleep. “He cooked and I proved. The obsession of Alfonso of twelve was Soufflés, but I didn't know how to grow them,” says Livia, leafing the various recipe books written by the family between laughs and comments exchanged in Italian with her husband.
Francesco Magni (“one of the two or three people I worked with and who have become as children to me,” confesses Alfonso) approaches and points to some of the dishes that will be available for tasting between May 5 and 31 in both SJM restaurants. Some recipes, such as Aveyron lamb with Morchella mushrooms, “were created four centuries ago - four centuries of work and constant improvement by the following generations,” says Francesco. The great protagonists of the menu will be the classic ingredients of Italian cuisine - tomatoes, cheese, lemon, basil and 'paste' - presented here in a organic version and created under the awareness of the family from flour and seeds to the dish. In a world where palates are “devastated” by foods that fill, put on weight, but do not fulfill their nutritional function, Iaccarino are personally presenting their philosophy of life to Macao. The secret, they say, is simplicity. It all comes down to cultivating their own roots - whether the vegetables and sowing herbs, whether the biological or acquired family over the years.

Chef Alfonso descends from a family that has been in the hotel sector for several generations. Have you always been attracted to the kitchen world, even before you start cooking professionally? 
Yes. I am the fourth generation: it started with my great -grandmother, then my grandfather, my father… and now me. The new generation is my children, Ernesto and Mario, but also the people we work with. Francesco, for example, is like a child to me - does a phenomenal job in the kitchen and keeps everyone happy, both team and customers. In my case, I started cooking by passion. I have always been in love with food and very curious about what surrounded me. And above all, I entered this world because I have a huge respect for the kitchen. I never failed to honor my Mediterranean roots: we always used extra virgin olive oil, fresh vegetables, fish, pasta, pizza… From the beginning, this has always been our Italian tradition.
 
The pizza has a reputation, perhaps unfair, of being an unhealthy food. Do you think pizza can be part of a healthy diet as long as the ingredients are carefully selected?
If it is that frozen supermarket pizza, of course it is not healthy. Our version is different. It's the original, very Italian. It comes directly from our home and is done on time, with organic tomatoes and Mozzarella of our region. The dough is two days to rest and grow naturally without chemicals. When the pizza is good, you can even see the smell… In our restaurant people come in, see the oven, feel the Italian atmosphere, the aroma… The difference is obvious. [Livia: If the pizza is not done like this, then it's just plastic food].
 
Is the Mediterranean diet the healthiest in the world?
The quality of the food relates directly to a long and healthy life. It is essential to consume fruit, vegetables, beans, lentils… the sardines, much appreciated in Portugal. What more? [Livia: Pasta!] That, pasta. American physiologist Ancel Keys spent his life to study this-and had the idea of ​​focusing on this theme precisely when he was on the Amalfitana coast in Don Alfonso.
 
The family has its own Thursday, the “Peraciole”, in the Sorrentina Peninsula, where they cultivate their own fruits and vegetables. And in Macau, where do the ingredients come from?
We have a lot of Italy coming. Initially we tried to produce something in Macau, but it is not easy… we have no land here, not to mention the difference in the weather. In Italy, we live in a very special part of the world: we can cultivate a little of everything, according to the season. I must say that we have recently had some problems due to climate change. Before, we couldn't plant bananas… Now we got it. 20 or 30 years ago, we had to cover the lemons because the winters were very cold… Now there is no need. There are many insects and birds to die - I hope people understand that this will be a serious problem for everyone. For me, the future of food will belong to those who can offer natural foods. Pure food. Right now, we are hostage to big companies and eat what they want to eat, not what we would choose to eat if we had an option. If we go to a European supermarket, we see that there is a single large company to sell what you want without choosing. Imagine, for example, that they are selling meat originating in Kenya. If we want to eat meat from New Zealand, we don't find it - we only find what they offer. On top of that, meat is injected with hormones so that animals grow as soon as possible. However, on television, ads go to giant brands like Pizza Hut, who only destroy us… Customers who visit Don Alfonso sleep well, feel good, and advise friends to do the same-but it's a change that takes time. I have been fighting against it for 40 years, but it is like fighting a sword against tanks. This is also why we like to work with SJM: they put the quality of food above all. It's not like the other large American or European companies, where at the end of the month it only matters the money. Here we are free to choose the best. In addition, we are pleased to work with Chinese - they are working, responsible and faithful people.
 
Is that why chose Macau for the first restaurant in Asia?
In part, but it was a combination of factors. 40 years ago, I came to Hong Kong with Livia. We were curious to find out the history of the region, because we knew that Italian Jesuits had been sent by the Portuguese to spread the Christian faith. We ended up or two nights in Macau to discover the culture and found something very different from the interior of China: an authentic mix, from architecture to the supply of food. Twenty years later, a gentleman [Stanley Ho] enters our restaurant and tells us that he's doing a 'tour' for Italy about a new hotel that will open in Macao. Ask me if I would like to open a space in Macau-I answer yes, without hesitation. We ended up being the first hotel to open in Greater Lisbon, 18 years ago, when everything else was under construction. At first it was difficult to find ingredients, but today it is possible to import everywhere: Italy, Australia, New Zealand, Japan… In Macau, there is a little of everything.
 
What were the main changes in the world of cuisine, since its route started? How does tradition balance with modernity?
I think intelligent chefs use new technologies without dismissing the old tradition. It is impossible to have a great future if we have no respect for the past. Technology, of course, has made our work easier… it was all so difficult in the kitchen, in the old days. We started with heavy oil, then light oil, then gas, and now we have the induction. The technology eventually facilitated a job that was quite hard, without compromising quality.
 
Speaking again in the past: He mentioned, over the years, that the idea of ​​opening a restaurant with his wife was not well accepted among the family, that he preferred to continue only to manage the hotel. How did they fight for this dream?
I was studying hotel management, but my true passion was the food. I must say that I was a little self -taught - I never worked with big chefs, although my family had experience in the area.
Livia: Don Alfonso was the restaurant of our dreams. Our vision; our obsession. We decided to renounce the family hotel and dedicate ourselves to the mission of recovering the gastronomic biodiversity of southern Italy. 50 years ago, it was all horrible. The mass was scarce, the tomato was hybrid… After the war came the multinationals, which offered enough food at low prices and equally low quality. We said, "No, this is not our food. Our food is our family, our grandparents." We started this adventure of biological agriculture in 1985, when no one has talked about food purity. When we made the decision, my father called four times in a row saying, "My daughter, you went crazy. It's fantastic what they want to do, but we have customers to serve at the hotel. Don Afonso is just an adventure. Go back to the hotel, we have all our lives here." I answered, "Papa, don't pieces me. This is my mission." My father continued to call me and insist, but ended up being proud over the years. One day he called me again and said, "I believe in you, daughter. I'm sure you're very intelligent, just like me. [Laughs]." But it is true, it was really an adventure we started without anyone's support. We were alone in this. We invested in Thursday and regained every inch of land, then abandoned: we started with the cows, to control the fertilizers, and then the bees, for natural pollination. This has always been the mission of our life - and now we see that it was all worth it.

The delegation included the Chief Secretary of Administration, Eric Chan Kwok-Ki; The Assistant Secretary of Finance, Michael Wong Wai-Lun; the Secretary of Constitutional Affairs and the Continent, Erick Tsang Kwok-Wai; the Secretary of Trade and Economic Development, Algernon Yau Ying-Wah; Housing Secretary Winnie Ho Wing-Yin; the secretary of Innovation, Technology and Industry, Sun Dong; Secretary of Internal Affairs and Youth, Alice Mak Mei-Kuen; and also the director of the office of the chief executive, Carol Yip Man-Kuen.
The delegation arrived in Hangzhou as the first stop on April 22. John Lee and his employees went to visit a Center for Scientific and Technological Innovation at the University of Zhejiang. In a social networking publication, John Lee said he was impressed by the way the Technology Center facilitated collaboration between industry, educational sector and research. According to Lee, this nexus among industry, education and research sectors can contribute to China's technological advancement - a nexus that can also be learned and reinforced by Raehk.
Lee revealed that about 4,000 Zhejiang University graduates were approved to work at Raehk under the Top Talent Pass regime. Lee participated at a dinner offered by the Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce in Zhejiang, having talked to Hong Kong entrepreneurs who invested and exercised their activities in the region. Lee stated that Raehk companies should show their strengths and help their Zhejiang counterparts to globalize and attract foreign investment, simultaneously promoting high quality development between the two regions. He stressed Hong Kong's unique force as the headquarters of several world -level universities classified among the 100 best in the world, thus promoting a solid Talent Reserve for Hong Kong state -of -the -art investigation. John Lee appealed to the intensification of exchanges and mutual learning in innovation and technology between Hong Kong and Zhejiang, adding that advances in national development will be recorded.
On the second day of the visit, John Lee and his delegation visited UNITEE Robotics, a prominent Chinese robotics company and one of Hangzhou's “Six Little Dragons” (DeepSeek, Game Science, Unite Robotics, Deep Robotics, Brainco and Manycore Tech). He talked to Unite founder Wang Xingxing, and observed the demonstrations of the company's advanced robotic technology, including robotic dogs, humanoid robots and an unprecedented prototype of boxing robot.
Wang Xingxing said Unite, famous for its high -performance economic robots, already has business in Hong Kong and that the company sees more opportunities for cooperation. Wang, 34, was one of the executives of the new technologies that met President Xi Jinping in February 2025. Wang was invited to sit in the front row, facing President XI, and is one of China's youngest high-tech entrepreneurs.
The John Lee delegation later attended the Hong Kong-Zhejiang Cooperation Conference, which signaled the creation of a new cooperation mechanism between the two regions. During the plenary session, the two governments identified thirteen areas of cooperation, covering fifty -one projects. These include finances, aviation and the joint development of the initiative “a track, a route”. Four cooperation agreements were signed, covering housing development, technological innovation, economic and commercial collaboration and the development of youth.
The conference attracted more than six hundred prominent entrepreneurs from the financial sectors, the supply chain, innovation and technology and professional services.
In his speech, Lee stated that the new mechanism had led cooperation between Zhejiang and Raehk to a new level. He added: "We will work together to promote the development of high quality trade using the advantages of Hong Kong as the International Trade Center and multinational supply chain center, along with Zhejiang's strengths in the digital economy." 
John Lee stressed that Hong Kong's unique access to the continent under the "One Country, Two Systems" board makes it the ideal place for Zhejiang investors to diversify their activities, moving away from the US, where risks to foreign investment have increased.
He also added that Hong Kong has a vast experience in international trade, a diverse set of worldwide talent and professional service services, which can and will allow the continent companies to explore emerging markets and overcome the US -led containment efforts against China. Raehk is accelerating the development of emerging industries, such as life and health technologies, AI and Robotics, areas that, according to John Lee, can be developed in constructive collaboration with Zhejiang.
Zhejiang's provincial secretary of the party, Wang Hao, and the deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macau, Zhou Ji, also attended the Hangzhou meeting. Zhou Ji said at the conference that, despite US commercial and tariff pressure, Hong Kong has defended international law, multilateral commercial regulations and separate Customs Statute recognized by the WTO with worldwide recognition. His observations constituted an indirect criticism of the US Jail War, while Raehk maintains the liberal order of international trade.
Michael Wong, Deputy Secretary of Hong Kong Finance, also gave a speech, stating that to minimize risks to US-listed Companies, Hong Kong is willing to welcome and embrace Chinese companies that return to China as a new preferential quotation destination. Hong Kong's commitment to a liberal commercial order can attract Chinese companies originally rated in the US that seek safer refuge.
Wong also added that Hong Kong can take advantage of their global commercial networks to help companies look for markets under the “one track, a route” initiative - an appeal to continent companies that can use Raehk as a trampoline to internationalize, aiming at other bei countries.
Wong referred to the Renminbi Hong Kong Offshore Center, as Raehk manages about 80 percent of Renminbi offshore payments worldwide-a "superconnector" that can play a crucial role between Zhenjiang and the world companies. The commissioner appealed to participants at the conference, highlighting the fact that Hong Kong is the first of the world's four major IPO markets, with funds raised through initial public offers that exceeded $ 87 billion from Hong Kong. Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited has more than one hundred requests for admission to the ongoing quotation, which indicates a strong confidence of companies in the action market. Wong's speech clearly aimed at attracting the investment and quotation of Zhejiang companies in Raehk.
John Lee and his delegation visited an optic company in Ningbo, created by a late Hong Kong businessman, where many Hong Kong entrepreneurs succeeded. In 2024, President XI wrote a letter to Ningbo entrepreneurs in Hong Kong to encourage them to play a more active role in Hong Kong integration in China. 
Lee published on social networks that his visit to Chao Kuang-Piu company highlighted the business spirit of contributing to the modernization of China through industrial development. Specifically, the Chao company produced microscopic equipment and later optical components for use in space. John Lee and his delegation took tea with Ningbo entrepreneurs and explored the possibilities of cooperation between Hong Kong and Zhejiang. It stressed that Raehk serves as a platform for the continent companies to become more globalized.
John Lee concluded the visit of his delegation to Zhejiang with the signing of investment agreements with 12 companies based in Ningbo, ranging from technology aviation and supply chain management. The agreements included partnerships with companies such as Lygend Resources - a Hong Kong -quoted nickel producer, vital for electric vehicle batteries.
John Lee's visit to Zhejiang's province is particularly significant.
Firstly, from a technological point of view, Raehk can learn more from the advanced technological knowledge of Zhenjiang's high-tech companies, reinforcing cooperation, looking for its investment in Hong Kong and attracting them to Raehk quote. In this way, the northern Hong Kong metropolis can and will be developed more effectively as a high-tech center, especially since Xia Baolong, the director of the Hong Kong and Macao Cabinet, visited Hong Kong Park in the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Hetao Innovation Zone. If the director of HKMao attributes great importance to the development of high technology in the North Metropolis, it was sensible and strategic that John Lee and his delegation visited Zhejiang, ensuring their companies' investment and reinforcing mutual collaboration in the coming years.
Secondly, since in February, Xia Baolong expressed her hope that Hong Kong would accelerate her integration into the Great Bay area, such as John Lee's observations after Xia's visit to Shenzhen, the visit to Zhejiang represented a narrower techno-economic integration between Raehk and the continent. The participation of seven main employees in this delegation Zhejiang has no precedents, which illustrates the high degree of importance of the visit.
Third, in the context of the Customs War between the US and China, the visit to Zhejiang can be considered as a joint response from Hong Kong and China to US economic pressure, which means that although China remains inflammadable to climb customs rights, Raehk has an important role in maintaining international order of liberal trade. As such, Raehk can constitute a safety valve for Chinese companies quoted in the stock market or operating in the US and who are considering the hypothesis of withdrawing from the US. Hong Kong represents an ideal location for these continental China companies in terms of finding new markets in BRI countries and quotation in Hong Kong's stock exchanges.
Fourthly, the Chinese government report presented at the National Congress of the People in March stressed that both Hong Kong and Macau should reinforce their "internal connections and external interactions." As such, the visit of the delegation Zhejiang represented the consolidation of “internal connections”, using the rich resources and full support of mainland China in the development of the project “One Country, two systems” of Hong Kong. The aspect of “external interactions” has been underlined in the speeches of John Lee and Michael Wong, as Hong Kong can and will constitute a gateway to greater internationalization of mainland China companies. Therefore, the role of Hong Kong as a traditional window for mainland China companies has not been diminished. On the contrary, this role of gateway to the international world, outside the US orbit, was even reinforced by the US War released by the US against China.
In conclusion, John Lee's visit and his high -level delegation Zhejiang is significant from a technological, economic and political point of view. In technological terms, Raehk can take advantage of the high-tech know-how of Zhejiang companies, ensure its support for Hong Kong's high-tech development in the Northern metropolis and provide them with a super-conqueror to internationalize more over the track and route countries. From an economic point of view, the visit deepens Hong Kong's economic integration with the continent, bringing the purpose of integration beyond the Great Bay area and penetrating more deep into Zhejiang province, where Ningbo entrepreneurs have had a phenomenal success in their business enterprises in Hong Kong. Politically, the US tariff war against China now has an unintentional consequence, namely the acceleration of Hong Kong's faster and deepest integration into mainland China, on the one hand, and the deepening of Raehk's “internal connections” on the other.</description><pubDate>2025-05-02 02:25:47</pubDate></item><item><title>The first 100 days of Trump: chaos, ineptitude and illegality</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/05/02/os-primeiros-100-dias-de-trump-caos-inepcia-e-ilegalidade/</link><description>On Wednesday, April 30, Donald Trump completed his hundredth day in office. Since Franklin D. Roosevelt took office in March 1933, US presidents have been evaluated for their achievements during their first 100 days and as they fulfilled their promises during their presidential campaign. Both Roosevelt and, much later, Barak Obama (January 2009) took office in the midst of a serious economic crisis. Each of them had the discipline, preparation and rigor needed to define a totally new course.  Donald Trump made numerous promises: he would end the wars in Ukraine and Gaza on his first day; would close the US border with Mexico; would lower prices, especially foodstuffs; would improve the American economy; and would adopt fair international trade measures. When we look at the last 100 days, what do we really see and what do these measures increase to the US and the world?
The US and the world are watching Trump Unbound or, as some White House experts call it, "Trump 2.0". Like David Remnick, editor of New Yorker and longtime correspondent, he stated: "Impulsive, self -centered and liar, Trump burned the integrity of his position." Trump stated that he would be "dictator for a day," but aspires to be dictator for four years or for a lifetime. Using a marginal theory, once far right, called “unitary executive branch”, Trump tried to consolidate all power within the executive branch, including all departments, such as the state, defense and justice; And all federal agencies, such as the FBI, Cia, NSA, FDA, FEMA, NIH and CDCs, and hundreds of other acronyms, under their exclusive control to carry out their agenda and be absolutely loyal to it, and only to it.  If fully implemented, the Executive Power, which is supposed to be one of the three co-iguais branches of the United States Government, will dominate by far the other two branches-the Legislative Power (Congress) and the Judicial Power (the Supreme Court and other federal courts), effectively the United States in an electoral autocracy. The vice president, J.D. Vance, stated in X: "Judges (or anyone else) are not allowed to control the legitimate power of the executive." The White House has been aggressively moved to remove the control of expenses to Congress, unilaterally removing funds to entire programs and agencies, even to the Department of Education. Republicans, who control both branches of Congress, have largely responded to these unconstitutional and illegal actions with silence.
In office just over three months ago, Trump has already turned the US inside and international. However, its history is of failure:
 

Trump has alienated almost all America's allies, including US neighbors - Canada and Mexico, the United Kingdom, the European Union, Japan and Korea. He undermined the NATO, the Atlantic Alliance, which has maintained the European order since World War II. Canada held national elections on Monday and the main question was "which Canadian leader can best face Trump and his constant attacks."  Against all predictions, Prime Minister and Banker Mark Carneary won the elections for the current liberal party. Do NATO member countries fear that if any of them are invaded, the US will come to their military aid, as promised in article V of the 1949 NATO Treaty? Trump is selling Ukraine, demanding that the invaded state gives off a territory and significant resources to its invader, Russia. Trump has denounced Ukraine leader Volodymyr Zelensky, while praising Russia leader Vladimir Putin. Under the presidency of Donald Trump, the United States has become the most isolated and hated country of its modern history. Tourists from Canada and Europe are not coming to the United States, causing great difficulties to border communities. Future students fear coming to the US to attend universities.

 

Obedience. Trump made obedience to him and his policies the only qualification for appointment for a position in the US government. This provoked the appointment of incompetents, such as Pete Hegseth to Secretary of Defense; or crazy, such as Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. for Health Secretary, who ended decades of medical investigation. The result of such appointments has been chaos, confusion and errors that cost lives, money and security.

 

Retribution. Trump has committed himself to persecuting his enemies, ups and downs, and did so during these last 100 days. His first act in office, on January 20, was to forgive all 1270 home terrorists and disorders of 6 January for his violent attack on Congress. Among them were people who attacked and hurt police, five of whom died later. Trump told his Justice Department that he is under his firm control to criminally investigate critics, which happened. The Justice Department has been armed in a way that has not been seen since Richard Nixon about half a century ago. The department arrested a judge and is investigating various political opponents. For the first time in decades, the US has political prisoners in their arrests. Others "disappeared".

 

Budget cuts.  Trump sanctioned his benefactor, Mega-Bil "and weird Elon Musk, to dismiss tens of thousands of federal workers in all government agencies because of the so-called" waste, fraud and abuse. " Publicly branding a brilliant gold chainsaw, Musk promised to cut US government trilies. Dispersing some of his young people in his early twenties, he traveled department after department, agency after agency, fired people in critical positions, who maintained nuclear security, assistance in case of disasters, disease control and others. The Musk Agency, DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency - Department of Government Efficiency), has negatively affected programs that Americans - healthy and sick, young and elderly - depend, such as Social Security, Internal Revenue Agency, Veterans Department and Medicid, which deals with the poor and the elderly. In its destruction of USAID (Agency for International Development), Trump and Musk have gone out the foreign aid programs, causing the deaths of thousands of people in Africa and Asia due to hunger, disease and poverty, without any concern or a touch of empathy. Government services are already being negatively affected. Instead of savings trilions, Musk now estimates that their dismissals will save the government $ 150 billion, but compensation to the farewell employees will cost to the government about $ 135 billion. Their cuts and discharges caused a pandemonium in the US and around the world, abruptly putting term to services that save lives. All of this is being done to “pay” the cost of their tax reduction, estimated at $ 4.5 trilions, for the benefit of their billionaires. The high US debt will surely increase. The deficit will explode.

 

Tariffs. Over the past 40 years, Donald Trump has been a big fans of tariffs as a cure for all problems - increasing revenue, restoring old transformative industries and cities, getting a fair deal in international trade, etc. In the “Liberation Day”, on April 2, Trump imposed fares on all territories and nations, ranging from 10% for all, including uninhabited islands, 25% for steel, aluminum and car parts from Canada and Mexico neighbors, up to 145% for all China products.  American customs rights have been currently at its highest point since 1903. The 1930 Smoot-Haw-Hawha-Act Law suspended most of international trade, deepening the great depression. In reaction, most nations decreed customs rights to retaliate, causing a fierce tariff war. For example, China responded with 125% customs rights to American products. Trade between the world's two largest economies is suffering a sudden stop. The ships to the United States returned backwards. Arriving at the port of Los Angeles registered a 35%break. Prices will increase considerably, as the interruption of supply lines will cause the scarcity of numerous common products, which will make the shelves of stores empty. Trump's reaction is to let American children have "two dolls instead of thirty," invoking Maria Antonieta's famous statement: "Let us (the ordinary people) eat cake." Trump's customs rights will probably make Biden's expanding economy last year fall into a deep recession, perhaps even a depression later this year. The US government reported a US GDP decline in the first quarter of 2025, for the first time since the pandemic. The deeply unpopular tariff war is the largest self-inflicted economic wound that any developed nation has committed since the British Brexit about ten years ago. Donald Trump managed to destabilize the world economy in an instant.

 

A war against the institutions. In his effort to consolidate power, to restore dissent and opposition, Donald Trump made war on universities, law firms, media organizations and corporations.  Billionaires like Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg and Tim Cook were the sea-to-lag "kneeling" and promised their financial and political support. Trump used the retention of federal contracts and security authorizations to pressure important law firms to recruit and hire more conservatives, as well as to represent him to him and his pro bono causes. Trump's goal is to prevent his political opponents from receiving the best possible justice, which he received only last year. Trump has used the same tactic of retaining contracts and perhaps tax exemptions to intimidate the leading universities in the United States. It has insisted that the federal government must play a role in hiring and dismissing teachers and staff, admission of undergraduate and postgraduate students, and curriculum analysis, which is equivalent to controlling universities by government. A United States Crown Jewel is being ruined, as scientific, medical and other areas has been interrupted, reversing the gains obtained over decades. Newspapers, television networks, radio and even museums are being instructed to make a positive coverage of Trump and their schedule. Some institutions have given in to the regime's demands - Columbia University, CBS, ABC, Washington Post and Amazon to name a few. Others - Harvard University, several important lawyers (Paul Weiss), the Associated Press - are resisting through the federal courts. The judicial power has been able to lock Trump's dizzying speed to convert the United States into an authoritarian or even fascist country under its absolute control. More than 100 court actions were presented by states, universities, law firms and companies.

 

The US Border. Trump came to power promising to close the US border, preventing illegal migrations and mass deportations of millions of illegal immigrants. Trump attributed to two hardline elements, Tom Holman and the unbalanced Stephen Miller, Positions (Border Czar and Deputy Chief of Staff) so they could manage these tasks. The end of the border and the parking lot of American troops caused illegal border crossings to decrease significantly, but at what cost? Hundreds of immigrants were deported without any legal process. These mass deportations have included three US citizens, including a small child, being treated to metastatic cancer; permanent residents, who have been in the US for years, employed with their families; Foreign students, both undergraduate and graduate, some about to obtain their diplomas; Academic; scientists; and other highly qualified and necessary people who were detained or deported.  Some were deported to their home countries, others for an El Salvador Gulag (a huge inhuman prison and a torture chamber) and others to another third country, possibly Rwanda or Libya. Many have been accused, without evidence or without a fair process, to belong to a feared gang or be supporters of Hamas, based on tattoos, clothing, opinion articles in student newspapers or participation in demonstrations. All of these deportations, arrests and arrests severely restricted the once sacred freedom of expression provided for in the first amendment.

 

Imperial expansion. For the first time in over a hundred years, an American president promoted US territorial expansion. Stated that Canada should become the “fifteen first state”; The US should take hold of the Panama Canal, as well as Granelândia; And expel the 2.4 million Palestinians from Gaza, to convert the "track" into a Trump Resort Hotel. These actions would cause wars, ethnic cleansing, incalculable suffering, deaths and other serious violations of international law.  Trump is returning to a long -discredited policy of imperialism, last seen in the late nineteenth century. 

As a university professor for over 40 years, I would classify Donald Trump with a D or F. he launched the American brand.  Not long ago, people looked at the US like a "city in a hill," as Republican President Ronald Reagan said, or a "light lighthouse" in a world that would otherwise be dark. This America has disappeared, perhaps forever, with Trump's counterrevolution. What we see emerge is a much more cruel, without empathy, corrupt, authoritarian and lawless country.  Trump normalized corruption, enriching him, his family and his friends from day to day. He recently stated: "I direct the country and the world." Donald Trump truly believes that he is invincible-a true superman. The rule of law and decency are other of the victims of current America.
But cracks are emerging. In a recently released CNN poll, only 41% of Americans approve of their work as president, the lowest value of any president after 100 days in office. Two thirds disapprove of their economic policies, which had been Trump's strongest point. The Democratic Party seems to be emerging from its state of shock and paralysis in relation to last November's electoral results, and is now vigorously criticizing Trump, its illegal agenda, their staff and their anti -constitutional policies. As Frederick Douglass, an important social and abolitionist reformer of the nineteenth century, stated: "The limits of tyrants are prescribed by the resistance of those they oppress." Unfortunately, however, the world and the United States have to support more 1365 days of this foolish and dangerous presidency. Will they survive?</description><pubDate>2025-05-02 02:25:51</pubDate></item><item><title>HAC Sá Adventure Field could cost 600 million patacas</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/05/02/campo-de-aventuras-de-hac-sa-podera-custar-600-milhoes-de-patacas/</link><description>The government launched on Wednesday the first phase of the public tender for the Youth Adventure Field of Hac Sá Beach, which foresees that the global budget of the work is between 500 and 600 million Patacas. About two years ago, when the project was presented, the authorities even spoke at a global cost of 1.4 billion patacas, then reached a lower value.
This space will include zones for leisure activities for the general population and an outdoor training base for young people, with a total area of ​​10 hectares, developed by phases the opening work of public tender and construction.
On Wednesday the contest began for the first phase of the adventure field facilities and equipment, while the public tender for the first phase of construction works will open in the third quarter of this year. It is expected that, in the second half of 2026, the public zone to children and the campsite site is open to the public, perspecting the simultaneous conclusion of the works of all construction phases in the fourth quarter of 2027 and the beginning of experimental operation.
An adventure tower, a climbing wall, a zip line, a suspended airline, a set of training network, a low -height swing network, children's cars, a mountain bike circuit, a skateboard, a wargame area, an area of ​​scientific popularization about nature, is an area for aquatic adventure activities, among others.
“Espera-se que, após a conclusão deste Campo de Aventuras, se crie um espaço para as crianças e jovens de Macau, enriquecendo as experiências de aventura tridimensionais em água, terra e ar, para fortalecer a sua condição física e força mental”, diz o IAM em comunicado, acrescentando que o projecto pretende também proporcionar às escolas de Macau “um espaço integrado de treino e aprendizagem, tornando-o uma segunda sala de aula para promover o desenvolvimento integral da saúde física e Mental, including ethics, intelligence, physical condition, team spirit and aesthetics of young people, providing residents of Macao a leisure space for the whole family. ”</description><pubDate>2025-05-02 02:34:54</pubDate></item><item><title>“It is up to us everyone to make the AI ​​positive for humanity,” says expert</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/05/02/cabe-a-nos-todos-fazer-com-que-a-ia-seja-positiva-para-a-humanidade-diz-especialista/</link><description>The mornings of conversations organized by the France-Macau Chamber of Commerce (FMCC), held at Sofitel, have been bringing relevant discussions on topics that affect the current local and global economic situation a month a month. Artificial Intelligence (IA) is at the center of a labor revolution that requires reflections on coexistence between innovation and ethics. Three subject experts have articulated different views on the theme "Artificial Intelligence in the Crossroads: Can innovation and ethics coexist?".
 
"AI is not 'killing' jobs, it is making people more productive and efficient," was one of the considerations of Stéphane Monsallier, founder of the company specializing in strategic solutions through AI, System In Motion, who participated in the last conversation held at Sala Baccara, on the sixth floor of Sofitel Macau at Ponte 16, on Wednesday morning, along with two important figures in the area that acts Macao.
Speakers include Serge Stinckwich, expert at the United Nations International University Programming Technology in Macau (Unu-Iist), which brought a global perspective on AI sustainability and environmental impact. Also present was lawyer Sara Migliorini, who addressed the legal and intellectual property issues related to the use of data and the responsibility of the companies. Stéphane Monsallier, on the other hand, contributed her view on responsible innovation, regulation and the role of companies in building an ethical use of artificial intelligence. 
With the moderation of Jérémy Artan de Saint Martin, a member of the FMCC, the conversation began with his question: How to ensure that the benefits of this new technology are accessible to everyone, without ethical, social and environmental risks are neglected? 
From the use of massive “datasets” (diverse information that is dealt with by an operating system as a unit), to the implications of transparency, responsibility and regulation, the debate has given a series of challenges and opportunities that require a collaborative and informed approach.
"It is essential to promote a more holistic approach, which not only consider ethical aspects, but also the environmental impacts of technology," said Serge Stinckwich regarding the responsibility in the application of these new systems. According to Stinckwich, "the high use of Energy by AI systems has a direct impact on carbon footprint, contributing to climate change, a concern that often goes unnoticed in the discussion of innovation." Thus, it introduced sustainability as a priority in discussing AI solutions, and the need to inform the general public and investors on how to prevent technological advancement compromises the planet's resources and is performed more consciously.
In addition, the issue of regulation turned out to be one of the most complex, as lawyer Sara Miglioorini explained. "Although the existing legislation, such as the General Regulation on European Data Protection (RGPD), has been applied to limit certain AI system operations, there is still a significant gap in AI -specific regulation in many jurisdictions." Miglioni added that "the absence of clear rules can lead to misuse of data, the production of false information - such as the so -called" hallucinations "of great language models, which generate incoherent or invented responses - and to intellectual property -related problems." For example, recent cases of "datasets" containing images or texts protected by copyright ruling in doubts about the legal use of such information in the formation of AI models, raising judicial actions and debates on the limits of intellectual property.
With regard to responsibility, the debate also addressed the issue of transparency and the obligation of companies to be more open as to the operation of their systems. As researcher Serge Stinckwich said: "Encouraging transparency can create an incentive system where organizations, by clearly explain the limitations and risks of their AI products, can escape legal responsibilities under certain circumstances." This concept of shared responsibility was pointed out as fundamental to creating a culture of business ethics, where innovation cannot be an excuse for neglect or carelessness.
However, there is also a legitimate concern that excessive regulation can stifle innovation. This perspective was shared by Stéphane Monsallier, who highlighted “the importance of a self-regulation stance responsible for companies”, arguing that “the experimentation and development of internal skills are essential for ethical AI use”. According to Monsallier, “investment in training and training of professionals is the best strategy to ensure that I will benefit society, without having to create an excessively rigid regulatory structure that can delay progress”.
 
Social and economic impact
 
Another important point discussed was AI's social and economic impact, especially for small and medium -sized SMPs (SMEs). The rapid evolution of technology may seem like an obstacle race, but it also presents an opportunity to create new jobs, such as promoters of Prompt Engineers or AI experts, who can play a key role in adapting to change. 
The discussion also addressed the specific challenges of developing countries, where access to digital infrastructure and the internet is still limited. UN expert Serge Stinckwich stressed that "in regions such as Africa, it is necessary to rethink AI implementation models, including the use of local infrastructure and the development of datasets in local languages, to ensure that technology is inclusive and benefits all communities."
Finally, the debate reflected on the duality of the impact of AI on humanity. Was it the positive or negative AI for humanity? As Sara Miglioni stated, "the question is not whether AI is 'good' or 'bad', but how we use it. It is a collective decision that requires responsibility, transparency and a commitment from all - governments, companies and citizens." He added that "ethics should guide the development and application of AI, promoting a use that prioritizes social well-being, sustainability and human rights."
Closing with the phrase of Stéphane Monsallier, “it is up to us all to make the AI ​​positive for humanity,” ultimately the consensus was that the future of artificial intelligence depends on each of us. As a society, we must assume an active role in the molding of this future, promoting a culture of responsibility and ethics. This joint effort is necessary to ensure that this technology is a force of progress, which contributes to sustainable development, social justice and global well-being, according to the speakers of this debate. After all, artificial intelligence will only be truly beneficial if we all take responsibility to conduct it by an ethical and responsible path.</description><pubDate>2025-05-02 02:23:05</pubDate></item><item><title>Hold on to Hope Gallery inaugurates tomorrow exhibition of art and handwriting</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/05/02/galeria-hold-on-to-hope-inaugura-amanha-exposicao-de-arte-e-caligrafia/</link><description>It is inaugurated tomorrow, at 16h, the exhibition entitled “Our Time Zone-Collective Exhibition of Art and Curative Calligraphy”, at the Hold on To Hope Gallery, which is in the village of Our Lady of Ká-Hó.

According to data from the Public Security Police Corps, released by the Directorate of Services for Labor Affairs, this number represents a growth of almost 3,900 in the last 12 months.
Workers without resident status have increased by almost 31,500 since January 2023, when the end of the Zero Covid policy, which was in force in Macao and mainland China for almost more than three years. This month, the labor coming from abroad, including from mainland China, had fallen to less than 152,000, the lowest number since April 2014.
Since the maximum peak of 196,538, hit in late 2019, at the beginning of the pandemic, and until January 2023, the city lost almost 45,000 non -resident workers, which corresponded to 11.3% of the active population.
The hotel and restoration sector was the one that has hired the most in the last 12 months, earning 3,792 non -resident workers, followed by domestic employees (another 1,688) and real estate activities (plus 1,193).
The hospitality and restoration area had been precisely the most affected by loss of labor during the pandemic, having faced more than 17,600 not resident employees since December 2019.
Macau welcomed, in the first quarter of 2025, 9.86 million visitors, 11.1% more than in the same period of 2024 and the second highest amount ever for a year start.
The economic crisis created by the pandemic led the unemployment rate to reach 4% in the third quarter of 2022, the highest since 2006. But, and despite the number of non -resident workers, the unemployment rate was 1.9% in the first three months of this year.
Macao's economy grew 8.8% in 2024, thanks to the resumption of game and internal demand, according to official data. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) represented 86.4% of the amount recorded in 2019, before the start of the pandemic.</description><pubDate>2025-05-02 02:34:15</pubDate></item><item><title>Former deposed president Yoon Suk-Yeol accused of abuse of power</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/05/02/ex-presidente-deposto-yoon-suk-yeol-acusado-de-abuso-de-poder/</link><description>The South Korean Public Prosecution Service (MP) has announced that it accused former president Yoon Suk-Youol of the crime of “abuse of power” due to the imposition of martial law in December.
 
The MP said in a statement that “later investigations on abuse of power led to this additional accusation” to join the accusation of insurrection, presented in January
South Korean prosecutors reported that they did not request the custody of the former chief of state, which was formally deposed by the Constitutional Court in early April.
On Wednesday, prosecutors broke into Yoon's house in Seoul, as part of a separate investigation into a shaman accused of receiving luxury gifts whose final recipient would be the former first lady Kim Keon-Hee.
According to South Korean public news agency Yonhap, shaman Jeon Seong-BAE will have received a diamond necklace, a luxury and ginseng bag, a popular product in South Korea that can cost thousands of euros.
On April 16, the South Korean police searched the presidential office and the Yoon Presidential Residence complex, as part of an investigation to the “alleged obstruction to the execution of an arrest warrant”. Two days earlier, the former president began to be tried by insurrection, an accusation that may result in a conviction to life imprisonment or even the death penalty.
Yoon refused to have committed any act of insurrection during the attempt to impose martial law in December. "To describe an event that lasted just a few hours, which was not violent, and immediately agree to describe the request for dissolution of the National Assembly as an insurrection ... It seems legally unfounded," Yoon said before the Central Court of Seoul.
The MP accuses Yoon of “wanting to provoke a revolt, with the purpose of overthrowing the constitutional order,” noting that the martial law was prepared in advance and that orders were given to the army to cut electricity and depart the parliament windows.
On the night from December 3 to 4, Yoon imposed the martial law unexpectedly, sending the army to block the parliament, dominated by the opposition. However, a few hours later, a high number of deputies managed to meet to vote for the survey of martial law, in a crisis that caught the country by surprise.
If convicted, Yoon will be the third former president of South Korea to be convicted of insurrection after Chun Doo-Hwan and Roh Tae-Woo in 1996 by a coup d'etat in 1979.
South Korea will hold early presidential elections on June 3. The favorite is Lee Jae-Myung, a candidate for the main opposition movement, the Democratic Party, which, on March 26, was acquitted of a condemnation for corruption linked to an urban development project that threatened it disqualifying it.

Despite the growth, gross revenues are still below government forecasts, which expected a monthly average of 20 billion this year.
 
In April, the casinos operating in Macao appointed a total of 18.8 billion patacas, ie 1.7% more than the 18.5 billion of April last year. According to data released yesterday by the Directorate of Inspection and Game Coordination (DICJ), in April there was a 4% break compared to March this year.
Cumulatively, in the first four months of this year, casinos got gross revenues of about 76.5 billion patacas, more 0.8% than the 75.8 billion from the same period last year.
Despite the annual growth, these amounts are still short of the government expected. In the budget for this year, the authorities put the goal for all this year in the 240 billion Patacas, which would imply that, per month, casinos were an average of 20 billion patacas. So far, however, no month has reached this value. February has been, so far, the best month of this year, with 19.7 billion Patacas.
Recently, both the Chief Executive and the Secretary for the Economics and Finance of MSAR have warned of the possibility that economic indices do not correspond to the budget forecasts for this year. Tai Kin IP said, in the presentation of the government and finance portfolio -government lines, that “the recovery of the Macao Integrated Tourist Industry was softened due to the complexity and volatility of the international situation, along with a major change in the patterns and consumer concepts of visitors and residents”.
It is recalled that tax revenues from the game industry represent more than 80% of all of the MSAR tax revenues. The review of the Game Law, which came into force in 2022, stipulates that the concessionaires of the sector have to pay a direct tax of 35% of their revenues, plus an annual amount of 2% for a public fund and 3% more for urban development, tourism promotion and social security of MSc.
In 2024, gross game revenues ascended to 226.7 billion patacas, according to DICJ data. This figure meant an increase of about 24% compared to the 183 billion of 2023. In the years of pandemic restrictions, 2020, 2021 and 2022, the gross revenues of the casino industry were 60.4 billion, 86.8 billion and 42.2 billion patacas, respectively. Before the pandemic, in 2019, the game sector had revenues of 292.4 billion patacas and in 2018 of 302.8 billion, for example.</description><pubDate>2025-05-02 02:31:38</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
