At the same meeting, the Chief Executive described the Macao Science and Technologies Industrial Park of Research and Development as "an important project to optimize the technological innovation environment and promote the development of the diversification of Macau's economy."

Trade, defense and strategic cooperation should be the main topics on the table.

South Korean President Lee Jae-Myung will meet on 25 August with US counterpart Donald Trump in Washington to discuss topics such as trade, defense and strategic cooperation against North Korea.
The summit occurs after a trade agreement in July, in which Washington agreed to reduce the reciprocal fare from South Korea and extend the same reduced rate to South Korean cars, the country's main export to the United States.
Seoul has also pledged to buy $ 100 billion in US energy and invest $ 350 billion in the United States, and Lee and Trump are expected to discuss the structure and management of this investment package.
The conversations should also address the expansion of cooperation in strategic sectors such as semiconductors, batteries and shipbuilding, yesterday the spokeswoman of the South Korean executive, Kang Yu-Jung.
Lee, a liberal elected in June in an early election to replace the depleted conservative Yoon Suk-Youol, has put the economy at the center of his agenda, seeking to protect the nation, dependent on exports, impacts of Trump's imposed tariffs and their demands, so that allies reduce Washington's dependence and take on greater defense costs.
The meeting takes place in a context of fears in Seoul that the Trump administration can change the alliance of decades, requiring higher payments to the presence of the US 28,500 military personnel in the country and pondering reduced it as the US focuses on containing China.
According to Kang, the two leaders will discuss the reinforcement of the defensive posture against the growing threats of North Korea and the development of bilateral partnership in a “comprehensive strategic alliance oriented to the future, adjusted to changes in global security and economy.
Trump argues that Seoul must pay more for the US military presence. Recent comments from administration officials, such as Defense Undersecretary Elbridge Colby, suggest desire to restructure the alliance, which, experts, may affect the dimension and role of US forces on the peninsula.
In this scenario, Seoul would have to assume greater responsibility in confrontation with North threats, while US forces would focus more on China.
The US forces commander in Korea, General Xavier Brunson, defended last week the need to “modernize” the alliance to respond to the evolving safety environment, including the North Korean nuclear program, the approach of Pyongyang to Moscow and what he classified as Chinese threats to a free and open “Indo-Pacific”.
Asked about a possible reduction in troops, Brunson stressed the importance of capabilities, rather than numbers, pointing out advanced systems such as fifth generation fighters, and defended strategic flexibility, recalling the recent travel of South Korea's Patriot defense systems to the Middle East.
During the first term, Trump suspended a joint military exercises with Seoul while trying to negotiate with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. The two leaders gathered three times between 2018 and 2019, but the conversations collapsed due to divergences about the exchange of sanctions for Pyongyang's concrete steps to dismantle the nuclear and missile program.
Since then, Kim has suspended virtually all diplomacy with Washington and Seoul, accelerating the development of weapons and prioritizing the relationship with Russia, to which he provided weapons and troops to support the war in Ukraine.
The tensions on the peninsula can get worse later this month, when South Korea and the United States perform large-scale joint military exercises as of August 18.
Pyongyang considers these maneuvers an invasion test and usually uses them as a pretext for intensifying military demonstrations and weaponry testing to reinforce the nuclear program.

The Macao Scientific and Cultural Center (CCCM), in Lisbon, will conduct a formation dedicated to this Macaense Portuguese Creole in the Patuá Language Initiation course. Classes start on September 15, in a contact of about two months with a language recognized by UNESCO as a linguistic heritage at risk. In addition, the Center also promotes two other courses that connect the Chinese to Portuguese culture.

The Macau Scientific and Cultural Center (CCCM), in Lisbon, will host the third edition of the Patuá Language Initiation Course, a formation that aims to disseminate and preserve this Portuguese -based Creole, enriched with African, Malao and Chinese influences. The course, which will take place between September 15 and November 27, is intended for the general public from 15 years and will be taught in Portuguese.
With a total of 22 sessions, always on Wednesdays and Fridays, from 10:30 am to 11:30 am, the course will take place at CCCM facilities, at Rua da Junqueira, number 30, in Lisbon. The registration fee is set at 160 euros, and the number of participants will be limited to a minimum of eight and a maximum of 15 people. Entries must be made through the center's electronic address.
The Patuá language, recognized by UNESCO as a minority language, represents an important Macanese cultural legacy. The course was conceived as a set of dynamic classes that intend not only to teach the foundations of this Creole, but also highlight its value as a unique linguistic heritage. The initiative is part of the CCCM mission to promote knowledge and intercultural dialogue between Portugal and Macau.
The training will be conducted by two specialists with distinct but complementary trajectories. Joaquim NG Pereira, born in Macau and son of a Portuguese father and Chinese mother, is a degree in Communication and Culture Sciences and Master in Programming and Cultural Management. His master's dissertation focused on the CCCM Macao Museum, demonstrating his deep connection to the Macanese culture. As a member of the Migration Commission of the Lisbon Geography Society, he has dedicated his efforts to the promotion and dissemination of Patuá.
Raúl Leal Galão, in turn, is a Portuguese researcher with a formation in philosophy and literary sciences, specializing in linguistic studies. Master in Portuguese Language, concentrated his work in the areas of Lexicology, Dialectology and Creo -Linguistics. He is the author of reference works such as the Creole Dictionary of Macau - Adé Writing in Patuá, published in 2019, and studies on lexical aspects in the work of Macanese authors.
In addition to the Patuá course, CCCM promotes other formations that reflect the shared cultural richness between Portugal and Macau. The Chinese Cítara (Gujin) course, starting on September 23, is another opportunity to explore Chinese culture through this traditional instrument. Over eight sessions, always on Saturdays from 5 pm to 6 pm, participants will contact the history of Gujin, from their origins to contemporary development, including the study of tones, guidelines and musical exercises. The course, which costs 80 euros, will be taught in Portuguese and Chinese by Professor Du Wanzhen, expert at Lingnan School, and Ana Cristina Alves, PhD in Philosophy of History and Culture.
Equally relevant is the creative translation course, scheduled to start September 17th. This training, consisting of ten sessions on Thursdays between 16h and 18h, proposes a practical approach to the translation of literary and philosophical texts between Chinese and Portuguese. Based on works by authors such as Li Ba and Lao Zi, participants will work with pedagogical materials developed by Ana Cristina Alves herself, including the manual “Cultures in Dialogue and Chinese-Portuguese translation”. The course, worth 80 euros, also has the guidance of António Graça de Abreu, award -winning Chinese poetry and former teacher in Beijing. Both formations take place at CCCM facilities and are subject to limited vacancies.
Macau's Scientific and Cultural Center has continued its role as a meeting space between cultures and preserving the common heritage, standing out as an extension of Macao in Europe.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Credit Interest Bonus Government Plan received two thousand requests</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/08/13/plano-do-governo-de-bonificacao-de-juros-de-credito-recebeu-dois-mil-pedidos/</link><description>The government launched in April this year the Bank Credit Interest Bonus Plan for Small and Medium Enterprises, which has so far received 2,000 loans.
The information was advanced by the president of the Macao Banks Association, IP Sio Kai. The representative stated that 80% of the applicants first requested loans to banks, and 20% repeated the loan to pay old loans.
IP Sio Kai pointed out that if all current orders are approved, the amount involved will be over 3 billion patacas.
It is recalled that the Bank Credit Interest Bottle Plan has been announced by Economics and Technological Development Services (DSEDT), which offers each Elegable Commercial Entrepreneur (especially small and medium enterprises), a maximum loan of five million patacas, with an interest allowance of 4% for a period of three years.
The plan foresees a total maximum limit of bank loans of 10 billion patacas. In this case, there is even more than half of the limit available for companies to request.
According to information from the bank sector, the two thousand loan claims were mainly submitted by traditional sectors, such as restoration, retail, gross industry and construction, representing more than 70% of the total. The rest are sectors such as health, cutting -edge technology, culture, sport and entertainment.
The application deadline for this plan ends in April next year. According to DSEDT, the initiative aims to provide financial support to commercial entrepreneurs of small and medium enterprises, in order to “mitigate their financing costs” and help them “reinforce the flow of capital and increase their risk resistance”.
In the opinion of IP Sio Kai, traditional sectors, such as restoration and flap, are facing challenges of “abroad fuction” and online shopping, and need time to transform and find new models of commerce, so this plan can play a support role for your business.</description><pubDate>2025-08-13 03:00:37</pubDate></item><item><title>Caeal attentive to irregularities practiced outside the territory</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/08/13/caeal-atenta-a-irregularidades-praticadas-fora-do-territorio/</link><description>The Commission of Electoral Affairs of the Legislative Assembly (Caeal) ensured that it is aware of any irregularities under the electoral campaign practiced both in the territory and abroad.

In the last 2021 elections there were 14 races lists, and in 2017 there were 25 lists.</description><pubDate>2025-08-13 03:07:52</pubDate></item><item><title>Family members are responsible for the vast majority of cases of abuse to children</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/08/13/familiares-sao-responsaveis-pela-grande-maioria-dos-casos-de-maus-tratos-a-criancas/</link><description>The violence practiced by family members constituted the vast majority of cases of abuse to children that the Association to Fight Macao Children followed over the past year. Seven suspicious cases were registered, and the physical treatment and the witness of acts of domestic violence were the main reasons for requests for help.

In the official start of the time for both teams, the "blues and whites" mastery was unequivocal throughout the match, with Pepê, 12 minutes, and Samu, with a 'bis' at 32 and 79, the final result, which could have been wider.
On the sidelines of the game, the honors to the historic captain Portista Jorge Costa, who performed the role of director of football and died last Tuesday, unfolded, through a choreography with posters and a choir of applause to the second minute of the game, reference to the 'jersey 2' that so often weer.
Given a scenario where both teams came up with new coaches, it was hard to predict how the two sets could be presented, even though Francesco Farioli had more changes to the squad, while Luís Pinto's bet resided in continuity.
In the dragon benches it was visible the enthusiasm before a FC Porto renewed for the time that yesterday began, but the first great opportunity belonged to the Vimaranenses, in the first minute, with Tiago Silva, inside the area, to fail the target for very little.
Still, FC Porto surpassed the initial scare and left for a starting start at a very high pace, atypical for the premature phase of the time, and the chances of goal were quickly multiplying, before a victory of Guimarães with difficulties in accompanying.
At 12 minutes, the "dragons" scored the first goal of the season, through a very fast transition that culminated in a note with artistic note, through Pepê, who "stung" the ball over the goalkeeper Charles and thus had a promising start, coming from an admittedly less successful season in individual terms.
From then on, the portists were galvanized and the reinforcement Victor Froholdt, five minutes later, was also close to making a premiere to mark after recovering the ball at midfield and leaving for an individual drag.
After wasting several occasions and seeing a scored goal, Samu signed up his name on the starting marker list, following a short singing kick, which resulted in an accurate crossing of Alberto Costa, to which the Spanish international responded in the best way, with a head to the bottom of the net on the 32 minutes.
Already during the period of compensation of the first half, an initiative of João Mendes could have resulted in goal for the workers, were it not for the decisive cut of Bednarek, who, in official debut for the 'blues and whites', offered a defensive stability absent at many times at the time 2024/25.
The second half was less prolific at chance to mark, with the hosts showing another discernment to manage the advantage, with several approaches to the opposite goal, while visitors were almost nonexistent in the offensive chapter.
Among other opportunities, such as Borja Sainz shortly after the return of the resorts, Samu was coming to 'Bis' and closing the count on 79 minutes in the 'recharge' to a shot of Stephen Eustáquio, defended incompletely by the Vimaranense guardian.
The goalkeeper Charles was yet the main figure of Vitória de Guimarães in what was left of the match, having been fundamental for the result to remain 3-0 until the end.

The initial truce was agreed three months ago in Geneva, leading Washington to reduce from 145% to 30% the tariffs applied to Chinese products, while Beijing lowered from 125% to 10% the rates on US goods.
China yesterday confirmed the extension, for another 90 days, of the truce in the trade war with the United States, following the negotiations held in London and Stockholm in June and July, respectively.
The initial truce was agreed three months ago in Geneva, leading Washington to reduce from 145% to 30% the tariffs applied to Chinese products, while Beijing lowered from 125% to 10% the rates on US goods.
The extension was already the expected result after the last business rounds between the two largest economies in the world.
The day before, the China Ministry of Foreign Affairs called on the United States "efforts" to achieve a "positive result based on equality, respect and mutual benefit."
During Stockholm talks in late July, delegations expressed the desire to maintain dialogue and avoid climbing in the trade war that at the height, even equivalent to a 'de facto' commercial embargo.
The meeting in the Swedish capital followed meetings in Geneva and London, as well as a telephone conversation in June between US President Donald Trump and Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, designed to exceed differences.
At the London meeting, Beijing approved rare land export requests and Washington suspended some "restrictive measures" against China, including chips export controls.
Hours before expanding the truce, Trump urged China to quadruple US soybean purchases, while Washington has, in recent days, to sanction Beijing for the importation of Russian oil in the context of Kremlin refusal to end Ukraine war.
China defended the right to maintain normal trade relations with its partners and rejected US pressure. Trump is expected to meet on Friday at Alaska with Russian President Vladimir Putin, in a meeting considered historical.
Import rates on Chinese products reached 145% in the United States. If the deadline was not extended, US imports from China would have returned to April levels when the tariff war among the world's largest commercial nations was at its peak.
China retaliated increasing tariffs on imports from the United States and suspending rare land exports, ores used by the energy industries, defense, among others, and whose Beijing Supply Chain controls.
In May, the two sides agreed to reciprocately suspend the most rates, after negotiators were first gathered in Geneva, Switzerland.
