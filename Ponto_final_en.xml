Zence Object Holding already has more than 20 active projects in areas such as interior decoration, beverage packaging, among others, which develops with various customers, who are also partners, namely restaurants, hotels and conference centers.
Every year, China produces about 100 tons of tea waste, which end in the trash, according to the China's annual report of China in 2023. On the other hand, the country produces about 200 million tons of plastic waste annually, according to a UN report by 2023.
Zence has seen in the need to “solve global waste problems” an opportunity, seeming perfectly the idea of ​​turning tea waste into recycled ecological materials.
The company founded in 2023, with a capital of six million patacas, expects to reach the return on investment next year and be profitable in 2028. "A ton of tea residues can give rise to ten tons of tea -based bioplastic, flexible and versatile as plastic," the company's co -founder Bob Hou Keung told Lusa.
The same weight of tea residue can make 150 table tops, or cluster panels with size 120x60x1.8cm, which can be used in the “direct replacement of most wood panels”, with the “triple of the hardness of cement”, added the entrepreneur.
About a ton of tea waste per month, coming directly from a tea plantation from Fujian province, one of China's largest tea -producing provinces, is sent to two Zence factories in Guangdong province, the neighboring province of Macao, said Law.
The industrial process integrates technologies of modification of biological -based plastics and mixture of vegetable fibers, biomaterial modification, production and manufacture. "After gathering the tea residues, we process them, sterilize them, we begin to turn them into a grain-shaped tea-based bioplastic, which after melting is shaped by a machine," the businessman explained. Law stressed that tea waste “can be decomposed 100% naturally”, “without formaldehyde” and “carbon neutral”.
A cup of coffee, for example, contains 10% pure tea leaves with vegetable polymers and polyhydroxialcanoates (PHA)-natural biodegradable polymers, “buried in the ground, and can completely decompose within 60 to 90 days,” he said.
The most fragile side of the project has to do with the final cost of biodegradable products, at least for now. The cost of tea -based materials produced by Zence is 30% more expensive than plastic. Keeping the example of coffee cup, "each one costs 100 patacas (12 euros) in the market," he added law. "I hope that tea residues can completely replace plastic in 2030" in the set of products to which Zence is looking, the businessman said, in reference to the date set by the UN in sustainable development goals.
In September 2020, Chinese leader Xi Jinping stated in the general debate of the 75th UN General Assembly that China will adopt more vigorous policies and measures, and strive to reach the peak of carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 and try to achieve carbonic neutrality by 2060.
The set of materials that are being used as biological alternatives to conventional plastics are increasing, such as starch based bioplastics, cellulose materials (wood pulp, cotton, agricultural waste), chitosan (crustaceous carapaces), alginate (brown algae), mycelium -based materials, or casein (milk protein).

Kong Chi Meng, the body's director, said the measure aims to reduce students' distractions during classes and the education sector "favorable" to their implementation. Authorities will also accept requests for subsidy by schools to purchase equipment to store mobile phones.
 
Kong Chi Meng, director of Youth Education and Development Services (DSEDJ), said that will be introduced to the use of mobile phones in schools, whose implementation is scheduled for next school year. The measure, according to the official, aims to restrict the use of mobile devices by students and covers all schools in Macau.
Speaking to the Chinese channel of Radio Macau, Kong Chi Meng pointed out that the body “has already communicated with the educational sector and educational associations” about the measure. "Generally speaking, they are favorable to the guidelines on the control of mobile phone use, such as requiring students to leave mobile phones in a designated place when they return to school," he said.
The DSEDJ director indicated that schools agree that the measure will reduce students' distractions and the “excessive time” of mobile phone use, preventing students from using these devices during classes to see content not related to pedagogical activities.
According to Kong Chi Meng, the places designated for storing mobile phones are specific cliffs and students can raise their mobile phones only after classes. However, if a special situation is verified and the teachers' authorization is allowed, students can use the devices.
About 50 schools are already equipped with the necessary equipment, such as cliffs, for the centralized management of mobile phones, and the DSEDJ will also provide financial support to schools through the Education Fund, for the acquisition of these equipment.
"Each school can have different practices. For schools that have space restrictions and cannot install phones for mobile phones, they can adapt to their conditions to choose a different way of management, such as storing the mobile phone installed on the wall. We do not have a fixed requirement for implementation, and the aim is to prevent students from having mobile phones in their pockets that affect their learning," he said.
Kong Chi Meng added that DSEDJ is negotiating with major telecommunications suppliers to launch student phone plans for students 'healthy use', and some suppliers already provide similar services.
"After joining these plans, mobile phones will automatically filter out the electronic pages with violent, discriminatory and pornographic content in order to provide a healthy internet environment," he explained.
The DSEDJ has resorted to data from an international report to indicate that the use of computer appliances for students for one to two hours is "adequate and satisfies their needs." The body, in this sense, provided previously to schools guidelines on the use of computer equipment and guidelines on the teaching and learning of the internet, serving as a reference during the pedagogical work. In this case, students can use the internet “properly” for an average of an hour a day and take a break after using electronic devices for 20 minutes.</description><pubDate>2025-05-26 07:04:16</pubDate></item><item><title>Convicted in Macao, Joseph Lau sells wines collection for double the estimated value</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/05/26/condenado-em-macau-joseph-lau-vende-coleccao-de-vinhos-por-dobro-do-valor-estimado/</link><description>Hong Kong's tycoon Joseph Lau, convicted of corruption in Macao, reached a milestone in wine collection by selling a selection for eight million euros, twice the estimated value. In an auction of Christie's, who attracted the attention of international experts and enthusiasts, Lau presented 211 lots of high-range wines, including renowned producer rarities Henri Jayer, as well as iconic crops from Petrus and exclusive selections of La Romanée-Connti. Driven by the success of the previous two editions in 2022, the expectation around the auction was considerable. The first edition, held in April 2022 and baptized “Iconic Wines of Joseph Lau Part I”, achieved an unprecedented result, with all lots sold and revenue over 63 million dollars of Hong Kong, tripling the pre-sale estimate. The second edition in November generated more than $ 61 million from Hong Kong, twice the initial assessment. The results reinforced Lau's position as one of Asia's most influential wine curators and captured the attention of investors from around the world. The third part of this series promised rare bottles and included a selection of wines from Henri Jayer, producer of the Burgundy region. Many of these bottles were purchased at the 2012 Christie's “The Private Cellar of Henri Jayer auction. Among the highlighted lots was a set of 10 bottles of Henri Jayer Vosne-Romomée Cros Paranoux 1999. A lot of nine bottles of Henri Jayer Vosne-Romomée Cros Paranoux was also offered. This last collection was sold in the Christie's auction for almost 73 million dollars of Hong Kong, twice the estimated value.
Lau, 73, has a fortune valued at $ 5 billion, according to Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Wealth mainly comes from the commercial properties it has, together with the family, as well as the participation in Chinese Estates Holdings Ltd, one of the main real estate companies in Hong Kong. However, the real estate sector of the Asian Financial Center recorded a sharp slowdown, which had a negative impact on the businessman's activity. Lau resigned from the position of Executive Director and President of Chinese States after being convicted of bribe and fraud in Macao in 2014. The conviction took place within the process of the former Secretary of Public Works and Transport of Macau (1999-2006) to Man Long, sentenced to 29 years in prison for corruption crimes, capitals, abuse of power and unjustified wealth.</description><pubDate>2025-05-26 07:06:22</pubDate></item><item><title>Infrastructure Forum presents 13 unpublished projects in June</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/05/26/forum-sobre-infra-estruturas-apresenta-13-projectos-ineditos-em-junho/</link><description>The 16th International Forum and Infrastructure Investment and Construction Exhibition (IIICF) will take place at Cotai Expo do Venetian between June 10 and 12, integrating, for the first time, a ceremony of “innovative results”.

The Directorate of Education and Youth Development Services (DSEDJ) said in a statement that contacted Macau students at Harvard "to provide permanent counseling and assistance."
On Friday, a federal judge in Boston, Massachusetts, temporarily blocked the Trump administration's decision to suspend foreign students at Harvard University.
DSEDJ said it "is closely following the last developments," but stressed that "circumstances are still changing." Still, DSEDJ has encouraged Macao universities to make available methods of "convenient transfer" to those affected to "protect students' rights to continue their studies." "Any concrete measure will be decided by each university in accordance with the actual conditions," said the DSEDJ.
On the other hand, the tutelage promised to “continue to promote Macao universities and attract exceptional students from around the world” to promote the internationalization of higher education in the territory.
On Friday, a university in the neighboring region of Hong Kong had already promised to facilitate the registration of students from Harvard University.
Hong Kong University of Science and Technology has promised "unconditional offers, simplified admission procedures and academic support to facilitate a soft transition."
The proposed benefits include “accelerated admissions, credit transfers and personalized support” in visa and accommodation assistance, according to a statement.
The United States government banned Harvard on Thursday from continuing to enroll foreign students and indicated to those who are already transferred to other universities at risk of losing their immigration status. The university, the most prestigious in the United States, responded to the executive with a judicial action.
Judge Allison D. Burroughs accepted Harvard's temporary suspension of the revocation of permission to welcome international students, representing a quarter of the institution's total students. "Harvard has shown that without a request to temporarily restrict [the Order of Trump], it will suffer immediate and irreparable damage," the judge noted. The magistrate scheduled an audience about the case to 27 of Naio, which will be attended by representatives on both sides.
Harvard sued the republican government in April to recover its fragrant federal financing of $ 2.6 billion for alleged anti -Semitic behaviors.</description><pubDate>2025-05-26 07:06:14</pubDate></item><item><title>North Korea holds three leaders after an accident with a new war ship</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/05/26/coreia-do-norte-detem-tres-dirigentes-apos-acidente-com-novo-navio-de-guerra/</link><description>North Korea detained three leaders under an investigation into an accident on Wednesday during the release ceremony of a new war ship.
 
"The authorities detained Kang Jong Chol, chongjin shipyard engineer, Han Kyong Hak, head of the hull building workshop, and Kim Yong Hak, vice-director of administrative affairs," said the group that is analyzing the incident, quoted on Saturday by KCNA.
The North Korean official news agency said leader Kim Jong-un, who was present at the release ceremony of the five thousand tons in the port city of Chongjin, described the accident as a "criminal act."
On Friday, the KCNA had said that an underwater and detailed inspection of the war ship "confirmed that, contrary to what was initially announced, there was no gap in the back of the ship."
However, "the stroke hull was scratched and a little sea water entered the stern section by the emergency exit," the agency added, ensuring that the damage suffered by the "not serious" war ship. "No more damage to the war ship" and "The rehabilitation plan is advancing as scheduled," KCNA said on Saturday.
According to the US and South Korea information services, the “side launch attempt” of the ship has failed.
The Fatherworthy is currently sloping in the water, the South Korean military said. Satellite images from the site showed the ship lying on the side, with most of the submerged hull and covered by blue covers.
Hong Kil-ho, the shipyard director where the accident occurred, was summoned by a military commission on Thursday, KCNA added.
North Korean experts estimate that “two or three days to restore the balance of the war ship that pumps water from the flooded section,” the agency said. The repair of the hull of the Freemaker should take about ten days, he added. The name of the boat was not specified.
In April, Pyongyang released images of a five thousand tonword -filed ship, called Choe Hyon.
At the time, state media transmitted Kim images to participate in a ceremony with their daughter, Kim Ju-AE, that many experts believe it will be the successor in power.
North Korea claimed that the ship was equipped with the "most powerful weapons" and "would enter service early next year."
According to some experts, Choe Hyon may be equipped with short -range tactical nuclear missiles, although North Korea has not yet proven to develop small nuclear weapons. Public recognition of technical or administrative failures is highly unusual in North Korea.

The event, called “Museum Development Exchange Conference on the Great Bay”, highlighted the importance of regional cooperation, and the role of museums in the construction of a more humanist society, with the aim of strengthening the area's cultural heritage until June 2025.
 
At a time when culture and innovation are focused on searching for sustainable development, the Grand Bay area has been highlighted by the effort to strengthen the role of museums as agents of social transformation, as evidenced last Friday, May 23rd.
The University of Macao (one) received a relief conference dedicated to the future of the museum sector in the region, in an initiative that reflects the ambition to create a more humanistic, integrated and innovative society through cultural heritage. The organization of the event was in charge of the Cultural Institute (IC) and UM, with the support of MGM.
Under the celebrations of International Museum Day, celebrated on May 18, the event was attended by experts, academics and institutional leaders from various regions of the Great Bay, including Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau. The program of the day included several activities, starting with the inauguration of the exhibition “About Books” at the UM Museum of Art, which brought together more than 50 copies of Chinese and Western old books, highlighting the relevance of books as vehicles of knowledge and works of art. The inauguration highlighted the role of museums in the preservation of heritage and the promotion of knowledge, as fundamental elements for the construction of an informed and culturally enriched society.
The conference, chaired by figures such as Wan Sucheng, director of the Department of Advertising of the Central Popular Government Cabinet in Macau, and Choi Kin Long, Substitute President of the IC, addressed topics that reveal the potential of museums in the age of technological innovation. Zhao Feng, a member of the Executive Committee of the International Museum Council, spoke about the impact of new technologies on museology, highlighting the opportunities for innovation they provide to involve more diverse audiences and expand access to cultural heritage.
The discussion also deepened the importance of strengthening cultural exchanges in the Great Bay region with Feng Fangdan, direction of subsistence affairs in Hengqin, underline the need for greater collaboration between different museum sectors. Zhao Lifan, deputy director of the Guangdong Museum, presented a vision on the evolution of museums in the province, advocating a diverse and high quality approach to ensure the relevance and sustainability of these institutions in the New Age.
The Hong Kong sector was also present with Lam Kwok Fai of the Hong Kong Heritage Museum, which highlighted the importance of technology in the dynamization of museums and their function of cultural agents. For those responsible for the management of smaller museums, such as Zhang Peng, a member of the Permanent Committee of the China's Museum Association of Youth Association, the challenges of reactivation and innovation in small and micro-museum museums are essential to ensure their sustainability and social impact.
In turn, university teachers Li Jun and Li Fan addressed issues related to curatorship in the age of globalization and the relationship between university museums and higher education, reinforcing the formative and educational role of these institutions in the contemporary context.
The meeting was also an opportunity to strengthen regional cooperation, with the participation of representatives of thirteen museums of cities such as Guangzhou, Zhuhai and Shenzhen, committed to promoting the exchange of good practices and innovative strategies for the sector.

In the same intervention, Coutinho also criticizes the “inappropriate” legislation on car rental and the lack of clarity regarding the circulation of border -border companies in Macao.
 
José Pereira Coutinho sent a written interpellation to the government about the need to modernize the transport network in Macao, considering that the overcrowding of buses and the lack of effective alternatives to public transport makes residents' daily life and impair the image of the region between tourists and visitors.
The deputy and president of the Macao Public Function Association (ATFPM) states that the overcrowding of buses is a “chronic problem” in the territory, which is accentuated during periods of higher influx. The fact that both residents and non -resident workers and tourists share the same transport networks “makes travel experience uncomfortable and sometimes frustrating,” especially during concerts, conferences or large -scale events. “Buses, which already operate with maximum capacity, become insufficient to meet growing demand, resulting in long waiting times and crowded travel,” laments the deputy.
In turn, also the main alternatives to public buses - taxis - are unable to respond to the growing demand of tourists and visitors, especially weekends and holidays. Taxi scarcity, coupled with a frequently crowded public transport network, severely affects residents 'daily lives and visitors' tourist experience, “who expect an efficient and accessible transport system” proper from an excellence tourist destination. Humming specifically about the tourism industry, Coutinho considers that the weaknesses of the transport network have a “direct impact” in this sector by deteriorating visitors experiences, reducing their return intention and making recommendations less likely to friends and family.
Coutinho ends the first point of interpellation by questioning the government about the alternatives and solutions it proposes to “diversify and complement” the public transport network and cover the needs of residents and tourists, asking that role will play technology in the “modernization” of the transport system.
 
Vehicle rental law is obsolete
 
At a second point of his questioning, the deputy draws attention to the need to update the current regulatory diploma of car rental in Macao, which he considers unmistakable “in relation to the local reality and the growth of tourism”. The regulation, about forty years old, was written at a time “when the volume of visitors and the dynamics of mobility were substantially different”, becoming “crucial” that legislation is readjusted to current circumstances.
One aspect to recontextualize the new reality would be, for example, the prohibition of this type of vehicles on the Hengqin border. Given that the interconnection between the two regions is “vital for the economic and tourist development” of Hengqin, Coutinho argues that this restriction makes the mobility of visitors difficult and condition the tourist potential of the territory, still in the expansion phase.
Presenting these points of reflection, the deputy questions the government about the “concrete measures” that plans to implement in the modernization of the car rental industry and the plans that exist for the revision of the “unsuccessful” legislation. It also asks if there are examples of other regions that have followed similar modernization plans that may be a reference to the case of Hengqin.
 
“Transparency” missing GC enrollment
 
In a last topic sent to the Government of MSAR, Coutinho requires “clear and transparent communication” with regard to the recent authorization for the circulation of vehicles with GC enrollment - that is, vehicles of transfronist companies circulating between Macao and the interior of China.
The deputy acknowledges that the legalization of the circulation of these vehicles may result in “benefits to mobility”, but criticizes the lack of transparency of the government regarding the criteria used in approval, the purpose of vehicles and the definition of rules on where they can circulate.
“The need for transparency is crucial, as clear communication on these issues will help ensure that the population feels informed and involved,” he stresses, before asking the government what “specific measures” that plans to adopt to ensure “clear and affordable communication” about the regulation of these vehicles.

The project was awarded by 9.28 billion Patacas, a budget "as planned," says the government, but will have a budgetary appropriation by 2031 due to the circulation system.
 
The construction works of the East Line of the Light Metro began in the 3rd quarter of 2023 and are expected to be completed in the 1st quarter of 2028, with progress and budget “as expected”, stressed the Board of Public Works (DSOP). Authorities expect the east line project to operate in the 2nd semester of 2029, shortly after commissioning and testing the circulation system.
According to a press release released on Saturday, DSOP recalled that the total value of the award of construction works of the southern and northern east line was 9.281 billion Patacas. Despite the expected service entry of this line in 2029, DSOP said it will need a budget allocation by 2031, "since some works will continue to be performed after the entry into operation" regarding the circulation system.
The body also explained that the budget amount of award is being paid according to the progress of the work of the year. Compared to 2024, the projected works were completed in advance, so it was necessary to transfer the allocation to payment purposes at this stage.

"Currently, the works related to the circulation system have already begun, while the construction work of underground stations, the tunnel using tuning and the linked mud binding viaducts are also taking place in accordance with the plan, and the work of some mandatory goals has been completed in advance," he said.
DSOP pointed out that the northern segment tunner began excavation earlier this month, and the southern segment tunner will also begin the excavation process on the 28th of this month. "At this stage, there is a conclusion of the global project by about 41%," the statement said.
The east line of the light metro, according to the government, will have a layout of about 7.7km long with six stations that will connect to the doors of the siege, to zone A of the new urban landfills, to the area and new urban landfills, as well as the maritime terminal station of the mud line.
The central government approved the use of “Vit in the form of V”, a portion of Zhuhai, which is near the doors of the siege, so the ES1 station of this line will be moved west and will have more convenient connection between the siege gates border post and the light meter. DSOP has ensured that, despite the increase in work, the deadline for completion will not be affected for now.</description><pubDate>2025-05-26 07:03:15</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
