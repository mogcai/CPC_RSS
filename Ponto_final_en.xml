XI, who congratulated Wong for victory in last month's parliamentary elections, indicated that, “in the face of the current international situation of interconnected changes and chaos, China is willing to strengthen strategic communication with Singapore”, according to a statement widespread by state television CCTV.
The Chinese leader urged both parties to "strengthen cooperation ties, work together to face challenges, and generate greater benefits to peoples from both countries."
Wong said that "the importance of relationships between China and Singapore is greater than ever in a turbulent world situation," according to CCTV. “We can work together to build more narrow bilateral relationships and strengthen regional and multilateral cooperation to strengthen multilateralism, protect international rules and order and benefit all countries in the world,” said Wong, who chose China as his first international official trip outside Southeast Asian after May elections.
Wong ascended as Prime Minister of Singapore in May 2024, when the predecessor, Lee Hsien Loong, left office after almost two decades in power.
In the May elections, his party, the Popular Action Party (PAP), which has been in power in Singapore for six decades, managed to wage the fall and curb the rise of an opposition still reduced, conquering 87 of the 97 seats in Parliament.
China maintains close relationships with Singapore, where it is estimated that hundreds of Chinese companies have changed in recent years in an attempt to avoid the impact of geopolitical and commercial tensions between Washington and Beijing.
Singapore, which has a strong regulatory system and low corporate taxes, also proved to be the ideal alternative to Hong Kong, whose attractiveness was impaired by the growing control that Beijing exerts on the semi-autonomous region.</description><pubDate>2025-06-25 03:56:22</pubDate></item><item><title>Chef Tam's Seasons among the 100 best restaurants in the world</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2025/06/25/chef-tams-seasons-entre-os-100-melhores-restaurantes-do-mundo/</link><description>Chef Tam's Seasons, located at Wynn Palace, is the first restaurant in Macao to be present on the full list of the world's 50 best restaurants (The World's 50 Best Restaurants).

It is anchored in this historical context that “Portuguese Demons - Catalonia 1794” arises, a novel that combines factual and fictional elements to create a story about passion, revenge and the tenacity of the Portuguese.
 
The Rui Cunha Foundation receives today, at 18:30, the presentation of the book “Portuguese Demons - Catalonia 1794”, with the presence of author Vítor Carmona. This is the second volume of the saga “The Pyrenees War”, which thus succeeds the historical novel “The Campaign - Rossilion 1793”. The session has free admission and will be held in Portuguese.
The Rui Cunha Foundation, in a statement, says that the trilogy focuses on “the unprecedented theme of national fiction, little studied by historians, the participation of the Portuguese in the European military campaigns of the revolutionary France of the late eighteenth century”. The third (and last) contribution to history has no name or release date yet.
If the first book addressed the participation of Portuguese and Spanish soldiers in the Rossilion campaign, a conflict in which the Iberian countries joined the United Kingdom in opposition to France, the second work deepens the exploitation of internal fractures in the Portuguese High Command and the bleak winter in the Eastern Pyrenees.
The synopsis begins by mentioning that the Portuguese of the army assist the Spanish Crown have "by company hunger, cold and disease", and cannot even resort to hospitals "overcrowded with hundreds of sick and malnourished soldiers." Among the deplorable conditions and the growing tensions within the regiments, "the orders are to endure, at all costs, the fragile and permeable line of defense, in the left flank of the combined army, against the incursions contained in the fearsome" Miquelets ", the French irregular troops."
The plot breaks the lines between fiction and reality, supporting itself in historical facts to, on the sidelines of the battlefield, set up a plot of rivalries, passion and revenge between well-delineated and multidimensional characters, such as the Captains Diogo Saraiva and António de Monte Cruz or Baroness Isabel Borges. While the protagonists surpass their own personal wars, "the French seek to annihilate the Luso-Spanish army," in which "only Portuguese demons (as the French call them) seem to have the courage and determination to face them."
Vítor Carmona was born in 1973 in Lisbon, where he graduated in international relations. His passion for history-specifically, for the period from the French Revolution to Napoleonic Epic-motivated him to found the Portuguese Napoleonic Society for ten years, a space for the dissemination and discussion of the military cargo and the battles waged by Napoleon Bonaparte, one of the most relevant characters in world history.

However, Chinese emerging cafeteria chains are threatening the presence of the US jail.
 
The popular US cafes Starbucks chain is looking for a buyer for its business in China, due to the impact on the results of the company raised by local competition, the Caixin News Portal said yesterday.
Caixin, which cites anonymous sources, revealed that the US company recently held meetings with almost 20 potential buyers, although Starbucks's current market assessment makes operation expensive and therefore "difficult."
One of these sources indicated that Starbucks started these rounds of contacts in February, initially just looking for a local partner. Some investment funds showed interest, but did not have enough resources, he said.
After presenting the results of the second quarter, Starbucks executive director Brian Niccol said his team is focused on making changes to his business in China to “be more competitive” in this market, with which he reaffirmed his “long -term commitment”. "We see great potential for our business in China over the coming years and we are still open to [discover] how to reach it," said the executive.
However, Chinese emerging cafeteria chains are threatening the presence of Starbucks: according to a Zheshang Securities report, its market share fell from 5.6% to 4.2% between 2022 and 2024, while that of its main rival, Luckin Coffee, rose from 6.1% to 11% in the same period.
In addition, the entry of the Chinese giant of JD.com e -commerce in the home delivery business intensified the price war in the beverage sector, as the platform he.me - from rival Alibaba - announced weeks later a promotion that offered millions of milk with milk or cafes.
In a consumer weakness scenario in China, Starbucks has had to reduce the prices of dozens of products: Caxin estimates these discounts by about 5 yuans (0.6 euros) on average and clarifies that, for now, they do not include coffee, but other drinks such as “frappuccinos”, cold teas or milk teas.
In response to the information released by Caixin, Starbucks has ensured in a statement that it is not "considering the total sale of its business in China" and is simply "evaluating what is the best way to take advantage of future growth opportunities."
