In response to a written question from deputy Ella Lei, the Government also said that it is preparing a document with new objectives for the development of women in Macau.

In the last five years, the Directorate of Services for Labor Affairs (DSAL) has not received any complaints from workers discriminated against because they are female, the Government informed in a response to a written question presented by deputy Ella Lei.
DSAL guarantees that it is “committed to protecting and defending the legitimate labor rights and interests of workers” and promises that, “if it becomes aware that any worker has been treated in a discriminatory and unfair manner, it will monitor and investigate the case in accordance with the law”. “If it is found that the act in question involves a criminal crime, the case will be forwarded, in accordance with the law, to the police authorities for monitoring purposes”, adds the Government's response, which is signed by Hon Wai, president of the Institute of Social Action (IAS).
Furthermore, if a public services worker is treated “unfairly or inappropriately at work”, she can lodge a complaint with her service or with the Management Committee for the Handling of Complaints Submitted by Public Services Workers, authorities advise.
The IAS also noted that the first objectives of the document “Objectives for the Development of Women in Macau”, prepared by the Council for Women and Children's Affairs, were completed last year. Therefore, the second objectives are now being developed, which will involve 21 public services and will be implemented between 2026 and 2032.
These new objectives, explains the IAS, will have as their main focus physical and mental health, family-friendly measures, social participation and gender equality, covering eight areas, namely gender mainstreaming, public decision-making and management, education, healthcare, well-being and social security, legal protection, economy and employment, and technological development.
With regard to promoting the rights and interests of pregnant women and women in labor, the IAS highlights that, currently, there are around 370 breastfeeding rooms in Macau, mainly in the main services and public entities, as well as in schools and kindergartens. Within the scope of the “Breastfeeding-Friendly Workplace” initiative, more than 1,200 promotional activities were carried out, with the participation of 285 institutions.
It is also worth remembering that the Macao SAR Government recently proposed increasing maternity leave from 70 to 90 days. This change to the labor relations law is currently under public consultation.
Regarding the promotion of employment for single-parent mothers, the six-month professional reintegration plan for women, launched in January this year by DSAL in cooperation with integrated tourism and leisure companies, provided 29 jobs, combining measures such as group support, professional training, work-based practice and flexible working hours, “so that women, including single-parent mothers, who have already left the job market, can gradually adapt to the work environment, regain confidence and get back to their lives professional”, highlights the IAS response.</description><pubDate>2026-02-15 23:04:57</pubDate></item><item><title>China announces new humanitarian aid to Kiev</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2026/02/15/china-anuncia-nova-ajuda-humanitaria-a-kiev/</link><description>China is ready to provide “new humanitarian aid” to Ukraine, announced the head of Chinese diplomacy, Wang Yi, during a meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart at the Munich Security Conference.

“Relations between China and Ukraine must remain on the right track (…). China is ready to provide new humanitarian aid to Ukraine,” Wang Yi told Andrii Sybiga, according to a statement released by Chinese state television CCTV.
China, which has never condemned the Russian offensive in Ukraine and presents itself as neutral, regularly calls for peace negotiations to end the war started by Moscow four years ago.
Western governments and Ukraine accuse China of providing Russia with crucial economic support for the war effort, including military components for the defense industry. Wang said trade exchanges between Beijing and Kiev will develop steadily in 2025, keeping China as Ukraine's biggest trading partner and biggest source of imports.
He also said that China hopes that the Ukrainian side will continue to guarantee the safety of Chinese personnel and institutions in Ukraine, he added, according to the official Chinese news agency Xinhua.
Wang spoke of recent progress in dialogue on the conflict, which he considered reassuring, and assured that the Chinese position is constant, “upholding objectivity and equity and actively promoting peace talks”. “We are ready to maintain communication with Ukraine and work with the international community to play a constructive role in achieving a quick political solution to the crisis,” he added.
At the end of the meeting, Sybiga thanked Wang for China's decision to “grant additional humanitarian aid in energy matters to Ukraine”, given the intensification of Russian bombings against the country's energy network.
The Ukrainian minister said on social media that he spoke to Wang about recent developments in the war Russia started four years ago. “I briefed my Chinese colleague on the situation on the frontline, the Russian attacks on our energy system and the damage inflicted on Chinese companies as a result of the Russian attacks,” Sybiga said. “We discussed peace efforts and China’s important role in facilitating the end of the conflict,” he wrote, quoted by France-Presse (AFP).
Sybiga referred to a “fruitful meeting” during which they analyzed “ways of developing mutually advantageous commercial and bilateral relations, based on reciprocal respect for territorial integrity”. The two ministers exchanged invitations to visit their respective countries, according to Sybiga, who also highlighted “Ukraine's interest in contacts at the highest level with China”.
The minister was alluding to recent efforts to organize a meeting between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, who maintains close relations with Russian leader Vladimir Putin.

In Chinese astrology, this is the year “Bing Wu” – “Horse of Fire”, being a combination of the “double Fire” that symbolizes vigor, ambition and progress. At the FINAL POINT, Feng Shui master Mickey Hung indicates that this Year of the Horse will be marked by transformation, turmoil and significant advances. In the midst of the challenges and opportunities brought by changes, according to the master, we must maintain a dynamic balance and precaution against restlessness and impatience.
 
In the traditional interpretation of Feng Shui, what do the Horse and the Year of the Horse symbolize?
The Horse is traditionally characterized by its active and dynamic nature, by moving vigorously, which is seen as a symbol of mobility and pioneering spirit. Equestrian symbolism is also found in military conquests, as horses were central to fighting during ancient wars.  Therefore, the Year of the Horse is always considered as a year of ambition and relentless progress.
According to Chinese astrology, this is also a year of the “Bing Wu” combination, a double element of Fire – one of the five elements in Chinese mythology. The nature of fire is to ascend, and with the accumulated impact of the elements of Fire, the year 2026 is marked with change, upheaval and significant advancements, symbolizing the collapse of old orders and the establishment of new ones.
Excess Fire energy can thus trigger geopolitical conflicts, volatility in financial markets and public health incidents. Collective global emotions can become impatient and impulsive, leading to frequent errors in decision-making. The conflictual nature of Fire and the instability of the Horse also alert us to the risks of overheating in the global economy.
The energy of the Year of the Horse, on the other hand, is dynamic and explosive, making it a suitable period for starting new ventures, driving reforms and overcoming constraints.
Generally speaking, the Year of the Fire Horse is a year in which opportunities and challenges are particularly pronounced. It encourages proactive action, but places greater emphasis on assessing situations and maintaining a dynamic balance.

What are the forecasts for Macau throughout this year?
Social and cultural vitality will flourish, with vibrant local arts and Portuguese-Chinese cultural exchange activities. The creativity of young people will be particularly vigorous.
However, due to the Fire element in excess, it is necessary to prevent “restlessness and impatience”. During the summer, when the Fire is raging, we must pay attention to intense public discourse and minor safety incidents such as fires and electrical hazards. The element of Water can be used to balance Fire, through the increase of coastal public spaces and the promotion of peaceful cultural activities, such as meditation and tea ceremonies.
Recruiting talent, especially bilingual professionals in Chinese and Portuguese in the areas of technology and law, will produce notable results. And female leaders will excel in social issues.
In terms of the economy, the year of the Horse leads to a stable recovery trend. The Fire element governs consumption, so the gaming industry will gradually recover, but growth will be relatively moderate.
Tourism and the conference and exhibition industry will be new growth points. Cross-border tourism and trade in Portuguese-Chinese specialties are brimming with vitality. It is also necessary to be cautious against potential risks in the financial sector and investments.

Which industries will have the best development prospects this year?
Blessed by the Earth element star “Ba Bai”, the real estate sector and traditional industries will perform favorably this year. The Fire element of the Year of the Horse strengthens this Earth energy, which creates a situation where opportunities and pressures coexist.
The gaming and tourism sector (which tends towards the Water element) may face challenges due to the strong Fire energy and, therefore, transformation is needed by incorporating cultural and health elements, which belong to the Wood element.
Reference exhibitions and specialized finance, of the elements of Earth and Metal, will benefit from the mutual generation between Fire and Earth, becoming new points of growth.
Furthermore, the Internet also implies the element of Fire, and in this case, tourism and cross-border data services will flourish. Technological projects in collaboration with Hengqin, whose name corresponds to the element of Wood, especially in green technology and the chip factory, reveal auspicious signs.
The fortune of wealth is benefited by the auspicious stars, causing tax revenues to increase steadily. But caution is needed to avoid volatility caused by excessive dependence on a single expanding sector. It is essential to deflect risks by using the stability and breadth symbolized by the Earth element.

In the Year of the Horse, what initiatives are auspicious to undertake? And what areas should special attention be paid to?
For businesspeople, businesses related to culture, entertainment and restaurants will perform optimistically. The element of Fire governs “rituals and arts”, making Macau’s local culture, festive tourism and the Portuguese element particularly appealing. They may consider organizing events focusing on Portuguese-Chinese cultural exchange to attract visitors.
But be careful: you may experience liquidity overload during the summer. Collaborate with partners from coastal regions, or with people born in the Year of the Pig or the Year of the Rat to balance the energy.
Workers, in turn, will have a year of intense competition in the workplace. Younger workers should seek training to improve their skills, for example, in the areas of Portuguese-Chinese bilingualism and cross-border electronic commerce.
Excessive Fire can lead to disputes. We must remain cautious in office interactions. Wear white, blue or black (colors of the Water element) and use metal accessories, such as watches, to promote harmony and alleviate interpersonal tensions.
While the stock market is prone to sharp rises and falls, investors should be extra careful about a rapid cooldown after the market's euphoria in the summer. It is recommended that you favor stocks in industries aligned with the elements of Water and Wood, such as logistics, technology and education. Avoid short-term speculation in Fire and Earth element industries such as energy and real estate. Gold prices may soar due to global instability, but they are likely to be highly volatile, so avoid a large one-off investment.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Japan highlights “deepening cooperation” with NATO and announces support for Ukraine</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2026/02/15/japao-sublinha-aprofundamento-da-cooperacao-com-nato-e-anuncia-apoio-a-ucrania/</link><description>Tokyo announced that it had expressed to NATO its expectations of “deepening cooperation” with the Atlantic Alliance and its readiness to reinforce Japan's support for Ukraine.

Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi said in a meeting on Saturday in Munich with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte that the security of the Euro-Atlantic and Indo-Pacific regions “are inseparable”, so “cooperation between Japan and NATO and between NATO and its partners in the Indo-Pacific region (Japan, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea) is strategically important”, according to a statement released by the ministry. Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Motegi also highlighted that Tokyo “intends to raise relations with NATO to new heights through concrete cooperation in several areas, including defense equipment and industrial cooperation”.
In response, in the “approximately 25-minute” meeting on the sidelines of the security summit taking place in Munich, Rutte expressed hope in the development of cooperation between Japan and NATO and “valued Japan's cooperation with the North Atlantic Alliance, including Tokyo's support for Ukraine through programs” of the organization he presides over, according to the statement.
Japan will contribute around 15 million euros in non-lethal equipment to the NATO assistance package for Kiev, according to Japanese news agency Jiji Press.
The announcement comes amid rumors, reported last week by Japanese television station NHK, about Tokyo's possible adherence to the list of priority requirements for Ukraine (PURL), coordinated by the Atlantic Alliance and Washington, which includes financing purchases of North American weapons that Ukraine has designated as essential, especially air defense weapons and ammunition.
NATO representatives quoted anonymously by NHK indicated that Japan would provide funds only for non-lethal defense equipment, with the possible inclusion of radar systems and bulletproof vests.
The alignment of the positions of the two interlocutors reflects Japan's growing involvement with NATO, which includes the creation of a permanent delegation at the Alliance's headquarters in Brussels. In April, Rutte visited Tokyo, where prospects for expanding cooperation in the defense industry were discussed.
Motegi's meeting with Rutte came a day after Japanese Defense Minister Shinjiro Koizumi took part in discussions at the same forum on how to continue supporting Ukraine's energy sector, which has been compromised by Russia's attacks.
Motegi also met in Munich with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, with whom he discussed the situation around China and policies towards North Korea, including Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs, according to another statement from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The two officials also coordinated the visit of the Japanese Prime Minister, Sanae Takaichi, to the United States, scheduled for March.

The report published by the official media does not specifically mention Russia, but the Russian ambassador to North Korea participated in October in the inauguration ceremony of this “Combat Deeds Memorial Museum”, which Kim Jong Un described as a “historical pinnacle” in relations with Moscow.
Earlier this week, Kim Jong-un promised to “unconditionally support” all the actions of Russian President Vladimir Putin, in a letter to the latter released by KCNA.
Communist North Korea, one of the most diplomatically isolated regimes in the world, has strengthened its ties with Moscow since its invasion of Ukraine almost four years ago.
The country has mobilized thousands of soldiers to fight alongside Russia, according to South Korean and Western intelligence agencies.
At least 600 North Korean soldiers were killed and thousands were injured, according to South Korean estimates.
In addition to sending troops to fight for Russia, Pyongyang has supplied Moscow with artillery shells, missiles and long-range missile systems.
In return, Russia provides North Korea with financial aid and military technology, as well as food and energy, according to analysts.
The Kim dynasty has ruled the country with an 'iron fist' since its founding in 1948, with Kim Jong-un succeeding his father and grandfather.
According to a South Korean deputy this week after a meeting with the secret services, Kim Jong-un is preparing to name his daughter Ju-ae as successor, when the great power ceremony is being prepared in Pyongyang this month.</description><pubDate>2026-02-15 23:00:33</pubDate></item><item><title>Beijing asks Washington to make 2026 a year of “peaceful coexistence”</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2026/02/15/pequim-pede-a-washington-que-2026-seja-um-ano-de-coexistencia-pacifica/</link><description>China and the US must make 2026 a year of convergence for “mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and mutually beneficial cooperation”, said the head of Chinese diplomacy, Wang Yi, to his US counterpart, Marco Rubio.

Wang and Rubio met this Friday on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, according to a statement published on the official website of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. “Dialogue is better than confrontation, cooperation is better than conflict, and mutual gain is better than the zero-sum (mentality) in relations between China and the US,” said the Chinese foreign minister.
Wang assured that, as long as Washington and Beijing “respect the principles of equality, respect and mutual benefit”, they will be able to “find ways” to resolve tensions and manage differences “appropriately”. “Both sides should work together to continuously expand the list of areas of cooperation and reduce the list of problems, so that China-US relations are on a stable, healthy and sustainable path of development, sending a positive message to the world,” added the head of Chinese diplomacy.
According to the statement, Wang and Rubio concluded that the meeting was “positive and constructive” and agreed to “facilitate high-level interactions” and “strengthen dialogue and cooperation in various areas.”
The United States Department of State has not yet released any information about the meeting, nor has Rubio done so on social media.
The meeting precedes the expected trip by US President Donald Trump to China next April - the exact dates have not yet been confirmed - during which, according to the local press, an extension of the one-year trade truce that the Republican President sealed in October with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, could be signed, after months of confrontation over tariffs.
Furthermore, Trump recently stated that Xi will also visit the United States “later this year”, although this visit has not been officially confirmed either.
The statement makes no reference to the issues addressed by the two presidents in a phone call last week, such as Taiwan, described by Xi as the “first red line” in relations with the United States, a subject he suggested to Trump to address “with the utmost prudence”, after the latest arms sale to the self-governed island.
According to Trump, who classified the call as “excellent” and “exhaustive”, issues such as trade and defense were discussed, with the US President specifically referring to China's purchase of oil and gas from the United States, as well as the acquisition of aircraft engines and an increase in imports of agricultural products, especially soybeans.
Friday's meeting was the second face-to-face meeting between Wang and Rubio — sanctioned by China in 2020, when he was a senator from Florida, due to protests in Hong Kong and sanctions over Xinjiang —, after the meeting last July, on the sidelines of a summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).

“Compulsive consumption of short videos has a negative impact on cognitive development, which can cause lack of concentration, social anxiety and self-doubt”, he explained to Lusa Wang Wei, academic in the field of Educational Psychology at the University of Macau (UM), author of the study “Addiction to short videos, school involvement and social inclusion among Chinese rural students”.
“This short video design can be particularly dangerous for children”, warned the researcher. “Our research indicates a direct correlation: the more students consume short videos, the less they engage with school,” Wang continued.
Wang argues that although children's fundamental psychological needs must be satisfied offline, the architecture of short video platforms, with personalized algorithms and social interaction features, directly and subtly satisfy these same needs.
This parallel satisfaction, Wang's research suggests, “potentially leads to overuse and addiction.” “The stimulating and fast-paced nature of short videos makes them highly entertaining for students,” the researcher added.
Anise Wu Man Sze, professor of Psychology at UM's Faculty of Social Sciences and author of the study “The relationship of affective and cognitive components in the problematic use of short videos”, adds to Wang's conclusions the issues related to the overstimulation of children, which further harms healthy cognitive development.
The short videos capture everyone's attention precisely because “they are right there at hand and they are free”, highlights Wu, speaking to Lusa. People can access vast amounts of short videos “anytime, anywhere”.
Now, these addictive behaviors often originate from a “functional purpose”, he explained. “We have to raise awareness, especially if use starts to affect daily life, leading to the sacrifice of family time, neglect of sleep, or people surfing at inappropriate times, such as during classes or driving, putting themselves or others at risk,” he told Lusa.
In addition to the design of the platforms, the use of algorithms and the nature of the quick videos themselves, Wu identified other factors that trigger the dependency relationship.
According to the researcher, daily stress, but also the environment and even genetic predisposition contribute to addictive behaviors, she detailed in the study. “In fact, one of the primary reasons for addiction, which results in these compulsive behaviors, is to escape unpleasant realities, pressures or situations that people want to avoid confronting”, explained Anise Wu, calling for awareness of the effects of watching short videos.
As for interventions with children, according to Wang Wei, “it is very important” to satisfy their emotional needs, while cultivating digital literacy and self-regulation skills, “instead of limiting ourselves to taking away their cell phone”.
By December 2024, the number of people with access to this type of videos in China reached close to 1.1 billion individuals, with 98.4% being active users of this format, according to the Annual Report on the Development of Audiovisual Services on the Internet, published by the Chinese authorities. “The size of the industry exceeded 1.22 billion yuan, driven by the consumption of short videos and ‘live streaming’ [real-time transmission].

On the last occasion, in 1966, the birth rate in Japan fell sharply due to superstitions about a supposed “curse” associated with women born under this sign. But is there really any basis behind the myth? THE FINAL POINT sought to find out what Chinese astrology says on the subject and understand the impact that gender signs and stereotypes still have in East Asia.
Women born under the sign of the Fire Horse are stubborn, obstinate, temperamental. In young people, they challenge the authority of the father figure; Once married, they torture their husbands with their volatile temperament until they lead to an early death. Or, at least, that's what the stereotypes say – stereotypes that don't extend to men of the same sign.
They could just be prejudices resulting from an incorrect interpretation of Chinese astrology, but the consequences were real and devastating in Japan. According to data presented in a study by Ishise Hirokazu, published in 2025 in the Osaka University repository, the number of live births in the country registered sharp decreases in the years 1846, 1906 and 1966. At the same time, the ratio between male babies and of females had an atypical increase, favoring the first.
The drop in the number of births was particularly large in 1966, when the use of contraceptive methods became more widespread. The decline was around 25% compared to the previous year (463,000 fewer live births), according to data collected in a study published by Kanae Kaku in the academic journal Annals of Human Biology.
In the same publication, we read that the rate of induced abortions that year was 43.1 per thousand births, a much higher number than the 30.6 initially projected by the country's demographers. Data analysis also highlights a “notable increase” in the early neonatal mortality rate among girls born in 1966, caused by “accidents and violence”. “This fact is consistent with the superstition that women born in the year of the Fire Horse are ill-fated,” writes the author.
As for China, data compiled by the United Nations Population Division show that in 1966 there was a decline of 7.39% compared to the previous year, although the number of births fell again by 3.13% in the following year, 1967. It is important to highlight that the birth rate in the 1960s was strongly impacted by the consequences of the Great Leap Forward, which makes it difficult to assess other demographic factors.
PONTO FINAL requested data on the number of live births in Macau in 1906 and 1966 from the Statistics and Census Bureau (DSEC), which said it did not have information prior to 1970.
THE ORIGIN OF THE MYTH
The Chinese zodiac is made up of twelve animals ordered as follows: Rat, Buffalo, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Goat, Monkey, Rooster, Dog and Pig. Each year is also associated with one of five elements: Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal and Water. It takes a 60-year cycle for all possible combinations to happen.
In 1966, Japan was in the midst of an “economic miracle” that transformed a country devastated by the Second World War into a huge economic power. Technology, science and education flourished, concomitant with a thought still rooted in superstition and supposed innate differences between women and men. Six decades later, the sign of the Horse crosses paths again with the Fire element in 2026 (more precisely, according to the lunar calendar, between February 17, 2026 and February 5, 2027). Could we be facing an unfavorable new year for female children?
In the 21st century, superstition is still part of the daily lives of the Chinese population. On the first day of the New Year, you don't wash your hair, lest prosperity – a word that sounds similar to “hair” in Mandarin – be washed away. Some families avoid visits and social events on the third day, which is considered conducive to arguments (this year, the date falls on February 19).
Astrology also plays an important role in collective mentality, although not as strongly as in previous decades. The year of the Dragon, considered particularly auspicious among others, often coincides with significant increases in birth rates in Mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. In 2024, the most recent year associated with this mythical creature, there was a slight increase in the number of live births on the mainland after seven consecutive years of decline.
“This phenomenon is based on superstitious beliefs that ‘Dragon babies’ are luckier and stronger”, explains master Sam Pao, a specialist in ‘feng shui’, to PONTO FINAL. “Even better if it is a boy, because in areas where superstitious thinking is more rooted, such as Fujian or Chaozhou, there is still some preference for male children.”
This is a trend that has been losing strength in recent years, in which decisions related to marriage and birth are increasingly based on emotional preferences and the couple's economic stability. “I don’t believe that astrology has an impact on birth rates in Macau or in the interior of China”, argues the astrologer. "In the past, it could happen, because these beliefs were more popular and taken more seriously. For example, it was common for marriage to depend on parental approval and even choosing the right time. Nowadays, young people don't even consult their parents – it would be unthinkable for someone to stop dating because their mother said their birth times weren't compatible."
Still, master Sam Pao does not rule out the hypothesis that some beliefs or superstitions spread through the influence of friends or colleagues. This is how the stigma of the women of the Fire Horse spread: through stories passed by word of mouth, without foundations in traditional literature (let alone scientific).
“This is not a generalized belief, but rather particular ideas”, confirms the feng shui master. "If we look in ancient texts or divination books, we will not find such references to the Fire Horse women; they are myths transmitted orally."
In fact, the origins of this stigma are nebulous and seem likely to be caused by a story told from generation to generation since the 16th century. The protagonist is Yaoya Oshichi, a sixteen-year-old girl burned at the stake in 1683 for setting a fire. The reason? A year earlier, she had met a boy during a devastating fire and was certain that she would meet him again if the city of Edo (now Tokyo) was consumed by flames again.
Based on true facts, the story ended up gaining fictional elements over time and became a cautionary tale against impulsiveness, excessive passion... and the weight of the astrological sign, which would have condemned the teenager, born in the year of the Fire Horse of 1666, to a tragic end. Three hundred years later, the stigma remained in Japan – despite the story of the “cursed” Fire Horse woman being exclusively based on folklore.
Myths and centuries-old stories aside, master Sam Pao draws attention to how reductive it is to associate personality with the sign. Chinese astrology is based on a much more complex reading: the individual astral chart, called Bazi (literally, “eight characters”), is formed by four pillars corresponding to the year, month, day and time of birth, combining a Celestial Stem (which contains one of the five elements, with Yin or Yang polarity) and an Earthly Branch (associated with one of the twelve animals).
In total, there are eight characters that define the astrological profile. The zodiac sign, corresponding to the Earthly Branch of the year, represents only one of these eight elements and does not provide enough information to decipher the intricate puzzle that is the Chinese horoscope.
THE MODERN WOMAN
Equality between the sexes is inscribed in the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, originally promulgated in 1954, and has been one of the main flags raised by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The massive entry of Chinese women into the job market and the guarantee of their legal protections coincided with the emergence of the famous phrase “women hold up half the sky”, popularized by Mao Zedong, and seemed to consolidate female power in Chinese society. In practice, the reality is not always this.
“The traditional stereotype of the ideal woman in China is influenced by discourses from different historical periods,” says Juan Chen, assistant professor of Anthropology at the University of Macau (UM). “In the past, the ideal image of a woman was characterized as kind, virtuous and family-oriented, taking on responsibilities such as supporting her husband and educating her children.”
“Traditional Chinese thought suggested that a woman should be docile”, confirms master Sam Pao. "If she was impatient, strong-willed or very ambitious, she was seen as a problematic woman who did not respect feminine conventions. Of course this is a traditional and old view, which has no place in an egalitarian society."
Times have changed – and gender stereotypes have progressively given way to a fairer and more multidimensional view of women. Juan Chen notes that the main changes occurred in the 1990s, “with the development of the country's economy and the increase in the number of women in the job market”. Working women came to challenge these preconceived ideas and force reflection on them, although in an unequal way between regions and provinces.
The professor, whose area of ​​research focuses mainly on gender and anthropology themes in China, highlights that the path to full equality is still far from being achieved. “In general, as China is a patriarchal society, even if women have a certain degree of financial independence, the expectation remains that they adopt the same traditional values.”
This observation suggests that social impositions regarding marriage and childcare have not disappeared – they merely constitute one of several layers associated with modern women. They are now workers, but continue to play the roles of diligent wives and mothers.
However, the attempt to draw a portrait of Chinese women may require generalizations that are too extreme considering the size and diversity of the country. “Women with strong personalities are not necessarily seen as problematic or difficult: this perception varies depending on factors such as social context, regional differences, level of education and the group in question”, highlights Juan Chen. “For example, the older generation tends to associate ideal femininity with kindness and virtue, so they may tend to view strong-willed women as relatively difficult.”
Younger generations, more open to the world and distanced from traditional thinking, may have a different perspective. The professor emphasizes that, “in general, modern young people have received higher levels of education and have witnessed the increasing participation of women in the workforce and their financial independence”, which contributes to their perception of them as their peers. “Economically independent, competent or strong-willed” women are no longer seen as a source of problems: for some men, they are even “challenging and attractive”.
As Chinese society advances, social values ​​also seem to evolve and pave the way for full equality, regardless of sex or astrological sign. The new year of the Fire Horse will allow for a deeper understanding of the contemporary thinking of East Asian countries, positioned between technological vanguard and fidelity to traditional teachings. Will we once again be faced with an atypical year in Japan, where the birth rate has already reached alarmingly low levels? Will there be repercussions in China, particularly in contrast to the Dragon years? The answer to these questions will remain unknown until February 2027, when the year of the Horse ends and gives way to the year of the Goat.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Economy grows 4.7% in 2025 and returns to 89.6% of pre-pandemic values</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2026/02/15/economia-cresce-47-em-2025-e-retoma-896-dos-valores-pre-pandemia/</link><description>The territory's economy maintained a stable recovery path throughout 2025, with the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) reaching 418.04 billion patacas, a real growth of 4.7% compared to 2024 and equivalent to 89.6% of the economic volume recorded in 2019, before the pandemic.

Wynn's revenues shrank despite revenues from the company's two properties in Macau increasing 0.97% compared to 2024, to US$3.72 billion, according to a statement from the operator.
Betting at the Wynn Macau and Wynn Palace casinos accounted for the majority of the company's turnover in 2025, generating US$3.13 billion in revenue, an increase of 3.5%.
The results “reflect continued strength across all sectors of the company and steady progress in our global development initiatives,” said Craig Billings, CEO of parent company Wynn Resorts, cited in the same statement. “In Macau, we saw substantial increases in both VIP and mass market betting, compared to the previous year and also compared to the previous quarter,” said Billings, referring to the last quarter of 2025.
In the segment known as VIP gaming, bets from big players rose 15.9% at Wynn Macau's two casinos, but revenues increased much less, 0.93%, to US$632.7 million.
On average, casinos operating in Macau will seek 3% of bets on the VIP game, but in 2025 this figure has dropped to 2.55% in the case of Wynn Macau.
The so-called mass market continued to be, by far, the main segment for the operator, representing revenues of 2.92 billion dollars, 2.4% more than in 2024.
In 2019, the so-called VIP baccarat game represented 46.2% of the total revenue of Macau casinos. But in 2025 this segment remained at a share of 27.5%, despite absolute revenues having increased by 24.1%. Big bets were affected by the arrest of the leader of the largest VIP betting company in the world, in November 2021, Alvin Chau. The former executive director of Suncity was sentenced in January 2023 to 18 years in prison, in a case that saw the number of gambling promoter licenses issued in Macau drop from 85 to 18.
In a conference call with investors, held after the results were announced, Craig Billings said that “the good momentum in Macau has continued” in 2026, with turnover “slightly above” that recorded at the end of last year. “We remain optimistic about the future of Macau,” said the executive.</description><pubDate>2026-02-15 23:03:30</pubDate></item><item><title>Municipal Kennel: fewer adoptions, more slaughters</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2026/02/15/canil-municipal-menos-adopcoes-mais-abates/</link><description>Last year, the Institute for Municipal Affairs (IAM) slaughtered a total of 491 animals – 158 cats and 333 dogs.

The number of cases of animals involved in aggressions decreased. In 2023, 152 animal attacks were recorded, in 2024 there were 162 and last year there were only 120.

In 2024, 2,588 had been introduced and in 2023 there were 2,140.</description><pubDate>2026-02-15 23:06:32</pubDate></item><item><title>DSAL and Sands China's pioneering plan supports women's professional reintegration</title><link>https://pontofinal-macau.com/2026/02/15/plano-pioneiro-da-dsal-e-sands-china-apoia-reinsercao-profissional-de-mulheres/</link><description>The Directorate of Labor Affairs Services (DSAL), in partnership with Sands China Limited, launched the Professional Reintegration Plan for Women in January 2026, a pioneering project that aims to support residents temporarily away from the job market to resume their careers in a sustainable way and adapted to their personal needs.
The plan, developed in cooperation with the sector of activity, is aimed at women who, for reasons of family assistance or other personal reasons, were away from the labor market. The initiative integrates a set of comprehensive measures, including group support, professional training, work completion sessions and the possibility of flexible schedules, allowing a gradual and personalized transition to the job market.
Recruitment received a total of 379 applications, with 303 participants invited for an interview after a preliminary assessment. Of these, 243 interested parties attended the clarification and interview session, demonstrating interest and the need for programs of this nature.

Sands China made a total of 29 job offers available for this plan, covering 16 different types of functions, ranging from administrative areas and customer service to sales positions and operations at holiday resorts.

One of the most innovative features of the plan, according to DSAL, is the flexibility it offers after completion. Participants can choose to transition to a full-time job or, depending on their needs, personal preferences and career planning, decide to maintain a flexible working arrangement, thus ensuring a balance between professional life and family responsibilities.</description><pubDate>2026-02-15 23:02:29</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
