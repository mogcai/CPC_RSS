In recent months, the results of Sands China have not met expectations in Macao, regardless of Londoner renewal projects restricted the company's hotel offering, admitted the CEO of the Las Vegas Sands (LVS) group, intervening in a session of Bernstein's 41st Annual Decisions Conference, held in New York by the international consultant. "We did not perform as good as we could have had competitively and our last quarter was disappointing, so we expect improvements in our operational philosophy and approach to accelerate our EBITDA - results before interest, taxes, amortization and depreciation - within the limits of Macao's current market," Robert Goldstein said.
In the first quarter of 2025, Sands China's net profits dropped 32% to $ 202 million (1.6 billion to the current exchange rate), in annual terms, and EBITDA gains retreated $ 12.3% to $ 535 million. Net revenues fell 5.7% to $ 1.7 billion.
In contrast to the “strong” evolution in Singapore, Macao operations “should have better performance,” insisted the LVS and Sands China leader, arguing that the group needs to be “more aggressive” to deal with various factors, such as growing internal and regional competition, the rise of online game in Asia and the weakening of visitors, in a market that is now more oriented to direct encouragement and discounts. "We need to compete and be sensitive to the market, and frankly we have not been. We have been good enough, but our numbers are disappointing for me," he confessed.
"We are the largest investor in Macau and we were not rewarded with the returns we would like to see," he said, stressing, on the other hand, that he remains optimistic about the future of the Macao Market.
"In the long run, I still believe that Macau will move between $ 32 billion and $ 34 billion [in game revenues], but this will not happen today or tomorrow, and we are facing difficulties," he said, noting that tourist spending did not follow the growth of visitors. “I had a false belief for a few years that Macao would continue to rise to the $ 30 billion and beyond. I think there are some factors, including consumer feeling - obviously, global economic issues and tariffs do not help - but there are also others. We can not determine how much is linked to online game in Asia and if, for some reason, this is definitely attributed to Macao, which is definitely I found before Covid. The end of the Junket segment did not help either, and of course the competition is fierce, ”he said.
According to Goldstein, the game market "had a good postcovid recovery," however, "now it seems to be stable" around the annual dollar 27-28 billion (218-226 billion patacas) in gross revenues.
 
Trade War generates “confusion” and “concern”
Goldstein also maintained that the US and China should work together to end the current environment of commercial tensions. "The world is in a difficult situation and there is confusion about the bilateral relationship between China and the US, about tariffs and the trajectory of China. It is not an easy place to navigate," he said, stiving that many consumers in both countries "are perplexed or worried."
"If there is no joint relationship between China and the US, the world economy suffers. We all suffer. This ridiculous idea that we will exist alone is insane. We need to have commerce, we need to have a relationship with China and the world. It can not only be with the US or just with China," he warned that "people need more certainties about what tomorrow will bring."
"I hope there is a solution and President Trump and President XI will be able to solve this," Goldstein shot, who will leave the group's lead on March 1, 2026, starting consultant. For its place, the LVS Board of Directors intends to appoint Patrick Dumont, the current director of operations that is son -in -law of Sheldon Adelson, the group's late founder.</description><pubDate>2025-06-03 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Chinese team without rival in the streams of boats</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/equipa-chinesa-sem-rival-nas-regatas-de-barcos-dragao/</link><description>The Chinese rowers of the Nanhai Jiujiang team again dominated the international macao-dragon boat tank top, overcoming the races of men and women.

The expectation of this year a greater opposition to the accredited team Nanhai Jiujiang, a great favorite to win the International Macao Boat Regatas, gave the motto for the third and last day of the event, intended for large vessels. However, as happened in previous editions, both in the male and female category, there was the monopoly of triumphs of formation from Guangdong Province.
From the qualifiers to the final it was evident the power of the Chinese rowers, who triumphed without large opposition in the races of men and women, leaving the teams of Macao and Thailand, respectively.
In the Open category, in addition to the fourth consecutive victory and the 13th overall, Nanhai Jiujiang established a new record of the route, at a distance of 500 meters, with a time of 1,48,673.
The continent's team still felt in the middle of the race some opposition from the mashed team, which recovered some lost ground at the start, but never saw the victory was in danger, ending with almost two seconds of the rivals. The title of runner-up for the formation of the territory proves the growing improvement of local teams, which left vessels with credentials such as Hong Kong, SJM Golden Jubilee, Filipine Federation and Wynn, which have qualified by this order.
In the female class, Nanhai Jiujiang reached the 13th consecutive victory, now with the mark of 1,58,156, although this year has felt some pressure from the Thailand team, which ended just over a second (1,59,341) of the winning formation. Soon after, three selections, Hong Kong, Macao and Philippines, closing Wynn in the sixth post.
The race for higher education students was won by the National University of Sport of Thailand, ahead of Foshan and Nanyang.
The international races, which took place in the waters of Lake Nam Van, took place according to the calendar stipulated by the organization, by the Sport Institute (ID), SJM and the Macau-China-dragon boat association, since it did not rain despite the threats.
The benches of the Nautical Center of Praia Grande were full of spectators, not lacking the usual performance of the animators (“Cheerleaders”) of the representative formations of the game operators, giving a greater color and festivity environment to the event.
After the finals were completed, the tradition of the attribution of banners was fulfilled to the first three classifieds. In the Open class, the flag would be delivered by the chief executive, Sam Hou Fai, to the team of Nanhai Jiujiang.
The Tung NG (Dragon Boat Festival) is one of the typical traditions of Macao, and is also significant for the value in the context of the cultural identity of the Chinese community. With over two thousand years of history, the festival, recognized by UNESCO as an immaterial cultural heritage of humanity, honors Que Yuan, poet and minister of the former state of Chu, who drowned on the Miluo River in an act of patriotic despair in the face of conquering his kingdom by the state of Qin.
This year's edition of races attracted almost 60,000 viewers in the three days of competitions, according to the president of ID. Speaking to “or Mun Tin Toi”, Luís Gomes also said that the evidence brought to the MSAR a total of 3,000 athletes from different continents, and that the authorities intend to continue the event's success during the National Games and other sports manifestations scheduled for this year as the Macao Grand Prix.

At the end of March, Macau employed 183,368 TNR, which corresponds to 93.3% of the number accounted for at the end of December 2019, that is, before the pandemic, according to data from the Public Security Police body published on the DSAL website.

The Portugal Gastronomy and Wine Festival will take place between June 8 and 15.

Three cooks, led by chef Justa Nobre, will make typical Portuguese dishes at the Military Club restaurant, between June 8 and 15, in another annual edition of the initiative “Festival of Gastronomy and Vinhos de Portugal”. Invited to return to the event, where he was in 2012 and 2016, Justo Nobre will come this feat accompanied by Ana Graça and Teresa Seixas, who work at the restaurant O Nobre, in Lisbon, owned by Justa Nobre.
During the period when they will be in the kitchen of the Military Club restaurant, the cook's trio will provide various dishes, probably from various regions of the country, to customers and visitors of that gastronomic space.
“Portuguese food has no borders, but usually the chefs who visit us are rich in their original cuisine,” he told the Journal of Macau Manuel Geraldes, responsible for the restoration area of ​​the Military Club. Being a transmontana of birth, it is likely that just noble disseminate some dishes from that region of Portugal.
Known for reinventing the good Portuguese kitchen, fair nobleman always had the concern to use new and quality products in making their recipes.
Many of the inspirations and flavors that have always accompanied it have been with it since its origin, in Trás-os-Montes. “The colors and textures of the ingredients enchant it and inspire it in each recipe, and seasonality is another relevant factor in its choices, to ensure that ingredients are served at the right time, with all their characteristics intact,” says a site of Portuguese gastronomic criticism, adding that “their permanent curiosity always makes them look for foods with a creative perspective, making them versatiles. And creating new recipes, but always without losing sight of what is traditional, what is ours (Portuguese) ”.

Manuel Geraldes refers to a press conference, to hold days before the starting of the initiative, the main details of the menus that will be presented by the chef, but highlights the main objectives of the festival. Above all, it underlines, it serves to “promote Portuguese food”, which has been happening at the Military Club restaurant for several consecutive years.
However, the formation component is equally important, since “it gives our cooks to update themselves,” he acknowledges. "All cooks and kitchen staff are Philippines and this allows them to review dishes and menus, besides producing new dishes, updating what they learned when these Portuguese chefs first came for the first time," he explained.
Because the team is composed, this time, only by women, the Military Club leader emphasizes that this has to do with the choices of the invited chef to form his team. "We address an invitation to a chef, the rest of the elements is his entire responsibility," he said.
It is recalled that Justa Nobre received the career 2023 award, which releases the best restaurants and hotels in Portugal. The reward serves to distinguish a personality that has contributed decisively to the development and affirmation of the country's gastronomy and restoration, with a professional life dedicated to this sector and with broad recognition by the community.

In a new turnaround on the script, as Colombia Ambassador in Beijing, now commands a historical rapprochement between the two countries.
The 75 -year -old film director, then a teenager, arrived in 1963 to the Chinese capital with his parents, convinced communists who moved clandestinely to teach Spanish in the kingdom of Mao Tse Tung. Six decades later, its diplomatic mission in Beijing is a new "stimulating and very exciting" chapter, in a very distinct city, full of skyscrapers and electric vehicles, the capital of the second largest economy in the world.
“Comparatively Bogota, Beijing was a village,” recalls Cabrera in an interview with the AFP at the Colombia embassy in Beijing, decorated with posters from his films.
"It was a city of one floor, there were no avenues, there were no cars, people dressed all the same. It was a poor country. I remember my sister telling me," Why did the father bring us here? "
“Now this country is a country full of abundance, possibilities, where there is everything,” he says.
In the early 1960s, the drastic renovation implemented by Mao to modernize the agrarian economy, which left millions of hungry. In the streets of Beijing, people fixed toothbrushes and recharged pencils. Even they, with their foreigners' privileges, needed coupons to buy flour or clothes.
“I've been here as an ambassador for over two years. And I still go through places and say, 'No way,” says the man whose life has been captured by his compatriot Juan Gabriel Vásquez in the book' Volver La Vista behind '.
In that precarious and convulsive seal, Cabrera learned Mandarin, who still uses, and participated as a red guard of the cultural revolution, the violent movement promoted by Mao against the capitalist and bourgeois influence.
After training with the popular liberation army, he returned to Colombia to join the guerrillas, from which he left four years later "deeply disappointed." “I realized that there was a tendency to mythomania, to invent that we were very powerful and believing it,” he reflects.
Then he returned to China, where he studied at university before devoting himself to what was always his dream: cinema.
With films with strong political connotations, such as “The Snail’s Strategy”, he found “ways to revolutionize” the public's mind. “I said, 'Since I can't do it the hard way, or with bullets, I'll do it in the good way,'” he explains with a glow in the green eyes that appears when he talks about cinema.
Cabrera loves to "create worlds" on the big screen, but your new job is to deal with the real world. President Gustavo Petro, a former guerrilla like him, entrusted him with the mission of strengthening relations between Colombia, historically aligned with the US, and the Asian giant.
“From diplomacy, I can't make a revolution, but I can continue with the idea of ​​somehow conveying an improvement in the bilateral relationship between Colombia and China,” he says with determination.
