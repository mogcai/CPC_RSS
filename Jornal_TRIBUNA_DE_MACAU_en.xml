The Secretary for Security guaranteed that the diploma “will bring benefits” to ordinary citizens and “will not affect daily life, work and freedom of expression”, aiming to prevent threats, including non-traditional ones, to national security
 
With all 32 votes in favor, the Legislative Assembly (AL) approved yesterday, in general, the proposed law entitled “Commission for the Defense of State Security of the Macao SAR (CDSE)”. In the presentation, the Secretary for Security, Chan Tsz King, reinforced the objective of “clarifying the legal position” of the Commission and “highlighting the seriousness and authority of the CDSE in matters relating to the defense of national security”.
The diploma encompasses the nature, duties, powers and composition of the CDSE, which will have the power to issue opinions with binding effects.
In the discussion, seven deputies asked questions, including Leong Hong Sai, who wanted to know the impact of this law on the lives of ordinary Macau citizens. In response, the Secretary for Security guaranteed that the diploma “will not affect the daily life, work, freedom of expression, among all aspects, of ordinary citizens”. The law “will bring benefits to ordinary citizens and not disadvantages”, he assured.
“I believe that the citizens of Macau in general, who respect the law, will obtain a more fundamental and important legal guarantee, which will serve as a legal cornerstone for the security and stability of the country and a fundamental guarantee for the good life of residents”, highlighted Chan Tsz King. As he argued, “a more improved and efficient legal regime” allows “fostering a safer and more stable social environment for Macau”, protecting the city from unrest and ensuring the continued development of the economy, the security of citizens’ lives and property and their legitimate rights and interests.
However, "individuals with bad intentions, anti-China and disruptors of Macau certainly do not want this law to be approved. This is exactly what we need to combat. It is necessary to defend the tranquility and stability of society", he stressed.
The bill calls for the inclusion of all five Secretaries, the president of the Cultural Institute (IC) and the directors of the Games Inspection and Coordination (DICJ) and Education and Youth Development Services (DSEDJ), among other Government representatives, in the composition of the CDSE. Chan Tsz King clarified that this decision is related to the fact that “the concept of national security has already surpassed the traditional concepts of territorial integrity and military security, but now encompasses economic, cultural, social security, among other non-traditional areas”.
Regarding the integration of DICJ, IC and DSEDJ into the Commission, the Secretary indicated that the gaming sector is “very important” for the local economy, while education and culture are “crucial areas” to consolidate the public's knowledge about State security, develop patriotic education and cultivate new generations with love for the Fatherland and Macau.
For the Secretary, the direct participation of the respective leaders in the Commission's work aims to strengthen the cultural, educational and youth areas, preventing non-traditional threats to State security. “This also means that, in the future, national security work will, on the one hand, attach importance to the construction of ‘hard power’, and on the other hand, will value the creation of ‘soft power’, reinforcing Macau’s economic security and preventing the infiltration of harmful ideologies”, he highlighted.
 
New requirement for lawyers “does not aim to take away the right to defense”
On the other hand, the proposal requires the prior obtaining of special authorization so that lawyers can deal with cases related to State security. From the judge's decision on whether or not to authorize the judicial representative to handle the case - and based on the CDSE's “binding verification opinion”, there is no claim or contentious appeal.
In this aspect, the Secretary argued that it is important to prevent national security from being affected or harmed through the conduct of judicial representatives, noting that there are similar regimes in the laws for the elections of the AL and the Chief Executive.
The diploma “does not aim to take away the right of defense of the parties involved” and “does not mean a cancellation of the qualification to practice the profession of lawyers”, he stressed. “Anyone who participates in legal proceedings related to national security must be subject to verification… it is as if a protective barrier was being built”, he highlighted, arguing that, with the introduction of this requirement, the regime in general will be “improved” to “guarantee that national security is not threatened, in any way, during litigation”.
Furthermore, he highlighted that not allowing complaints and contentious appeals against the CDSE opinion “is a very natural political arrangement”, since “State security is the responsibility of the Central Government”. “The CDSE’s decisions and rulings are based on the consideration of national security at a macro level, involving decisions by the Central Government, and the Macao SAR judicial body does not have the power to review the CDSE’s decisions,” he added.
In general, Chan Tsz King argued that, “with the deepening of the general perspective of national security and the complex and constantly changing international situations, it is necessary, through law, to regulate the CDSE, to adapt to the needs and requirements of current work” in this field.
On the other hand, in an article published yesterday in the newspaper “Ou Mun”, the Macau Lawyers Association considered that the improvement of the CDSE regime is “necessary and reasonable”.</description><pubDate>2026-02-11 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Regular pedestrian zones during festive periods</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/zonas-pedonais-cariz-regular-nos-periodos-festivos/</link><description>Starting this year, the Government will regularly implement pedestrian zones in places with the highest concentration of tourists, such as the old quarter of Taipa and Rua de Nossa Senhora do Amparo, in the Central Zone of the city. In addition to Chinese New Year, pedestrian spaces will be established on May 1st and National Day holidays. The objective is to guide tourists and residents to visit and consume in different neighborhoods and their surrounding areas

As a result of previously implemented measures, starting this year, the Government intends to regularly create pedestrian zones, not only in the old area of ​​Taipa, but also on Rua de Nossa Senhora do Amparo, in the Central Zone of Macau. Festive periods will cover Chinese New Year and the May 1st and National Day holidays in October.
According to a note released jointly by several services, the decision to open car-free areas to pedestrians aims to “guide tourists and residents to visit and consume in different neighborhoods and their surrounding areas”.
For the upcoming Lunar Year of the Horse festivities, authorities confirm the creation of pedestrian zones in the old quarter of Taipa and Rua de Nossa Senhora do Amparo, between the 17th and 22nd of February (from the 1st to the 6th day of the first month of the lunar calendar), daily from 12:00 pm to 7:00 pm, providing, “with this modality, a more comfortable and safe travel environment”.
The scope of the pedestrian zone in the old quarter of Taipa will be located in the area between the intersection of Rua de Fernão Mendes Pinto and Rua do Supico (former Piscina do Carmo bus stop) and the intersection of Correia da Silva and Governador Tamagnini Barbosa streets (next to the Taipa and Coloane History Museum).
In turn, the pedestrian space to be implemented on Rua de Nossa Senhora do Amparo will cover this entire artery next to the Ruins of São Paulo and some section of Rua da Tercena.
The creation of pedestrian zones in that period continues to be promoted in cooperation and coordination between the Directorate of Economic and Technological Development Services, the Institute for Municipal Affairs, the Directorate of Tourism Services, the Public Security Police Corps, the Fire Department, the Cultural Institute and the Directorate of Services for Traffic Affairs, as well as civil and commercial associations.
The statement states, on the other hand, that the special bus service will be continuously provided within the Taipa pedestrian zone. In the three designated locations there will also be a service available to residents with reduced mobility, with free round-trip transport between the temporary stops.
As for the public bus service, between the 17th and 22nd of February, daily, from 11 am, the four stops in the old quarter of Taipa will be temporarily deactivated and the routes of several routes will be changed. Buses serving the Rua de Nossa Senhora do Amparo area will continue to operate normally.
Regarding the activities organized to celebrate the Chinese New Year, during the same period, daily from 1pm to 6pm, typical fairs, shows, interactive tent games, workshops and distribution of blessings will be available in those locations.
Also in the area between the intersection of Largo do Pagode do Bazar and Rua de Cinco de Outubro, there will be the Pagode do Bazar Night Market, which will operate between the 21st and 22nd of February, daily from 6pm to 9pm.</description><pubDate>2026-02-11 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Foreign investment in the Macao SAR between optimism and caution</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/investimento-estrangeiro-na-raem-entre-optimismo-cautela/</link><description>Foreign businesspeople surveyed by the European Chamber of Commerce of Macau revealed “cautious optimism” regarding the economic development of the Macao SAR, even despite recognizing the existence of “certain global economic challenges”. Respondents, whose companies operate in the Macao SAR, highlighted the “positive opportunities” in “technological innovation, regional integration and talent mobility”
 
PEDRO MILHEIRÃO
Foreign investors maintain “cautious optimism” regarding the economic prospects of Macau and neighboring regions, according to the results of a survey by the Macau European Chamber of Commerce (MECC). Respondents recognize “positive opportunities particularly in technological innovation, regional integration and talent mobility”, according to a MECC statement sent to this newspaper, even taking into account “certain global economic challenges”.
The “Business Sentiment Survey” report, presented at the University of São José (USJ), aims to “systematically understand the views and expectations of companies with foreign connections operating in Macau regarding the local economic environment, policy trends, and regional cooperation”.
More specifically, it sought to “precisely facilitate the participation of companies with strategic links in the adequate economic diversification of Macau”.
The results of the study demonstrate a “moderately better” outlook for the economy. Compared to 2024, companies demonstrated “a slight recovery” in their business prospects for 2025, with neutral or positive positions on regional economic integration.
Furthermore, most companies indicated that they intend to maintain or slightly increase investment in Macau, focusing on new sources of revenue and partnerships.
From the point of view of technological innovation, 70% of respondents revealed that they prioritize technology and artificial intelligence in their research and development and an “active commitment to trends in the digital economy”. Respondents also stated that the political environments of the European Union or the US “have a minimal impact” on operations in Macau.
They also recognized the advantages of Hengqin, in terms of costs and access to the Mainland Chinese market, with more than 60% having established contracts or partnerships with Mainland institutions, within the scope of Greater Bay Area regional cooperation.
For Jenny Phillips, dean of the Faculty of Management and Law at USJ, “the data reflects the adaptability and predictions of companies in a complex environment”. “Particularly in investing in technology and regional integration, the companies demonstrated a clear path aligned with the development strategies of Macau and the country”, he added, cited in a statement.
From the perspective of Rui Pedro Cunha, vice-president of MECC, the purpose of the survey was to “identify opportunities and challenges that companies with foreign connections face in Macau” beyond “informal sentiment” and “gain a clear, data-driven understanding of the current business climate”.
Cunha stressed that the “Chamber will continue to serve as a bridge, fostering multifaceted cooperation and dialogue, in order to support companies with foreign connections in taking advantage of development opportunities within the scope of Macau's ongoing process of economic diversification”.
The survey was conducted between June and August last year, in collaboration with the USJ Faculty of Management and Law, and collected 27 valid responses from chamber member companies.</description><pubDate>2026-02-11 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Requests from SMEs for subsidized credit involve 3.8 billion patacas</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/pedidos-das-pme-para-credito-bonificado-envolvem-38-mil-milhoes-de-patacas/</link><description>Local SMEs made 1,804 requests under the Bank Credit Interest Subsidy Plan, of which 93% were approved. According to DSEDT, they involve a credit of 3.8 billion patacas and an interest subsidy amount of 460 million. The organization will study extending the application deadline, which ends in April

Launched in April last year, the Bank Credit Interest Bonus Plan for Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs) attracted, until January 21st of this year, 1,804 requests, of which 1,682 were approved, representing 93% of the total, revealed the Directorate of Economics and Technological Development Services (DSEDT). The requests involve “a credit amount of around 3.8 billion patacas and an interest subsidy amount of around 460 million patacas”, says the organization's deputy director, Cheang Hio Man.
It should be noted that the plan grants qualified commercial entrepreneurs a maximum credit limit of 5 million patacas, with an interest subsidy of 4% for a period of three years, with 10 billion patacas being the maximum limit for the amount of bank credit to be subsidized.
Applications for the plan remain open until April 22nd of this year. However, DSEDT indicates, in response to a question from deputy Ngan Iek Hang, that it will study, “in due time, the feasibility of extending the application deadline”. At the same time, Cheang Hio Man assures that the organization “will continue to maintain close collaboration with the banking sector, accelerating the loan assessment and authorization process”, also evaluating the effectiveness of the plan.
Cheang Hio Man also states that, “taking into account that the operational situation of SMEs continues to be affected by the delayed effects of the pandemic and other internal and external factors”, the Monetary Authority “has already held several meetings with the Macau Banks Association, having expressly expressed its support for banks, respecting the principle of prudent risk management, to provide customers in need with adequate credit support”.
This scope includes measures such as interest-only payments, without capital amortization; payment of interest with partial amortization of the capital; adjustment of the repayment period and/or interest payment period; or even full debt restructuring, can be read in the response. The idea, adds DSEDT, is “to ease the pressure on customers regarding capital amortization, giving them some time to resolve exploration difficulties and, at the same time, creating space for modernization and reconversion of their development”.
With regard to consumption in community neighborhoods, and to “increase market confidence”, DSEDT adds that, together with industrial and commercial associations, it has launched promotions, such as the “Consumption Grand Prize”, which have contributed, “in a certain way, to the dynamization of the Macau consumer market”.
Regarding the discounts launched on the occasion of the Macao SAR's anniversary, between December 20th and 22nd, and which were attended by more than 500 catering establishments, Cheang Hio Man indicated that, during the three days, benefits worth a total of around 8.27 million patacas were distributed (half of which was borne by the Government and traders), generating an associated consumption amount of over 30 million. Remember that the discounts offered to residents were 30%.</description><pubDate>2026-02-11 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Macao SAR supports white paper on national security</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/ultimas/raem-apoia-livro-branco-sobre-seguranca-nacional/</link><description>Several high-ranking Macao SAR officials yesterday demonstrated support for the white paper released by China's State Council, entitled “Safeguarding National Security in Hong Kong Under the ‘One Country, Two Systems’ Principle”, in which Beijing justifies the sentence of activist Jimmy Lai to 20 years in prison.
The president of the Court of Final Instance emphasized that “the defense of national security is a competence of the Central Government and, simultaneously, a constitutional responsibility of the SAR”. “Judicial bodies will continue to enhance their professional skills, ensuring that, in a complex and changing international context, Macau Justice can simultaneously effectively maintain national security and sufficiently protect the fundamental rights of residents, ensuring that both are mutually reinforcing,” added Song Man Lei.
The President of the Legislative Assembly, André Cheong, stated that “at this crucial turning point for Hong Kong, from chaos to order and prosperity”, the white paper “serves to clarify all sectors of society, including those in Hong Kong and Macau, as well as the international community”, ensuring “a full and correct understanding of the practice of safeguarding national security”.
In the same vein, the Macao SAR Government Secretaries pointed out that the white paper “clearly clarifies the Central Government’s principled position in firmly safeguarding national security and defending the ‘one country, two systems’ principle”.
In the white paper, Chinese authorities argue that political and social stability in the region is only possible with a “robust” legal system, which prevents external interference and the infiltration of “hostile forces”. “National security is the cornerstone of the peace and stability of Hong Kong, as well as the well-being of its inhabitants”, reads the more than 30-page document, released by the Chinese Government Information Office.
Beijing accuses foreign powers of “abusing human rights as a pretext to undermine China” and directly criticizes Western countries that “encouraged or tolerated” the 2019 pro-democracy protests, described as “an almost insurrectionary attempt to destabilize Hong Kong”. According to the State Council, the implementation of the National Security Law, in June 2020, made it possible to “restore order” and “correct deep flaws in the region’s legal system”.
The white paper cites a series of measures adopted since then, including the creation of new police units, a special liaison office with Beijing and the appointment of judges for security-sensitive cases.
The document presents the case of Jimmy Lai, founder of the Apple Daily newspaper, as an example of strengthening law enforcement and responding to threats to national sovereignty. Lai was convicted on Monday of conspiring with foreign forces and publishing content considered seditious.

Before voting in the Legislative Assembly, jurists warned, in statements to Lusa, of the Government's obligation to consult the Lawyers' Association about the diploma
 
The Macau Government stated yesterday that it had consulted “the legal sector” on the proposed law for the State Security Defense Commission, without specifying whether it was the Lawyers Association (AAM), which is legally obliged to listen.
“Regarding the changes to the Budgetary Framework Law and the Basic Law of the Judicial Organization, we have already heard the technical opinions of the financial services, judicial bodies and the legal sector of the Macao SAR, and it was possible to reach a consensus”, declared the Secretary for Security during the presentation of the law that will regulate the Commission for the Defense of State Security (CDSE), generally approved by the Legislative Assembly (AL). However, Chan Tsz King did not indicate which entities were consulted or what this consensus consisted of.
Jurists warned, in statements to Lusa and even before the vote in the AL, that the Government was obliged to consult the AAM.
This proposal determines the duties, composition and functioning of the CDSE, the body responsible for matters relating to the defense of State security in Macau, and subject to the supervision of the Central Government. Anticipating changes to the Basic Law of the Judicial Organization, the document determines that the choice of a lawyer for national security cases is subject to the approval of a judge, who forwards the request to the CDSE, so that it can issue a binding and non-appealable opinion.
Lusa had questioned AAM before the vote about whether it had been contacted and whether it had issued any opinion regarding the proposed law in question, but received no response. The Secretariat for Security also did not respond to a similar request for clarification.
Before presenting the proposed law, “the Government was legally obliged to listen” to the AMM, under the Lawyer's Statute, highlighted jurist António Katchi. Article 30 of this statute establishes that the AAM “shall be consulted on proposals or draft diplomas that regulate the judicial organization, the practice of law, civil proceedings and criminal proceedings”.
"The explanatory note makes no mention of this consultation. I do not know whether or not this formality was complied with and, if so, what the content of the association's opinion would have been," said Katchi.
Lawyer Pedro Leal, who considers this “a pertinent issue”, says that “it is possible that [the AAM] was not” consulted. “Normally it is public to know who contacted her”, he says.
"It's possible that it wasn't, I wish it had been, to look at the Lawyers Association as a public association, but independent of political power. That's how it has to be, that's how it should be", he notes.
Also according to the proposed law, the request for authorization for a lawyer to represent a national security case in court must be “accompanied by the forensic power of attorney, proof of the applicant's capacity as agent, information relating to household members, nationality and connection with bodies or individuals abroad and others”.
Special authorization, the Government proposes, can occur in criminal or other proceedings, when “there are well-founded reasons to believe that there is a need to protect the interests of State security”. It is also stipulated that the work of the CDSE is “free from any interference from other entities or individuals in the Macao SAR”, “the information relating to these will not be public”.
It will be up to the judges to decide whether the trials will be held behind closed doors, still according to the proposal, “taking into account the damage that publicity may cause to the interests of State security”.
 
“Disturbing aspects” of constitutional functioning
On the other hand, analysts interviewed by Lusa consider the proposed law for the Commission for the Defense of State Security to be unconstitutional, highlighting “disturbing aspects”, such as restrictions on the appointment of lawyers in national security cases.
The document, according to lawyer Luís Almeida Pinto, “contains disturbing aspects of the constitutional functioning of various powers, and also in some matters of rights, freedoms and guarantees enshrined in the Macau ‘Constitution’: the Basic Law”.
Almeida Pinto evokes the Basic Law, which guarantees “access to the Law, the courts, and assistance from a lawyer in the defense of their legitimate rights and interests”, to point out that it is up to the defendant “to freely choose the lawyer who best serves them”. “It seems like a rule that will be unconstitutional when approved, and when applied in practice”, he explains.
In addition to understanding that this is “a violation of the Basic Law”, Pedro Leal, who has practiced law in the territory for several decades, points out “clearly, a collision” between what is proposed and “the decree that regulates the Lawyers Association and the Statute” of the Lawyer, with regard to the free choice of a defender. This is the “most debatable issue” of the proposal, assumes Leal, who says he agrees with the legislative initiative.
"China pays special attention to security issues, it is a world power, as such it does not want interference in any way. I understand the position and I understand that it does not want changes to the 'status quo'. (…) Now, they want to do things, do them well", he adds.
Almeida Pinto also considers the regime envisaged to be “unacceptable” for “inquiries to be made to lawyers” who wish to legally represent a defendant in national security cases. This is because, attached to the request made by the agents to the judge, there must be, among other elements, information regarding the members of the lawyer's household, nationality and connection with organizations or individuals abroad.
This is a “real investigation into personal life”, when “what is only at stake is the exercise of the profession for which he is duly registered and authorized by the Macau Lawyers Association”, he says.
The requirement, “in addition to being extremely vague, is perfectly impossible” to implement, assesses Leal, who suggests “it is implicit” that a non-Chinese lawyer will not be authorized representation in these cases – it should be noted that in cases of national security, only the intervention of Chinese judges is now permitted.
Another doubt, raised to Lusa by jurist António Katchi, concerns the time it will take for the CDSE to issue the opinion. The proposal does not clarify this aspect, so the Code of Administrative Procedure “should” be applied, which sets the deadline for acts to be carried out by administrative bodies at 15 days.
But, says Katchi, “will the CDSE follow this same understanding or will it consider (without the possibility of this being denied by any court) that it can simply leave the issue to its next semi-annual ordinary meeting?”. If the opinion is negative and it is necessary to repeat the process, with a new legal representative, “how many months or years will the defendant remain deprived of his liberty, without a lawyer”?
Alluding to the principle of judicial independence, which he recalls is guaranteed by the Basic Law, António Katchi deduces “with complete certainty, the inadmissibility of subjecting a judicial decision to a binding opinion from an administrative body, namely the CDSE”.
The professor also talks about the importance of a relationship of trust between constituent and lawyer and “how vital it is, for a person at risk of a prison sentence, to be defended by a lawyer who is sincerely motivated by the cause and well versed in the matter involved”.
In addition to the Basic Law and the Joint Declaration, signed by Lisbon and Beijing in 1987, and which defined rules for Macau after the transition of administration, Katchi highlights another legal provision that the proposal contradicts: the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), according to which, he quotes, “every person accused of a crime shall have the right, in full equality, (…) to present himself at trial and to defend himself in person or to be assisted by a defender of your choice.”
The ICCPR is one of the instruments that constitute the UN International Bill of Human Rights. In 1992, when Macau was still a territory administered by Portugal, Lisbon extended this convention to the region. Although China signed the treaty in 1998, it never ratified it, and is not bound by its rules.
The Basic Law, explains António Katchi, points out that restrictions on fundamental rights, including the right to be assisted by a lawyer, “cannot contradict the provisions of the ICCPR”.

At the end of December last year, 1,101 “fully electric or hybrid” taxis were circulating on Macau's roads, that is, powered by diesel and electricity, “representing around 76% of the total number of taxis” in the territory, said the director of the Environmental Protection Services (DSPA), Ip Kuong Lam, in response to a question from Lam Lon Wai. It should be noted that the new licenses issued stipulate that the awarded companies must “use light cars with a capacity of six passengers or more, which are hybrid or powered by environmentally friendly energy”.
As for buses, the two operators had 966 new energy vehicles in circulation, representing around 96% of the total number of public buses, according to the Directorate of Services for Traffic Affairs (DSAT), which ensures that it “will continue to promote the increase in the number of fully electric buses in both operators”.
Also according to DSAT, currently, “more than 90% of shuttle buses in hotels and casinos are powered by new energy or environmentally friendly energy, of which more than 160 are completely electric”.
Although there are currently no plans to launch financial support for the replacement of vehicles with new electric cars, the director of DSPA recalls that “the Macao SAR Government has been implementing a series of measures aimed at promoting electric vehicles”.
Ip Kuong Lam points out that the Electric Vehicle Promotion Plan presents the objectives and policies and measures to promote the use of electric vehicles, noting that “the specifications and distribution of charging and battery exchange facilities are being progressively improved, and charging tariffs have already been adjusted”.
In addition, it is planned to install super-charging stations for light and heavy vehicles at COTAI by mid-2026.
“The Macao SAR Government continues to evaluate the use of electric vehicles in Macau and will review the effectiveness of the aforementioned Plan in due course, in order to boost the transformation of land transport to a low-carbon emission model”, adds Ip Kuong Lam.

The historic and tourist area of ​​Barra will host a creative exhibition until March 8th, where the public can enjoy 30 works designed by students who participated in the “Talent Training in Cultural and Creative Design of the Maritime Silk Road” program.
The year-long activity was based at the MGM Poly Museum, which served as an academic training center, and had the collaboration of the teaching team from the Palace Museum and the Beijing Institute of Fashion Technology. The events were extended to five major cities along the Maritime Silk Road.
Through a “systematic training model that integrates cultural theory, field studies and design practice”, the program “injected new impetus into the training of cultural and creative talents”, according to a statement from MGM.
More than a comprehensive presentation of the program's results, the exhibition also represents a “vivid demonstration” of Macau's strategic role as a base for the “coexistence of diverse cultures centered on Chinese culture as the dominant current, contributing to the national strategy of cultural development”, highlights the text.
After 60 days of intensive training and months of refinement, the original creative works are presented in this exhibition, which is structured around six thematic chapters and presents diverse explorations of the Maritime Silk Road through cultural interpretation, design translation and contemporary artistic expression.
The works cover cultural and creative products, fashion design, painting, sculpture and multimedia installations. “These works demonstrate the creative transformation from tradition to contemporaneity, while at the same time injecting renewed artistic vitality into the Barra area, rich in history”, adds the MGM note.
At the opening ceremony, Pansy Ho, president and chief executive officer of MGM China Holdings, said that participants in the training “translated history and culture into works of contemporary aesthetic value and cultural confidence”, adding that “this ability to fuse traditional heritage with modern expression is the essential skill needed to propel the cultural and creative industries from the realm of production to that of creation”.
In order to “further promote collaboration between creativity and industry”, an intersectoral exchange session was held on the opening day, bringing together professionals from the cultural and creative areas, design, tourism, branding and others for face-to-face discussions with participants.
The moments of sharing, which served to boost the advancement of the Silk Road civilization, “explored paths for commercialization, branding and interdisciplinary collaboration”, developing an “organic connection” between the “creativity-design-industry” chain, reinforces the game operator's statement.
The extension of the project, held at the Poly MGM Museum, provided an exchange of experiences, with the presence of Lou Jie, researcher at Dunhuang Academy, and Chu Yan, professor at BIFT, as main speakers, who interacted with the public in the area surrounding the museum. Discussions delved into topics such as the contemporary transformation of Silk Road aesthetics.</description><pubDate>2026-02-11 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Fairs in Thailand and Indonesia reinforced investment in Southeast Asia</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/feiras-na-tailandia-indonesia-reforcaram-aposta-sudeste-asiatico/</link><description>Macau continued its investment in the Southeast Asian market by being present at the international tourism fairs in Bangkok and Jakarta. In both events, DST promoted workshops, dance shows, gastronomic areas and cultural heritage
 
The Tourism Services Directorate (DST) was represented at two major international events, which took place in the capitals of Thailand and Indonesia, offering stands to promote and sell tourist products. The organization thus continued the “promotional offensive” in the Southeast Asian market, consolidating the territory’s image as a “short-distance tourist destination”.
The campaigns were carried out by connecting popular intellectual property (IP) characters from the two markets and the official Macau tourism mascot “Mak Mak”, in combination with diverse interactive stalls. In Bangkok, the mascot established a cooperation with the popular Thai IP “Warbie Yama”, who were together on stage, livening up the atmosphere in the fair space and combining with installations for taking photos in tourist attractions in Macau, interactive games, workshops on ecological bags, dance shows and characteristic gastronomic areas.
The Macau stand attracted around 24,000 visitors during the four-day exhibition. Travel agencies, booking platforms and Thai airlines, together with tour operators from Macau and Hengqin, participated in the promotion with “multi-destination” preferred tourist products from the Macao SAR, to encourage Thai visitors to visit the territory.
Consumers who purchased tourism products had the opportunity to receive prizes from “Mak Mak”, “Mak Mak x Warbie Yama” and POP MART “Molly Space Macau limited edition”.
After the Thailand Tourism Fair, the DST delegation traveled to Jakarta to participate in the Indonesia International Tourism Fair (ASTINDO Travel Fair), one of the largest of its kind in the country. Last year, the organization collaborated with the characters “Tahilalats”, in a street promotion, and this time the collaboration was renewed, with the Macau stand designed with the theme “Mak Mak x Tahilalats”.
The initiative aimed to promote the world heritage of Macau, a city of gastronomy, events, the “Macau for Muslim Travelers – Halal Travel Guide”, among others, “closely following the tastes of local young people and reinforcing the content of promotional actions, in order to obtain greater results”, can be read in the DST note.
In line with the promotion, a “Tahilalats” video was released on social media, having already attracted 1.47 million views. On the other hand, presentation and interaction sessions were also promoted with the Indonesian public and actions were carried out together with operators, in order to publicize Macau's tourist products.
In 2025, visitors from Thailand and Indonesia were among Macau's top five international markets, with 208,000 and 186,000 respectively, up 13.6 and 38.1% year-on-year.

He therefore dismissed a review, which had been requested by Leong Pou U
 
The Government ruled out a review of the current social risk value adjustment mechanism, after deputy Leong Pou U said it was “urgent” to review the minimum subsistence index. The value, 4,340 patacas, was last adjusted in January 2020.
In response to the question, the president of the Institute of Social Action (IAS), Hon Wai, states that the organization “carries out assessments and proposes suggestions, twice a year, on the value of social risk”, in accordance with the current mechanism. “Despite having recorded a relatively low inflation rate in recent years and slight deflation in certain periods, accordingly, the Macao SAR has kept the value of social risk unchanged”, he adds.
Stressing that the current adjustment mechanism is the result of a study commissioned by the Macao SAR Government and carried out by a local academic institution in 2011, Hon Wai also recalls that the IAS carried out reviews in 2014 and 2019, with the aim of understanding whether adjusting the mechanism could provide basic guarantees to vulnerable groups.
To check whether the evaluation result obtained through the review of the adjustment mechanism is close to the trend of the IPC-A during the respective period, which aims to achieve the objective of guaranteeing vulnerable groups in 2025, the IAS carried out the review work on the mechanism again, which includes: “comparison between the result of the evaluation of the adjustment mechanism over the years and the IPC-A of the corresponding periods, analysis of the change in the IPC-A of recent years in Macau and consumption expenditure situation per household, carrying out surveys on day-to-day expenses by households benefiting from the regular subsidy, as well as interviews with experts and academics from higher education institutions and the relevant area”.
The work was completed at the end of last year. “After the global assessment, with the recognition of the experts and academics interviewed, the current adjustment mechanism is scientific and can protect the daily living needs of families who are in a vulnerable situation”, says Hon Wai.
“In the future, the IAS will continue to carry out the assessment based on the aforementioned adjustment mechanism and pay attention to changes in the inflation situation, in order to propose suggestions on the adjustment of social risk in a timely manner”, adds the president of the IAS, also recalling that there is a series of subsidies and support for vulnerable families and which serve as “a minimum guarantee”.

According to O Lam, Secretary for Social Affairs and Culture, the Government will accept medical certificates issued by professionals from Mainland China who work in the Deep Cooperation Zone between Guangdong and Macau in Hengqin, “as long as they have a license”, within the scope of granting sickness benefit.
Wong Chon Kit asked O Lam about expanding the support regime for patients with certificates issued by institutions in Hengqin, since “Doctors from the Interior who work in the Cooperation Zone have different rules or criteria than those in Macau”.
Nick Lei also asked whether any sanctioning mechanism is foreseen in the event of irregularities in the granting of medical certificates. Lam explained that the Social Security Fund (FSS) “already has a working mechanism with the authorities of the Cooperation Zone”.
Representative Nick Lei also asked how long approvals would take. According to Chan Pou Wan, president of the FSS Board of Directors, the work could be done by the Board itself, which now meets twice a week, as “there are more cases of requests now”.
Regarding the inclusion of workers, students or residents of Hengqin to count the days spent in Macau, Ngan Iek Hang asked the Government whether the regime will be extended to Macau residents who live in other areas of the Greater Bay Area. Lam clarified that “this regime does not include the Greater Bay Area”.
The Secretary also stated that “after leaving Macau, a declaration must be made”. Chan Pou Wan also said that “the requirements for issuing proof of residence are strict” and that “collaboration with the Hengqin authorities will be strengthened”.
Furthermore, “facilitating measures for elderly people with reduced mobility” will be further improved”, added the FSS head. Lam said that these measures include the introduction of self-service kiosks in Hengqin and the exemption of fees for receiving the elderly pension.
In the same session, proposals to change the legal regime for urban construction and the law creating the Institute for Municipal Affairs were also approved.

The conversation will be conducted in Portuguese, by José Luís de Sales Marques
 
The new cycle of conferences under the theme “Being Macanese in the 21st Century – Culture, Tradition, Identity, Challenges” brings another session to the Rui Cunha Foundation (FRC), the third, this time entitled “Macanese Gastronomy and the Challenges of its Dissemination”. The conversation is scheduled for this afternoon, at 6:30 pm.
The session will be led by José Luís de Sales Marques, president of the Council of Macanese Communities, bringing together as guest speakers chefs Antonieta Manhão (Neta), professor of Macanese cuisine at the Macau Tourism University; Florita Alves, from La Famiglia Restaurant; Marina Senna Fernandes, from Restaurante Macaísta; and Sónia Palmer, from Cozinha D. Aida, “four distinguished local representatives of the arts of traditional culinary preparation”, according to the FRC note.
"Macanese Gastronomy is recognized for its originality, transporting its flavors and aromas to the four corners of the world, where the Portuguese traveled. It is a harvest from the global world and, therefore, deservedly considered the first fusion cuisine in the world", says the organization, pointing out that it is, for this reason, "also a singular landmark of the Macanese identity, and intangible heritage of Macau and the People's Republic of China, making a significant contribution to the classification of Macau, by UNESCO in 2017, as a Creative City of Gastronomy”.
However, “there is still a long distance between recognition and its dissemination, making it accessible to the general public”, adds the statement. The session aims, in this way, to address “the way of life of the Macanese, the community or communities, in Macau and in the diaspora, and their daily challenges to maintain the being and feeling of the Macanese reality”, historically between two cultures: Portuguese and Chinese.
The purpose of the conference, and the next ones in this cycle, is a “constructive discussion looking at the present and the future, without forgetting the tradition and the different identity landmarks, especially Gastronomy and Theater in Patuá, both Intangible Heritage of the Macao SAR and the PRC”, according to the organizers.
The round table will be held in Portuguese, with free entry.</description><pubDate>2026-02-11 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Building in Toi San will be rebuilt</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/edificio-em-toi-san-vai-ser-reconstruido/</link><description>After obtaining the consent of 95.5% of the owners (a rate higher than the minimum of 80%), the Kong Mou Un Tai Ha Building in Toi San, known as the Public Servants Building, is about to be rebuilt. According to Chinese-language media, the building's management entity revealed that 86 owners have already signed the reconstruction agreement. As for the remaining four, the idea is to resort to the intervention of the Arbitration Center. The building was built in 1965. 61 years old, with five floors and 90 units, it has cracks in the exterior walls, falling stone, exposed steel bars, infiltration in units on rainy days, among other problems. Currently, only a dozen families still live in the building. On the other hand, five fractions belong to the Financial Services. The management entity hopes that the Government will conclude, as quickly as possible, the arbitration procedures, and accelerate the verification and approval of the construction plan, so that the work can start this year. Furthermore, owners urge authorities to quickly publicize clauses on renting housing for temporary accommodation, allowing residents a smooth transition. After reconstruction, the building will have seven floors, plus 17 housing units, elevators and 14 stores on the ground floor, with the additional units belonging to the builder to offset costs. Reconstruction expenses, in the order of 90 million patacas, will be borne by the builder. Each owner will have to pay a lawyer's fee of around 38,500 patacas. After reconstruction, owners can, in principle, “exchange one fraction for another”, obtaining a new one with an area similar to the original.</description><pubDate>2026-02-11 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Portuguese folklore and Chinese dance united in the celebration of Lunar New Year in the USA</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/lazer/folclore-portugues-danca-chinesa-unidos-na-celebracao-ano-novo-lunar-nos-eua/</link><description>Nai-Ni Chen Dance Company and Sport Club Português de Newark, in the United States, have announced an artistic collaboration that will bring together Portuguese folklore and contemporary Chinese dance in celebration of the 2026 Lunar New Year. This artistic collaboration will culminate in the world premiere of a new dance work, part of the company's 2026 Lunar New Year celebration, and will take place at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center (NJPAC), on the 14th and 15th of this month.

Marking the Year of the Horse, this new collaboration brings together Chinese, Portuguese and Mongolian dance traditions in an ambitious exploration of shared cultural symbols.
“In these cultures, the horse represents resistance, freedom and vitality – from the revered ‘Spirit of the Yellow River’ from China to the legendary Lusitano horse from Portugal, celebrated for its elegance, strength and expressiveness”, explained the organization, in a statement sent to the Lusa agency through the public relations company Plusable.
The new work, created especially for this occasion, is being developed by Miguel Veloso, artistic director of Rancho Camponeses do Minho – the traditional folkloric group that is part of the Sport Club Português de Newark – in collaboration with Greta Campo, artistic director of Nai-Ni Chen Dance Company, and resident choreographers Lawrence Jin and Ying Shi.
The choreography combines the rhythmic, rooted footwork of the Minho region with the expansive fluidity and dynamic strength of contemporary Chinese dance, according to the statement.
Reflecting centuries of historical connection between Portugal and China – in particular through the cultural crossover of Macau -, the work highlights the way in which global exchange continues to inspire contemporary artistic creation and performative innovation.
“This collaboration is a celebration of the common pulse that connects Newark’s neighborhoods,” said Andy Chiang, executive director of Nai-Ni Chen Dance Company, quoted in the note.
The Year of the Horse program is also enriched by traditional Mongolian dance, whose galloping rhythms, broad gestures and equestrian images evoke the nomadic cultures of northern China and reflect the same spirit of freedom and resilience celebrated in the three traditions, explained the event organizers.
“By bringing together Portuguese, Mongolian and Chinese cultures on the same stage, we honor the city’s immigrant history while creating a new, inclusive artistic language,” added Chiang.
Jack Costa, president of the Board of Directors of the Sport Club Português de Newark, considered, in turn, that “culture has always been a powerful bridge between communities”, stressing that the partnership in question “honors the Portuguese heritage while embracing the rich diversity of Newark”.
“Celebrating the Year of the Horse through dance allows us to share a story of strength, movement and common memory that connects Portugal, China and the many immigrant voices that shape the city of Newark”, concluded Miguel Veloso, artistic director of Rancho Camponeses do Minho.
