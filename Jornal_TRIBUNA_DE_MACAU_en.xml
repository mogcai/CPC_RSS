The three requests for “urgent disclosure” and the only legal process submitted were related to nine accounts or users of Meta’s services. Macau authorities were able to receive information regarding all requests, unlike what happened with Hong Kong and Mainland China. In the same period of 2024, the Macao SAR made nine requests, thus registering an annual drop of 55.6%

Between January and June 2025, the Macao SAR Government submitted four requests to Meta, owner of the Facebook and Instagram platforms, according to a report from the North American company analyzed by the TRIBUNA DE MACAU newspaper. The requests referred to a legal process and three requests for “urgent disclosure”, involving nine accounts or users. The data also indicates that respective information was provided for all requests.
Of the accounts involved, four were related to legal proceedings, while the remaining five concerned requests for “urgent disclosure”.
The number of requests made by the Macao SAR authorities in the first half corresponds to an annual drop of 55.56%, compared to the nine requests registered in the first six months of 2024. Of these, only one was related to a legal process, while eight were requests for “urgent disclosure”.
In the second half of 2024, nine requests were also submitted, making a total of 18 in the overall year. Analyzing the available data, 2016 was the year in which the Government submitted the most requests, all for legal processes, for a total of 26.
With the exception of an emergency request made in the first half of 2019, this type of requests were only recorded from 2022 onwards, which exceeded the number of requests relating to legal processes in the overall calculation of the last three years. Furthermore, Meta data also indicates that the Macao SAR has not submitted any request for “preservation” of information since 2017.
With regard to the content that Meta restricted in the Macao SAR, based on Macau laws, throughout the first half of 2025, as well as throughout 2024, no restrictions were recorded. On the other hand, in the second half of 2023, 38 restrictions were imposed, and between 2020 and 2022, there were a total of 53. However, it is necessary to clarify that these refer to “global restrictions imposed externally” and not specifically restricted to Macau.
The Hong Kong Government submitted a total of 35 requests in the first six months of 2025, involving 44 accounts or users. Of the 22 legal process requests and 13 emergency requests from the HKSAR, Meta only provided information on 2.86% of submissions.
In turn, Mainland China submitted three requests, including one as part of a legal process and two requests for “urgent disclosure”, all relating to just one account. Meta did not provide any information to the Chinese authorities. Remember that the North American group's social networks are blocked in mainland China.
At a global level, in the first six months of last year, governments collectively submitted more than 374 thousand requests referring to more than 707 thousand accounts or users. Meta, in turn, provided data for 78.70% of requests.
As the company explains on its website, government authorities sometimes make requests for data about people using Meta technologies as part of official investigations.” “The vast majority of these requests are related to criminal cases, such as assaults or kidnappings. In many of these cases, these government requests seek basic information from subscribers, such as name, registration date and length of service. Other requests may also request address records or account contents”, he adds.
Requests for urgent disclosure waive the legal process. “Based on the circumstances, we may voluntarily disclose information to authorities where we have a good faith belief that the matter involves an imminent risk of physical harm or death,” the page reads.
Regarding global restrictions, “when something on Facebook, Instagram or Threads is reported to us as being against local law, but does not go against our Community Standards, we may restrict the availability of the content in the country where it is allegedly illegal”. “While we respect the law in the countries in which we operate, we strongly oppose any extraterritorial legal requirements and actively pursue all available options to appeal these orders,” explains Meta.</description><pubDate>2026-01-22 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Retail sector with mixed expectations</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/sector-comercio-retalho-expectativas-mistas/</link><description>The president of the Federation of Industry and Commerce of Macau Central and Southern Districts predicted that retail trade turnover this year “could be even worse” than in 2025, believing that the decline in business will be the main axis of the sector this year. The president of the Industrial and Commercial Federation of the Islands anticipated an “optimistic” scenario in the Islands. However, he admits that the existence of “many unstable factors” could affect the flow of customers at stores in Taipa and Coloane

Despite the annual record of 40.06 million visitors set in 2025, the spending power of tourists has not gained the same level of momentum, a phenomenon felt in the retail sector in the Central and Southern Zones of the Peninsula, according to Lei Cheok Kuan, president of the Federation of Industry and Commerce of Macau Central and Southern Districts.
Speaking to the newspaper TRIBUNA DE MACAU, this association leader predicted that, this year, the turnover of small and medium-sized retail stores in the Central and Southern Zones of the Peninsula “could be even worse than last year”.
Changes in the consumption model of new generations fuel these projections. "It's a chicken and egg question. Tourists really want to visit the old areas of Macau. However, many small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in these areas have permanently closed their doors, which has made it difficult to create a commercial atmosphere. As a result, tourists have come, but there is nothing for them to buy. Therefore, they are losing the desire to enter our old areas", warned Lei Cheok Kuan.
Furthermore, he pointed to “traffic problems, serious flooding, concentration of large flows of people and inconvenient travel” in the respective areas, which, in his opinion, gave rise to the “lack of will among investors to do business in the old areas” and the “sluggish environment” in these parts of the city.
"Everyone sees that the community economy in the Central and Southern Zones is very weak. I believe that the decline in business in the sector in general will be the main axis this year, since changes in the consumption model of new generations, consumption in Mainland China and online shopping are irreversible, and we are also facing the problem of flooding", lamented Lei Cheok Kuan.
To reverse the crisis, the association leader highlighted that the Government has “an undeniable responsibility” to create a better commercial environment for the old areas. In his opinion, authorities should support SMEs in old areas in optimizing, transforming and updating, through marketing strategies based on mega data, so that these establishments are able to meet the consumption models of new generations.
On the other hand, he pointed out, SMEs themselves also need to try to continually use online resources to improve offline business. “We must constantly review our products, services and decoration, so that they are more attractive to new groups of consumers”, highlighted the president of the Federation of Industry and Commerce of Macau Central and Southern Districts.
 
Retailers on the Islands saw a decline in business in 2025
In turn, following the influence of “many factors”, the turnover of retail stores on the Islands generally suffered a decline last year, noted Yeong Keng Hoi, president of the Industrial and Commercial Federation of the Islands of Macau. As he pointed out, some stores in the sector have decided to close their doors permanently in 2025, and there are new operators taking over empty stores.
"We observed that many stores were opened in leisure companies' resorts. This had some impact on commercial establishments outside, whether in tourist areas or residential areas", said Yeong Keng Hoi.
To this newspaper, the association leader stated that the high flow of visitors to the Islands, especially in Rua do Cunha and Vila de Coloane, last year, did not contribute to a notable increase in business volume, which was due to changes in consumption models in general among tourists. In this regard, he highlighted that the turnover of restaurants on the Islands was also “not very satisfactory” in 2025, a situation also associated with the new consumption preferences of tourists, who “became more curious about street cuisine, such as beef tripe, cream puffs and ice cream”.
In relation to 2026, the president of the Industrial and Commercial Federation of the Islands predicted an “optimistic” scenario for retail trade on the Islands. Even so, he admits that the persistence of “many unstable factors”, including new consumption models and the fact that, soon, MSAR vehicles registered to Hengqin will be able to circulate freely throughout Guangdong province, could affect the flow of customers at stores in Taipa and Coloane.
On the other hand, from his perspective, some new Government measures, especially the acceptance of requests for terrace licenses, will represent favorable factors for the Islands.
Revealing a phenomenon of “high turnover” of tenants in busy areas on the Islands, the association leader highlighted that, in general, many operators take an optimistic view of commercial prospects. The new stores, he noted, include both restaurants and retail establishments.
 
Slight salary adjustments on the horizon
Regarding the possibility of wage increases adopted in the retail sector in 2026, Yeong Keng Hoi predicted that, in general, even if there are wage increases in the sector on the Islands, they will be slight, unlike the “significant increases” adopted in previous years.
Highlighting the “sincere” position of employers in the old zones, Lei Cheok Kuan, in turn, stressed the conviction that, as long as stores do not record losses, retailers in the Central and Southern Zones “will be completely willing to increase wages for workers”. However, it also anticipated slight increases.</description><pubDate>2026-01-22 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Chief wants FAOM to reinforce young people’s competitiveness</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/chefe-quer-faom-reforcar-competitividade-dos-jovens/</link><description>The Government intends for workers' associations to reinforce their role in the development of the Macao SAR and calls for actions to improve well-being and support, as well as the training of qualified staff.

Providing increasing support to local workers is one of the challenges launched by the Government to workers' associations, with the aim of promoting adequate diversification of the economy and contributing more broadly to the long-term development of the Macao SAR and the Deep Cooperation Zone in Hengqin.
In his speech at the ceremony celebrating the 76th anniversary of the Federation of Workers' Associations of Macau (FAOM), the Chief Executive said he hoped that FAOM would strengthen its role as a liaison with the Government, presenting “valuable suggestions and proposals” in defense of government actions, thus helping citizens to “dedicate themselves to diversified industries and provide support to local workers, focusing especially on increasing the professional qualifications and competitiveness of young people”.
Furthermore, Sam Hou Fai intends to continue deepening exchanges and cooperation with Mainland China. FAOM “must align itself closely with the new ‘Macau+Hengqin’ positioning, develop more actions to improve the well-being and support services for workers, residing in the Cooperation Zone and the Greater Bay Area, as well as the training of qualified staff, supporting the integration and provision of services in Macau in the context of national development”, said the government official.
Considering that the development of Macau's economy currently presents a “stable and promising” trend, the Chief Executive stated that the main economic indicators “reveal a constant improvement and the general unemployment rate remains at a relatively low level”.
In this sense, he noted, the Government “makes every effort to guarantee the priority of local residents in access to employment”, having created the Working Group for the Coordination of Employment Promotion, dedicated to resolving the issue of employment of Macau residents, in particular, young people.
Sam Hou Fai also recalled that the Government will carry out a “complete review and improvement of the mechanism for assessing and authorizing the hiring of non-resident workers, in order to exercise dynamic control over the number of non-resident workers”, as it had already announced in the Government Action Lines. It will also continue to improve diplomas in the labor area, intensify the frequency of employment combination actions and carry out more professional training actions.
Pointing to five goals that the Federation must achieve, Sam Hou Fai highlighted the desire to maintain and promote “the beautiful tradition of patriotism and love for Macau, strengthening the Federation's own capabilities and continually demonstrating exemplary conduct and image”.
In particular, he recalls that science and technology “must be used to raise the quality of services, seeking to provide more and better services to workers, and strengthen the training of young pillars, with a view to consolidating the social base”.
Meanwhile, the president of FAOM, Lam Lon Wai, who recently took office, stressed that the association he heads will persist “more firmly” in the central value of love for the country and for Macau, consolidating the sociopolitical basis of “One Country, Two Systems”.</description><pubDate>2026-01-22 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Tender launched for operation of Cinemateca Paixão</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/lancado-concurso-para-operacao-da-cinemateca-paixao/</link><description>A new tender was launched yesterday for the operation of Cinemateca Paixão, located in Travessa da Paixão, not far from the Ruins of São Paulo.

PEDRO MILHEIRÃO
Optimizing the sensory coherence of urban events, through integrated audiovisual design, can improve participants' spatial perception, particularly in high-density environments such as the Macao SAR, argues a recent study. The group of authors offers practical ideas for urban planners, event organizers and policymakers on strategies to “improve the environmental predictability and participant comfort” of nighttime activities.
The research explored how “audiovisual experiences, lighting quality and perception of crowding shape risk perception in different types of activity”. The group of researchers was made up of Huiming Liu, Chaoyi Cui and Xinmu Ren, academics from the Macau University of Science and Technology, Junying Yan and Yifan Li, from Peking University, and Yongxi Gong, from the Harbin Institute of Technology in Shenzhen.
The conclusions take into account the results of a survey, carried out during four events in Macau, including two “short-term” events – Arraial na Ervanários and a set of art installations for the Mid-Autumn Festival in a square. Because they are repeated periodically, the other two “long-term” events were the Macau International Fireworks Competition and the Hong Kung Night Market, a street initiative that takes place every weekend.
Commercial reactivation activities, such as Arraial, are designed to utilize open urban squares, offering spacious environments with minimal crowding and dependence on natural lighting. The “simplicity” of these spaces offers participants “a less demanding sensory environment” and “attracts a balanced mix of locals and tourists”.
"Night markets, on the other hand, symbolize dynamic, high-density urban events. The spatial constraints of narrow streets and crowded squares, combined with vibrant lighting and diverse soundscapes, create an intense sensory environment where the interaction of visual and auditory stimuli significantly influences the perception of crowding", the article reads.
Live shows, performed in semi-closed or open spaces, "present sophisticated audiovisual dynamics that require high levels of sensory engagement. The lighting and soundscapes in these environments are not only complex, but also selected to improve participants' immersion."
According to the authors, “artistic installations, as immersive and visually dense events, use restricted spaces, such as courtyards or small exhibition areas, to create distinct sensory environments.” “The heavy reliance on lighting to improve spatial coherence and mitigate perceived risks is a defining characteristic of these events.”
The interaction between auditory and visual stimuli is particularly significant in high-density urban environments. “Environmental factors such as lighting, spatial density and spatial layout significantly affect the perception of risk”. Natural sounds, for example, “can reduce anxiety and perceived risks, while discordant or aggressive noises amplify them.”
"Lighting quality is a fundamental component of the sensory environment, instilling visual and psychological experiences in urban spaces, particularly during nighttime activities. Key elements of lighting quality include brightness, color temperature and illuminance, which contribute to the perception of safety, comfort and atmosphere."
 
Challenges and opportunities
Short-term urban nighttime events present unique spatial challenges as they are “highly dynamic and unpredictable”. From a geographic point of view, “they complicate spatial cognition and pathfinding, affecting individuals' ability to assess spatial safety and risk”.
“These factors can amplify participants’ perceptions of vulnerability and uncertainty, directly influencing their willingness to participate in such activities.” Temporary spaces introduce “variability in lighting conditions, soundscapes and crowd densities that contribute to spatial disorientation and greater environmental uncertainty”, which influences “the way participants navigate and interpret urban space”.
Geographically, “the absence of fixed landmarks and stable spatial references forces individuals to rely on fragmented visual and auditory cues for navigation, increasing the risk of spatial disorientation and event-related anxiety.” The risks “discourage participation, reduce participant satisfaction and, ultimately, undermine the economic and cultural viability of temporary urban interventions”.
On the other hand, "temporary urban uses represent a vital dimension of urban development, offering cities the flexibility needed to adapt to rapid technological advances and transformative lifestyle changes. Temporary uses expand the possibilities for experimenting with new forms of spatial engagement and innovative urban practices."
The researchers believe that “strategic spatial planning and sensory coherence can mitigate these concerns by improving spatial legibility, optimizing crowd management, and enhancing environmental confidence through predictable spatial cues and controlled lighting conditions.”
Permanent urban spaces, for example, provide “stable environmental conditions” by offering “established spatial cues that facilitate cognitive mapping”. In fact, “environmental characteristics are often optimized for safety and reliability”.
“Temporary nighttime urban events are not just risk-prone spaces, but evolving urban assets that require strategic sensory and spatial planning.” In this sense, the authors highlight “the importance of designing temporary spaces that balance sensory stimulation with risk mitigation”, ensuring participation and safety at events, as cities increasingly invest in night-time economies.
“Macau presents a diverse urban landscape that combines historic architecture with modern developments, creating a complex environment where sensory and spatial dynamics significantly shape visitors’ experiences.” These events provide “a dynamic and cost-effective way to enliven urban spaces, improve visitor engagement and support economic development”.
However, the researchers state that "Macau faces significant challenges in the regeneration of its urban spaces. The predominance of private property among owners and the high density of buildings result in substantial regeneration costs, limiting options for large-scale urban revitalization. To this end, innovative approaches are needed to attract tourists and revitalize urban areas, such as hosting temporary urban activities", they argue.</description><pubDate>2026-01-22 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Secretary asks for more data on vacancies for administrative jobs</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/secretario-pede-mais-dados-sobre-vagas-para-trabalhos-administrativos/</link><description>Bank administration continues to be the most attractive area of ​​work for young people in Macau, Tai Kin Ip revealed yesterday, at this year's first meeting of the Working Group for the Coordination of Employment Promotion.

PEDRO MILHEIRÃO
Young people in Macau continue to show a preference for administrative positions in the banking sector, according to data from the Working Group for the Coordination of Employment Promotion, which states that this trend “continues to manifest itself”. According to the Office of the Secretary for Economy and Finance, Tai Kin Ip stressed that “it is necessary, through the interdepartmental cooperation mechanism, to proactively collect more information about administrative job vacancies, from large institutions in the areas of higher education and public utility services”.
At the first meeting of this year, the Working Group coordinated by the Secretary for Economy and Finance announced yesterday that “it plans to hold, between March and May, four large-scale job matching sessions, providing precise job matching services to different sectors and groups of job seekers”, says the statement.
At the same time, “cooperation with integrated tourism and leisure companies will be deepened”, with priority given to “more diversified specific employment plans” and “personalized training”, aligned with the real needs of the concessionaires.
The Directorate of Services for Labor Affairs (DSAL) also intends to “further strengthen cooperation with the banking sector” to carry out a specific job matching activity. In addition, support will be given to young people on the development of the sector and information on the recruitment of jobs, in order to “effectively increase their competitiveness in employment”.
The Working Group also intends to “strengthen communication with stakeholders in the sector and associations, in order to understand the needs of companies in relation to human resources”.
 
Necessary reforms in support for professional training
On the other hand, in a response to a written question from Leong Pou U, Chan Un Tong, stated that it was “necessary to carry out a synthetic rationalization with the current employment and training measures, in order to ensure the effective use of resources”. The director of DSAL explained that, in recent years, “no requests for financial support were received regarding the ‘Regulation of specific funds for professional training actions’”.
Furthermore, he also mentioned that, according to the Social Security Fund (FSS), “the financial support expenses provided for in the ‘Regulation of incentives and training for the unemployed’ in 2023 were 88,970 patacas, in 2024 they were 108 thousand patacas, and in the year 2025, until October, they were 19,620”.
For the review process, Chan guaranteed that “DSAL will take an open and pragmatic attitude to listen and analyze the opinions of different sectors of society on the improvement of employment support services and professional training actions”.
This reform is aligned with the Executive's “governance efficiency” policy in the construction of “a more simplified, coordinated and efficient system of modernized public services”.
The director of DSAL recalled that the services continue “to launch various employment measures and specific professional training actions, including the organization of various professional training courses and professional techniques testing modalities so that residents can enroll free of charge”.</description><pubDate>2026-01-22 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Investment funds can attract more external institutions</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/fundos-de-investimento-podem-atrair-mais-instituicoes-externas/</link><description>Shanghai hosted a presentation session on the advantages and development opportunities of the MSAR's investment fund sector.

The entry into force of the Investment Funds Law may contribute to promoting, between Macau and the funds markets of other jurisdictions, regulatory convergence and articulation, as well as connection and connectivity, creating a more ideal development environment for the sector.
This is one of the conclusions to be drawn from the “Presentation session on the advantages and development opportunities of the Macau investment funds sector”, held in the city of Shanghai, in a meeting that brought together around 170 representatives from services, associations, companies, companies, banks and insurance companies.
Vong Sin Man, deputy chairman of the Board of Directors of AMCM, stated that the entry into force of the Law will contribute to promoting, between Macau and the funds markets of other jurisdictions, regulatory convergence and articulation, as well as connection and connectivity, creating “a more ideal development environment” for the investment funds sector.
Thus, in connection with the competitive tax incentive measures launched by the Government, “the possibility of attracting more external institutions to participate in the Macau investment fund market is expected”, said the official.
Currently, three investment fund management companies have already been authorized to establish themselves in the territory, one of which has already established Macau's first public fund.
In a statement, AMCM highlights that the expectation is that investment fund management companies “can fully take advantage of the Macau platform, expanding their respective international markets”, including Portuguese-speaking countries, “and providing investors from Mainland China and abroad with more diversified asset allocation options”.
In the opening speech, the deputy director of the Office of the Financial Commission of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, Cao Yanwen, highlighted the expectation that Shanghai and Macau will persist in the principle of “mutual learning and exchange of experiences, mutual benefits and shared gains”, taking advantage of their own advantages to contribute to the construction of a “financial power”.
During the meeting, representatives from AMCM presented the legal framework applicable to the activity of investment funds in Macau, as well as the respective support measures. In turn, representatives from the Macau Trade and Investment Promotion Institute (IPIM) explained the Macao SAR's business environment and the procedures for setting up companies.
Before and after the presentation session, under the organization of the Macau Securities and Funds Industry Association, AMCM and IPIM, together with more than 20 senior officials from the local financial sector, traveled to Shanghai and Suzhou respectively to visit local financial institutions.</description><pubDate>2026-01-22 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>CCAC in the HKSAR to improve internal supervision</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/ccac-na-raehk-para-melhorar-supervisao-interna/</link><description>The Anti-Corruption Commissioner sent a delegation to Hong Kong to strengthen ties with the Independent Commission against Corruption and learn about the “workings and internal supervision mechanism” of the HKSAR body
 
A delegation from the Anti-Corruption Commission (CCAC), led by Ao Ieong Seong, recently visited the Independent Anti-Corruption Commission (ICAC) of the HKSAR, to “get to know more in-depth the functioning and internal supervision mechanism in the area of ​​combating corruption in Hong Kong”, according to a press release.
On the occasion, Commissioner Ao Ieong Seong shared information about the specialized Commission, responsible for “monitoring problems related to complaints against the discipline of CCAC staff”. The functions of this Commission include analyzing accusations of a non-criminal nature and issuing recommendations addressed to the Chief Executive, the note states.
ICAC Commissioner Woo Ying-ming, in turn, presented the work carried out by the Hong Kong entity, relating to combating corruption, promoting integrity and international cooperation.
Woo highlighted the “close cooperation” between the two bodies and assured that, in the future, “both parties will continue to commit to combating corruption crimes”. In addition, links and exchanges with anti-corruption institutions in the Greater Bay Area will also be strengthened, he added.
In turn, Commissioner Ao also highlighted the “close cooperation in investigating cases, exchanging information and in the area of ​​training” that the CCAC has maintained with its counterpart in Hong Kong.
Ao Ieong Seong also said he hopes to continue “maintaining a friendly relationship and jointly promoting cooperation with other anti-corruption institutions in the Greater Bay Area”, in favor of an “integrity” cross-border region.
In general, the meeting allowed both organizations to exchange views on prevention, the fight against corruption and “raising awareness of integrity”, according to the CCAC. The delegation also visited the Director of Public Prosecutions, Yang Mei Kei, and the Prosecutions Division of the HKSAR Justice Department to learn about the Division's procedures.

In 2015, David Chow signed an agreement with the Cape Verdean Government for the construction of the project, with the first stone of the project being laid in February 2016. This is the largest tourist development in Cape Verde, with a planned global investment of 250 million euros - around 15% of Cape Verde's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) - for the construction of a tourist resort on the islet of Santa Maria, which will cover an area of 152,700 square meters, inaugurating the gaming industry in the archipelago. (FOLLOWS TEXT OF AUGUST 10, 2020). FERNANDO DE PINA / LUSA



Macau Legend Development (MLD) said that the Government of Cape Verde did not have “any legitimate basis” to repossess the hotel-casino, whose construction the gaming operator left unfinished in the capital, Praia.
On Saturday, the Cape Verdean Executive announced that it took possession of the assets and building of the hotel-casino that the company, which is facing financial difficulties, began to build but abandoned years ago.
On Tuesday night, MLD said that it was notified, on January 15, by the Government of Cape Verde of the intention to recover the assets and the building on the islet of Santa Maria and on the seafront of Gamboa. Cape Verdean authorities requested the presence of a representative of the operator “to facilitate a voluntary handover” of the unfinished hotel-casino, MLD said.
“Having determined that this request lacked any legitimate basis, the company did not agree”, highlighted MLD, in a statement sent to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.
The Government of Cape Verde went ahead with taking office on Friday, entering the project facilities and “ignoring the company's objection to voluntary delivery”, lamented MLD.
The operator assured that “it is currently seeking legal advice” to decide how to respond to the loss of the hotel-casino, something that, it highlighted, was already foreseen in MLD's accounts.
“Thus, management considers that the recent development of the investment project will not have a material adverse impact on the company’s operation or financial performance”, the statement highlights.
The Government of Cape Verde reiterated on Saturday that it “did everything to ensure the implementation of the project”, but the contracts “were irremediably breached” by the investors.
In July, the Minister of Internal Administration of Cape Verde, Paulo Rocha, told Lusa, in Macau, that the Government would give a “last opportunity” to the company, which promised “an alternative” for space.
At the end of March, MLD had already announced losses of 45.9 million Hong Kong dollars in 2024, in part due to the threat of reversion of the hotel-casino in the capital of Cape Verde.
In 2015, Macau businessman David Chow Kam Fai, founder of the operator, announced an investment of 250 million euros. After reviews, completion of the first phase of the project was scheduled for 2021. At the end of 2023, MLD president Li Chu Kwan said the group intended to close projects in Cape Verde and Cambodia.
Currently, there were only guards at the gates of the enclosure, an area of ​​around 160,000 square meters, which includes the islet, partially gutted, and an asphalt bridge a few meters long that connects it to a building of around eight floors, empty and fenced with walls – which, in the meantime, have begun to be removed.
At the end of August 2025, MLD admitted that it had “significant doubts about the group's ability to continue in business” due to total debts of 2.4 billion Hong Kong dollars.

In the case of the Macao SAR, eligible voters are those registered in the area of ​​the Consulate General of Portugal in Macau and Hong Kong. For this purpose, they must be in possession of a citizen card, identity card or other valid identification document, such as a driving license or passport. António José Seguro and André Ventura are the candidates who will decide the next Portuguese Head of State. Meanwhile, people registered in the electoral register in Portugal, but who are temporarily displaced abroad, will be able to vote in advance on the 27th, 28th and 29th of January, between 9:00 and 12:30 and 13:30 and 16:00. In a statement, the Consulate also makes an additional clarification, indicating that, “in view of news circulated during the electoral campaign in Macau, the Portuguese electoral administration does not withdraw the voting capacity of citizens who abstained one or more times in elections, nor does it eliminate names from the electoral rolls for that reason”. The note adds that the voter registration law only establishes that in the case of the return of envelopes containing voting ballots to voters registered abroad twice consecutively, the electoral administration of the General Secretariat of the Ministry of Internal Administration officially ceases sending voting ballots until the voter informs them of the new address. The clarification follows messages that were “sent to voters, namely by Rita Santos, Councilor of the Portuguese Communities for the China Circle”, according to the newspaper Ponto Final.</description><pubDate>2026-01-22 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>IC seeks restoration proposals for the Entertainment Zone</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/ic-procura-propostas-de-restauracao-para-zona-de-espectaculos/</link><description>大型戶外演出場地

3rd case of dengue detected this year
A new case of imported dengue fever, which is the third recorded this year, was notified by the Health Services (SSM). This is a 40-year-old man, non-resident worker, who traveled to the Philippines between December 26, 2025 and January 11. After returning to Macau, he developed symptoms such as fever and muscle pain. Analyzes were carried out at the Centro Hospitalar Conde de São Januário, confirming the presence of type III dengue virus. The patient's fever went down on Tuesday morning, and the patient was admitted to the hospital to receive treatment. So far, the individuals he lives with have not shown any symptoms. SSM recommends residents to take precautions when traveling abroad. The organization will send personnel to carry out the preventive elimination of mosquitoes near the patient's residence and main places of activity.
 
Arrested on suspicion of usury and document retention
The Judiciary Police detained a 43-year-old domestic worker, of Indonesian nationality, on suspicion of usury and improper document retention. According to the investigation, since 2024, the suspect will have lent a total of 170 thousand patacas to around 60 people, having collected 90 thousand patacas in interest. In addition, he illegally withheld the passports of 51 compatriots and a “blue-card”. Most of the victims borrowed money because they needed money urgently and had incurred debts of between MOP500 and MOP5,000 from the suspect. One of the victims accepted the conditions of handing over a passport and paying monthly interest equivalent to 20%. Unable to settle the capital, the creditor refused to return the document. Therefore, the victim filed a complaint with the authorities. The police have already contacted four injured parties and will continue to monitor the remaining victims.
 
Post office warns of fraudulent messages
The Directorate of Postal and Telecommunications Services (CTT) received complaints from the public about messages, allegedly sent by CTT, which require a new authentication of the SIM card, inducing citizens to access fraudulent websites. CTT clarifies that they never provide hyperlinks via message, nor do they require the introduction of personal or credit card details. Therefore, they call on people to remain vigilant and informed about preventing scams.

With capacity for 100 passengers, this aircraft surpassed the speed of sound by flying at Mach 2.04, that is, 2,180 kilometers per hour. Current long-haul aircraft do not exceed 1,000 kilometers per hour.
With the Concorde, a passenger could depart Paris at 10:30 am and arrive in New York at 8:15 am local time, beating the clock. The fastest transatlantic flight was made on February 7, 1996, from London to New York, in just two hours, 52 minutes and 59 seconds. Fifty years later, the journey takes seven hours.
To design the Concorde, all mechanics had to be rethought, since its aerodynamics had to be different from that of conventional aircraft, which were much heavier. Such was its technology that, half a century later, nothing similar exists, François Adibi, Concorde pilot between 2001 and 2003, told EFE. The supersonic speed and flight autonomy of approximately four hours have not been replicated.
“I miss flying it”, admitted Adibi, happy to be back in the cockpit of this machine on display at the Air and Space Museum in Le Bourget (north of Paris).
The pilot did not find the same connection with any other aircraft. “I have the impression that it is something alive, as if the Concorde had a soul that other more modern aircraft do not have”, said the author of “Concorde: Notre part de rêve” (“Concorde: Our Part of the Dream”), which will be published at the end of April in France by publisher Michel Lafon.
Among his anecdotes is the story of Michael Jackson flying the Concorde. Jackson was afraid of flying, so he covered his face with a blanket during the flight.
Concorde was also designed to demonstrate the power of France and the United Kingdom to the USA and the Soviet Union (USSR), which were vying for leadership in aerospace technology. In the context of the Cold War, the two European countries allied themselves through a treaty signed in 1962, given that, separately, they would not be able to bear the enormous economic cost of creating such a powerful machine.
The US responded to Europe by launching its own project in 1963, which it later abandoned due to technical complexity and growing environmental concerns. The USSR, in turn, was the first great power to fly the first supersonic passenger plane, the Tupolev Tu-144, on December 26, 1975, 26 days before Concorde. However, it was unsafe and extremely noisy.
On January 21, 1976, two Concordes took off. One, operated by British Airways, flew from London Heathrow to Bahrain, and the other, operated by Air France, flew from Paris to Rio de Janeiro with a stop in Dakar.
 
2000 accident was the beginning of the end
The beginning of the end came in 2000, when a wheel on a Concorde taking off from Charles de Gaulle Airport exploded after being hit by a piece of titanium on the runway that had detached from another aircraft. The accident resulted in the deaths of 113 people.
Concorde flights were suspended following this incident. They would be resumed in 2001, after improvements to the wheels, however, in 2003, the Concorde was definitively retired due to economic and social reasons.
The maintenance of these aircraft was very expensive, as was the price of tickets, which in the 2000s were around 8,000 euros for a round trip from Paris to New York. Today, this would be equivalent to around 11,500 euros, adjusted for inflation in France.
Furthermore, the 2001 attacks on the Twin Towers in New York created fear in society and affected the way people traveled.
“There has been a drop in passenger numbers and less interest in keeping these types of aircraft in operation,” said Marion Weckerle, curator of the aircraft collection at the National Air and Space Museum, who is organizing several activities to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Concorde's first commercial flight.
