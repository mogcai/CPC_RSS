The director of tourism services, Helena de Senna Fernandes, said yesterday that the impact of commercial disputes "is not yet reflected in the tourist flow of Macao", but ensured that the body will be aware and could readjust the promotions that were planned

The implementation of global customs cuisines by the Trump administration originated a response from China, which, starting yesterday, began to apply an additional 50% retaliation rate on imports from the United States to 84%. In turn, the US president announced an immediate increase to 125% of tariffs to Chinese products, intensifying the trade war between the world's two largest economies (see page 11). “Directly”, the tax war “will little the economy of Macao,” considers Kwan Fung, assistant professor at the Department of Economics at the Faculty of Social Sciences at the University of Macau (one).
However, one released new predictions for the Macao macroeconomics yesterday this year, according to which, the rate of growth of MGO's GDP will be 6.8%, ie less 0.2 percentage points than previously predicted (7%). The forecast is considered “relatively conservative”.
At the Macao Economic Development Forum, organized yesterday by the Macao Study Center, Kwan Fung explained that the forecast adjustment was due to the fact that “the global economy records changes due to US tax policy, which led to reduced global trade”.
The academic also stressed that US actions have been affecting several economies, including China. According to Kwan Fung's analysis, "the tax war could indirectly affect the consumption of visitors in Macao."
The Director of Tourism Services (STD) yesterday assured that the impact of commercial disputes between the United States and the rest of the world, but especially with China, "is not yet reflected in Macao's tourist flow." Helena de Senna Fernandes stated that the moment is “observation about what is happening”, considering that Macau “will be very attentive” to the next moments.
If the situation climb to other levels, the STD official recognizes that "there will have to be a readjustment of promotions that were planned."
About a possible reduction of visitors, Helena de Senna Fernandes says that there is still no such fear, stressing that "the situation can change". Therefore, he stressed, on the sidelines of the Press Conference on the Expo of Tourism, "we must always be aware, but without failing to do our work."
Recently, it is recalled, economists told the Jornal Tribuna de Macao that impacts on the territory will be able to feel precisely at the level of tourism, with the possible reduction in the number of visitors, if there is an economic recession, and also with the reduction of revenues associated with this sector.
In yesterday's forum, organized by UM, Kwan Fung was asked if the tax war could have any impact on US capital companies operating casinos in Macau-Wynn, Sands and MGM. The academic anticipated that “it will somehow affect companies' decisions for investment”, noting that the impact could be different from operator for operator.
Kwan Fung also said that he believes that, in the context of the great proportion of increased customs rate, investors around the world can reevaluate investment goals.
On the other hand, Kwan Fung explained that other economic indicators were also the target of adjustment. In concrete, the pace of growth in the services and export segment was adjusted to 6.8%, while the growth rate in the field of private consumption became 3.8%. In addition, the inflation rate became 0.7% and the general unemployment rate was changed to 1.7%. The estimate on the local unemployment rate remained, being 2.3%.
It also predicted that the ordinary revenues of the Government of MSAR may be 116.8 billion patacas by 2025.

It helped Father Nicosia in the activities related to the well-being and treatment of patients who were in isolation. Born in China, he came to the territory just over 30 years old, and today still opens and closes the doors of the church every day, having “converted” naturally to the Catholic religion. It is considered by Father Daniel Ribeiro as a “living treasure”. The elderly told the Jornal Tribuna de Macao that “leproseria was an authentic prison” and saw a lot of people die, but was never afraid of being contaminated

A distorted voice, a difficult translation singing, and some memory failures only allowed to record pieces of the life of a 100-year-old man, still volunteer in religious activities in the Ká-Hó church. Still, Ieong Siu Keong managed to share with the Jornal Tribuna de Macao a part of his long history, which intersects with that of the village of Our Lady of Ká-Hó.
Born in Zhongshan, a city of the neighboring province of Guangdong. At the age of 18 he was part of the Chinese Communist Party and already after 30 decided to move to Macao, advised by friends, to treat a problem in an eye. He never returned to his homeland.
He arranged some works to survive and settled in Ká-Hó where he was later hired to help Father Gaetano Nicosia, some time after Salesian priest, born in Italy, came to Macao in 1958.
Among several adventures in the territory, most of whom are already without very safe memories, recalls his life, working on leprosy alongside Father Nicosia. The elderly begins by denying the rumors that he would have been one of Lepra's sick and, therefore, after being treated, was living in that Coloane village.
"I was not one of the sick of the leproseria, I just helped Father Nicosia in the works he developed, with the aim of creating conditions for patients to treat and be healed," he says.
Asked if he was never afraid of being contaminated, Ieong was peremptory: "I was never afraid, because they were isolated, but I saw a lot of people die."
The pavilion where the patients met was “an authentic prison,” he says, recalling that there were many dozen lepers. "There were more than 80, men and women, of various ages, from young people to the elderly and even children, many of them natural from the continent, but also from Macao," he says.
Already during the years when he was one of the helpers of Father Nicosia and some Canossian nurses and charities, to Ieong Siu Keong was mainly offered to the chapel, or shrine, existing there, serving as "guard," according to determination of the Italian priest. "He told me that there were only Catholics, and I wouldn't let people of other beliefs come in."
 
Natural conversion to Catholicism
The centenary did not clarify if he was Catholic when he came to Macao after 30 years, but it is likely not, having naturally "converted", following the contact he has maintained for years with Father Nicosia and other people linked to the Church.
“Nowadays, he participates in all the activities of the Ká-Hó Church, including the retreats we have been organizing,” says Father Daniel Ribeiro, who served as a translator, thanks to his ability to speak and understand Cantonense.
The parish priest of the diocese spoke with love of the elderly who cares for the church of Ká-Hó. "This gentleman is a historical presence that shows the various phases here of the Church, since the leper period and then with the arrival of Father Nicosia," he said.
At this time of greater number of religious activities in Ká-Hó, the priest says that "this person who came from China and today is Catholic, who knows the story and is healthy, is for us a living treasure." It is beautiful to see “the zeal he has in the morning when opening the church and then in the afternoon closing it, feeling very useful and important,” he adds.
Therefore, “it is a person we treat with all the affection”, concludes Father Daniel Ribeiro.
About 70 years after he first met Macao, he continues to live in the village of Ká-Hó, where, to survive, he has the help of several neighbors and people linked to the church that offer him food.
For several years, he has been responsible, volunteer, for the opening and closing of the doors of the Ká-Hó Church, sunny daily or rain.
Speaking in a difficult to understand Cantonense to Father Daniel Ribeiro, the elderly said they like what they do. "I feel good here, despite being alone for all these years," he said, adding that he never married, perhaps fearful "one day having to divorce."
All his family members have died and Ieong implied that he wants to stay in Ká-Hó until the end of his days.
Although curved by the wear of a century life, he has shown that he still has health to “continue in this world” for a few more years. He made a point of proving that, standing and gesturing energetically, as an old player of any martial arts sport, who will have practiced on the continent when he was young.
Ieong Siu Keong also agreed to take several photographs with the Church of Ká-Hó and also in front of some of the pavilions that once housed sick and served as wards and rooms with multiple useful.
 
Father Nicosia improved leprosy facilities
Recalling the passage by Macao from Father Nicosia, who died in 2017 in Hong Kong, at the age of 102, it should be noted that the ecclesiastical lived in the village of Ká-Hó between 1963 and 2011. Under his proposal, the place of leproseria began to be called “Vila de Nossa Senhora”.
When he arrived in the colony, the priest came across a catastrophic situation. Due to the serious illness they suffered and the almost total abandonment of which they were targeted, the suicide rate among the lepers was high, there was no drinking water or electricity, hygiene was practically nonexistent, only from time to time received a doctor's visit and the foods were few.
The Italian has developed all efforts to improve the living conditions of Ká-Hó's lepers and, thanks to their long and continuous work for 48 years, has achieved many of them recover and be reinstated in society, despite the social stigma associated with this disease, having become known as the 'Angel of the lepers'.
In 1929, the government began the expansion of the Ká-Hó leprosy. The new buildings, including five pavilions and a chapel designed in an eclectic architectural style, were completed in 1930, defining a road on the slope facing the sea. The pavilions were characterized by large, classic, large -inspired balconies that opened on the landscape.
They are currently closed, but some have suffered a revitalization process, such as one of the homes that is part of the Hold on To Hope project, from the Macao Toxicode Rehabilitation Association, where exhibitions of local artists are often performed.
The new leproseria, with capacity for 90 patients, who joined the other in the São Lazaro neighborhood, built by Bishop Dom Belchior Carneiro, in the mid -16th century, being funded by the Holy House of Mercy of Macao, would later be completely transformed by Father Nicosia.
With a boundless dedication, the priest never refused to deal with these patients, despite the high risk of contagion. Upon arrival, the lepers began to receive more frequent medical assistance and the village of Ká-Hó was slowly free from leprosy.
In 2011, all inhabitants of the leprosy colony were declared healed and many returned to work as teachers, workers or practicing as independent professionals.
All this evolution watched Ieong Siu Keong, the "old man" of Ká-Hó, who continues to live in the village and do what he likes the most, very early every morning-open the doors of the Church of Our Lady of Sorrows.</description><pubDate>2025-04-11 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Tourism Expo registers 50% increase in international stands</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/expo-de-turismo-regista-aumento-de-50-nos-stands-internacionais/</link><description>Press Conference of the 13th International Tourism Expo (Industry) of Macao

The São Domingos market will be the next municipal market to be revitalized, the president of the Institute for Municipal Affairs (AMI) said. Stating that the organism that directs is “proceeding in an orderly manner to optimize the operations of all municipal municipal markets”, Chao Wai Ieng stressed that in the next phase, he plans to develop revitalization work in that market in the heart of the city, next to the Senate. For this, you will start collecting opinions.
In a community colloquium in the parish of the Sé, the issue of markets was addressed, but we also talked about architectural barriers and traffic and pedestrian facilities. As for the markets, and following the opening of the contest for 20 lightweight food stalls and cafeteria in the mud market, Chao Wai Ieng said that, as regards the São Domingos market, the body will take into account the hypothesis of introducing something similar.
The mud market is currently being revitalized, with the conclusion of the optimization works of the space to be pointed to the fourth quarter of the year. The idea is to introduce cultural and creative elements as well as light food.
The body has already said that it intends to adjust the distribution of newsstands in the territory markets, as well as to unification of some that are unoccupied. At the same time, it also aims to beautify the facade of these spaces. The idea is to "inject new vitality into traditional markets."
According to the Chinese language press in the Colloquium, Chao Wai Ieng said the third phase of the optimization work of Ferreira do Amaral Square and the surrounding roads will end in July this year.

The revenues of the orchestra society from tickets doubled to 1.9 million patacas. Still, the increase in expenses led to the government to cover the society's deficit, which totaled 54.2 million, an annual increase of 44.4%
 
The Macao Orchestra and the Chinese orchestra performed or participated in 230 concerts last year. The number includes seasonal or small season concerts, educational community spectacles, extension activities, commercial acts, as well as “tours”.
According to the 2024 report of the Macao Orchestra Society, the number of concerts of the two orchestras rose 14.4% in annual terms. At the same time, the number of spectators increased by 29.4% to over 94,000, with 63,000 attended the 113 concerts of the Macao Orchestra and 31 thousand at 117 starred by the Chinese orchestra.
The society pointed out that, throughout last year, the two orchestras "tried to actively increase their international reputation", having acted in Canton, Shenzhen, Hong Kong and South Korea and obtained "positive repercussions", which "widened the opportunities to act abroad effectively." In addition, the two orchestras organized “diverse concerts”.
In this context, the revenues of the company orchestra derived from the concert tickets exceeded 1.91 million, illustrating a significant annual increase of 98.7%.
The company registered revenues of 70.1 million patacas, which represents an annual increase of 39.3%. However, at the same time, the public capital company spent 124.3 million, an annual climb of 41.5%, so it suffered operational losses of 54.2 million (+44.4%).
According to the report, the Government of MSAR and the Culture Development Fund granted subsidies in the total amount of 72.2 million patacas, of which 54.2 million were used to cover the losses. At the end of the annual financial year, the orchestra company had government subsidies of 18 million patacas that had not yet been used.
 
Four more musicians
At the end of last year, the Orchestra Society employed 137 workers, including 68 local musicians and 34 non -resident musicians, nine employees of the Cultural Institute (IC) who perform functions on a possible service committee and 26 administrative workers recruited directly by the company.
The total number of workers increased by 3.8% (five more people) compared to 2023. According to the report last year, the company reinforced the staff with three local musicians and a non -resident musician, having added five administrative workers. At the same time, he saw the number of IC employees in society decrease from 13 to nine.
Already in the chapter of revenues, the realization of concerts allowed to raise 26.28 million patacas, which reflects an annual decrease of 14.2%. In justifying this descent, the company explained that the season's two orchestras concerts were previously acquired by the IC, but since 2023/2024, the Macao orchestra season has been sponsored by the six integrated tourism and leisure companies, while the Chinese orchestra maintained the acquisition by IC.
At the same time, revenues from the sponsorship of the season grew 200% to 30 million. In addition, with the digressions, society raised 3.18 million (+251.1%) in 2024.
The company also accounted for revenues of 3.19 million (-32.1%) derived from the teaching aspect and 1.97 million (+193.7%) from bank interest. The company no longer provides the Macao Conservatory Teaching Service in the 2024/2025 school year, so it has not revenue from this segment since September last year.
In the expenditure aspect, 96.64 million (+41.7%) were spent on the organization of concerts, 3.05 million (-33.5%) in education, 6.72 million (+111.6%) on sale, 13 million (+38.3%) in administrative personnel, and 4.9 million (+98.8%) to support the company's regular operation.
The remuneration and subsidies of the musicians represented 54.24 million patacas (+23.3%), not to mention the central pension fund of 1.56 million. As for the musicians and guest conductors, the expenses rose almost 11.5% to 11.67 million.
The report indicates that the company's rising expenses is due to the increase in the size and number of concerts last year, as well as the strengthening of the sale section in order to make the concerts more exposed to the public. Also the hiring of more musicians and administrative workers, as well as the entry of the music director, who is the main conductor of the Chinese orchestra, increased expenses with human resources.</description><pubDate>2025-04-11 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Coutinho calls for queues for the Delta Bridge</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/coutinho-pede-solucoes-para-filas-na-ponte-delta/</link><description>José Pereira Coutinho says he has been receiving numerous complaints due to long lines on the delta bridge, asking for solutions to the government. One of the suggestions of the deputy is that the cars can enter and leave in other places of passage, such as the Hengqin border post
 
Long queues and “altercations and zaragatas” between drivers: This is the scenario described by Deputy José Pereira Coutinho regarding the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge, especially on Saturdays, Sundays and holidays. In this sense, it asks the government solutions, since, it says, the “palliative measures”, such as the increase of reserve lanes to the departure of Macau and the use of technological equipment to raise vehicle inspection.
Pereira Coutinho says, a written interpellation, which has been “constantly receiving complaints from drivers” due to “traffic jams and long lines of car that takes hours”. In concrete, he said that a group of truck drivers complained that “due to the lack of planning, the logistics industry” faces “insufficient parking lots to increase demand in the process of overflowing goods from the interior of the continent by Via Ponte do Delta”.
Thus, he questioned the government about whether to implement “efficient, effective and pragmatic measures” for the full use of that infrastructure. I also wanted to know whether the authorities will consider “the extent of supply of the transhipment services of macao trucks from the continent and vice versa, thus opening a new direct land transportation channel on both sides”.
On the other hand, Pereira Coutinho also asked if the executive will ask the interior authorities of China “to help unlock the current situation of permanent traffic jam and feature of car lines waiting for a pass on the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau bridge”. This is to allow cars to go to Zhuhai from other places of passage, such as Hengqin's border post.
Another concern of the deputy is related to the overcrowding of Zone A, saying that it will be full of "buses, trucks, cars and motorcycles, a situation further aggravated because it is adjacent to a peninsula zone that is also very congested." Thus, in addition to the two lanes of one side on each side on Tun Seng Avenue “what measures are being planned to be performed briefly to reduce the current inconvenience of road traffic, namely insufficiency of lanes and traffic jams, and thus decrease the current chaotic road traffic situation?” He asked.

IP Wing-huen, a member of the Academic Committee of the Macao University of Science and Technology Laboratory (UCTM), revealed that the institution invited Inpe and received a positive response.
“We came into contact with Brazilian planetary scientists and asked if they would be interested in working with us about asteroids. (…) They are very interested,” IP explained. In addition to Brazil, the Macau laboratory, known as SklPlanets, also wants to cooperate with researchers in Portugal, taking advantage of the presence at UCTM of Portuguese Marta Filipa Simões, teacher of Astrobiology.
“I spoke to the rector [of Must] Lee [Hun-Wei]. He said there is a window we could open for cooperation” with Brazil and Portugal, indicated IP Wing-huen, who grew up in Macao. "Macau has its own historical heritage, which cannot be reproduced by any other city anywhere else in China and is something to explore," said the astronomer, referring to the Portuguese administration of the region.
IP, which received in 2020 the Gerard P. Kuiper career prize of the American Astronomy Society, spoke on the sidelines of a lecture in UCTM about the efforts to explore asteroids.
The scientist revealed that the SklPlanets laboratory is considering participating in the mission of the European space probe Ramses, which will “try to land and travel” at Asteroid Apophis, which is expected to pass by Earth in 2029.
Astronomers have ruled out any risk that Apophis hit the planet over the next hundred years, because “we have been accompanying it for decades, because, when it comes to asteroids, having time is very important,” said IP.
The investigator recalled that in early February, local press said China began gathering a planetary defense team following the discovery of a large asteroid that could reach Earth within seven years.
This after the European Space Agency (ESA) estimated the probability that the asteroid 2024 YR4 reaches the land by 2032 by 2,2%, placing it on top of the agency's risk list. Weeks later, ESA descended the likelihood of impact to 0.002%, but set the likelihood of an impact on the moon by 1.7%, which remains “very low”.
"Earth can only be hit by a significant asteroid in 100 years or a thousand years, but how early we detect them, better," said IP. In addition to detection, the astronomer stressed the importance of planetary defense missions such as Dart of the US Aerospace Agency, NASA, which in 2022 intended in an asteroid. “We have to experience how to get away from Earth, because asteroids are usually surrounded by smaller objects, it's almost like hitting a sandbag,” IP explained.

The flowering of the cherry trees, or "Sakura" in Japanese, is long awaited by both Japanese and tourists, but is threatened by the advanced age of many of these trees, which are between 70 and 80 years old. Given the risk of extinction and increased maintenance costs, local authorities are resorting to “tree doctors”.
To help collect more data on cherry trees, the Japanese Kirin Beverage company has developed a new tool called “Sakura Ai Camera”. This application allows users to evaluate the condition and age of cherry women using photos taken with mobile phones and a five -level scale that goes from “very healthy” to “worrying”.
AI, trained in 5,000 images and assisted by these “medical experts”, analyzes the trees to assess. Photos of the trees, of their condition and location are then compiled on the Sakura Ai Camera website. Since its launch last month, about 20,000 new photos have been recorded, and data are available online for free to local authorities.
“We heard that the preservation of cherry people required human and financial resources, and that it was difficult to collect information. I think we can help it,” explains Risa Shioda of Kirin's marketing department.
According to the district of Meguro, in Tokyo (southwest), famous for a neighborhood decorated by cherry trees, planting a new tree costs the equivalent of 6,210 euros.
Hiroyuki Wada, from the association of “tree doctors”, which helped oversee the development of the tool, says it is “wonderful to be able to identify the location and condition of cherry trees”. For him, the ideal would be for experts to use this data to analyze the reasons for cherry fragility.
Wada, who often inspects cherry trees in Tokyo, recently noted an increase in the number of trees that require special care. "I am very worried. Environmental changes are usually gradual, but now they are visible," he warns.
"We have the impact of heat and, of course, the lack of rainfall, not to mention the age of the trees, which naturally makes the situation more serious," he says.
The Japan Meteorological Agency reported in January that 2024 was the hottest year of the archipelago since the start of the records.
Since last year, Kirin has begun to donate part of its profits to the preservation of cherry trees.
Alcohol, especially beer, is one of the favorite drinks during “Hanami”, parties and picnics held under the trees during the Sakura season, explains Shioda.
Cherry flowers symbolize the fragility of life in Japanese culture, because in full flowering they last only about a week before the petals fall.
