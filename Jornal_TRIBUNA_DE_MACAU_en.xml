Last year, revenues rose 3.3% to over 13 billion, equivalent to twice the expenses, although they grew about 6%. In 2024, investment profits dropped 17% to about 6.2 billion, but the fund's net result increased by 5% to 6.5 billion

The Net Heritage Value of the Social Security Fund (FSS) was led by about 99.47 billion in the late 2024, translating an increase of 7% or 6.48 billion compared to 92.99 billion accounted for a year earlier, according to the body's latest annual report. The net situation exceeded 15.3 times the current expenses, which rose 5.8% to 6.74 billion last year, after retreating 54.3% between 2022 and 2023.
Given the values of 2024 and the current demographic panorama, the fund's net situation would allow almost 15 and a half years of expenses, including in an unrealistic scenario of absence of revenues in this time interval.
After announcing losses of 11.13 billion of patacas by 2022 and profits of 6.43 billion by 2023, the FSS ended last year's financial year with a positive net result of 6.48 billion, plus 4.9% annually. This growth derived part of the reinforcement of 3.3% of revenues to a total of 13.22 billion patacas.
According to the FSS, the rise in revenues was mainly due to the reduction of the worldwide impact of COVID-19 as well as the “ordered recovery of social and economic activities of Macao”, namely in the sectors of integrated tourism and leisure, which propelled the increase in regular government endowment. In addition, he stresses, "the global financial market had a generally favorable behavior," which translated into a "positive return", along with the rise in interest rate interest rates and the "alteration of the FSS investment strategy, which increased the proportion of timely deposits."
According to the report analyzed by the Jornal Tribuna de Macao, the total income of FSS investments ascended about 6.18 billion patacas over 2024, which, on the one hand, reflects an annual decrease of 16.7% compared to the profits of the previous year (7.42 billion) and, on the other, again contradicted the loss of 7.06 billion suffered by 2022. Based on the weight of term bank deposits and financial investments worldwide, the average investment income rate was 6.78%, 2.04 percentage points than in 2023.
In the previous five years, the global profit of investments totaled about 18.9 billion patacas, with an average annual return rate of 4.49%. By 2022, the return rate had been negative at 7.37%.
In 2024, the report points out, "the global financial market had a generally favorable behavior, thanks mainly to the maintenance of the positive growth of the economy, the moderate fall of inflation, the reduction of interest rates by major central banks and the" boom "of artificial intelligence, among other favorable factors." In this context, the portfolio of international actions and obligations of the FSS obtained positive income, especially the “performance of the market”.
Nonetheless, the document shows that the income of global financial investments dropped 29.3% to 3.82 billion patacas compared to 2023, with an effective rate of 10.16% (less 4.33 percentage points). On the other hand, net income resulting from time deposits increased by 17.4% to 2.36 billion in annual variation, corresponding to an effective rate of 4.42% (plus 0.11 percentage points).
In general, the FSS has again bet on a “prudent and firm investment strategy”. On December 31, 2024, the total investment assets were heading at 96.87 billion patacas (another 6.8%), including 55.52 billion in term bank deposits (plus 4.6%in annual terms) and 41.35 billion in international financial investments (plus 9.9%).
On the same date, cash and bank deposits (55.54 billion) equivalent to 55.8% of the fund's assets (99.53 billion) and financial assets (41.35 billion) had a weight of 41.5%. The fixed and intangible assets (36.05 million) accounted for 0.04% of the total, including FSS property located at Eduardo Marques Street, the equipment and software necessary for its operation, and the works of service remodeling.
In turn, current passives increased 6.1% to 56.68 million, involving essentially amounts due to suppliers and benefits and subsidies to pay.
 
More than 4.6 billion in government appropriations
Government appropriations - the contribution of the game and the reimbursements of 1% and 3% of the central budget execution balance - rose to 6.18 billion patacas (over 33.5%), or 46.8% of total revenues. In addition to investment, interest and dividend (6.28 billion) income, which constituted 47.5%of total revenue, the FSS also received 379.51 million (less 0.5%) in contributions to the Social Security regime and 362.92 million (plus 10.4%) of non -resident workers' hiring rate.
The amount of contributions paid to the FSS integrated 309.62 million of the compulsory regime (less 0.7%) and 69.88 million of the optional regime (plus 0.5%). The mandatory regime was thus responsible for 81.6% of contributions.
In the chapter of expenses, the fund associates the annual increase of about 372.21 million with the growth of spending on the installments of the social security regime and the currency losses resulting from the devaluation of Renminbi compared to Pataca. On the other hand, the FSS states that "the risk of risk of financial assets and the various accounts to be received, and a value of 22.74 million patacas for provisions for impairment and provisions for dubious collection credits was determined."
The installments of the Social Security regime and social allowances implied expenses of 6.28 billion (plus 4.4%), representing 93.1% of the total. Expenses with FSS personnel (181.57 million) rose 5.1%, while financial and other administrative expenses - mainly intended for the payment of service consultants, depositaries and investment managers - grew 2.6% to 129.56 million.
During last year, 351,862 beneficiaries made the payment of contributions, illustrating an annual decrease of 1.5% or 5,325 people. The universe of beneficiaries encompassed 283,978 of the mandatory regime (80.7% total) and 67,884 of the optional regime.
In 2024, 8,968 new beneficiaries were registered (less 1,208 or 11.9%). In the mandatory regime, the new beneficiaries registered (7,556) descended 15.2%, but at the optional (1,412) increased 11.2%.
 
Pension beneficiaries rose 5% to almost 167 thousand
The universe of pension beneficiaries grew 5.3% (plus 8,376 individuals) to 166,895 between 2023 and 2024, indicates the annual report of the Social Security Fund. The number includes 153,923 pension beneficiaries for the elderly (plus 4.7%), representing 92.2%of the total, and 12,972 of the disability pension (plus 13.1%). Already the beneficiaries of subsidies fell 81.8%, from 80.262 to 14,640. By 2024, the fund paid 5.17 billion patacas in pensions for the elderly (plus 4.4%) and 572.10 million in disability pensions (plus 12.6%), in addition to 468.89 million for extraordinary pension (plus 5.8%). The different subsidies required a total expense of 69.75 million (less 39%). Throughout the year, the FSS filed 13,058 requests for the various pensions, which marks a homologous break of 14.8%. The requests for the anticipation of the pension for the elderly of the Old Regime dropped 20.1% to 7,800. The body also accounted for 15,143 subsidy requirements, less 83.1% than in 2023, especially the birth allowance (4,832 cases).</description><pubDate>2025-08-05 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Slaughter and animal adoptions decreased 30% by June</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/abates-adopcoes-de-animais-diminuiram-30-ate-junho/</link><description>According to data from the Institute for Municipal Affairs, in the first half of the year 213 animals were slaughtered, less 30% than in the same period last year.

The new predictions are still in the July result, which has broken the record since the start of the pandemic

Praveen Choudhary, Anson Lee and Stephen Grambling, Banco Morgan Stanley analysts, revolved the growth predictions of the game's gross recipes in Macao in 2025 from 5% to 10%. The investment bank foresees that EBITDA (results before interest, taxes, amortization and depreciation) of six game operators grow 6%, triple the previous forecast (2%). Consultant Seport Research Partners also updated its projections, from a growth from 7% to 9%.
Bank estimates on the game's annual revenues point to values of around 248.96 billion patacas and a daily average of 682 million. Morgan Stanley updated their projections after the inspection and coordination of games coordinating that July was the best month of the game since the pandemic, with over 22 billion patacas in gross revenues.
According to the Investment Bank, the main impulse came from the increase in inputs, resulting from facilitating the issuance of visas for visitors from cities such as Shenzhen and Zhuhai. In addition to the increase in the number of shows with popular Asian artists, the MSAR also benefited from the drop in popularity of Thailand and Japan between visitors from the continent and Hong Kong, as well as the appreciation of Renminbi, according to the bank.
Vitaly Umansky, an analyst at Seport Research Partners, stressed that July's results "exceeded expectations again." The consultant foresees that game revenues increase 14.8% in August, in relation to the same month of 2024.
According to Unsky, "the improvement of China's economy, especially upper -middle class consumers, is critical to boosting growth in Macao." The analyst expects a possible trade agreement between the US and China, in the context of tariffs, can also strengthen Chinese consumer confidence.
In turn, Morgan Stanley believes Macau is a good opportunity for investors, considering that consumption in mainland China is still "weak."
For this month, Deutsche Bank foresees an annual increase of 10.5%to 22.1 billion patacas. Stephen Pizzella, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, anticipates revenues of about 63.2 billion patacas in the third quarter and 245 billion for the entire year 2025, which would correspond to climbs of 12.3% and 6%, respectively. For 2026, Pizzella foresees gross revenues of 253.5 billion patacas, more 3.5% than in 2025.

Indonesia, China, Malaysia, Taiwan and Denmark conquered the categories of singular, masculine and female, and pairs, men, women and mixed, respectively. Highlight for the triumph of Chinese Chen Yufei, Thursday of the world ranking and only “footage” of the tournament to confirm the status of favorite

Indonesian Alwi Farhan and the Chinese Chen Yufei won the categories of male and female singular, respectively, from the Badminton de Macao Open, which took place for almost a week in the East Asia (Macao Dome) sports ship. In the remaining categories, the titles were reached by Malaysia (male peers), Taiwan (female peers) and Denmark (mixed peers).
The last day of the tournament was marked by the conditions of the floor, due to the rain that fell in Macao and which caused some infiltrations in the coverage of the pavilion. The final of male singles, played in the middle of the afternoon, was the most impaired, with several stops for cleaning the court, wet in some areas where players evolved.
This final set a front-to-front two young people who promise to occupy, in the near future, top places in the international ranking: Alwi Farhan (20 years) and Justin Ho Wei (21), Malaysian player. Indonesian, world junior champion in 2023, 25th of the ranking before the territory Open (is expected to climb several positions thanks to the victory) and fifth pre-designed in the mashed race, led to the 45th of the ranking, in two “sets”, partial 21-15 and 21-5, showing great potential and an investigated technique throughout the event.
In this category, the main favorite, with the status of the first “head-of-head”, was Lee Cheuk Yiu, from Hong Kong, 15th in the world, who was eliminated in the second round by Indian Tharun Mannepalli, after having had some difficulty away from away Pang Fong, Macao representative.
In the female sector, the 27 -year -old Chinese Chen Yufei who performed at Open as the most categorized player in terms of ranking (number five) gave no hypotheses to all opponents, having only wasted a set in the second round of Malay Goh Jin Wei. In the decisive meeting to assign the title, the Golden Medal athlete at the Tokyo Olympic Games in 2020 won the 25-year-old Danish Line Drost Christophersen, with the 32 world, with 21-17 and 21-17 partials.
In male peers, the victory was the Indonesian duo formed by Sabar Gutama and Muhammad Isfahani, in a very balanced confrontation, only resolved in the final moments of the two sets. Result: 22-20 and 21-18.
In the women's peers, it was Japan's turn to ensure the conquest of the trophy through Kaho Osawa and Mai Tanabe, after a triumph over Hsieh Pei-Shan/Hung En-Tzu of Taiwan, 21-18 and 21-12.
Finally, among the mixed formations, the title went to Denmark, which presented the duo Mathias Christiannsen and Alexandra Bje. He won in the final to Malays Jimmy Wong/Lai Pei Jing, 21-13 and 21-16.
This was the 17th edition of Open de Macao, which was organized by Sands China and Badminton Association, and the support of the Sports Institute, having received a record number of registered athletes (442) from 29 countries or regions.
The International Federation level 300 tournament had this year a general monetary prize of 370,000 US dollars, almost three million patacas. The champions received an individual check in the amount of about 220 thousand patacas.</description><pubDate>2025-08-05 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Taiwan makes employees travel to RAE</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/ultimas/taiwan-dificulta-viagens-de-funcionarios-as-rae/</link><description>Taiwan hardened travel requirements for civil servants visiting Hong Kong and Macao in an attempt to wage Beijing's influence on the island. According to sources cited by the newspaper Taipei Times, the continent's Council of Affairs (MAC) - responsible for relations with China - changed regulation to demand that employees traveling for “unofficial motives” to Macau and Hong Kong present reports before and after visits. Those who do not deliver this information may face “disciplinary measures”, indicated the sources, adding that legislative changes will be submitted to Parliament for definitive approval and implementation.
"Travel to China, Hong Kong and Macau imply increasing risks, and Taiwan will further reinforce the management system of its government personnel," the sources said, explaining that reports should include details about meetings or contacts with "specific people" of these territories.
The change takes place about half a year after William Lai announced a set of initiatives to counteract China's influence operations, which referred to as a "hostile external force." Among the measures is the obligation to disclose by all government officials, at the central and local level, of any participation in exchanges with Chinese entities.
In April, Taiwan had already hardened the criteria for the assignment of residence to citizens of Hong Kong and Macau, for "national security reasons." At the time, Mac President Chiu Chui-Cheng explained that residence applicants from both RAE will be evaluated under a new category that will include a “national security observation period”, with the aim of “ensuring greater security” for the citizens of Taiwan.
 
Residence in “exchange” of the Passport of the RPC
On the other hand, Taiwan will require Chinese citizens who wish to settle on the island to present a certificate of resignation to the Population of the Popular Republic of China. According to the amendments proposed by the Ministry of the Interior, the applicants of legal residence will have to present notary documents that prove the loss of the registration of domicile on the continent and the waiver or absence of possession of the Chinese passport.
“Os cidadãos da China continental que pretendam fixar residência em Taiwan deverão, por lei, renunciar ao seu registo de residência e ao passaporte da China, sem manter qualquer identidade dupla”, indicou o ministério, sem especificar quando entrará em vigor a nova norma.
On Friday, an eastern village boss of Taiwan was allegedly dismissed to keep Chinese nationality, becoming the first local employee for this reason. This is Deng Wan-Hua, a native of Sichuan province, who moved to Taiwan in 1997 after marrying a Taiwanese, and obtained the island's identity card for 17 years. Since 2022, he had worked as head of the village of Xuetian, in the municipality of Fuli.
"I have no Chinese nationality. What's the problem?" Deng told CNA, accusing the Interior Ministry and the party in power, the Progressive Democratic Party, to be forcing its dismissal.
Fuli's mayor, Chiang Tung-Cheng, explained that he received instructions from the Interior Ministry in October 2024 to act based on the law of nationality, which prohibits the exercise of public office to individuals with double nationality. Chiang recalled that, according to Taiwan's legislation, mainland and Taiwan are considered two areas of the same country, which prevents Chinese citizens from formally waiving their nationality or from obtaining a certificate of resignation from Beijing.
Nevertheless, local authorities have decided to dismiss Deng to “ensure transparency” and allow the courts to comment on the case, he justified.

In the opinion of 40% of respondents, the types of existing courses are insufficient
 
An inquiry promoted by the Federation of Macao Workers Associations (Faom) between January and May this year reveals that out of a total of 1,336 local service sector workers, 62% did not participate in vocational training last year before the investigation is held. In addition, 40% consider the types of vocational training courses insufficient.
According to Faom, on the other hand, almost 35% of respondents pointed out that the quality of vocational training teachers needs to be improved, while only 32% said they know government policies in vocational training. For the association, this shows that the workers inquired have little knowledge about this matter.
Another conclusion highlighted by FAO is that about 30% of workers in the alected service sector are aware of the training on psychological adjustment and stress management.
Based on the conclusions obtained through the inquiry, FAOM suggested to the government to establish a diversified support system for vocational training in the service sector. Leong Sun IOK, a subdirector of Faom, proposed the exemption or reduction of taxes, in order to encourage companies to value more workers' training, including flexible working hours and paid training license. In this regard, the deputy also appealed to the creation of a Financial Support Fund for Vocational Training.
In addition, Faom argued that the government must stimulate psychological counseling institutions, companies and associations to launch training courses related to psychological skills. At the same time, it expects the government to integrate mental health in the public vocational training system and to subsidize the workers of the service sector who participate in these courses.
On the other hand, the association asked the government to create a database on teachers in charge of vocational training. In this aspect, he suggested that higher education institutions are encouraged to teach vocational training courses and improve the remuneration conditions and reputation of teachers.</description><pubDate>2025-08-05 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Public hospital already uses AI technology</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/hospital-publico-ja-usa-tecnologia-de-ia/</link><description>AI technology is already being used in the public hospital, and the SSM director indicated that it will be extended to the tracking of diabetic retinopathy, “among other areas”. Alvis Lo pointed out that the idea is to “improve the efficiency of medical services”
 
Health services (SSM) “have dynamically introduced artificial intelligence technology (AI) to improve the efficiency of medical services,” said the body's director, Alvis Lo, in response to a interpellation of Deputy Ho Ion Sang. According to said, the reading of computed tomography to the chest, by AI support, is being used at the Conde de São Januário Hospital Center (CHCSJ).

At the same time, SSM will continue to maintain exchange and cooperation with China's interior AI technology companies, taking as reference the experience of development and application development, “in conjunction with local health needs to promote adequate innovative solutions, in order to raise the level of the local intelligent health system and deepen the quality and accessibility of medical services”, can be read in replica.
On the other hand, it ensures that, in the future, the government of the MSAR “will continue to reinforce cooperation between the two public hospitals,” referring to the Macao Union Macao Medical Center. In this context, Alvis Lo states that it will be reviewed and adjusted, “dynamically”, the allocation of resources “according to the turnover rate of health professionals, the volume of services provided and the needs of society, in order to ensure the stability of human resources and improve the experience of residents in search of medical consultation”.
Until early July, the Island Health Care Complex held more than 10,000 external specialty consultations and about nine thousand imaging exams, he said. It is recalled that it was in January this year that this hospital began to receive patients from the São Januário emergency service.
“With the progressive development of various medical services in collaboration with the Macau Union Medical Center, it is expected that by the end of 2027, 25% of CHCSJ medical services can be reimbursed,” reiterated Alvis Lo.

Following the arrest of Au Kam San, for alleged violations of the State Security Defense, Portugal commented, saying that it is following the case, while the European Union condemned the detention and showed concern. For its part, China's mission in the EU, the RPC MNE Commissioner in Macao and the Government of Masters exhorted Brussels not to interfere with “internal affairs” and not weaving “irresponsible comments”
Catarina Pereira
The case of former deputy Au Kam San - who is awaiting trial in pre -trial detention, on suspicion of violating the law on the defense of State Security - deserved reactions of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MNE) of Portugal, which claims to be following the situation of the Portuguese citizen, as well as the European Union (EU), which condemned the detention and expressed concern about the “erosion of political pluralism and freedom of expression”. After the comments of Brussels, Macao and Beijing opposed “firmly” to the “interference” of the EU “in the internal affairs of MSAR” and China.
Following the detention of Au Kam San, the Jornal Tribuna de Macao requested a reaction to the MNE of Portugal, also questioning that the joint statement on the issue of Macao, signed in 1987, has been being fulfilled with regard to rights and freedoms - a question that was unanswered.
In the email sent to this newspaper, Portuguese diplomacy states that MNE “is following this subject, through the consulate general of Portugal in Macau”. Paulo Rangel's office also assured that the case "will deserve the best attention of the Portuguese authorities, from the outset in future meetings at the political level, in the spirit of the joint statement."
However, the liberal initiative (IL) will propose to the Portuguese Republic Assembly (AR) a vote of condemnation of the detention of AU and to ask the government to request clarification from the Chinese authorities. According to the voting project to which Lusa had access, IL states that the Portuguese State has the “duty to rigorously follow” the case and ensure respect for the commitments made in the joint statement. The air “cannot remain silent in the face of the arrest of a fellow citizen that dedicated his life to the defense of freedom, nor can ignore the degradation of the regime of freedoms in Macao,” he argues.
In turn, the EU condemned "the detention of the European citizen and former deputy of Macao", in which "the first application of the law on the defense of state security in the since of its adoption in 2009" is constituted. The European service for external action adds that "this development aggravates existing concerns about the continuing erosion of political pluralism and freedom of expression in the MSAR."
Noting that “respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms is a central element of the Macao Basic Law and the“ a country, two systems ”principle”, EU diplomacy also recalls China's duty to respect that the premise of respect for the rights of Macao residents was also established through the Sino-Portuguese joint statement and the international pact on civil and political rights.
It is recalled that the PJ said it had "strong evidence" that Au Kam San was in collusion with a "anti-china organization", having provided "a large amount of false provocative information, for public display abroad and online." In addition, he will "disturb" the election to the 2024 Chief Executive, as well as "to which foreign countries take measures against Macao." The former deputy is thus accused of the crime of “establishment of connections with organizations, associations or individuals from outside the MSAR for acts against state security”, whose prison sentence may be from three to 10 years.
However, this newspaper sent a series of issues to PJ, in order to clarify some aspects, but the authorities did not advance more information. We asked, in particular, if there are more people to be investigated on suspicion of violation of the State Security Defense, that false information was disclosed by Au and with which “anti-china” organizations, as well as how the former deputy disturbed the election of the chief executive, given that “it took place within normal”, as the authorities said at the time.
“China's internal affairs”
China's mission in the EU, in turn, expressed “strong discontent and firm opposition” to Brussels' statements. “The application of the law where it exists and the punishment of violations are basic principles of a society governed by law,” said the spokesman, considering that the measures taken are “blameless”: “The government of the Masters, by punishing in accordance with the National Security Acts with hostile forces abroad that in danger of national security, has legal foundation and rational justification, in accordance with international law and international law common ”.
In addition, he stressed that "Macau's affairs are purely internal issues in China" and "the EU has no right to make irresponsible comments." The mission of China thus urged the European part "to scrupulously respect international law and the fundamental rules of international relations, to respect China's sovereignty and the rule of law in Macao, and immediately cease interference with Macao and China's internal affairs."
Also the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China in the masters repudiated the "illusory comments", classifying them as a "gross interference in Macao affairs and in the internal affairs of China." "We urge the EU immediately to make remarks and unfounded accusations about Macao's affairs and stop immediately to interfere with Macao's affairs and China's internal affairs!"
In the same note, he says he supports "firmly the government government in the performance of his duties in accordance with the law", as well as the police "in taking law enforcement measures against the anti-china rebels against Macau, in accordance with the law."
The Commissioner even argues that "since the return of Macau to the country, the" one country, two systems "system has been continually improved and national sovereignty, safety and the interests of development have been effectively safeguarded." "The democratic political system has been perfected and the residents of Macao enjoy a wider range of rights and freedoms than in any other moment in history," he adds.
In this sense, “the maintenance of national security is the prior condition and the most important and fundamental basis for the survival and development of the State”, so “the government of the MSAR, in accordance with the National Security Act, punishes the acts of collusion with hostile forces outside the territory that endanger national security, which is in accordance with international law and common international practice, and is justified by the reasonable, unquestionable and unquestionable law!
Also the Government of Misrees repudiated “vehemently” the EU's statements, opposing “firmly”. In a statement, the Executive points out that "in the investigation process, MSAR police and judicial authorities have always dealt with the case scrupulously under the law" and adds that "the defendant's procedural law is effectively guaranteed under the law."
It also states that "the fundamental rights of MSAR residents, including the right of suffrage and freedom of expression, are fully safeguarded." By the way, “since the return to the homeland, the mashes has reached worldwide notable successes in safeguarding human rights, and no one can overlook them,” he says.
The executive later states that the application of the law on the State Security by the MSAR “is strictly an internal subject of China and its special administrative region”, so “any foreign or abroad bodies, including the European Union, have no right to interference”.
"Mand will continue, as always, to comply with the duties of state security defense under the law, in favor of lasting and stable successful application of the" one country, two systems, "he adds.
Au Kam San in Preventive Prison
Au Kam San will wait for the trial in pre -trial detention. According to the Public Prosecution Service (MP), the coercion measure was applied by the criminal court judgment "for concluding the existence of strong evidence of the crime of establishing bonds with organizations, associations or individuals outside the sinhel to practice acts against state security." The MP also underlines that "it will actually fulfill its legally established functions and strictly perform the tasks defined by the law on the defense of state security." Finally, it appeals to citizens to “do not practice any acts against state security”, as it adds, “the responsibility and duty of the defense of national security must be assumed by each people in China, including residents of Macao”.</description><pubDate>2025-08-04 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Casa de Portugal receives jazz concert to 23rd Fringe Festival</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/casa-de-portugal-recebe-concerto-de-jazz-para-23o-festival-fringe/</link><description>The Fringe Festival will return in September, with a program of activities and shows distributed throughout the city.

Gross Macao game revenues grew 19% in July, in annual terms, exceeding the first time of 22 billion patacas since the start of the pandemic. Reinforcing the recent acceleration trend, the growth recorded last month represents about twice the average projections of analysts and maintains the invoicing of casinos well above government forecasts, which have been low magazines in the table of changes to the budget of the MSAR to 2025

Macao casinos have established a new record since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic ending July with gross revenues of nearly 22.13 billion patacas, according to data published on the electronics page of the DICJ Inspection and Coordination Directorate. The previous maximum postcovid dated May this year, when revenues reached 21.19 billion, driven by the increase of visitors during the “Golden Week” commemorative Labor Day.
July revenues represent a 5% increase compared to 21.06 billion accounted for the previous month and an increase of 19% compared to 18.60 billion in the same period of 2024. In addition, the comparison with 24.45 billion recorded in July 2019, the pre-pound year, illustrates a recovery of 90.5%, above the levels of resumption verified in June (88.5%) and May) and May levels (81.7%).
With the July accounts closed, the amount accumulated in the first seven months of this year was around 140.90 billion patacas, reflecting an increase of 6.5% for the same period of 2024, when the billing reached 132.35 billion. Between January and July, the total of gross revenues corresponded to 81% of the first seven months of 2019 (173.96 billion).
After having advanced 19% in June in the homologous variation, gross revenues thus consolidated the recent acceleration trend, which some analysts have largely attributed to the impact of several shows held on game operators enterprises. Despite coinciding with the beginning of the third quarter of the year, which is usually the least productive period for casinos, immediately due to the absence of “golden weeks” in the interior of China, the July result was still much higher than general expectations.
According to Steven Pizzella, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, the latest information from consultants and investment houses suggested annual growth between 12% and 16%. The average projection of the “Consensus metrix consensus” platform foreseen a 9.5%increase.
With the monthly average to be encrypted by 20.13 billion Patacas between January and July, casinos are also counteracting the traditionally more conservative forecasts of the Executive, and may end the year with total revenues of 241.54 billion if they maintain this record. However, this bar should also be exceeded, as the seasonality factor may further expand the prospects for the second half.
In the initial budget for 2025, the Government of MSAR predicted gross revenues of the game of about 240 billion this year. However, in the proposal of amendment approved in June, the estimate was reviewed at low to 228 billion Patacas. It is recalled that, in the general calculation of 2024, the casinos raised 226.78 billion, more 23.9% than in 2023 and 77.5% of 2019 level.
For this month, Deutsche Bank foresees an annual rise from 10.5% to $ 2.73 billion (22.10 billion patacas to the current exchange rate). On the other hand, using historical records, notes that between 2013 and 2019, the daily average revenue rose 2.1% between July and August, which could translate this month into an annual increase of 14.5%.
Analyst Steven Pizzella now anticipates revenues of US $ 7.81 billion (63.17 billion patacas) in the third quarter and $ 30.30 billion for the entire year (244.95 billion patacas), which would equivalent to homologous climbs of 12.3% and 6%, respectively. The projection for 2026 advocates an annual increase of 3.5%to $ 31.35 billion (253.45 billion patacas).</description><pubDate>2025-08-04 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Pavilion at Expo2025 in Osaka “Already Fruit” in the promotion of Portugal</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/lazer/pavilhao-na-expo2025-em-osaka-ja-deu-frutos-na-promocao-de-portugal/</link><description>Vitor Quintã*
With Expo 2025 Osaka in half, the director of the Portugal Pavilion, Bernardo Amaral, told Lusa that the space “has already given fruit” in the promotion of Portuguese companies and cooperation with Japanese institutions.
Bernardo Amaral revealed that six Portuguese entities have already signed agreements since the opening of the event on April 13, including the Catholic University that will cooperate with Sophia University, located in Tokyo.
CORKSRIBAS, based in Santa Maria da Feira, which was one of the suppliers of the cork used at the Portugal Pavilion, signed a new partnership with the Japanese company Toa-CORK “for the next ten years,” he said. Turismo de Portugal has signed an agreement with the Japanese homologous and Better With Lucks, an almond producer from Idanha-a-Nova, “had an excellent meeting with a Japanese distributor,” added the leader.
"It only fills us with pride three months that there is actually these businesses already done. We are certain that in the next two, three years the numbers will be much larger," said Amaral.
The director of the Portugal Pavilion said he had no doubt that the global investment of about 21 million euros in the project was already worth the “media attraction” and the number of visitors.
The Portuguese Commissioner of Portugal at Expo2025 in Osaka, Joana Gomes Cardoso, told Lusa that the space already exceeded one million visitors, and the goal for the entire event was 1.2 million.
But Bernardo Amaral now predicts that up to two million people can pass the Portugal Pavilion by October 13, because the organization has revealed that "there is an increase in ticket sales for the last month."
One of the space missions is “the internationalization of economy and foreign investment attraction”, serving as “a platform for Portuguese companies and institutions to project in Japan,” said the leader.
The space, by Japanese architect Kengo Kuma, has 1,800 square meters and has a terrace, two permanent exhibition areas, a store and two multi -arted rooms. One of the rooms, which was delivered to the University of Aveiro, has now begun to be used by the Blue Ocean Foundation to demonstrate “actually global solutions” to the oceans, Amaral said.
The Foundation invited Bluebio Aliança to “give visibility” to blue bioeconomic products that are “successful cases, Raquel Gaião Silva, a member of the Portuguese network.
“These 'startups', despite being international, all went through Portugal,” said Gaião Silva.
Some are interested in exploring the Japan market and the leader believes they can “attract potential partners” during Expo, while others want to “learn from Asian countries”, namely in the area of Aquaculture.
"The idea is that we can have here [in Japan] an open door," said Gaião Silva.
