A normal “regional” and even “international” trend, Agnes Lam told this newspaper. However, if adjustments are not made to housing policy and taking into account the growing trend of population aging, existing social homes could be “insufficient”, argued the academic. Jacky Ho, specialized in Gerontology, also argues that social housing policy must be “rethought”, especially because there are numerous buildings in the territory that will be more than 50 years old in the coming years, and are therefore unsuitable for the day-to-day lives of elderly people.

The social houses planned by the Government may not be sufficient if adjustments are not made, consider academics interviewed by the TRIBUNA DE MACAU newspaper, arguing that housing policy must be rethought. According to data provided by the Housing Institute (IH) to this newspaper, of the 15,558 representatives of households renting social housing, more than half were aged 65 or over. Specifically, in mid-September, there were 8,406 elderly tenants, equivalent to 54% of the total population.
According to IH data, there are 4,674 tenants (around 30%) in the 45 to 64 age group, 2,465 (around 16%) in the 23 to 44 age group, and, finally, just 13 tenants aged between 18 and 22.
Taking into account the continued aging trend in the territory - projections from the Statistics and Census Services indicate that the oldest segment of the population will increase to 164,400 in 2041, at an average annual growth rate of 3.5%, “considerably higher” than that of the total population (0.7%) -, Agnes Lam, director of the Macau Studies Center, considers that social housing could “probably be insufficient, if there are no adjustments”.
"The percentage of elderly people is increasing and greater life expectancy means longer periods of occupation, increasing the accumulated demand for social housing units. Turnover is low, that is, elderly people vacate housing units less frequently, delaying availability for new candidates", noted the also former deputy.
Furthermore, Agnes Lam added that “if the new supply is far from transport, clinics, markets or community centers, for example in Zone A, the practical demand for these units may be lower than the nominal supply suggests”.
According to data provided by the Government, as of September 25th, 1,727 applicants for social housing were on the waiting list, of which only 184 had already been notified to present documents for consideration before being allocated a home. The majority, 946 (around 55%), were households made up of just one person, followed by households with two members (568), with three members (193), with four people (16) and with five people or more (4).
As for the age group, there are 358 candidates on the waiting list who are 65 years old or over, representing 21% of the total, with the majority being in the group between 45 and 64 years old and between 23 and 44 years old, for a total of 682 and 875, respectively. There are only 12 candidates aged between 18 and 22.
The fractions available for allocation, in turn, were 1,054 in mid-September, in addition, 5,494 were under construction (all in Zone A of the New Landfills) and 352 in the process of repair.
Asked whether the planned social homes will be sufficient to meet demand, Jacky Ho, director of the Faculty of Medical Sciences at the University of Saint Joseph (USJ) and specialized in Gerontology at the University of Sydney, argued that “the main focus should not be demand and supply, but rather rethinking our housing policy and the eligibility of potential residents, such as those who own an apartment in an old building”.
"It is important to keep in mind that GDP growth has increased dramatically in the last decade and that these 'potential residents' belong to a generation without an adequate retirement plan. They may have had an apartment, but they cannot meet the eligibility requirements of the current social housing program," he added.
Jacky Ho noted that Macau has many buildings that will exceed 50 years old in the next few years. “Without long-term strategies on how to rebuild these areas in time, these potential residents will have no choice but to remain in these old buildings, without adequate facilities or equipment for elderly care,” he predicted.
In the opinion of the USJ professor, it is necessary to outline strategies for the next decade, "If we expect an increase in the number of elderly people in the future who will try to find a home outside of these old buildings, we also hope that they will be able to find housing options with the help of the Government. Which means that the Government must work with social service organizations and experts in designing homes with an environment suitable for elderly people. I believe that social housing can be a great platform for this”, he stressed.
From Jacky Ho's perspective, one should not just think about building more apartments for the elderly, but rather find social housing and establish a quota there, for example, 20% of the units being allocated to the elderly. “I believe this could be a way to help alleviate the predictable burden that the population will have to deal with due to the aging population,” he added.
Regarding the ten-year policies that are being reviewed by the Institute of Social Action, Jacky Ho also argues that the Action Plan for Support Services for the Elderly and the Planning for Rehabilitation Services “should be analyzed together and aligned”. “Part of the rehabilitation plan has a lot in common with elderly care services, because as elderly people get older, their bodies become fragile and, in some way, they may have some type of disability,” he noted. Furthermore, it also proposes that the Executive create an independent department that focuses on population aging.
 
Elderly people “pushed” into subsidized options
Agnes Lam explained that it is natural for social housing to have a mostly elderly population, an “international and regional” trend. Firstly, because “the pension is normally lower than the salary of someone who works”, then because they have a greater need for health care. “Proximity to public services such as clinics and community centers, as well as accessibility features make social housing attractive relative to older private buildings without elevators or renovations,” he noted.
The academic also highlights that the criteria for evaluating economic resources and the priority score tend to favor older candidates, in addition to the fact that private house rents are higher in relation to the average income after retirement, “pushing the elderly towards subsidized options”.
Does this mean that the support granted by the Government to the elderly population is insufficient? “Not necessarily, but there are signs of gaps”, responds Agnes Lam. “Subsidies can reach many elderly people, but still not cover the real costs of rent, healthcare and assistance, especially with inflation and medical expenses”, she highlights.
Furthermore, it also points to the “gap in housing supply”: “Even with subsidies, if affordable and well-located units are limited, elderly people will accumulate on waiting lists for social housing or remain in unsuitable homes”.
Jacky Ho also notes that the majority of elderly people in social housing depend either on their savings or on those who support them. "From the research perspective in Macau, we realized that almost 85% of elderly people depend on government subsidies or financial support. This means that if they do not have [their own support], they actually depend on less than 5,000 patacas per month from the Government." In this sense, “the only housing options that may exist are housing with government support, in this case, social houses”.
 
Requirements for new social housing
The professor considers that, in basic terms, the requirements for new constructions include “having a social service organization to serve the residents of these social housing”, “implementing a project for an adapted structure for the elderly and people with disabilities in these buildings” and “installing technology that can help monitor the individuals who live in this environment”. At the same time, “we have to increase the number of home care services,” said Jacky Ho.
Agnes Lam considers that there are five criteria to take into account: accessibility, well-being, services and community, location and mobility, and, finally, management and maintenance. "Step-free paths, wide doors/corridors, reliable elevators are necessary, as well as non-slip floors, door handles, clear and high-contrast signage. Bathrooms must have a 'walk-in' shower and grab bars, and kitchens must be accessible", he stated.
The academic also considers that it is essential to have “welcoming common spaces on all floors” and “small corners for neighbors” to create a sense of belonging and well-being. Regular social activities should also be organised, there should be follow-up visits and easy access to advice and support, as well as staff trained to understand and respond to isolation or distress.
On the other hand, within the scope of services, he argues that nurses and social workers should be deployed nearby, as well as meal programs, in addition to the need for spaces for family visits and short stays for caregivers. “Intergenerational activities” are another point highlighted by Agnes Lam.
For this population group, it is also important that, close to social housing, there is public transport, clinics, pharmacies, markets, parks; barrier-free sidewalk, shade and benches every 50-100 meters; as well as covered and safe areas for boarding/disembarking. In terms of management and maintenance, he argues that repairs must be quick and that there must be clear help channels for emergency situations.</description><pubDate>2025-10-15 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>“Blackbird” on the balcony and on the street resulted in “positive interaction”</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/blackbird-a-varanda-na-rua-resultou-em-interaccao-positiva/</link><description>The show “Jazzés &amp; the Blackbird”, promoted by Casa de Portugal at the Fringe Festival, once again gave wings to jazz music on the balcony of the headquarters building of the Portuguese-based association.

Jazz music, taking as its stage the balcony of the building where the Casa de Portugal headquarters are located, was once again the basis of another “out the window” show, this time integrated into the Fringe Festival program. “Jazzés &amp; the Blackbird” was the title of the event with which the Portuguese-based association contributed to this year's edition of the artistic event that transforms the city into a stage, taking shows and activities to different areas of Macau, including community neighborhoods.
Being a festival that integrates unexpected initiatives, it was with some surprise that passers-by on Rua Pedro Nolasco da Silva, more specifically those who passed by the door of the Western-style building, with number 28, came across a “bird in the shape of people”.
On the walk, the bird's mission was to “flutter”, attracting the attention of young people and adults. Above, on the balcony, three more giant birds, these static, placed behind each member of the band playing jazz music. With this apparatus, many stopped to watch and take photographs. That was the objective of the initiative.
This whole performance, designed to mark yet another contribution from Casa de Portugal to the Fringe Festival program, “resulted in a very positive interaction”, according to the interpreter of the “black bird” exhibition, Elisa Vilaça, to the newspaper TRIBUNA DE MAC AU. The person responsible for dressing the animal's “skin” highlighted that the “public's reaction was very interesting, both from Chinese tourists and residents, who at first were surprised and somewhat apprehensive about my figure there on the street, but quickly joined in the games, especially the younger ones, providing moments of great laughter”.
The artist, who produced all the figures, considers that the show was “very positive”, noting that “the only problem is the fact that the place is very busy, with a lot of traffic, and therefore we need to be very careful, because people then start to gather on the other side, on the street next to the Consulate, to stay in the shade, watching the show and taking photographs”.
The “Jazzés &amp; the Blackbird” event took place over two days, in two daily sessions of half an hour each, in the morning and in the afternoon, with one of the sessions having to be postponed until the following week, due to the passage of Typhoon Ragasa.
In reviewing the activity, Elisa Vilaça states that “it is an initiative to repeat in the future, because it is always very interesting to interact with the public”. In his particular case, the “black bird”, the experience was positive.
“Contrary to what it seems, appearing to be an expansive person, I am often not that much, but there is a characteristic in me, perhaps because I have worked with children and theater for many years, the moment I play a character in a show, when I stop being Elisa and start being a bird or something else, I assume the role to the maximum, in what I really think are the characteristics of the element I am playing”.
The important thing is “to have a young spirit, and I do despite my age, since my mind remains perfectly open”, he emphasizes.
Tomás Ramos de Deus was the lead singer of the “show”, alongside musicians Paulo Pereira (saxophone) and Miguel Andrade (guitar), who had some supporting audio, having repeated the experience of singing on the balcony, after “Fado à Janela”, which Casa de Portugal also launched in March this year.
The musician from the institution's resident band, “80 &amp; Tal”, revealed to JTM that “Bye Bye Blackbird”, being a song written in honor of Charlie Parker, “was the one we chose because we really liked it, so we designed the project around that, starting to select an entire jazz repertoire around that involvement”. More classic songs were chosen, “but we also looked for some bossa nova songs, old ones from the 40s, and also selected modern jazz”, he highlighted.
Comparing it with “Fado à Janela”, he says that “the impact was the same, just something different, because this one had a greater visual impact, but in musical terms it was similar”.
“80 &amp; Tal”’s next performance is next weekend, at the Hush!” Festival, at Hac Sá Beach and at the Temporary Leisure Zone, in Coloane, followed by a performance at the Lusofonia Festival, on the 25th of October, immediately before Kalema’s take to the stage. “Then we’re going to play our Portuguese popular music project, pimba music, which is going to be a funny thing”, he observes.
Regarding Casa de Portugal's next initiatives, Elisa Vilaça told this newspaper that “there is a lot of work to do” for the Chinese New Year Celebration Parade, in the second half of February, and the Macau International Parade, in March, with no themes yet defined. “These are large-scale projects and our concern is to always give a good image of the House with great care”, he mentions.</description><pubDate>2025-10-15 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Coimbra and UM share database on Camões</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/coimbra-um-partilham-base-de-dados-sobre-camoes/</link><description>For the first time, the Portuguese poet Luís Vaz de Camões will have a universal, online database, developed by the University of Coimbra and with the support of its counterpart in Macau.

A universal online database on Luís Vaz de Camões, developed by the University of Coimbra (UC) will be available for consultation, from the middle of next year, both at the higher education establishment in that Portuguese city, and at the University of Macau (UM). The archive of information relating to the life and work of what is considered the greatest poet in the Portuguese language and one of the greatest in world literature, has the support of UM, and this collaboration will be expressed in a document to be initialed today in the early afternoon, in a ceremony to be held at the Macao SAR's “flag” university.
“There are already databases on Shakespeare, Cervantes and others, but there is nothing on Camões, so we give our support to the work carried out by UC”, Rui Martins, vice-rector for Global Affairs at UM, told Jornal TRIBUNA DE MACAU, adding that “this database will exist online at UC and also here at UM”.
Luís de Camões has a connection to the territory, “being a very important figure in Macau, which is why it makes sense to have a database here that makes the poet known universally”. The vice-rector thus explains the reasons for his connection to this project, through the support of the university's own Foundation.
In Macau there is nothing like this. “This will be a universal database that requires some development and research work from UC colleagues who will apply it to this project”, he expresses, highlighting that “it will be open to everyone, but will be based in Coimbra and also here in our university library”, and is expected to be available in 2026, “in a significant year for UM, which celebrates 45 years of existence”.
Before the collaboration signing session between the two sides, UM's admission to a UNESCO chair at UC will be formalized, which will be attended by the vice-rector of the Coimbra university, João Nuno Calvão da Silva.
The chair, which is a study or research center, is focused on the area of ​​intercultural dialogue and Portuguese-influenced heritage. “This is a chair coordinated by Coimbra, which covers several Portuguese-speaking and European universities, with UM now being admitted to this group”, indicated Rui Martins. A professor responsible for the chair, Walter Rossa, from UC, will also be present at the event, “and we will have our colleagues who will talk about the topic”, informed the academic.
Regarding the importance of this admission, remember that Macau is part of UNESCO heritage. “Therefore, this is a chair linked to intercultural dialogue between heritages, particularly those of Portuguese heritage, which is why it makes sense for us to also participate in research projects with colleagues in this area, in collaboration with Coimbra and other universities in Portuguese-speaking and European countries”, he stressed.
 
Law seminar brought together more than 100 experts
A joint UM and UC seminar brought together more than 100 experts and academics from Mainland China, Macau and Portuguese-speaking countries, who discussed emerging themes in the construction of the rule of law.
During the lecture, the rector of UM, Yonghua Song, stated that the principle of “One Country, Two Systems” guided the direction of legal research and the practice of the rule of law, providing Macau with “a miracle of development”, establishing a unique legal system and governance model.
Also speaking, the vice-rector for External Relations and Alumni at UC, João Nuno Calvão da Silva, highlighted the historic partnership between the law faculties of both universities, stating that the collaboration “has expanded to areas such as medicine and cultural heritage, reflecting the deep friendship between China and Portugal”.
António Menano, executive vice-president for Legal Affairs at MGM, highlighted that UM, UC and the gaming operator signed a cooperation agreement aimed at promoting, over the next four years, research and teaching in matters that include the reconfiguration of international law in the context of ecological transformation and the constitutional principle of the “one country, two systems” policy. This aim, he said, “will be achieved by holding seminars, granting scholarships and awarding academic prizes, with the aim of supporting students in developing diverse perspectives”.
The director of the Faculty of Law at UM, Tong Io Cheng, stated, in turn, that the harmonious coexistence of different legal systems and the deep integration between tradition and modernity allowed Macau to develop as a 'manual' of public law practice.
With the theme “Public, International, Constitutional and Administrative Law”, the event included three panels, with the participation of 14 academics from Mainland China, Macau, Portugal, Brazil, Angola and Mozambique.</description><pubDate>2025-10-15 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Chinese opera brings classics from November</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/opera-chinesa-traz-classicos-partir-de-novembro/</link><description>The new season of Chinese cultural shows will start next month, announced yesterday the president of the Cultural Institute, Leong Wai Man. Until March 2026, the IC will bring renowned groups of traditional Chinese opera from Mainland China and various activities will also be organized in schools and community neighborhoods
 
PEDRO MILHEIRÃO
Leong Wai Man yesterday presented the preliminary plan for the new season of Chinese cultural shows, which is scheduled to take place between November this year and March 2026. In addition to shows of classical Chinese opera works, the president of the Cultural Institute (IC) stated that multiple exchange activities will also be carried out in schools and community neighborhoods.
Over the next six months, Macau will host the productions of shows such as “Three Kingdoms”, “A Meeting of Heroes”, “Mulan”, “The Legend of the White Serpent” and “Goodbye, My Concubine”, as announced by the IC leader, during a press conference at the Cultural Center. In fact, some of these works will be carried out in an interactive format with public participation, allowing residents and visitors to “feel traditional Chinese culture”.
In addition to these classics, the agenda will also feature performances by other contemporary opera, musical and theater groups, “with themes known from Macau”. Leong Wai Man hopes that “cooperation with local groups will be improved so that they can participate in the shows”.
During the plenary meeting of the Consultative Council for Cultural Development, the concept of the project was presented to listen to the opinions of members and “understand how to extend activities within the community or schools and how to reinforce exchanges with local entities”, stated the president of the IC.
For his part, Lok Hei, a member of the council, said that “several members expressed their interest in this highly valuable initiative”, as it “aims to introduce residents and tourists to excellent Chinese culture”.
Lok explained that the season will be divided into “two large parts”, with one of “high quality shows” and another that will take “exchange activities and initiatives to schools and community neighborhoods”. “Since some performances will be carried out by high-quality and renowned entities, ‘masterclasses’ and workshops are also being considered for greater exchange with society”, he said.
Productions of classic works will target both older and younger spectators, offering the population an opportunity to learn about the story behind each classic, as well as “the characters and reason” behind each play. “We hope that, with this opportunity, people can experience greater enthusiasm and greater curiosity about Chinese culture”, said Lok.
Asked about the funds that the IC intends to allocate for this initiative, Leong Wai Man clarified that, since the initiative is in the preparation phase, the organization does not have any budget or total number of shows and assured that this information will be disclosed in a future presentation session.</description><pubDate>2025-10-15 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Cape Verde makes history by securing a presence in the USA</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/desporto/cabo-verde-faz-historia-ao-garantir-presenca-nos-eua/</link><description>Fans of the Cape Verde football team celebrate during the football game of the last qualifying round for the World Cup 2026 against Essuatini, at the National Stadium, in Praia, Cape Verde, October 13, 2025. Cape Verde qualified today for the first time for the final stage of a football World Cup, by imposing itself in the reception to Essuatini (3-0), in the last round of the African qualification, in which they were superior in the second time.

Cape Verde qualified for the final stage of a football World Cup for the first time, by prevailing against Essuatini (3-0), in the last round of the African qualification, in which they were superior in the second half. At the National Stadium, in Praia, Dailon Livramento, in the 48th minute, Willy Semedo, in the 54th minute, and Stopira, in the 90+1, produced the result for Bubista's team, securing first place in group D, with 23 points, four more than Cameroon, second placed, who drew 0-0 against Angola.

The 'blue sharks' reached the final round as leaders of the 'pool' and ahead of them they faced a team with no chance of qualifying, who had little desire to play, preferring to defend in a low block and stop the match several times, namely through goalkeeper Shabalala. The first 45 minutes ended up not having much cause for interest, but the second half began with the Cape Verdeans' opening goal, in the 48th minute, by Dailon Livramento.
Shortly after, the 2-0 came, which practically 'sealed' qualification for the World Cup, which will take place from June 11th to July 19th, 2026, in the USA, Canada and Mexico. A cross from the right side of the attack to the second post was received by Diney Borges, who, with his head, served Willy Semedo as a 'tray' for the second of the 'blue sharks'.
During added time, Torreense player Stopira, released in the final stretch, appeared to score Cape Verde's third, given the visitors' difficulties in releasing the ball from the dangerous area.
Cape Verde is the third newcomer to secure a place among the 48 teams present at the 2026 World Cup, along with Jordan and Uzbekistan, becoming the sixth African nation to qualify, after Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt, Algeria and Ghana.
 
Archipelago danced all night
The unprecedented qualification led to euphoria among the public at the National Stadium and was a reason for celebration on all the islands of the archipelago.
"It's a feeling of enormous joy. Our generation tried and now our children are getting there. It's a great satisfaction", said João Vieira, one of the 15 thousand spectators who filled the stadium.
As soon as the final whistle was heard, the substitutes jumped off the bench and Cape Verde's squad celebrated on the field. In the stands, the public shouted, danced and applauded the team, after 90 minutes of tireless support.
Fan Kleider Dias said he was living a dream: "Now, at the World Cup, we have to keep dreaming as long as we can. Hopefully we find Brazil, Germany or Portugal. The best. We want to be with the best."
“This becomes one of the three most important dates in the history of Cape Verde, after Independence Day and Democracy Day”, said Paulino Dias, who watched the game live, adding: “I have close friends in the USA and we will certainly be there to support”.
Cape Verde has a diaspora of around 1.5 million people, triple the number of residents in the archipelago, distributed mainly across Europe and the USA, where most of the World Cup games will take place. "I have nieces and cousins ​​in the USA who follow the game. Today is a day of celebration", said João Vieira.
Schools, public services and many companies stopped to watch the game, thanks to the point tolerance granted by the Government, with the purpose of supporting the team.
 
Government congratulates ‘Blue Sharks’
The Cape Verdean Government congratulated the football team on its first qualification for a World Cup. “Cape Verde makes History!”, congratulated the executive led by Ulisses Correia e Silva in a Facebook post. For the Government, the ‘Blue Sharks’, through this qualification, are taking the country’s name “even further”, which is a “pride for all Cape Verdeans, inside and outside the archipelago”. The Prime Minister reiterated to journalists at the stadium that this was a historic moment, “a great victory, a great game”. He also highlighted that Cape Verdean players demonstrated their ability to compete against “any team”. Asked about the logistical issue, Correia e Silva stressed that the authorities will support the team, as they have already been doing, and that they will also count on the help of FIFA.

Sam Hou Fai also called for “more collaboration models” to be explored to “create broader development opportunities”
 
The governor of Hainan Province, Liu Xiaoming, led a delegation on a visit to Macau, meeting with the Chief Executive of the Macao SAR, Sam Hou Fai. At the Government Headquarters, the leaders exchanged views on promoting cultural and economic-commercial cooperation between the two regions, as well as strengthening coordination in the promotion of tourist activities and exhibitions and conventions, according to a statement from the Social Communication Office.
Sam Hou Fai mentioned, from the outset, that the Macao SAR and the province of Hainan are located in the Greater Pearl River Delta region, having access to the vast market in Mainland China and also being linked to the Southeast Asian market. He also recalled that the parties have maintained a “frequent and in-depth exchange”, as well as “a solid basis of cooperation” in areas such as tourism, culture, exhibitions and conventions. For the Macao SAR leader, “remarkable results” were even achieved.
According to the note, the Head of Government also said that, with the joint promotion of the model of “a multi-destination trip”, the space for cooperation in the respective areas is deepening, “creating mutual gains”. As he said, “by encouraging the reciprocity of tourist flows, the dynamic development of the tourist industry in both regions will be promoted, achieving reciprocal benefits”.
Stressing that Macau has the “specific advantage” of the “one country, two systems” principle, as well as the positioning of “one center, one platform and one base”, Sam Hou Fai added that, together with the Hengqin Deep Cooperation Zone and the Hainan Free Port, the policies “generate an accumulated effect, achieving complementarity of advantages and creating favorable conditions for regional cooperation”.
Pointing out that the Macao SAR Government is “accelerating” the development of adequate diversification of the economy, the Macao SAR leader explained that in this process he hopes to “continue to count on great support from Hainan, and through pragmatic cooperation, fully take advantage of the advantages of each party, and explore more collaboration models to create broader development opportunities”.</description><pubDate>2025-10-15 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Coutinho suggests low-cost veterinary clinic at the Jockey Club</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/coutinho-sugere-clinica-veterinaria-de-baixo-custo-jockey-club/</link><description>Given the “increase in cases of abandonment of domestic animals, as well as the occurrence of cases of cruelty and mistreatment” and the existence of families with financial difficulties, José Pereira Coutinho proposes that part of the Jockey Club be used to create a low-cost veterinary clinic. The deputy explained that the objective would be to help low-income families, ensuring that they can have access to basic animal health services
 
José Pereira Coutinho wants to see the problem of abandonment and mistreatment of domestic animals resolved. According to him, he has been receiving “increasing requests for support” due to “the increase in cases of abandonment of domestic animals, as well as the occurrence of cases of cruelty and mistreatment”. Without citing numbers, the deputy says that, on the other hand, “many families face financial difficulties that limit access to adequate veterinary care”, which contributes to the problem.
Noting that “the few” animal protection associations are “overloaded with work” and that they do not have enough space or resources to respond to the growing demand, Coutinho makes some suggestions.
From the outset, in a written interpellation, the deputy questions the Government about whether it will implement more support structures, expanding the current public shelters and “transforming part of the spaces of the former Macau Jockey Club into an Animal Welfare Center with a low-cost veterinary clinic”. The idea, he explained, would be to “support families with lower incomes, thus guaranteeing access to basic animal health services” and preventing abandonment.
Furthermore, it intends for the Executive to create a Responsible Reception and Adoption Center, which will ease the pressure on existing associations and provide “better temporary conditions” for rescued animals until they find adoptive families. It also suggests “coexistence spaces” and “partnerships” to encourage cooperation between public and private entities and non-profit associations “in order to guarantee the financial and operational sustainability of projects”.
As he mentioned, he has also received complaints from “many citizens” against the “current practice” of euthanasia in healthy animals by the competent authorities. In the interpellation, Coutinho argues that “these methods are considered unnecessary and ethically unacceptable, especially in healthy animals, and more humane and sustainable strategies should be adopted”. Specifically, it talks about preventing abandonment, large-scale sterilization programs, permanent awareness campaigns for greater responsible adoption and the implementation of an “efficient system” within the scope of cooperation with associations.
In this sense, the deputy questions the Government about whether it will implement educational campaigns, create school programs on animal welfare and promote wide dissemination of the legal consequences of animal abandonment and mistreatment.

The organization considers that the presentation had a positive impact and explained that there are at least two interested companies
 
The Institute for the Promotion of Commerce and Investment (IPIM) was in Lisbon and Porto, as well as in Madrid and Barcelona to “boost” the development of the “first store economy”, publicizing the Plan for Economic Development in the Scope of Support for the Establishment of the First Store in Macau, the first phase of application for which will begin next month. According to the organization, the promotion received a “positive” response.
The roadshows, aimed at promoting the development of the “first store economy” in Macau, were attended by around a hundred representatives from commercial associations/chambers and companies from the restaurant chains, household items, luxury, jewelry, food and hotel sectors. During the trip, the IPIM team visited several renowned local companies, international chain brands and chambers of commerce, publicizing the business environment and policies of the territory.
The “China-PLP Trade Conduct” service and “one-stop” services for investors were also promoted, contributing to the expansion of the business network with Europe.
The initiative constituted the first international promotional action related to the Support Plan, which provides for a maximum financial support of one million patacas to support start-up and operating costs for qualified international brands that establish themselves for the first time in Macau and open their “first store” in the city.
According to the plan, the subsidies are made up of two components: a base subsidy with a maximum limit of MOP500,000 and a tiered supplementary subsidy, based on the location of the first store in designated areas, as well as the scale of operations measured by the usable area and the number of local employees working full-time. Registration for the first phase takes place between November 1st and January 31st, 2026.
According to the IPIM statement, Portuguese and Spanish companies “expressed confidence that Macau's vast tourist market can help make their brands known to an international audience and serve as a basis for future entry into markets in Mainland China, namely in the Deep Cooperation Zone and the Greater Bay Area”.
In particular, a Spanish jewelry brand, headquartered in Spain and with more than 200 stores in 30 countries, has scheduled a visit to Macau at the end of this month to assess the business environment and available commercial surfaces, according to the press release.
On the other hand, a Portuguese company “showed great interest” in the Support Plan and intends to integrate Macau into its international expansion plans. As a first step, it intends to look for local partners to establish the brand in the city and cooperate with Macau's business community in promoting characteristic Portuguese products. “This will also contribute to expanding and consolidating the supply chains and customer bases of the local business sector”, considered IPIM.
The Government's objective in launching this plan, remember, is to increase market competitiveness, boost local consumption, create new jobs and support the growth of small and medium-sized companies.
On the occasion, the organization took the opportunity to publicize Macau's latest advantages among commercial associations/chambers, businesspeople and representatives of the local sector. Specifically, the “2nd China-Portuguese Speaking Countries (Macau) Economic and Commercial Exhibition” stood out, which will take place in Macau from the 22nd to the 25th of October. Portuguese and Spanish companies were invited to participate in the event and carry out prospecting visits, to better understand the region's business environment.</description><pubDate>2025-10-15 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Calvão da Silva expects maintenance of Portuguese legal DNA after 2049</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/calvao-da-silva-espera-manutencao-adn-juridico-portugues-apos-2049/</link><description>The vice-rector of the University of Coimbra (UC) João Nuno Calvão da Silva expressed the hope that Macau will maintain the Portuguese legal legacy after 2049, the end of the transition period agreed between China and Portugal. According to the Joint Declaration, signed by Beijing and Lisbon in 1987, which led to Macau's transition of administration in 1999, the city should maintain rights, freedoms and guarantees for a period of 50 years.
“After 2049, if [Macau] leaves this international treaty, this transition period, obviously we hope that this work that has been done, the people that are being created, this human capital, stays here with a legal culture in which this DNA of Portugal and Coimbra will be maintained”, declared Calvão da Silva.
The vice-rector for External Relations and Alumni at UC explained that there is currently a right that “is being fulfilled”, a “Basic Law” and a “set of diplomas with a very specific matrix of Portuguese law”. “In criminal proceedings, (…) we are complying with this legal system, we know that until 2049 this will be the case, this is how it has been since 1999”, the professor at the UC Faculty of Law told journalists.
In July, the State Security Defense Commission excluded all 12 candidates from two lists competing in the elections for the Legislative Assembly, considering them “not defenders of the Basic Law or not faithful” to the Macao SAR. On the sidelines of the opening ceremony of a joint conference between the University of Macau and UC, held in the Chinese region, Calvão da Silva refused to comment on specific political issues.
"As with everything in the world, perfection does not exist. But it is this degree of understanding and this factor of certainty that I am pleased to note and that continues to be very important for bringing relationships closer", explained the academic.
“Not only between Portugal and China, but throughout the Portuguese-speaking world and the People's Republic of China, as an invaluable factor in contributing to peace in humanity”, added the former deputy director of the UC's Sino-Lusophone Academy.

The last edition of the competition for startups from China and Portuguese-speaking countries had recorded a maximum, with more than 1,600 participants in more than 320 teams.
“This growing interest reflects the strengthening of connections between Portuguese-speaking countries and China's innovation ecosystems, progress that we are grateful to witness through continuous collaboration and shared learning between regions”, highlighted the organization, on the social network Instagram.
For two weeks, the 402 teams registered in the fifth edition will participate every day, in an online 'bootcamp' from 7:00 pm to 9:00 pm in Macau. Until October 11th, teams will have a series of lectures, mentoring sessions and workshops “designed to help teams shape, validate and strengthen sustainable business models”.
The best 16 plans – eight from companies and eight from university students – will have 10 minutes to convince the “929 Challenge” jury and potential investors in the final, on November 30th.
The fifth edition of the “929 Challenge” in Macau includes the ‘Future Builders’ award for the best startup in Portuguese-speaking African Countries (PALOP) and Timor-Leste. In June, during the presentation of the competition, Marco Duarte Rizzolio, co-founder of the “929 Challenge”, told Lusa that the prize was created to encourage participants from less developed Portuguese-speaking countries.
In 2024, the “929 Challenge” did not receive any projects from Timor-Leste or São Tomé and Príncipe.
The Portuguese startup Iplexmed, which develops rapid genetic diagnostic devices, won last year's edition, while the also Portuguese NS2, which provides intelligent solutions to monitor water quality for sustainable aquaculture, came third. Bruno Ferreira, co-founder of Iplexmed, will be one of the mentors of this year's 'bootcamp'.
The only time that a team from PALOP and Timor-Leste reached the finalists was in the first edition, launched in 2021, in the middle of the covid-19 pandemic, then only aimed at university students. A project by the Lusófona University of Guinea-Bissau to install solar panels in the Gabu region, in the east of the country, came in second place.
“In the end, those who win are often teams that already have mature products and mature services”, explained Rizzolio.
This year the competition has new partners, including StartupPorto, Cabo Verde Digital and Eduardo Mondlane University, in Mozambique.
The competition is co-organized by the Forum for Economic and Trade Cooperation between China and Portuguese-speaking Countries (Macau) and several Macao SAR institutions, including all local universities.

Keaton debuted in Hollywood with “Lovers and Other Strangers”, in 1970. Her extensive filmography includes roles in “The Godfather”, an iconic work by Francis Ford Coppola, where she played Al Pacino's girlfriend and wife, and numerous hits by Woody Allen, with whom she maintained a great friendship after having been his companion, muse and actress for a long time. favorite.
She was the main performer in “Sleeper” (1973), “Love and Death” (1975), and “Manhattan” (1979), however, it was her starring role in “Annie Hall”, Allen's romantic comedy that earned her the Academy Award for Best Actress in 1978. Allen's Annie Hall is, even today, probably the role for which she is most known, playing the typical “crazy” Keaton. Based on the real-life relationship between Allen and Keaton, the film chronicles Annie's transformation from shy and awkward to mature self-confidence. In many ways, it was an autobiographical statement for Keaton, who made a dramatic turn in the same year as journalist Louise Bryant in Warren Beatty's "Reds" (1981), which earned her yet another Oscar nomination.
She received two more nominations: for “Marvin’s Room” (1996) and “Something’s Gotta Give” (2003), but she was the main artist in many films such as “Father of the Bride” (1991), “The Family Stone” alongside Jack Nicholson, “Morning Glory”, in which she starred with Harrison Ford, or in 2014 the complex “And so it goes” by Rob Reiner with Nicholson.
The actress continued to act well into her 70s. Her participation in “Book Club”, in 2018, where she played a retired woman, as well as in “Pooms”, in 2019, stood out.
In an interview with AFP after the premiere of “Pooms”, Keaton declared that he was not thinking about old age or retirement. “If no one calls me again [to film], I have several hobbies that I am passionate about and occupy my time,” he declared.
Single and mother of two adopted children, she also stated that she does not regret anything, including her personal life.
"I think I'm one of the few single women my age who made films without getting married. Am I an anomaly?", joked the actress, who had long-term romances with stars like Warren Beatty and Al Pacino. I’m not unhappy!”, he concluded.
As sexual harassment scandals in Hollywood erupted at the end of 2017 – affecting everything from producer Harvey Weinstein to major actors such as Kevin Spacey – old accusations of child sexual abuse against Woody Allen, made by his adopted daughter Dylan, resurfaced. “Woody Allen is my friend and I continue to believe in him,” Keaton tweeted in January 2018.
It was a rare encounter with controversy for a much-loved actress.
In 2017, Keaton was honored with a Lifetime Achievement Award by the American Film Institute, which described her as “unconventional, iconoclastic and out of the ordinary.”
“I feel very lucky to have spent time with this wonderful woman, and I am heartbroken that she is gone,” said Andie MacDowell, who starred in “My Heroic Uncles” (1995), one of the few films made by Keaton.
The late actress was born in 1946 as Diane Hall, in Los Angeles, on January 5th. He leaves two sons, Dexter and Duke.
In her last film role, in 2024, Diane Keaton co-starred in “Summer Camp”, with Kathy Bates and Alfre Woodard.
