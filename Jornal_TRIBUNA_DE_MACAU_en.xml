Furthermore, he added that, in 2026, new accessible taxis will come into operation
 
In the debate on the Lines of Government Action for 2026, the Secretary for Transport and Public Works noted that there are currently more than 1,400 taxis in Macau, announcing that, in the short term, 100 new taxis will be added and, in the future, tenders will be opened for another 700 taxis subject to a validity period. With the 800 new vehicles coming into operation, the total number of taxis will exceed 2,000, said Raymond Tam.
According to him, requirements will be introduced so that the number of accessible taxis increases from seven to 28 and that new barrier-free taxis successively enter into service next year.
The Secretary also revealed that he expects the revision of the Regulation on the Transport of Passengers in Taxis to enter the legislative process in 2026. Before that, consultation work will be carried out. As he explained, the revision of the law aims to create favorable conditions for the introduction of the taxi hailing service via online platforms.
Representative Ngan Iek Hang questioned whether there will be enough taxi drivers, Raymond Tam assured that, for now, the number is adequate. Even so, he revealed that the number of driving shifts will be increased, in order to allow more people to work in the sector. Furthermore, he assured that he will study, with the public security services, the reinforced combat against infractions committed by taxi drivers.
With regard to public buses, the Secretary stated that the Government will monitor the negotiations for the renewal of the bus service concession contract and the study to optimize careers.
In addition to continuing to move forward with the mid-term review of land transport planning, the Executive will continue the work on reviewing the Road Traffic Law and reformulating that law, “making it more rigorous and complete, in order to reinforce road safety”, assured Raymond Tam, specifying that, when reviewing the law, he will carefully study whether the behavior of leaving the scene of a minor collision should be considered a “public crime”.
On the other hand, the government official added that, in the construction of buildings, there will be a pedestrian system in groups of buildings, to promote interaction between commercial establishments on the top floor and passersby, increasing the value of the stores.
Regarding parking, he indicated that the tender for parking meters will soon begin, which will allow for diversified payment, and that the number of parking meters will be gradually increased according to demand. On-street parking spaces will, in phases, increase their length from five to 5.5 meters. At the same time, the half-hour pricing model will be expanded to more parks, while in several new outdoor parks the fare will be waived for the first 15 minutes. Furthermore, the Government will try to make more places available for tourist buses in old areas.
 
Executive cautious about supporting Macau-Lisbon flight
On the other hand, Ip Sio Kai defended the creation of a direct air link between Macau and Lisbon, which, as he argued, “would be very useful for us as a Sino-Lusophone platform”. The president of the Civil Aviation Authority, Pun Wa Kin, stated that the Government “attaches great importance” to the development of aviation, “in particular its role in promoting economic diversification”.
However, the official highlighted that “in commercial operations, airlines often consider market demand, operational costs, long-term benefits and the competitiveness of the route, before deciding to launch new flights”.
Will the Government provide financial support for this route? According to Pun Wa Kin, this support “involves different sectoral policies” and “the Macao SAR Government needs to analyze the issue comprehensively, from all aspects”.
The Secretary added that, if there is a direct flight to Lisbon, it would be beneficial to highlight the role of the Macao SAR as a Sino-Lusophone platform, stating that he will take this opinion to meetings on government matters, in order to discuss and implement the respective work together with services from other departments.
Furthermore, Pun Wa Kin revealed that an airline dedicated exclusively to cargo transport has requested to provide services in the territory, and the application is being assessed. As he highlighted, the Government fully promotes the development of the cross-border e-commerce air logistics industry.
Furthermore, Raymond Tam said that he will continue to advance the legislative work related to the Law on the Use of Maritime Areas, providing the legal framework for the use and management of maritime areas. He also indicated that the creation of the Hengqin-Macau Traffic Data Platform will be studied, as well as the location of a new access between Hengqin Financial Island and Macau.
 
Metro with “diversified payment” from the 3rd quarter of 2026
Within the scope of the Light Metro, the Secretary for Transport and Public Works said that he will try to install, in the 3rd quarter of 2026, new access channels, to implement the “diversified payment function”, in order to “further discuss the issue of discounts for transfers between the Metro and buses”. Noting that many of the users of the Hengqin Line are students, Raymond Tam stated that work will be carried out on passenger constitution, in order to encourage the Metro to become an “important means of transport for citizens”, and the integration of cultural elements will be considered. The Secretary also assured that the construction of the Eastern Line will be accelerated and preparatory work for the extension will begin.
 
Secretary promises to redefine careers “with a high rate of overlap”
Raymond Tam admitted yesterday that changes to bus routes are necessary, pledging to review routes and redefine lines with a “high overlap rate”. The Secretary even said that, in some cases, the overlap “is serious, 90%”. “We are carrying out a data collection, otherwise you would not know that there is a 90% overlap in some careers”, he highlighted, in response to a question from deputy Ella Lei. According to him, the next step is to select “viable careers”, stressing, however, that there needs to be little impact on the readjustment, as it “affects the daily lives of the population”. “We have to go step by step, meeting pressing needs (…) Transport is essential”, he also stressed, yesterday afternoon. Raymond Tam warned, however, that improving routes could reduce the number of buses. On the other hand, in relation to the land in front of the MGM, on the Peninsula, where numerous buses are parked, the government official guaranteed that a different parking lot will be created. "We are trying to find a permanent space to park buses and heavy vehicles. We are going to build permanent auto-silos for this purpose. In the long term, we intend to resolve it permanently and definitively", he stated.</description><pubDate>2025-12-02 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Another 30 plots of land will gain new use</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/mais-30-terrenos-vao-ganhar-nova-utilizacao/</link><description>The authorities will launch 30 lots for new purposes, such as a temporary leisure area, parking lot and free field, said the Secretary for Transport and Public Works
 
In the short term, the Government will launch 30 plots of land, with different dimensions, to be used for new planning and use, revealed the Secretary for Transport and Public Works, pointing out that, together with the nine lots already announced in the Legislative Assembly (AL), there will be a total of 39 lots that will gain new use.
Specifically, 12 plots of land will become temporary leisure areas, 14 will be transformed into open-air parking lots for light and heavy cars, four into open fields, four into “joy environmental centers” and the remaining five could serve as temporary warehouses and factories, automated parking lots and for the opening of roads. Raymond Tam said that the construction of these projects will be completed gradually. In addition, the Government will revitalize lots A3, A4 and A9 of Nam Van Lake and will begin the construction of Zone 1 of the Citizens' Sports Garden.
On the other hand, the Secretary stated that, in 2026, the public consultation will be launched to review the Master Plan, and will ensure the organized preparation of the remaining detailed plans, and the review of the Master Plan may imply “minor changes” to the Urban Planning Law.
In the context of housing, he revealed that a study on demand will be released soon. "Taking into account the supply and the real situation of the market, the demand for intermediate housing may, for now, not be so urgent. Therefore, it will be reconsidered whether intermediate housing will be built on the lot on the north side of the Son Lei Building [in Iao Hon] or whether the land will be used for other purposes. In the short term, the study will be published. When there is consensus in society, we will move forward with the concrete work", noted the Secretary.
Furthermore, he added that the study on the introduction of an economic home exchange regime is already ready, and consultation work will be carried out later.
On the other hand, Raymond Tam highlighted that some old-style social housing often requires repairs. In this regard, he pointed out that the Government intends to study the feasibility of reconstruction or change of purpose for some, after demolition. As he explained, taking into account the high population density in the North Zone, the Government decided to demolish two blocks of the Dª Building. Julieta Nobre de Carvalho, intending to transform them into a leisure area or car park.
The Secretary highlighted that the law will be reviewed in the legislative process with a view to expanding the scope of projects benefiting from the Building Repair Fund, increasing the amount of repairs and optimizing assessment, so that the Fund's support better corresponds to the needs of residents.
Raymond Tam also mentioned that urban renewal will be accelerated, and the expansion of the scope of housing for exchange and temporary accommodation will be studied, facilitating acquisition or replacement in urban renewal projects. Regarding housing rent for temporary accommodation, he promised “flexible treatments”, taking into account the real situation of tenants. He also highlighted that the Government will, depending on demand, make appropriate use of the houses under the premise of equity. As revealed, a consultation will be carried out to gather opinions regarding the best use of homes for exchange and temporary accommodation.
Furthermore, the Secretary mentioned that the Government needs to reinforce the work to reorganize the Inner Port. In another area, he revealed that he hopes to submit the proposal for the Telecommunications Law to the AL for consideration next year, and consult the sector before that. The proposal is now ready, and the Secretary assured that he will fully consider the needs of the sector, to guarantee the content of the legislation in line with real application scenarios.</description><pubDate>2025-12-02 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Fewer medical dispute mediation requests</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/menos-pedidos-de-mediacao-de-litigios-medicos/</link><description>The Medical Dispute Mediation Center received fewer requests for mediation last year, a total of five, with only two being resolved last year, according to official data. However, two more were completed, according to information provided by the Center to this newspaper. In annual terms, there were four fewer requests for mediation compared to 2023
 
Catarina Pereira
 
Over the past year, the Medical Dispute Mediation Center registered five new requests for mediation. Statistical data consulted by the TRIBUNA DE MACAU newspaper show that there was a reduction of four cases or 44% compared to the nine requests registered in 2023.
According to the Center's Annual Report, in 2024, only two were “success cases”. Two others were still being monitored and there was also a situation in which “the medical side did not accept the mediation procedure”. In the latter case, the organization does not explain the reasons for rejection, nor even the outcome.
In the information available on the website, the Center does not detail the specific cases, nor even the areas in which they fall. Therefore, this newspaper contacted the organization, in order to understand what situations are at stake. In its response, the Center recalls that “the mediation procedure is, by nature, confidential”, meaning that the mediator must “keep confidential all information of which it is aware and cannot use it”, and therefore did not provide any details.
As for the two cases that were still being monitored, the Center indicated that “they have already been finalized”.
In 2023, it should be noted, the nine cases verified reflected an increase of six or 200% in annual terms. In three of them the medical side did not accept the mediation process and in another the disputing parties withdrew from continuing to participate in the mediation process. Another four cases were being monitored and one was awaiting presentation of the report from the Medical Error Expertise Committee.
Created in 2016, the Center emerged within the scope of the Medical Error Legal Regime. The Center is responsible for carrying out mediation on disputes relating to compensation resulting from medical error that are voluntarily presented to it, and the mediation procedure is free of charge for the parties. The mediation service aims to “provide a flexible, convenient and low-cost solution to disputes between doctors and patients”, being subject to the duty of confidentiality.
Mediation takes place at the request of healthcare providers, users, or in the case of death or in a situation that prevents the user from declaring their will, family members may request mediation, specifically spouses or descendants, ascendants, civil partners, siblings and other collateral up to the fourth degree. The Center's request for intervention must be made in writing, with reasons and facts, including all available supporting information.
The request may be rejected if, after the court's judgment, the case has become final; the Public Prosecutor's Office officially presents the patient's side in accordance with the law; and if they are involved in criminal investigations.
According to data from the Medical Dispute Mediation Center, last year, there were 128 consultations regarding requests for mediation information, of which six (4.7%) were made by email, 84 (65.6%) by telephone and 38 (29.7%) in person. In this context, a reduction of 6.6% was observed compared to the 137 consultations received in 2023.
“However, a total of 117 case consultations, mediation procedures and case monitoring were registered, an increase of 5.1% compared to the 111 consultations registered in 2023”, adds the Center.
Regarding 2023, statistics indicate that among the 137 requests for information there were five cases that “reported to the Center the excessive charging of medical fees by medical institutions and expected intervention from the Mediation Center”. However, “the investigation and respective resolution of excessive medical expenses do not fall within the scope of this Center”, he added.
Between February 2017 and the end of last year, the Medical Dispute Mediation Center website received 34,736 visits, an increase of 10,521 (30.3%) compared to the total accumulated until the end of 2023 (24,215 visits).
According to the information on the website, the Center is currently composed of a coordinator, Bernardino Azedo Lei, and two mediators, Fong Kin Fao and Lou Sio Fong.</description><pubDate>2025-12-02 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>“Receita di Casa” by Chef Neta wins two international awards</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/receita-di-casa-da-chef-neta-arrecada-dois-premios-internacionais/</link><description>The book “Receita di Casa”, designed by Antonieta Manhão, won two awards in the international “Gourmand Awards Food Culture” competition, one in the Gourmet category and the other in the group of trilingual publications, Portuguese, Chinese and English. The award ceremony took place in the Saudi city of Riyadh. The author, known as Chef Neta, was present at the gala and told TRIBUNA DE MACAU newspaper that the titles achieved constitute a “vitamin injection” for Macanese food

The “Gourmand Awards Food Culture”, a worldwide competition that rewards the best works, in books, videos and other formats, on gastronomy, this year had the participation of a representative from Macau. Antonieta Manhão, known as Chef Neta, saw her publication “Receita di Casa” distinguished in two categories: Gourmet and Trilingue.
The ceremony to award the trophies to the first-placed teams took place in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia, where representatives from 96 countries or regions were present. Of the more than 1,200 works submitted, six were selected for the final of the group of recipe publications, with the aim of distinguishing “The Best Cookbooks in The World”.
“I received the invitation to go to the gala, but I never thought I would be awarded, and with two titles,” Antonieta Manhão began by telling Jornal TRIBUNA DE MACAU. Having just landed at Hong Kong airport, on her way back from Riyadh, the culinary master expressed satisfaction with the awards obtained and highlighted that they constitute an “injection of vitamin, of multivitamin, for Macanese food, which needs to be more recognized”.
The awards won in the international competition, which has reached its 31st edition, can “help to increase awareness and disseminate Macanese food”, he believes, recognizing, however, that at the moment “there are still few, only about five, restaurants in Macau that serve genuine Macanese food, without fusion with Portuguese food, because people still make some confusion”.
Participation in this year's “Gourmand Awards” came after a book exhibition organized in Hong Kong. “A person with connections to this international competition read the book and invited me”, revealed Chef Neta.
The book “Receita di Casa” was launched this year, in January, containing 19 dishes of Macanese food, including minchi, tacho, chapel, lacassá soup, African chicken and Zeca cod, this being a specialty that Chef Neta learned from her uncle and which is included in the classes that the Chef teaches at the Macau Tourism University.
“The recipes are normal, that is, homemade food, the one we usually eat in our homes”, expresses the woman who is recognized as one of the main ambassadors of Macanese food.
The publication took around four months to compile. “It could have been with less time, but the fact that it was in three languages ​​and there were, among them, some expressions with different meanings, meant that the book took a little longer”, he states.
Antonieta Manhão, 55 years old, born in Macau, has been preparing Macanese food at a professional level for over a decade, frequently participating in gastronomic festivals, both in the Macao SAR and abroad.
In 2016, her participation in the Thai version of the television competition “Iron Chef” gave her great visibility and catapulted her to high places in the culinary scene, starting to be present in various promotion and dissemination actions for Macanese gastronomy conducted by the Tourism Services Directorate, both in Mainland China and elsewhere.
Since being inscribed on the MSAR Intangible Cultural Heritage list, Macanese cuisine has achieved unprecedented prominence, increased the following year with the designation of Macau as a UNESCO Creative City in the area of ​​Gastronomy. Furthermore, remember, in 2020, the Government launched the Macanese Cuisine Database, marking another important milestone in the recognition of this type of fusion food.</description><pubDate>2025-12-02 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Football coach cites personal reasons for not renewing contract</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/seleccionador-de-futebol-invoca-razoes-pessoais-para-nao-renovar-contrato/</link><description>Kenneth Kwok is no longer coach of the Macao SAR main football team. The Hong Kong coach, who had been in office for a year, cited personal reasons for not renewing his contract, according to the Macau Football Association. The team of assistants is now taking over the guidance of the team
 
VÍTOR REBELO
 
Macau's main football team has been without a coach since yesterday, after Kenneth Kwok decided not to renew his contract. The departure was announced on social media by the Macau Football Association (AFM) with the phrase “Thank you Kenneth, we wish you a bright future”.
Contacted by TRIBUNA DE MACAU newspaper, the organization's secretary general confirmed the departure, stating that the coach presented “personal reasons” for not extending the contract, signed for one year, which expired at the end of December.
Chan Keng Hou did not give further details, only saying that the AFM will, from now on, discuss who will be the next coach. “For now, Kenneth Kwok’s team of assistants, made up of several elements, will be responsible for guiding the main team”, he clarified.
When asked whether, in the future, the option would involve another foreign coach, the director left the possibility of opening the vacancy to a local coach up in the air. “Nothing has been decided yet, but we will have to reflect on whether it will be worth hiring abroad, since football in the territory is not professional, which makes the work of a coach who comes from abroad difficult”, he highlighted.
He adds that the most important thing, in the short and medium term, will be to provide conditions for younger players, with a view to joining the main team. “That is always AFM’s first major objective, to invest in young people”, he observed.
The news took the players by surprise, as the AFM had not yet informed the athletes of the coach's departure. Amâncio Goitia revealed that he found out through social media. “I was surprised, but we knew that his contract ended at the end of the year”, he highlighted.
The central defender highlights that Kenneth Kwok “brought some new ideas”. However, “in a territory where football is amateur and players sometimes have difficulty training, because of their work, any foreign professional coach has a complicated task”, he attests.
When signing the contract, at the end of 2024, the former assistant of the Hong Kong main team and coach of teams from the neighboring territory of the I Division, as well as Tainan City, from Taiwan, had mentioned that one of the goals was to try to give Macao SAR football a “more professional” nature and increase the “frequency of training”.
The main team had not trained since last June, as no competition was scheduled until the end of the year, after participating in the Under-23 Asian Championship and the National Games, in this case with representation of Under-20 players.
It is recalled that Kenneth Kwok, 45 years old, replaced Portuguese-Angolan Lázaro Oliveira (accompanied by Portuguese assistant Pedro Simões), who led the team for two years.
The coach chose not to renew, considering that the AFM did not guarantee the conditions requested from the AFM, specifically with regard to more games to be played by the team. “For things to continue as they have been up until now, it is preferable for us to leave”, revealed the then coach to JTM.</description><pubDate>2025-12-02 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Secretary aims for a “green city”</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/secretario-ambiciona-uma-cidade-verde/</link><description>The Government intends to transform Macau into a “green city”, according to the Secretary for Transport and Public Works. The ecological measures presented by Raymond Tam include improving the electrical network and charging electric cars, regulating plastics and construction materials and expanding the distribution of recycled water, among other projects
 
PEDRO MILHEIRÃO
The Government will continue to improve the territory's electrical network, promote the sustainable use of water resources and continue with the waste management work already underway, within the scope of reducing carbon emissions and other pollutants, said yesterday Raymond Tam. During the presentation of the Lines of Government Action under his supervision, the Secretary for Transport and Public Works highlighted the Executive's intention to turn Macau into a “green city”.
The improvement of the electricity network will consist of expanding electric vehicle (EV) charging points and installing new “super charging” stations. “In the 59 car parks with spaces for EVs, the usage rate is not ideal”, observed the Secretary. “Through the market and benefits, we will encourage the use of these parks”, he said, noting that the Government “needs time to change the parking rules”.
“As for charging devices, we are following the EV development situation in Mainland China.” Tam also explained that “there are fewer and fewer requests for chargers in condominiums, because with ‘super charging’, the time is shorter”. Furthermore, he also stated that the Government will “take an active attitude” regarding the installation of photovoltaic panels in common spaces.
Raymond Tam also mentioned that solar energy capture equipment and EV chargers will be installed at the Delta Bridge Border Post, in response to Si Ka Lon, who lamented the low participation of companies and public services in the installation of photovoltaic panels.
Regarding solid waste management, Raymond Tam highlighted the need to find a suitable location since, in the Macao SAR, “spaces are limited”. "We cannot only resort to regional cooperation. We have to take advantage of our own spaces", he asserted.
As part of the construction of the Organic Resources Recovery Center and the sorting of construction materials, Raymond Tam stated that “the Department of Environmental Protection Services (DSPA) is already limiting the import of more polluting materials”, such as paints, among others. “We are going to think more about restrictions on imports of more polluting materials”, he said.
Deputy Si Ka Lon had questioned the Secretary about air quality, pointing out the fact that there are “many materials on the market that are not regulated” and that “the bad smell also affects the health of the population”.
Raymond Tam also spoke about the creation of a unit to collect and treat food waste, adding that this issue would involve collaboration with other entities in the Greater Bay Area.
Responding to a question raised by deputy Ho Ion Sang, the Secretary for Transport and Public Works assured that more plastic reduction measures will be promoted next year, and the import of more products will be prohibited.
Ho Ion Sang also called on DSPA to “define the criteria” for regulating restaurant emissions. In turn, the director of the organization, Ip Kuong Lam, stated that, “next year, instructions will be issued for restaurants and offices”, as they are “sectors that produce carbon dioxide emissions”. He also said that “the information will be published online”.
The Coloane Recycled Water Plant, whose first phase of development is expected to be completed next year, supplying water to Seac Pai Van public housing and the University of Macau, will also be expanded to Zone A.
The Macao SAR will also reinforce regional environmental cooperation, with the construction of an “international meteorological data hub”, integrated into the context of high-quality development in the Greater Bay Area.</description><pubDate>2025-12-02 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>“Night enchantment” inspires tourist programs</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/encanto-nocturno-inspira-programas-turisticos/</link><description>The “nighttime charm” of various areas of the city will be showcased in December through a series of festivals and activities that celebrate gastronomy, shows and multiculturalism. According to DST, 54 projects were approved this year as part of financial support, and by October 39 had been completed.

The “Luminescent Night at Travessa do Armazém Velho” takes place between December 6th and March 5th, 2026. Through the transformation of streets and alleys into a theater of immersive light, integrating interactive equipment, online games and in-person workshops, among other experiences, “the event aims to promote the flow of people and stimulate night-time consumption”, so that Travessa “shows its unique charm at night”.

The author, Bruno Gaspar, highlights the “power of a language that travels to every corner of the Portuguese-speaking world”
 
Paintings about Portuguese-speaking writers, some of whom are Macanese, such as Adé, Henrique de Senna Fernandes or Deolinda da Conceição, are among a hundred works that Bruno Gaspar will present in Macau. The exhibition will open on Thursday, December 4th, at 6:30 pm, in the space managed by Casa de Portugal (CPM) at Casa de Vidro.
The exhibition presents creations developed from the Portuguese language and its vast literary universe, celebrating Lusophony through painting. “Each work is born from words written by authors from Portuguese-speaking countries, transformed into color, rhythm and gesture”, says a note from Casa de Portugal.
“Macau, a territory where Portuguese finds new sounds, becomes the ideal setting for this dialogue”, he highlights, adding that “voices such as Henrique de Senna Fernandes, Deolinda da Conceição or José dos Santos Ferreira (Adé) coexist here, who inspire several of the pieces presented”.
In an introduction to the exhibition, the author highlights that “between literary echoes and encounters of identities, these paintings invite the visitor to feel the strength of a language that travels, adapts and remains alive in every corner of the Portuguese-speaking world”.
The event includes two workshops on Writing in the Visual Arts, which will take place on the 6th and 7th of December at the CPM School of Arts and Crafts, with a limit of 12 participants.
The exhibition, which will be open to the public at the CPM gallery, located in Praça do Tap Seac, has already had a prelude in Portugal, at Livraria Arquivo, in Leiria, with the title “From writing, before the exhibition in Macau”, in which the artist showcased paintings, drawings and sculptures.
“This project was born from an intimate dialogue with Portuguese-speaking poets and writers, from various Portuguese-speaking countries, whose texts and imaginaries I transported to the field of painting and drawing”, highlights Bruno Gaspar.
The artist adds that “the works oscillate between two main aspects: the deconstruction and plastic recreation of poems and texts, fragmented, recomposed and transformed into new visual landscapes, and the more figurative approach, where portraits of the authors themselves appear, thought of as a form of presence and homage”.
For the exhibition in Portugal, the author chose some writers with connections to the Leiria region, namely Acácio de Paiva, Afonso Lopes Vieira and Eça de Queiroz. “His works were reinterpreted through painting, where the word becomes color, gesture and texture, giving shape to a visual narrative that prolongs and reinvents the literary text,” he said.
The event also included three original sculptures, created based on the work Clepsidra, by Camilo Pessanha, “which open up new possibilities for reading and dialogue between literature and visual arts”. They were created in modeled and troweled cement, assuming themselves as “bodies under construction and deconstruction, matter that rises and transforms under the gesture”, describes Bruno Gaspar, adding that “the roughness of the cement, with its raw and textural marks, is close to Pessanha's poetic words, dense, fragmentary and sometimes unfinished”.
In the Macau exhibition, which will be on display until December 31st, the artist will make an adaptation, also portraying some illustrious figures from local society. “As a whole, the exhibition proposes a journey through the power of writing and its ability to generate images, where painting and sculpture become means of reinterpreting literary memory, projecting it towards new horizons”, he concludes.
Bruno Gaspar was born in France (Paris), in 1979, but grew up in a village in the parish of Reguengo do Fetal, municipality of Batalha, Leiria, and also lived in Macau, between 2016 and 2018. He graduated in Art History at Universidade Nova de Lisboa and graduated in Animation Cinema at the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation.
Since the age of 15, he has participated in different artistic projects: animated films, photography, design, advertising and marketing, sculpture, illustration, murals and visual arts. He collaborated with several media outlets, as an illustrator and travel writer, at SIC, RTP and TVI, among others, exploring Portugal and Asia. He founded the Cinantrope festival in 2013, which had editions in Portugal and Macau.
Since 2019, he has focused more on the visual arts: video, photography, sculpture and painting. He currently develops independent work, such as book illustration and portraits, and has held individual and group exhibitions, such as “Movimentos Perpétuos”.

The case dates back to 2022, when a fraudster from abroad planned to rent a property in Macau as a hideout for telephone scams, to remotely control the devices, disguise himself as an agent from the Police, Prosecutor's Office and Court, government services and telecommunications operators in Mainland China, to make large-scale calls, claiming to victims that they were involved in illegal activities and inducing them to transfer money. To commit the crime, the fraudster instructed a person to rent a unit and install the appliances, who contacted a friend, asking for help in finding a tenant and installing the appliances. The friend found someone to rent the unit and another with computer skills. With the help of the four, the fraudster managed to obtain at least 1,360,699.31 patacas, 4,373,500.00HKD and 18,260,211.01RMB. The Basic Judicial Court convicted the four of the practice, in material co-authorship and in a consummated form, of 22 crimes of “considerably high value fraud”, nine of “high value fraud” and 10 of “fraud”, with a penalty of 15 years in prison, and the payment of compensation to the victims. Unsatisfied, they appealed to the Court of Second Instance, which sentenced the person hired directly by the fraudster to 10 years in prison, his friend to eight years in prison, and the “tenant” and the person with computer skills to six years in prison each. The first two appealed, with the TUI upholding the previous conviction.</description><pubDate>2025-12-02 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>CURB animates public spaces to promote “Placemaking”</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/curb-anima-espacos-publicos-para-promover-placemaking/</link><description>Between December 11th and 14th, the “IN SITU Placemaking Biennale” event will liven up Macau’s public spaces with installations, meetings and experiences throughout the city.

Imported labor also grew by 0.5% and 0.7% in monthly and annual terms, respectively, maintaining a decelerating trend. Data for October this year show that TNRs from Mainland China (121,091) remain the main non-resident labor force, followed by those from the Philippines (31,917), Indonesia (8,184), Vietnam (7,918), Myanmar (4,785), Nepal (3,896), Hong Kong (2,113) and Thailand (890).

The November result also reflects a monthly drop of 12.5%, which was already expected due to the historical seasonality factor and taking into account that October set a post-pandemic record, with 24.09 billion. November's accounts largely exceeded analysts' monthly projections, for the seventh time this year. According to DS Kim, Selina Li and Lindsey Qian, analysts at the investment bank JP Morgan, mass market revenues grew between 12 and 13% in annual terms, equivalent to more than 125% of the pre-covid level, while the VIP segment rose more than 30% year-on-year and recovered between 30% and 35% compared to 2019. DICJ data also indicates that gross revenues amounted to around 226.52 billion patacas in the first 11 months of 2025, 8.6% more than in the same period of 2024 and 84% of the value recorded between January and November 2019. By the end of November, gaming revenue reached 99.3% of the 228 billion forecast by the Government in the Budget review for the entire year. For December, JP Morgan predicts annual revenue growth of more than 15%, or even above 20%, which would make the fourth quarter the best in the last six years.</description><pubDate>2025-12-02 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Jakarta rises to 1st place in the world population ranking, with 42 million</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/lazer/jacarta-sobe-para-1o-lugar-ranking-mundial-da-populacao-42-milhoes/</link><description>Jakarta, Indonesia's vibrant, overcrowded and decaying capital, has overtaken Tokyo as the world's most populous city, according to the United Nations, thanks to its new methodology for counting urban populations.
Jakarta is estimated to have 42 million inhabitants, approximately the population of Canada, according to the UN's “World Urbanization Prospects 2025” report.
Tokyo, with 33 million, now occupies third place. Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, is in second place, with 37 million.
This is a drastic reorganization compared to the last report, published in 2018, which placed Jakarta in 33rd place, with 11 million inhabitants, and Tokyo in first, with 37 million.
The big change is largely due to the report's new methodology. Previously, UN population estimates were mainly based on official national statistics, which could use widely varying metrics.
This time, according to the report, a consistent approach was used across countries to categorize cities, towns and rural areas.
For Jakarta, which stretches along the northwest coast of the island of Java, the new methodology counted about 30 million more people than previous criteria. Official national statistics for the city's metropolitan area excluded “densely populated communities” linked to the city center, according to the report.
Using the new criteria, researchers found that Tokyo was the most populous city in the world until around 2010, when Jakarta took the lead. Tokyo, like the rest of Japan, has seen a population decline in recent years.
Jakarta's dramatic growth in recent decades has been driven by mass migration as well as new development and infrastructure projects.
This growth has led to the formation of informal and dispersed settlements, both in the city center and in neighboring communities, where poor working-class people have built densely populated villages and slums – often close to skyscrapers, highlighting Jakarta's deep economic inequalities.
Millions of people in these informal neighborhoods, called kampungs in Indonesian, often lack access to clean water, electricity and garbage collection systems, and are often not counted in official city statistics, said Professor Waleed Alzamil, professor of urban planning at King Saud University in Saudi Arabia.
The UN report said its findings will help policymakers, planners and researchers improve systems of housing, transport, sanitation, health and other public services around the world, especially in growing cities.
