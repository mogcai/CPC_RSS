At least, this is the intention of the government, which is planning the extension of the network. Secretary Raymond Tam has admitted that the services of this means of transport are still "short of expectations" of the population, hoping that, with the creation of more lines, the number of passengers can have a "multiplier effect"

The Light Metro Network will be expanded, with the government advanced with studies on expansion in the peninsula - the idea, the secretary explained to transport and public works, is to increase the number of passengers, making the meter the main means of transport in Macao. In the presentation of the government lines of governing (LAG) of the guardianship he directs, Raymond Tam spoke to the deputies about two new lines on planning, both of which will reach Barra.
"We are studying the definition of the location of the future lines of the light meter," he began by saying Raymond Tam, pointing out that the network "changes according to the situation of society." In this sense, it bound, it is necessary to “make some adjustments”. “In general, we planned two new lines,” explained the secretary.
As for the west line, the idea is to start at the Qingmao post, extend to Fai Chi Kei, passing through the inner port and ending in Barra.
"The other line involves the border post of the artificial island [of the Delta Bridge]. As it is an important border post, we hope there will be a line of metro to pass through [zone A], the outer port and the areas of Lakes Nam van and leaves van, reaching Barra. The idea is to build a ring -shaped line," said Raymond Tam.
Already in 2012 he had spoken of a segment of the subway to cover the lakes Nam Van and leaves van, as well as the Barra station, totaling three stations. But since then it has not been talked about it.
In the Legislative Assembly, the secretary said he believed that, with the increase in the subway lines on the peninsula, “the number of passengers will certainly have a multiplier effect,” noting that this is what happens in many regions. "We hope that, with the network being perfected, the light meter will become the pillar of the means of transport in Macao," he said.
Raymond also confessed that "the services of the light meter, namely the electronic payment service, are still short of the expectations of the population." Reiterating that the executive is "determined" in solving "the problems", the secretary said, however, not being able to disclose a calendar about these works. But it assured that, in the short term, "mechanisms and regimes" will be introduced so that different electronic payment services can be used in the meter.

According to the LAG report, the works of the southern and northern segments of the east line - which will connect the siege doors, zones A and E, the taipa maritime terminal - “are advancing at all steam, with the installation of the circulation system and electromechanical equipment”. The conclusion of the construction work is scheduled for the first half of 2028, while the general conclusion of the project is pointed to the first half of 2029.
 
Three lots will have provisional function of Campos

According to Raymond Tam, in the future, eight to 10 land may be launched for temporary purposes. On the other hand, it revealed the plan to use the lot of the old “Flying Eagle Training Center” as a provisional parking lot with about 68 seats for light cars.

The first phase of the contest has already opened and the proposals can be delivered until June 18. Authorities expect part of the field to open in the 2nd semester of next year, also providing that it is fully completed at the end of 2027

The first phase of the public tender for the Youth Adventure Field of Hac Sá Beach has been launched, which is expected to be ready within two years. According to the Institute for Municipal Affairs (AMI), the construction project was “optimized”, keeping “unchanged” the positioning, distribution of space and functional zones.
The project was initially budgeted at 229 million patacas, but by 2023 authorities indicated that it would have an estimated cost of 1.4 billion, which generated some discontent. After a review, the global budget will now have to be between 500 and 600 million patacas.
The idea is to build a space for leisure activities for the general population, as well as an outdoor training base for young people, with a total area of ​​10 hectares. The opening work of public tender and construction will be developed by phases, the AMI indicated.
This first phase is focused on adventure field facilities and equipment, while the public tender for the first phase of construction works will open in the third quarter of this year. Proposals can be delivered until 5 pm on June 18.
The selection of the proposals happens in two phases: in the first, those that have a score equal to or greater than 18 may move to the second. Here, criteria such as the global price (30%), the conception optimization project (30%), the experience of the Fun Equipment Design Team (10%), the experience of the equipment producing of these equipment (10%), the Execution Team experience (5%) the global endeavor period (5%), the work plan (5%) and the hiring rate of local workers (5%).
The AMI predicts that, in the second half of 2026, the public zone for children's cars and the campsite area is open to the public. In addition, it estimates the simultaneous conclusion of the works of all construction phases and the beginning of experimental operation for the fourth quarter of 2027.
The body explains that the adventure projects of “water, earth and air” remain unchanged, namely the adventure tower, the climbing wall, the zip line, the suspended air network, the training network, the low -height bag, the children's bikes circuit. The park will also feature a skateboard, Wargame Zone, a scientific popularization area on nature, area for aquatic adventure activities, among others.
“It is expected that after the completion of this field of adventures, a space for Macao's children and young people, enriching the experiences of three-dimensional adventure, to strengthen their physical condition and mental strength,” says AMI. At the same time, the integrated training and learning space can be “a second classroom” and can be used by schools to promote the integral development of students' physical and mental health.
On the other hand, AMI explained that, since the field is located in a low area, it is easy to accumulate water after torrential rainfall. In this sense, “a small artificial lake with the function of adjusting and accumulating rainwater, besides having a leisure space near the water and landscape elements, also contributes to relieving floods that are caused by torrential rains”.
AMI states that it has listened to opinions from different sectors in relation to the field of adventure, after which it adjusted the project. In concrete, he indicated “that more than 90% of participants agreed” with the idea, worrying about the date of completion and availability to residents.
According to an inquiry carried out by the General Association of Students Chong Wa de Macau with students of primary and secondary teachings, about 30% understand that sports facilities for young people are “relatively insufficient” or “very insufficient”, 35% consider that the degree of sufficiency of the facilities is “moderate” and 80% expressed desire to visit the field after completion. 5,487 valid inquiries were collected.</description><pubDate>2025-05-02 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>AJM elects new members and intends to hold a meeting</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/ajm-elege-novos-membros-tenciona-realizar-encontro/</link><description>There are seven new members in the managing bodies of the Macanese Youth Association, five of them in the Directing Committee.

During the General Assembly, which took place at the premises of the International Institute of Macao, António Monteiro presented the program's lines of action for this year, highlighting the intention to take the organization of the Macanese youth meeting.
"It was proposed to hold a possible meeting with the Chief Executive as soon as possible, to propose to the meeting of young people and present the new leader team," AJM President told the Jornal Tribuna de Macau.
In addition, the body will have other activities scheduled for this year, such as participation in the event program of “June, the month of Portugal”.

The Mozambican National Resistance (Renamo) is a “closed chapter” in the book of life of Venâncio Mondlane, the politician himself recently said in exclusive statements to DW.
"At this time, I have no interest in turning back, neither to lead Renamo nor to be a member," said former presidential candidate and former member of Renamo, adding that "this is not part of my expectations or my aspirations."
"I think I can do better for this country, creating conditions to open a new opportunity for political action," he said.
Throughout his political course, Mondlane went through the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM) and Renamo. In the past elections, he was also supported by the Optimistic Party for the development of Mozambique (Somos), however, eventually turned away, accusing the party of "selling the struggle of the people."
Mondlane led an unprecedented movement after the October general elections, in order to the official results that attributed the victory ahead of Liberation of Mozambique (Frelimo). Tens of thousands of followers religiously follow their posts and broadcast broadcasts on social networks.
Now Venâncio Mondlane is trying to create a new party, the National Alliance for a free and autonomous Mozambique (Anamalala), which still awaits the green light of the authorities.
 
“Window of Opportunities”
For the former defeated candidate in the last elections, Mozambique needs a new window of opportunity and political action, "in a kind of third way political, and I think this is possible with the new party and political project," he said.
For political analyst Lourindo Verde, the united front of the opposition is not viable, given Mondlane's quarrels with other political forces. "Venâncio Mondlane comes from a political conflict, not only with the government of the day, but also with the party where he militated, Renamo. Soon after his departure, he was preaching the idea that he would never go back," recalls the politologist.
Mondlane stated at the time that he left Renamo “as a result of a deep awareness of the need to seek more efficient means” for his struggle. On the other hand, he said that he moved away from Somos to stop "giving ride to hanging."
The problem, according to Lourindo Verde, is whether the creation of a new party will serve Venâncio Mondlane more individually than to the nation.
Verde states that the politician would need to “put his hand in conscience” so that “his existence will not be another party of those we have, who do nothing for the development of this country,” he said.
 
Dozens of "naparamas" surrendered to the authorities
About 50 men from the named “Naparamas” group, traditional guerrillas, who had taken an administrative post in Nampula province, surrendered to the authorities, the local government announced. Accompanied by elements of the Army, Nampula's governor, Eduardo Abdula, went to the Mutuali Administrative Post of the Malema district, northern Mozambique, on Monday, interacting with the group, who presented a list of orders to the authorities, especially employment opportunities and more investments for the region. “Let's work together. And those requests that are made here, on a case -by -case basis, we will evaluate, but it is necessary that the people who come here to invest have confidence,” said Eduardo Abdula, quoted by the media. Mozambican authorities announced, on April 2, the restoration of public order at the Mutuali post, which was controlled by “naparamas”, who even appointed local leaders. However, on 19 April, five group members died following an attack on a police station in the same district, an episode associated by the authorities with the "Naparamas".

Ghanaian cardinal Peter Turkson said in 2010 that he was not prepared to become Pope and that perhaps the Catholic Church was not ready either. However, more than 15 years later, this influential African religious appears as one of the favorites of the next conclave.
"I wouldn't like to be the first black pope. I think it would be difficult," he said at the time, but after Francisco's death, the name of this African cardinal is quoted by many analysts.
Turkson is not the only possible African candidate at the conclave for the election of Francisco's successor, nor would it be the first pontiff of this continent. Pope Vítor, who led the church between 189 and 199 AD, was from North Africa.
But as the percentage of African faithful increases compared to an increasingly secular Europe, the debate is taken up on whether the church is prepared for a first black porridge.
"It is increasing the feeling that if the Pope must be an international authority, and so he has to proceed from the global church," says Miles Pattenden, historian of Catholicism.
Turkson was born in a humble family of 10 children and was Ghana's first cleric to become Cardinal in 2003.
In 2008, he played as a mediator on a peacekeeper after disputed elections that threatened to trigger a scenario of violence. He also performed high -ranking duties in the Vatican bureaucracy and recently showed a more moderate tone on the LGBTQia+rights, criticizing Ghanaian politicians who stated that same -sex relations were not native to Africa.
In 2023, the British BBC network argued that "LGBTQia+ people should not be criminalized because they have not committed any crime."
This may be more acceptable to moderate sectors than the guinean rhetoric Robert Sarah, a traditionalist cardinal praised by conservatives and who compared abortion, “Islamic fanaticism” and homosexuality with Nazi ideology.
Another cardinal on the list, Fridolin Ambongo, from the Democratic Republic of Congo, led the campaign against the blessing to same -sex couples in Africa after Francis has exhorted the church to advance on the subject.
Despite its most moderate rhetoric, the Argentine pontiff maintained many conservative dogmas, also against egalitarian marriage and abortion.
The balance between its rhetoric and real reforms paves the way for African candidates who, for some critics, are very conservative, says Cristina Traina, professor of religious studies at New York Fordham University.
Pattenden also points out that there is no reason to think that the next Pope necessarily follows Francisco's most liberal stance.
The first Latin American Pope marked a great break in a European-dominated church. His effort for the Vatican hierarchy to reflect the reality of the faithful led to a scenario in which 12% of Cardinals with the right to vote in the conclave are Africans, against 8% in the previous.
Despite the changes, the continent remains underrected in the conclave, as 20% of the 1.400 billion of Catholics in the world live in Africa.
"It would be almost impossible to imagine a world that accepts an African Pope without the transition of Pope Francis being Argentine," says Traina.
A Congolese priest who asked not to have his name revealed considers that there is a reason why there was no African Pope in 1,500 years. "Discrimination, although not obvious among our European brothers, is still a reality that we do not speak often," he said.
An African Pope would represent a new perspective for some of the current problems of the Church.
Faced with the lack of seminarians, some members of the clergy in Africa claim the revision of the veto to the married priests, says Traina.
“It has always been on our lips, as we would like to have an African pope,” says Father Paul Maji, a priest in the Nigerian capital, Abuja. But he is not especially “sentimental” as to the origin of the next Pope, he says.
The opinion is shared by the Dean of the Faculty of Theology of the Catholic University of Congo, Sylvain Badibanga. "We shouldn't think it's our turn," he said. "It's God's turn."
The Turkson Ghanabug also came to a similar conclusion. When his name circulated in 2013 as a possible pontiff, he finally accepted the idea of ​​becoming the first black pope "if this is the will of the Lord."
