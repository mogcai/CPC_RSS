Macao health services (SSM) will extend medical support in the elderly homes in other non-subsidized senior spaces through the “medical cooperation model” model. In addition, SSM, in collaboration with non -profit medical institutions, reiterate the availability to continue to provide home care to patients with reduced mobility.
It is recalled that, currently, the proximity medical services cover all homes subsidized by the government and two rehabilitation centers and the residence for the elderly.
The information is included in response to an interpellation of Deputy José Pereira Coutinho, in which the SSM stresses that partnerships with non -profit medical institutions have been established in the provision of health care to the elderly or residents of Macao holders of the disability assessment card through financial support. At the same time, the health care reimbursement program provides subsidies to residents to travel to private clinics to optimize accessibility and convenience of access to health care.
In response to the deputy, the issue of accessibility in transport is also addressed. In this field, the Directorate of Traffic Affairs Services (DSAT) points out that a series of affordable transportation services and complementary measures to guarantee the mobility rights of disabled elderly have been implemented, including the exemption of tariffs in public bus holders for elderly and card holders for disabled people.
On the other hand, it reinforces the obligation that new acquired buses are equipped with accessibility devices (such as relegated flooring, wheelchair space and their fixing device, among others). According to data recorded until March this year, there were 974 buses equipped with relegated floor, representing about 99% of the total fleet in operation, and 883 buses with wheelchair fixation equipment, corresponding to about 90% of the fleet.
At the same time, DSAT asserts that it is also promoted to introduce accessible vehicles into taxi fleets. Currently, 12 accessible taxis and 10 with mechanical access equipment, available to people with reduced mobility or other specific needs, are in operation.
"DSAT will continue to pay attention to the use situation of these taxis, due to the timely assessing their number," says the body.
DSAT also recalls that the “General Planning of Traffic and Terrestrial Transport of Macao (2021-2030)” has incorporated the principle of improvement of barriers without barriers and measures, namely the “optimization of the pedestrian environment, the complementary equipment of the buses and taxi services, in order to achieve the government's goal of building a city without barriers”.
 
Expansion of careers for residence for the elderly
In response to another interpellation, now from Deputy Nick Lei, the president of the Institute of Social Action (IAS), Hon Wai, says, in turn, that DSAT is evaluating the possibility of expanding careers of public buses to include the terminal and nearby residence for the elderly. The evaluation is based on the calendar of inspection and reception of public roads and the Punching Terminal of Lot P, in the Black Sand, as well as the calendar of the entry into operation of the housing and installations of the respective lot.
The objective, emphasizes IAS, “is to promote, in a coordinated manner, the conduct of buses with buses and the introduction of public bus services in this lot, with the objective of facilitating the public travel”.
In order to facilitate access to the health care of the elderly of the residence, the president of IAS stresses that health services have already launched the external consultation at a distance, having provided “One-Stop” services, namely online registration, video consult, revenue issuance, drug dismissal, among others. In addition, external medical services have already extended to the government's residence for the elderly.</description><pubDate>2025-05-13 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Xia Baolong wants “high standard” cultural space in Macau</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/xia-baolong-quer-espaco-cultural-de-alto-padrao-em-macau/</link><description>In the inspection visit to Macao, the director of the RAE affairs to the State Council stressed that, in addition to the preservation of cultural heritage, Macau must also advance with revitalization. In addition, Xia Baolong urged the creation of “a high standard cultural space” in the territory
 
On the fourth day of its official trip to Macau, Xia Baolong, director of the Hong Kong and Macau affairs office with the Council of State, visited several establishments of cultural interest. The Chinese leader took advantage of the occasion to urge the Government of Misreial to create “a high standard cultural space that has cultural value and contemporary atmosphere,” according to Lam, secretary for social affairs and culture.
For this goal to be achieved, Xia Baolong hopes that the local executive will study seriously, the strands of planning, construction and management, and proceed to several demonstrations, added Lam. According to the secretary, the director "expressed high attention to the situation of the planning of the" International Integrated Tourist and Cultural Neighborhood "and the development of the cultural industry in Macau.
LAM also stressed that the Chinese leader specifically expressed a "great interest" for the work dedicated to the protection of Macau's cultural heritage. In this chapter, he considered that, in addition to preservation, the territory must also "advance with revitalization."
In addition, Xia Baolong hopes that the government of the MSA will continue to make the most of the patriotic elements of the projects, such as the Lin Zexu Memorial Museum, Xian Xinghai Memorial Museum, the village of Mong-há and former residence of General Ye Ting, which visited that day, as well as the D. Pedro V Theater, in order to contribute to a good execution of the work of love for the Patria and Macao.
Regarding her guardianship, the secretary assured that she will, according to Xia Baolong's orientation opinions and under the leadership of the Chief Executive, intensify the union and collaboration, as well as interdepartal cooperation. LAM promised to strive to promote Macau as a “important high-level bridge in the country for opening abroad” and an “important door for exchange and mutual learning between Chinese and Western civilizations”, strengthen Macau's positioning as “a base”, and perform well the planning and construction of the “integrated tourist and cultural neighborhood”.
In addition, the ruler stressed that she will take advantage of tourist resources and further promote culture, in favor of developing the proper diversification of the economy.
 
Entrepreneurs heard appeals to the Union
Yesterday, a penultimate day of the visit, Xia Baolong met in the morning, for two hours, with representatives of the Macao Industrial and Commercial Sector in the Forum Complex. After the meeting, Tai Kin IP, secretary for the economy and finance, revealed that Xia praised Hong Kong and Macau entrepreneurs for their persistence in the tradition of love of the homeland and both sins, as well as taking responsibility and sharing the country's concerns at important times in national development, and their successes.
Xia Baolong concluded that this proves that the development of the RAE industrial and commercial sector and the country's development constitute a community of common destination.
According to Tai Kin IP, the director mentioned the current situation of international development as well as US unilateralism and commercial protectionism. In this sense, Xia Baolong pointed out that the industrial and commercial sector of the RAE should join and be on the same side of the homeland, warning that there would be no way out if they made concessions.
The Chinese leader also appealed to entrepreneurs' boldness, hoping that they are full of trust in economic development, invest in Hong Kong and Macao, take advantage of the advantages of the two regions and open even more abroad.
During the meeting, Xia Baolong listened to more than 20 representatives of the MSAR who presented proposals on the proper diversification of the economy, the current economic situation and the development of Macao.
Tai Kin IP has ensured that the team of its guardianship will, according to this year's governing lines, to implement the various works of economic development. At the same time, it will continue to hence opinions and suggestions from the various sectors of society, to study them deeply and to promote them.
He said, Xia Baolong urged the government, especially the protection of the economy and finance, to maintain communication with the industrial and commercial sector after this meeting to discuss issues by theme, in order to actively realize the expressed opinions.
Present at this meeting, Jia Tianbing, president of the Macao Banks Association and Boc Macau, stressed that the sector received "important signs." The official stressed that BOC Macau will take a number of measures to seek Macao's economic development, including future transfronist services related to Digital Pataca and a commercial and commercial service platform between China, Lusophone and Hispanic countries in Hengqin, which is already being created.</description><pubDate>2025-05-13 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>16 disappearances of residents abroad in 2024</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/registados-16-desaparecimentos-de-residentes-exterior-em-2024/</link><description>Last year, there was an increase in cases of disappearance of residents abroad, according to data sent by the Judiciary Police to this newspaper.

The number of disappearances of residents abroad rose to the pike last year, after eight years when it was below a dozen or even zero. Data from the Judicial Police (PJ) made available to the Jornal Tribuna de Macau show that in 2024, 16 cases of this kind were recorded, of which 15 have already been resolved. According to the authorities, "the cases (…) were all reported to PJ by friends or family of the missing."
"As soon as we learned, we immediately started an investigation. During the investigation of cases, PJ requested Interpol's assistance to consult the competent local entities about the whereabouts of the missing," PJ said in the response to this newspaper.
Remember that in mid-February, Security Secretary Wong Sio Chak called on the population to be careful with the traps of employment proposals abroad. In the message published on his office's website, Wong Sio Chak also assured that the PJ continued to "optimize" emergency action, intensify international police cooperation and "actively investigate cases of abroad disappearances."
Given the reference to the disappearances, JTM tried to realize the size of these cases and if they would be related to such employment traps in other countries. However, according to the PJ information, cases of disappearance verified last year took place in various regions and countries.
In six cases, the authorities realized that the residents were detained for crimes in Taiwan and in other two in Hong Kong. In addition, four cases were related to "family disputes, difficulties at work, emotional problems." On the other hand, one of the missing died in Thailand, for illness.
Another resident was the victim of a scam and was rescued in Mexico, a case, which was reportedly reported and, lastly, a resident was being investigated for crime in China, but, however, has already been released.
Compared to previous years, a rise was observed in the number of cases. Between 2019 and 2023 one recorded one or zero cases per year, and in 2017 and 2018 had been six and seven, respectively. The number of cases of last year reached the level of 10 years ago, since in 2014 they had registered 15. However, it did not reach 19 cases verified in 2015.
In relation to this year, the PJ indicated that investigations related to three disappearances were activated, of which two have already been resolved. At issue, “family disputes”, and the cases occurred in Hong Kong and the United States.
In all, in a decade, only two cases were resolved (one of them referring to 2025).</description><pubDate>2025-05-13 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>USA and China interrupt trade war for 90 days</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/ultimas/eua-china-interrompem-guerra-comercial-por-90-dias/</link><description>EPA12093205 US REPRESENTATIVE JAMIESON GREER (L) AND US SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY SCOTT BESSENT (R) Attend A Press Reference After Two Days of Closed-Door Discussions on Trade Between States States and China, In Geneva, Switzerland, 12 May 2025. The United States and CHINA ANNOUNCED THEY AGREED TO CUT TARIFFS FOR AN INITIAL 90-DAY Period.  EPA/JEAN-CHRISTOPHE BOTT



The US and China yesterday announced an agreement to suspend most reciprocal tariffs, thus interrupting a trade war that shook the world economy. The suspension will come into force tomorrow, reported the two largest economic powers in the world in a joint statement released after two days of negotiations in Geneva.
The two parties agreed to temporarily reduce reciprocal tariffs by 115 percentage points for 90 days, explained US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Representative Jamieson Greer. In this way, imported Chinese products in the US will pay a 30% rate and Americans imported by China a 10% rate.
“We want a more balanced commercial (relationship),” said Bessento in Geneva, admitting that customs barriers introduced in recent months have actually established a “embargo” to trade between the two countries.
The reduction of tariffs is something “of common interest in the world,” noted the China Ministry of Commerce, which praised the “substantial progress” in commercial negotiations with Washington.
The break is the result of two days of Geneva negotiations between Bessent and Greer on the American side and deputy minister He Lifeng on the Chinese side.
The trade war between Beijing and Washington began when US President Donald Trump imposed a series of tariffs that specifically affected China, which responded with hard measures of retaliation. Since the beginning of the year, US -applied rates to China have reached 145%, but accumulated rates for certain products can reach 245%. In turn, China imposed 125% rates on American products.
Geneva negotiations took place with “great respect” and the result shows that “neither party wants an economic rupture,” said Bessent. On Sunday, he Lifeng had also highlighted the "significant progress" in the negotiations, which he described as "french, deep and substantial."
According to the joint statement, Beijing and Washington also agreed to "establish a mechanism to proceed with conversations about trade and economic relations."
For the China Ministry of Commerce, the two countries have created conditions to further overcome differences and deepen cooperation. According to the Xinhua agency, a ministry spokesman said the high level meeting "has achieved substantial progress by significantly reducing bilateral tariff levels, which has met the expectations of manufacturers and consumers from both countries and are in accordance with the interests of both nations and the global community."
The Chinese vice-master-master reached negotiations with the tranquility that Chinese exports rose 8.1% in April, four points more than analyst expectations. Some analysts have attributed unexpected performance to a redirecting from Chinese trade to Southeast Asia to mitigate American tariffs.
For Gary Hufbauer of the “Peterson Institute for International Economics”, among some more moderate Trump government members, such as Bessent and Trade Secretary Howard Lutnick, “there is the awareness that China is better prepared than the US to face this trade war”.
The EU Chamber of Commerce in China considered that the agreement yesterday announced for the suspension of most tariffs between US and China does not end uncertainty, although it is encouraging. In a brief message published on its portal, the House points out that these tariffs were applied “erratically” and that companies “need predictability to maintain normal operations and make investment decisions”.

The introduction of Portuguese literature in China began in the 1920s. In 1922, the eminent Chinese writer Mao Dun translated into Chinese the poem Dream Oriental, from Antero de Quental. Through this initiative, he intended to present to Chinese readers a broader view of the aesthetic and cultural diversity of world literature. It can be said that such a conception of cultural dissemination, centered on the idea of ​​“making known the world and supplying gaps”, lasted until the late twentieth century, exerting a significant influence on the way Portuguese literature, as well as other foreign literatures of less visibility, was translated and received in the Chinese context.
Prior to the reform and opening in 1978, the translation and dissemination of Portuguese literature in China were still at an early and exploratory phase. The number of books translated was extremely reduced, and their diffusion equally very limited. In 1955, the Publisher of Literature and Art of Shanghai published Bedsters, by Neorealist writer Soeiro Pereira Gomes, -novel that portrays the harsh reality of children's workers -which would be reissued by the publisher of Nova Literature and Art. During the 1960s, due to the cultural revolution and the complexity of the political context of the time, the publication of Portuguese literature was interrupted in the interior of China. Only a few Portuguese tales and poems were released in the magazine literature of the world, among which realistic narratives such as the boy of the drum, by Fernando Namora; The Treasury, from Eça de Queirós; and the son, by José Valentim Fialho de Almeida. Francisco Miguel Duarte's texts were also translated, as well as works that addressed the situation of the oppressed peoples, Jonas Negalha. These translation choices highlight the Chinese interest in the proletarian literature and the narrative techniques of realism, reflecting the influence of political and ideological factors on the selection of works. More than properly a literary exchange with Portugal, this process is a “cultural transplantation”, guided by a specific ideological bias.
During this period, Portuguese literature aroused scarce interest among the population in Macau. Still, the awakening of an identity feeling and the pursuit of cultural roots among the macanese promoted the first translation initiatives. In 1959, the Macanese synologist Luís Gonzaga Gomes translated to Chinese the poetic anthology patriotic Message, by Fernando Pessoa, but the work had no repercussion and was eventually forgotten in time. Chinese scholar Yao Feng noted that Chinese and Portuguese literatures in Macao “have passed each other without meeting” - perhaps this same expression describes the general panorama of Portuguese literature in China before reform and opening in the country: reciprocal indifference, a constant mismatch.
With the establishment of sino-Portuguese diplomatic relations in 1979, cultural exchange between the two countries knew a significant expansion. During the 1980s and 1990s, the translation of Portuguese literature in China began to have the strong support of government cultural institutions in both countries, which resulted in gradual recovery and the beginning of their flowering. The translations mainly encompassed poetic novels and collections, combining the “classic” character, - by representativeness in the Portuguese literary canon - with an “exotic” appeal of landscapes, loves and cultural expressions that aroused the interest in the diversity of this culture.
Camões was one of the first figures to enter the Chinese literary panorama. In 1980, in Macao, Wang Quanli and Li Junbao translated the Lusíadas told to the children and reminded the people of João de Barros. In 1981, on the occasion of the 400th anniversary of the death of Camões, the Institute of Foreign Literature of the Academy of Social Sciences, with the collaboration of the Gulbenkian Foundation, published the poetry of Camões in China. Then works of two larger figures in 19th century Portuguese literature - Camilo Castelo Branco and Eça de Queirós - began to gain prominence. In 1981, the translation of love of perdition was published in Beijing; Three years later, it was the turn of Father Amaro's crime, followed by Os Maias. In addition, contemporary writers such as Miguel Torga, Júlio Dinis, Ferreira de Castro and Jorge de Sena also received some attention. The publication of these works, translated directly from Portuguese to the Chinese, marked an inaugural stage of the translation and diffusion of Portuguese literature in China.
In the 1990s, with the intensifying of cultural exchange between China and the World, Portuguese literature was translated in China through collections, with the active support of cultural institutions in both countries.
At the beginning of the decade, the Institute of Foreign Literature of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, in partnership with the Gulbenkian Foundation, launched the Portuguese Literature Collection, which included five works: the city and the mountains, the Lusíadas, animals and other tales, modern Portuguese poetry, and love of perdition.
At the same time, the publisher of the Association of Literature and Art of China and the Oriente Foundation collaborated in the publication of the Portuguese Culture Collection (15 volumes), which covered topics such as science, music, cinema, architecture and photography, as well as integrating literary works. Among the most relevant titles stand out Mr. Ventura, retail of a doctor's life and the full translation of Os Lusíadas.
In 1994, at the initiative of the Macao Cultural Institute and the Portuguese Institute of the East, the publication of the Basic Library of Portuguese Authors was organized, composed of 27 volumes, edited by China's Literature and Art Huashan Publishing House and simultaneously released in Macau. This collection played a significant role, not only for presenting works representative of different times of Portuguese literature, but also for offering critical frames that contextualized the authors, their styles and the historical contexts in which they wrote. The simultaneous publication in the interior of China and Macao reflected a joint effort to promote Portuguese literature both in the mainland of China and Macao, where the Portuguese cultural tradition has deeper roots and continues to develop.
These translations have provided Chinese readers a broader panoramic of Portuguese literature, covering both classic authors such as Camilo Castelo Branco, Eça de Queirós and Julio Dinis, as well as contemporary voices such as Sophia de Mello, Eugénio de Andrade and José Saramago. In addition to the consecrated authors, Macanese writers began to gain recognition in the world of Chinese language, such as Henrique de Senna Fernandes, with love and foot fingers and the witch braid; Rodrigo Leal de Carvalho, with refinement by Irina Ostrakoff; and Deolinda da Conceição, with Cabaia. These works not only fear the meetings and conflicts between Portuguese and Chinese cultures, but also offered a unique perspective on Macau, reflecting the vision of the Portuguese of China and their complex sociocultural interactions.
In addition to the three collections systematically translated with official support, literary magazines such as the world of literature, appreciation of classical works and foreign literature and art have also published, through this period, several tales of Portuguese authors, including Miguel Torga, José Rodrigues Miguéis and Fialho de Almeida.
However, these translations did not raise an interest in the academic environment. With the exception of Os Lusíadas, the other translated works revealed a limited impact and were hardly subject to study. The reception from the general public was also restricted. Even in Macao, where the Portuguese cultural heritage is more present, the reach of translated Portuguese literature remained modest. As a local criticism has observed, "so far, no Chinese writer in Macau dominates Portuguese, and the number of readers of the Chinese version of Os Lusíadas is very small."
It is noteworthy that in 1996, writer Han Shaogong translated from the English book of Fernando Pessoa's unrest, with a fluid version that aroused readers' interest and established the foundations for the vacancy of interest to the person in China. In 1998, Fan Weixin translated essay on blindness, by José Saramago. The work, which caught the attention of the editorial industry, met several editions, contributing decisively to the expansion of the presence of Portuguese literature in the country and to strengthen its influence on the Chinese literary panorama.
In the first decade of the 21st century, with the conclusion of the Basic Library of Portuguese authors, the translation of Portuguese literature in China entered a relatively silent period. Without official support, the translation of Portugal's literary works has reduced considerably, resulting in a total absence of new translations between 2006 and 2009.
In the first three years of the 21st century, five novels were published that were still part of the Basic Library of Portuguese authors. In 2003, China launched, for the first time, the youth novel The Moon of Joana, by contemporary author Maria Gonzalez. During this period, two works translated from the English were also published: Fernando António Nogueira Pessoa and the book of Unrest. In 2004, the Yilin publisher of Shanghai launched the eyes of Ana Marta, by Alice Vieira, probably the first Portuguese book published in China. The work had a good reception with the reader audience, establishing a basis for the later wave of interest in Portuguese children's literature in China.
In Macao, in addition to the simultaneous publication of the five works of the Basic Library of Portuguese authors, three poetic anthologies of Eugénio de Andrade were released: Small Orient Notebook, poetry and prose and white in white. Andrade's language, marked by clarity and conciseness, reveals a unique expressiveness that harmonizes with the attractive translation of Yao Feng, an experienced translator and poet, who had already poured to Chinese the other name of the Earth, in the 1990s. Poetry and prose was widely praised and aroused the interest of the Chinese poetic environment, contributing to expand the reception of Portuguese poetry in poetry in China.
The recognition of José Saramago, laureate with the Nobel Prize for Literature, began to gain prominence among the publishers of Taiwan. Following the publication of History of the Lisbon Siege in 2001 by Reading Times, the same publisher released two rehearsal editions about blindness in 2002, convent memorial in 2011 and the notebook in 2012. At the same time, Fernando Pessoa also aroused the interest of the Taiwanese publishers. In 2001, an edition of The Book of Deassiego was published and, in 2004, a bilingual anthology of poems by Fernando Pessoa was released. In addition, the Maya, which had already been published in 1998, was reissued in 2001, demonstrating the continuous reception of Portuguese literature in the Taiwanese editorial market.
After more than a decade of relative stagnation during the early 21st century, the last ten years have been marked by a remarkable dynamism in the translation and dissemination of Portuguese literature in China. With the progressive deepening of sino-Portuguese relations in the political, economic and cultural areas, cultural exchange intensified, contributing to a significant increase in the number of translated works and the consolidation of a vigorous development trend in this field.
During this period, the translation and study of Portuguese literature in China were mainly concentrated in Fernando Pessoa and José Saramago, signaling a transition from interest to Portugal to a deeper exploitation of the works of these authors, which aroused unpublished attention by Chinese readers.
In the last decade, more than half of the Portuguese poetic anthologies published in China was dedicated to Fernando Pessoa. Although the first translations of his work from the 1980s, it was not until 1995 that the Han Shaogong's Book of Decase, aroused a broad interest. Since then, new editions and anthologies have been released, but the first direct translation of Portuguese was only published in 2013, with a faithful version of Alberto Caeiro, translated by Min Xuefei, well received in the literary environment. From this moment, translators such as Zhang Weimi, Yao Feng, Jin Xinyi and Zhou Miao began to dedicate themselves to the work of person, whose translations boosted academic studies about the author in China. Its popularity has also grown on social networks, consolidating a dynamic scenario of reception and debate.
If Fernando Pessoa attracted readers for introspective loneliness and the delicacy of their sensitivity, José Saramago has won a faithful audience thanks to his deep and incisive satire. In 1998, Fan Weixin translated the convent memorial, with which he received the rainbow prize of literary translation in the first edition of the Lu Xun Prize for Literature. In the same year, the Nobel Prize assignment of literature Saramago had great repercussion, boosting the publication of its tales in magazines dedicated to literary translation.
In 2014, Saramago's reception in China entered a new phase with the launch of a new edition of Blindness rehearsal, along with a trial on lucidity. The satirical parable about human nature captivated the Chinese readers, consolidating the author's prestige in the country. Since then, the publisher of the writers has published the collection of Saramago classics, with seven fantastic theme titles, as well as the notebook. Over the course of ten years, thirteen novels of the author have been published or reissued, while academic studies about his work began to gain body and projection.
Saramago's success led the publishers to turn their attention to António Lobo Antunes, also a master of the historic narrative and winner of the Camões award. In 2020, three of his novels were published in China: the ships, the Inquisitors Manual and the costs of Judas. With a style characterized by the flow of consciousness and poetic and symbolic language, Antunes won readers attracted by his incisive social criticism. Only in 2022, more than ten Portuguese novels were published on the Chinese continent, most of them with historical theme and similar style, but none reached the impact of Fernando Pessoa and José Saramago.
During this period, illustrated children's books have achieved great editorial success in China. The works of Isabel Minhós Martins and Ana Oom were widely translated, with a remarkable peak in 2016 and 2017, when they were released, respectively, 21 and 24 titles.
The enthusiasm for children's books illustrated inside China has aroused the interest of the publishing market in Taiwan. Several Taiwanese publishers began to publish works by Isabel Minhós Martins, and Joana Estrela also gained space in the Taiwanese editorial market, expanding the presence of children's literature in Portuguese in the region.
In Taiwan, the editorial trend in the last decade is similar to that of the interior of China, especially Fernando Pessoa and José Saramago. The book of Deassie was published three times, and three works by Saramago were also released: the notebook, the year of the death of Ricardo Reis and the intermittences of death. For the first time, a work by Lidia Jorge was published, expanding the presence of Lusophone literature in the region.
At the same time, Portuguese literature began entering the Hong Kong editorial market. The editor of the Chinese University of Hong Kong published three anthologies of Portuguese poetry, namely: Scotoma, by Fernando Pinto do Amaral; Variation on roses, by Nuno Júdice; And nude: Study in Poignancy, by Ana Luísa Amaral. All were released in Trilingues editions (Portuguese, English and Chinese)
It can be observed that, in the last ten years or more, the translation and diffusion of Portuguese literature in China has lived a period of full prosperity, marked by the wide publication of works in Chinese and an open and inclusive literary vision. There was a significant increase in translations and the emergence of new translators. However, with the editorial focus focused on Fernando Pessoa and José Saramago, the selection of works followed relatively similar styles, resulting in less diversity than the 1980s and 1990s.
In short, the Portuguese literary journey reflects not only the path of its translation, diffusion and reception in China, but also the changes in the aesthetic taste of the Chinese public and the dynamism of sino-Portuguese cultural exchange. Notwithstanding the growing interest and influence of Portuguese literature in the country, critical and editorial attention, to a large extent, in Fernando Pessoa and José Saramago. It is a promising field, but it still requires continuous efforts, since many works of high literary value remain unpublished for the Chinese audience.

On the occasion of International Nurse Day, celebrated yesterday, Ella Lei urged the government to reinforce support for health professionals, helping them to relieve pressure. As a subdirector of the Federation of Macao Workers Associations (Faom) also supported the support of community medical institutions in the formation of youth nurses and the increase in remuneration of community nurses.
Ella Lei noted that many graduates of medical or nursing courses continue to find difficulties in search of employment. "In addition to increasing health professionals in the public sector, the authorities should also accelerate the launch of policies and measures, reinforcing resources to support the development of community medical institutions and rehabilitation homes. In the long run, they should evaluate the distribution and demand of human resources in public hospitals, community medical institutions and rehabilitation homes, in order to launch tile formation plans." also deputy.
In this respect, it law pointed out that at the level of community medical services, the front line staff is facing “increasingly pronounced” working pressure, especially in a context of population aging and increasingly common chronic diseases. In addition, he asked the government to pay more attention to nurses and improve the physical and mental health of these professionals. In general, the deputy hopes that a “stronger and resilient” health system will be fostered.

Predicting that a group of nurses will enter a "wave of retirement," Leong Sou Kam said the government expected the resources to expand the resources to support and attract more young people to join the community medical services team. From its perspective, it is also necessary to launch even more external and community services.</description><pubDate>2025-05-13 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Seac Pai Van waiting for more leisure spaces</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/seac-pai-van-a-espera-de-mais-espacos-de-lazer/</link><description>The land not yet developed in Seac Pai Van are being the subject of a study of updating on the urban plan, which aims to provide that community neighborhood of more green and leisure spaces. The objective is to improve habitability conditions. The Government is open to considering requests that are made by the services or competent entities for provisional use of land

The Directorate of Soil Services and Urban Construction (DSSCU) is developing the “Study of Update on the Urban Plan of Seac Pai Van de Coloane (East Side)”, which aims to optimize and adjust the land not yet developed in that community neighborhood. According to DSSCU, the study aims to “build a more comfortable, accessible and gifted community with a greater presence of green spaces, improving habitability conditions”.
The body states that if the competent services or entities submit requests for provisional land use, the Government will proceed with its comprehensive appreciation and study. And, “as long as it is considered in public interest”, a provisional purpose will be attributed to the land part.
The position of DSSCU was cited in the Institute's response to Municipal Affairs (AMI) to an interpellation of Deputy Leong Hong Sai. AMI stresses that the government continues to create more recreational, sports and leisure spaces in the Seac Pai Van community neighborhood.
These spaces intended for the well-being of the population of this housing zone, include the IP Heng leisure zones, completed in 2024, and the Harmony Alameda, open to the public on March 24 this year. This latter recreational area, in addition to having large children's fun equipment, also includes a series of physical maintenance machines for young people, adults and the elderly, “in order to respond to the needs of residents of different age groups,” says AMI.
Meanwhile, DSSCU states that the MSAR Director Plan (2020-2040) already provides for the creation, in the Operative Planning and Management Unit, of more areas with collective use equipment, maintaining, in particular, the current use for green spaces and outdoor activities, as well as the delimitation of green zones or open public spaces. In the future, it emphasizes, "when elaborating the respective detail plan, these aspects will be the subject of study with a view to its realization, contributing to the improvement of the distribution of urban spaces."
On the other hand, in response to Leong Hong's questioning, signed by the chairman of the Board of Directors for municipal affairs, Chao Wai Ieng, it is mentioned that the government will continue to pay attention and analyze the demand for sports facilities by residents. "In the scope of the urban renewal plan, urban planning or the construction of large projects, the Institute of Sport (ID) will proactively advise the competent services on the rational assignment of sports facilities," says AMI.
Moreover, he adds, "if the competent planning services need to begin territory planning work for sports use of the community, ID will cooperate and pronounce, to build more facilities for sports for residents."
Currently, there are in the network of public sports facilities bowling, scash, table tennis, tennis and badminton in the center of bowling, the tennis gym and the sports ship of the East Asia games that are located near the community neighborhood of Seac Pai Van, “the residents of that neighborhood arrive by resorting to the corresponding public transport, as by Example, the slight meter ”.</description><pubDate>2025-05-13 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Planned opening to the public of the Chio family house</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/planeada-abertura-ao-publico-da-casa-da-familia-chio/</link><description>The Chio Family House will be able to open to the public this year, according to the Cultural Institute.

In this context, the work of removing various objects, structural consolidation, 3D digitization and the topography of the buildings, as well as the collection, have already been completed. previous historical data and the elaboration of solutions for the restoration project.
The Chio family home is a Lingnan -style residential building, organized into a three -spinned system and three halls with two corridors between them. Subsequently, due to the insufficient space, four more adjacent dwellings were added to the four corners of the main building.
In other points of the response to the Hemiciclo member, IC president Leong Wai Man ensures that the government has been making all efforts to promote the development of culture and tourism “high quality science and technology empowerers”.

In addition to references to macanese or Portuguese families, the publication of Manuel V. Basilio presents summarized biographies of Chinese individualities and traders who lived in that ancient area of ​​Macao. Two of them were awarded in 1880 with the title of Knight by the honorary mercy of King D. Louis I of Portugal, due to the valuable contributions they made to the economic and social life of the territory
 
The headquarters of the Macao Retirers, Reformed and Pensioners Association (Apomac) will be the scene of the presentation, on May 19 at 15h00, of the Chinese version of Manuel V. Basilio's book, called “Stories and Memories - Baixo do Monte and around”.
The publication, already presented in Portuguese in October 2023, now comes in Chinese language “after several incentives made to the author to edit the book in Chinese, given the interest he can arouse,” according to a book presentation note.
The work releases one of the most striking periods of the past of Macao, the integration of the Chinese population into the so -called “Christian city”, thus beginning the effective miscegenation of western and oriental cultures, with the removal of the barrier created by the old wall and doors of the city, “all live in harmony as neighbors”. On the one hand, he underlines Apomac, "this situation has only become possible with the end of the coexistence of two jurisdictions in the Macao Peninsula, the Portuguese and the Chinese, respectively inside and outside the city wall that, over centuries, separated the two communities."
The same note also points out that, at that time, mainly from 1844, the Portuguese government authorized all foreigners to “buy or build houses and have any terrain in Macao”. This measure eventually favored years later, the Chinese traders who had some wealth and came to Macao from southern China to escape the Taiping rebellion, also known as the Taiping Civil War, which lasted from 1850 to 1864, having settled here and restarts their activities as entrepreneurs.
According to the story, one of the zones preferred by the Chinese traders to reside was the so -called low of the Monte, because it is near the heart of the city. Since then, some public road names have changed by the desire of their residents.
By that name was known the southern hill south and covering an entire vaguely defined boundaries, ranging from the fortress to near the streets of Palha, S. Domingos and Pedro Nolasco da Silva, between Street of S. Paulo and the sidewalk of the Monte ”.
There lived many Portuguese and Macanese families. To prove this fact, the author collected data on several families, especially macanese, who lived in that area of ​​the city from the mid -nineteenth century to the second half of the twentieth century, and whose collection includes, namely Batalha, Marques, Xavier, Rosario, among others.
In addition to references to macanese or Portuguese families, the book presents summary biographies of Chinese individualities and traders who lived in Baixa do Monte, namely Chou Iau and Fong Seng, who, in 1880, were awarded the title of Knight by King D. Louis I from Portugal, due to the valuable contributions they made to the economic and social life of Macao.
Regarding toponymy, the author tells his version of why they gave designations something curious or enigmatic to various public roads of Baixa do Monte, such as sidewalk of truths and Santa Filomena Street. It also makes a brief summary of the history of some buildings that existed and others that still exist, located in the boundary zone of Baixa do Monte, including the Capitol Theater, from its inauguration on April 18, 1931 to the closing on August 1, 1987, and its subsequent requalification, becoming the “Capitol Theater Shopping Center”.
The topics covered in this book are not only restricted to Macao's public or toponym, including memories, experiences, uses and customs, as well as stories based on the history of Macao. Manuel V. Basilio makes known one of the oldest zones of Macao: the bass of the mount or, in the local dialect, baixo Monte.

The introduction of Portuguese literature in China began in the 1920s. In 1922, the eminent Chinese writer Mao Dun translated into Chinese the poem Dream Oriental, from Antero de Quental. Through this initiative, he intended to present to Chinese readers a broader view of the aesthetic and cultural diversity of world literature. It can be said that such a conception of cultural dissemination, centered on the idea of ​​“making known the world and supplying gaps”, lasted until the late twentieth century, exerting a significant influence on the way Portuguese literature, as well as other foreign literatures of less visibility, was translated and received in the Chinese context.
Prior to the reform and opening in 1978, the translation and dissemination of Portuguese literature in China were still at an early and exploratory phase. The number of books translated was extremely reduced, and their diffusion equally very limited. In 1955, the Publisher of Literature and Art of Shanghai published Bedsters, by Neorealist writer Soeiro Pereira Gomes, -novel that portrays the harsh reality of children's workers -which would be reissued by the publisher of Nova Literature and Art. During the 1960s, due to the cultural revolution and the complexity of the political context of the time, the publication of Portuguese literature was interrupted in the interior of China. Only a few Portuguese tales and poems were released in the magazine literature of the world, among which realistic narratives such as the boy of the drum, by Fernando Namora; The Treasury, from Eça de Queirós; and the son, by José Valentim Fialho de Almeida. Francisco Miguel Duarte's texts were also translated, as well as works that addressed the situation of the oppressed peoples, Jonas Negalha. These translation choices highlight the Chinese interest in the proletarian literature and the narrative techniques of realism, reflecting the influence of political and ideological factors on the selection of works. More than properly a literary exchange with Portugal, this process is a “cultural transplantation”, guided by a specific ideological bias.
During this period, Portuguese literature aroused scarce interest among the population in Macau. Still, the awakening of an identity feeling and the pursuit of cultural roots among the macanese promoted the first translation initiatives. In 1959, the Macanese synologist Luís Gonzaga Gomes translated to Chinese the poetic anthology patriotic Message, by Fernando Pessoa, but the work had no repercussion and was eventually forgotten in time. Chinese scholar Yao Feng noted that Chinese and Portuguese literatures in Macao “have passed each other without meeting” - perhaps this same expression describes the general panorama of Portuguese literature in China before reform and opening in the country: reciprocal indifference, a constant mismatch.
With the establishment of sino-Portuguese diplomatic relations in 1979, cultural exchange between the two countries knew a significant expansion. During the 1980s and 1990s, the translation of Portuguese literature in China began to have the strong support of government cultural institutions in both countries, which resulted in gradual recovery and the beginning of their flowering. The translations mainly encompassed poetic novels and collections, combining the “classic” character, - by representativeness in the Portuguese literary canon - with an “exotic” appeal of landscapes, loves and cultural expressions that aroused the interest in the diversity of this culture.
Camões was one of the first figures to enter the Chinese literary panorama. In 1980, in Macao, Wang Quanli and Li Junbao translated the Lusíadas told to the children and reminded the people of João de Barros. In 1981, on the occasion of the 400th anniversary of the death of Camões, the Institute of Foreign Literature of the Academy of Social Sciences, with the collaboration of the Gulbenkian Foundation, published the poetry of Camões in China. Then works of two larger figures in 19th century Portuguese literature - Camilo Castelo Branco and Eça de Queirós - began to gain prominence. In 1981, the translation of love of perdition was published in Beijing; Three years later, it was the turn of Father Amaro's crime, followed by Os Maias. In addition, contemporary writers such as Miguel Torga, Júlio Dinis, Ferreira de Castro and Jorge de Sena also received some attention. The publication of these works, translated directly from Portuguese to the Chinese, marked an inaugural stage of the translation and diffusion of Portuguese literature in China.
In the 1990s, with the intensifying of cultural exchange between China and the World, Portuguese literature was translated in China through collections, with the active support of cultural institutions in both countries.
At the beginning of the decade, the Institute of Foreign Literature of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, in partnership with the Gulbenkian Foundation, launched the Portuguese Literature Collection, which included five works: the city and the mountains, the Lusíadas, animals and other tales, modern Portuguese poetry, and love for perdition.
At the same time, the publisher of the Association of Literature and Art of China and the Oriente Foundation collaborated in the publication of the Portuguese Culture Collection (15 volumes), which covered topics such as science, music, cinema, architecture and photography, as well as integrating literary works. Among the most relevant titles stand out Mr. Ventura, retail of a doctor's life and the full translation of Os Lusíadas.
In 1994, at the initiative of the Macao Cultural Institute and the Portuguese Institute of the East, the publication of the Basic Library of Portuguese Authors was organized, composed of 27 volumes, edited by China's Literature and Art Huashan Publishing House and simultaneously released in Macau. This collection played a significant role, not only for presenting works representative of different times of Portuguese literature, but also for offering critical frames that contextualized the authors, their styles and the historical contexts in which they wrote. The simultaneous publication in the interior of China and Macao reflected a joint effort to promote Portuguese literature both in the mainland of China and Macao, where the Portuguese cultural tradition has deeper roots and continues to develop.
These translations have provided Chinese readers a broader panoramic of Portuguese literature, covering both classic authors such as Camilo Castelo Branco, Eça de Queirós and Julio Dinis, as well as contemporary voices such as Sophia de Mello, Eugénio de Andrade and José Saramago. In addition to the consecrated authors, Macanese writers began to gain recognition in the world of Chinese language, such as Henrique de Senna Fernandes, with love and foot fingers and the witch braid; Rodrigo Leal de Carvalho, with refinement by Irina Ostrakoff; and Deolinda da Conceição, with Cabaia. These works not only fear the meetings and conflicts between Portuguese and Chinese cultures, but also offered a unique perspective on Macau, reflecting the vision of the Portuguese of China and their complex sociocultural interactions.
In addition to the three collections systematically translated with official support, literary magazines such as the world of literature, appreciation of classical works and foreign literature and art have also published, through this period, several tales of Portuguese authors, including Miguel Torga, José Rodrigues Miguéis and Fialho de Almeida.
However, these translations did not raise an interest in the academic environment. With the exception of Os Lusíadas, the other translated works revealed a limited impact and were hardly subject to study. The reception from the general public was also restricted. Even in Macao, where the Portuguese cultural heritage is more present, the reach of translated Portuguese literature remained modest. As a local criticism has observed, "so far, no Chinese writer in Macau dominates Portuguese, and the number of readers of the Chinese version of Os Lusíadas is very small."
It is noteworthy that in 1996, writer Han Shaogong translated from the English book of Fernando Pessoa's unrest, with a fluid version that aroused readers' interest and established the foundations for the vacancy of interest to the person in China. In 1998, Fan Weixin translated essay on blindness, by José Saramago. The work, which caught the attention of the editorial industry, met several editions, contributing decisively to the expansion of the presence of Portuguese literature in the country and to strengthen its influence on the Chinese literary panorama.
In the first decade of the 21st century, with the conclusion of the Basic Library of Portuguese authors, the translation of Portuguese literature in China entered a relatively silent period. Without official support, the translation of Portugal's literary works has reduced considerably, resulting in a total absence of new translations between 2006 and 2009.
In the first three years of the 21st century, five novels were published that were still part of the Basic Library of Portuguese authors. In 2003, China launched, for the first time, the youth novel The Moon of Joana, by contemporary author Maria Gonzalez. During this period, two works translated from the English were also published: Fernando António Nogueira Pessoa and the book of Unrest. In 2004, the Yilin publisher of Shanghai launched the eyes of Ana Marta, by Alice Vieira, probably the first Portuguese book published in China. The work had a good reception with the reader audience, establishing a basis for the later wave of interest in Portuguese children's literature in China.
In Macao, in addition to the simultaneous publication of the five works of the Basic Library of Portuguese authors, three poetic anthologies of Eugénio de Andrade were released: Small Orient Notebook, poetry and prose and white in white. Andrade's language, marked by clarity and conciseness, reveals a unique expressiveness that harmonizes with the attractive translation of Yao Feng, an experienced translator and poet, who had already poured to Chinese the other name of the Earth, in the 1990s. Poetry and prose was widely praised and aroused the interest of the Chinese poetic environment, contributing to expand the reception of Portuguese poetry in poetry in China.
The recognition of José Saramago, laureate with the Nobel Prize for Literature, began to gain prominence among the publishers of Taiwan. Following the publication of History of the Lisbon Siege in 2001 by Reading Times, the same publisher released two rehearsal editions about blindness in 2002, convent memorial in 2011 and the notebook in 2012. At the same time, Fernando Pessoa also aroused the interest of the Taiwanese publishers. In 2001, an edition of The Book of Deassiego was published and, in 2004, a bilingual anthology of poems by Fernando Pessoa was released. In addition, the Maya, which had already been published in 1998, was reissued in 2001, demonstrating the continuous reception of Portuguese literature in the Taiwanese editorial market.
After more than a decade of relative stagnation during the early 21st century, the last ten years have been marked by a remarkable dynamism in the translation and dissemination of Portuguese literature in China. With the progressive deepening of sino-Portuguese relations in the political, economic and cultural areas, cultural exchange intensified, contributing to a significant increase in the number of translated works and the consolidation of a vigorous development trend in this field.
During this period, the translation and study of Portuguese literature in China were mainly concentrated in Fernando Pessoa and José Saramago, signaling a transition from interest to Portugal to a deeper exploitation of the works of these authors, which aroused unpublished attention by Chinese readers.
In the last decade, more than half of the Portuguese poetic anthologies published in China was dedicated to Fernando Pessoa. Although the first translations of his work from the 1980s, it was not until 1995 that the Han Shaogong's Book of Decase, aroused a broad interest. Since then, new editions and anthologies have been released, but the first direct translation of Portuguese was only published in 2013, with a faithful version of Alberto Caeiro, translated by Min Xuefei, well received in the literary environment. From this moment, translators such as Zhang Weimi, Yao Feng, Jin Xinyi and Zhou Miao began to dedicate themselves to the work of person, whose translations boosted academic studies about the author in China. Its popularity has also grown on social networks, consolidating a dynamic scenario of reception and debate.
If Fernando Pessoa attracted readers for introspective loneliness and the delicacy of their sensitivity, José Saramago has won a faithful audience thanks to his deep and incisive satire. In 1998, Fan Weixin translated the convent memorial, with which he received the rainbow prize of literary translation in the first edition of the Lu Xun Prize for Literature. In the same year, the Nobel Prize assignment of literature Saramago had great repercussion, boosting the publication of its tales in magazines dedicated to literary translation.
In 2014, Saramago's reception in China entered a new phase with the launch of a new edition of Blindness rehearsal, along with a trial on lucidity. The satirical parable about human nature captivated the Chinese readers, consolidating the author's prestige in the country. Since then, the publisher of the writers has published the collection of Saramago classics, with seven fantastic theme titles, as well as the notebook. Over the course of ten years, thirteen novels of the author have been published or reissued, while academic studies about his work began to gain body and projection.
Saramago's success led the publishers to turn their attention to António Lobo Antunes, also a master of the historic narrative and winner of the Camões award. In 2020, three of his novels were published in China: the ships, the Inquisitors Manual and the costs of Judas. With a style characterized by the flow of consciousness and poetic and symbolic language, Antunes won readers attracted by his incisive social criticism. Only in 2022, more than ten Portuguese novels were published on the Chinese continent, most of them with historical theme and similar style, but none reached the impact of Fernando Pessoa and José Saramago.
During this period, illustrated children's books have achieved great editorial success in China. The works of Isabel Minhós Martins and Ana Oom were widely translated, with a remarkable peak in 2016 and 2017, when they were released, respectively, 21 and 24 titles.
The enthusiasm for children's books illustrated inside China has aroused the interest of the publishing market in Taiwan. Several Taiwanese publishers began to publish works by Isabel Minhós Martins, and Joana Estrela also gained space in the Taiwanese editorial market, expanding the presence of children's literature in Portuguese in the region.
In Taiwan, the editorial trend in the last decade is similar to that of the interior of China, especially Fernando Pessoa and José Saramago. The book of Deassie was published three times, and three works by Saramago were also released: the notebook, the year of the death of Ricardo Reis and the intermittences of death. For the first time, a work by Lidia Jorge was published, expanding the presence of Lusophone literature in the region.
At the same time, Portuguese literature began entering the Hong Kong editorial market. The editor of the Chinese University of Hong Kong published three anthologies of Portuguese poetry, namely: Scotoma, by Fernando Pinto do Amaral; Variation on roses, by Nuno Júdice; And nude: Study in Poignancy, by Ana Luísa Amaral. All were released in Trilingues editions (Portuguese, English and Chinese)
It can be observed that, in the last ten years or more, the translation and diffusion of Portuguese literature in China has lived a period of full prosperity, marked by the wide publication of works in Chinese and an open and inclusive literary vision. There was a significant increase in translations and the emergence of new translators. However, with the editorial focus focused on Fernando Pessoa and José Saramago, the selection of works followed relatively similar styles, resulting in less diversity than the 1980s and 1990s.
In short, the Portuguese literary journey reflects not only the path of its translation, diffusion and reception in China, but also the changes in the aesthetic taste of the Chinese public and the dynamism of sino-Portuguese cultural exchange. Notwithstanding the growing interest and influence of Portuguese literature in the country, critical and editorial attention, to a large extent, in Fernando Pessoa and José Saramago. It is a promising field, but it still requires continuous efforts, since many works of high literary value remain unpublished for the Chinese audience.
