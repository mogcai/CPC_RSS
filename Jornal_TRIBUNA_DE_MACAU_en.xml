In the first half of this year, a total of 7.09 million Patacas was granted on support, under the support plan for young entrepreneurs, with February registered an amount of two million (28.21%), more than any other month. In January 1.27 million (17.91%) were awarded, in April 1.15 million (16.22%), in May 750 thousand patacas (10.58%) and, in June, 1.92 million (27.08%), according to data analyzed by the Jornal Tribuna de Macao on the page of the Directorate of Economics and Technological Development (DSEDT).
Like previous years, retail trade remains the area of economic activity that the most funding receives, with 3.26 million patacas, or 46% of the total amount. 1.41 million were granted to the areas of education, medical services and social assistance (19.9%). Young people who created restaurants in the area of restaurants and hotels received 1.3 million patacas (18.3%), while vehicle and barber repair services received 550,000 patacas (7.8%). The services provided to the companies were granted 200 thousand patacas, 2.8% of the total amount, and, finally, the construction and public works received 70 thousand patacas (1%).
In the first six months, DSEDT received 59 requests for the support plan for young entrepreneurs. Of these, 42 were approved and 16 rejected. During March, although DSEDT received nine requests, none was approved or rejected, and therefore no financial support has been granted. Both in January and February, the body received 10 requests; Already in April there were eight, in May nine and, in the last month of the semester, 13.
In June, the services approved the largest number of requests (12) and rejected five, more than any other month of the year. DSEDT approved seven requests in January, 11 in February, seven in April and five in May. In February, as in May, DSEDT rejected two requests and the same happened to another three in April. In January, four were rejected.
Last year was also the period in which the least money was attributed, with just over 14 million patacas, in line with the decrease trend since 2022. This should be due to the fact that 2024 was the year in which the young people made fewer requests (114), since 2020. Consequently, fewer requests were also approved, in addition to 78, and 33 were rejected, only one less than one that in 2023.
Between August 1, 2013, the date on which the plan came into force, and the end of 2024, a total amount of 453.53 million patacas has already been granted. Of this value, more than 210 million intended only for retail trade (46.4%). The second most supportive economic activity received by 2024 was restoration and hotel (12.6%), which this year was surpassed by educational, health and social services. Until last year, education, medical services and social assistance received 34.79 million patacas (7.7%).</description><pubDate>2025-07-30 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Finished repair work on the statue of Camões</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/finalizados-trabalhos-de-reparacao-da-estatua-de-camoes/</link><description>The work of renewal of the Camões bust have already been completed, the institute for municipal affairs to the Jornal Tribuna de Macau, adding that the Cultural Institute has already inspected the place.

The Institute for Municipal Affairs (AMI) indicated that "the works of renewal of the statue [of Camões] have already been ended." It is recalled that the third stanza of “The Lusíadas” on the back of the pedestal where Luís Vaz de Camões bust was practically unreadable.
Faced with this situation in July last year, AMI had told JTM that “it had already found that the registration is disappearing” and that it was “accompanying” the situation, and added that maintenance work would be performed. Now, the body has also indicated to the Jornal Tribuna de Macao that "an inspection has been made by the Cultural Institute."
The stanza that was already practically incomprehensible was the number 81 of singing VI: “And yet, nymphs of mine, it was not enough/ that such misery would surround me,/ except those I singing walked/ such a prize of my verses would make me:/ the change of the rests I expected,/ of the bay chapels that honored me,/ works never used,/ with such hard state They lay down. ”
In an opinion article published in this newspaper last year, researcher António Aresta warned of this issue, saying that the resort needed to be rewritten. "Luís de Camões deserves this care, 500 years later," he said.
The first two excerpts contained in the stone pedestal in the cave of Camões were still able to read. They concern the stanza 95 of singing VI and the resort 42 of singing VIII.
The garden of Luis de Camões, one of the oldest in Macao, was created in the mid -eighteenth century. In the cave, consisting of three large faceted rocks, there is then the bust of Camões, by sculptor Manuel Maria Bordalo Pinheiro.
It is said that in the mid-16th century, Camões (1524-1580) lived in Macao for two years, where he will have finished, in the cave that has its name today, the work "The Lusíadas". “With the sponsorship of 600 francs from a rich Portuguese merchant from Macao, Lourenço Marques, son-in-law of Manuel Pereira, the cave was renewed in 1849, and there was a bust of the poet. It was also erected a pavilion over the cave, which no longer exists.

Many of these cases were filed
 
Since June 27, the beginning of the period of prohibition of the election campaign, the Commission of Electoral Affairs of the Legislative Assembly (Caeal) received 18 complaints or cases forwarded by the law enforcement authorities, involving irregular campaign, suspected irregular propaganda or defamation, the president of Caeal said yesterday.
According to Seng Ioi Man, after analyzed by the commission, many of these cases were filed, since the acts did not concern the election campaign. As for cases with “some evidence”, Caeal has already submitted them to the law enforcement authorities for follow -up. Asked what are the candidate lists involved in these complaints, Seng Ioi Man replied that, as some cases are still being treated, the commission cannot disclose these details. In addition, the cases received have not yet reached the referral phase to the prosecutor.
The judge added that the candidate teams had to deliver the candidate lists and political programs by June 26, but according to some complaints or opinions, on June 27, some internet publications implied news about that process. After the analysis, Caeal considered that their news is objective and do not imply electoral campaign.
In addition, in some sites, daily candidates have been reported, content that is also not related to electoral propaganda. Therefore, the commission decided to file such cases or opinions.
On the other hand, Seng Ioi Man warned that campaign actions using “influencers” or online platforms, as they imply advertising with commercial content, are also prohibited in the current phase. The judge stressed that both Caeal and the law enforcement authorities have specific personnel to be aware of irregular campaign situations on the Internet. If they detect gender situations, they will treat them seriously, he stressed.
For the president of Caeal, although there are some complaints in the context of campaign prohibition, the situation in general remains "optimistic". According to most candidate lists and the general public have respected CAEAL and acted appeals according to the law, which reflects the “continuous increase in public consciousness to comply with the law and integrity”. "Caeal and the law enforcement authorities will closely monitor the situation, to ensure that the atmosphere of elections and the situation of compliance with the rules will be maintained," he said.
Seng Ioi Man also stated that the lists should take advantage of the time to make preparations, in order to get, during the 14 -day campaign period, to publicize the political programs and the ideas to serve Macau, and to gain voter support votes, through fair competition, their political program, ideas and skills.
Asked about an eventual “weak desire to vote”, Seng Ioi Man stressed that “Caeal has never seen such a situation”, noting that the commission “will, on the one hand, according to legal provisions, create the best conditions, so that the candidate lists can, in a very good environment, transmit well their political programs, candidacy ideas, and outbreaks to serve society, and, on the other hand, to assure the voters, on the other hand, to serve the voters well that absorb, the best possible, the concepts and ideas of the candidate lists. ”
 
Mechanism capable of dealing with incitement abroad
In addition, ensuring the continuous inspection of the conduct of publicly inciting not vote, vote blank or null, the president of Caeal said that so far no serious situations have been detected outside Macao. The official emphasized that the mechanism of police and judicial cooperation between local law enforcement authorities and abroad authorities has worked effectively in combating crimes, so it will also be able to deal with the above situations.
However, on the morning of August 30, Caeal will again hold, at Tap Seac Square, the “Electoral Campaign Beginning Day”, an activity that did not happen in the 2021 elections due to the pandemic.
In addition, the commission will accelerate the preparation of scheduled work for the campaign period. According to it, street campaign panels will be placed in 25 locations on the peninsula, mud and coloane, two more locations than in previous elections. On the other hand, some places already used in the last elections will be optimized, with the panels to be placed in wider spaces or with greater flow of people.
At the same time, the number of 18 places for electoral propaganda activities will be maintained, with the time of use for each list decided according to a draw. Alongside this, Caeal has already suggested to the Chief Executive the times for the campaign activities of the Lists on TDM television and radio channels in Chinese and Portuguese Language, which will also be decided through a draw.
On the other hand, each list may request a maximum of eight sound advertising motor vehicles.
With regard to voting newsletters, he noted, the space among the blue squares of each list was even wider, in order to allow voters to vote more clearly, reducing the possibility of null votes.
In addition, Seng Ioi Man believes that Chikungunya fever will not have a major impact on the vote, stiving that the commission has attributed high importance the preparations for voting assemblies and will continue to pay attention to the evolution of this disease.</description><pubDate>2025-07-30 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Macau and Zhuhai reinforce control over chikungunya fever cases</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/macau-zhuhai-reforcam-controlo-sobre-casos-de-febre-chikungunya/</link><description>Following a notification from the interior of China of three cases of chikungunya fever in people living and working between Macau and Guangdong, health services and Zhuhai authorities gathered to reinforce control of such situations. Discussed “the way border posts can collaborate with prevention and control work in general”, as well as the definition of risk zones
 
Macao and Zhuhai authorities gathered due to the increase in cases of chikungunya fever, with a view to reinforcing disease prevention and control. This is because the number of cases has been increasing in neighboring regions. In Macao, five imported cases of chikungunya fever have already been reported. In addition, Health Services (SSM) were notified by the Guangdong Province Health Department on the occurrence of three confirmed cases of the disease related to “Macao activity itineraries”.
After investigation, it was concluded that "three bearers are workers of the workshops in zone A of the new landfills", which "work and often live between Guangdong and Macao, so the possibility of spread within the works of works is not excluded." The authorities on both sides discussed, in particular, “the way in which border posts can collaborate with prevention and general control work”, taking into account the frequent circulation between residents of the two regions.
In a statement, the SSM stressed that a “narrow connection” was established with the interior of China, a joint prevention and control mechanism, the immediate communication of cases related to transionic activities, the definition of risk zones in accordance with a place where cases are and the time of permanence in Macao. In addition, according to risk assessment, prevention and response work will be developed.
In addition to Macao, authorities say they are closely monitoring Chikungunya's epidemiological situation in neighboring regions to implement appropriate prevention and control measures.
As for the three cases notified in the interior of China, they have expressed symptoms in recent days. According to the SSM, during the incubation period and after the presentation of the symptoms, the sick had itineraries of activities in Macao, and “these overlapping itineraries were only limited, mainly, to zone A works yards”.
On Monday, under the coordination of the Directorate of Public Works Services (DSOP), the SSM sent personnel to the shipyards to proceed with the face-to-face inquiry and the dissemination of information. At the site, proactive research of suspicious cases and blood harvest for analysis was done. "After the laboratory analysis of the three blood samples collected, chikungunya fever infection was excluded."
Also, an inspection was carried out on the sources of mosquito proliferation (stagnant waters) in the workshops of works, "having been immediately removed some sources of mosquito proliferation." DSOP also exhorted those responsible for the establishments to reinforce, as soon as possible, the management of mosquito proliferation vectors and the elimination of mosquitoes. Yesterday and Monday, the SSM proceeded to the “urgent elimination” of mosquitoes in those shipyards.
 
Fifth Imported Case is a 70 -year -old woman
As for the fifth case imported from Chikungunya registered in Macao this year, it concerns a 70 -year -old resident, retired woman who lives on South Basin Street. According to SSM, from July 14 to 18, the patient was alone from Macau to the village of Shunde district of Foshan city to visit family members.
After returning to the territory, he expressed joint pain in the right lower limb, having taken medicines on his own initiative. At this point, the medical appointment did not use. Days later, rashes were detected in the right knee and arms. It was then that he resorted to the Emergency Service of the Conde de São Januário Hospital Center (CHCSJ) for medical treatment.
After analysis of the blood sample made by the public health laboratory, the presence of the chikungunya virus, with positive result. Currently, the patient is in a stable state and is admitted to the CHCSJ for medical treatment, SSM said.
The body has indicated that it will send personnel to proceed to the preventive elimination of mosquitoes at the home of this resident and near the main places of activity.
SSM recall residents that chikungunya fever is transmitted mainly through Aedes albopictus mosquito bites, who prefer to reproduce in small amounts of stagnant water. "All residents should reinforce the elimination of stagnant waters in households and workplaces," they said.

As part of the Macao International Art Biennial Program, Sands China presented the exhibition “Dopamine: Source of Happiness” in Venetian and “Collateral Exhibition” “Beyond the Frame: International Contemporary Works” at Four Seasons Sands Gallery. Patents until October 15, and curated by “Articross”, the two shows brought together nine international artists, including Macaense Bibi Lei and Brazilian American Jonni Cheatwood.
“Dopamine” involved nine international contemporary artists, namely Bibi Lei, Cheatwood, the duo Craig and Karl, Grafflex, Hei Lok, Ilya Milstein, Jun Oson and Song Zhou. All combined elements of Roman mythology with “art of dopamine”, to reinterpret iconic characters from Sesame Street. For “Beyond the Frame”, Bibi Law, Cheatwood, Song, Jun, Grafflex, and Milstein resorted to paintings, sculptures and art and multimedia facilities, to produce more than 60 works, through which they sought to establish “new artistic boundaries,” according to a Sands statement.
Bibi Lei, Macaense, is an emerging artist who has attracted international attention "for his capricious and vividly colorful style of painting." His artistic view was shaped by his childhood and the time he spent in Portugal with his grandmother, with whom he learned to paint ceramics. Jonni Cheatwood, an artist with Brazilian and American descent, is known for merging "abstraction and figuration, personal narratives and textile experimentation."
To the Jornal Tribuna de Macao, Bibi Lei spoke about his process, explaining that "it doesn't think much, it's all very intuitive." Flighting Claude Monet traces with neopop colors, the artist guarantees that she doesn't start with drafts. "I just feel the colors and the rhythm and use my fingers and my hands." Conventionally, painters mix the colors before using them on the screen. Bibi Law uses “as they are” colors, mixing them on the screen itself.
The artist also confessed to not having accompanied Sesame Street during her childhood, having only watched the popular television program very few times. However, for this project, Bibi Lei investigated the Universe of puppets and discovered Abby, a character who considered it very similar to his "brave girl," a recurring figure in the paintings he makes. Collaboration with Sesame Street also coincided with the creation of his latest character, “Bibifa”, daughter of Mazu, a mythological deity from Macao, both patent in the exhibitions.
Conversely, Jonni Cheatwood acknowledged that it was "the kid who grew up with Sesame Street as a caregiver." "My parents were always very busy. It's a large part of my childhood and it's also a very universal program. I feel that we have no borders. We all know sesame street in one form of another." For the project, the artist chose Grover, one of the oldest characters in Sesame Street, and Mercury, mythological messenger of the Roman gods. “I saw a parallel between Mercury, as a physical messenger, and Grover, as a messenger between his emotions, different personas and personalities,” he explained.
Cheatwood also attributes part of his inspiration to his Brazilian roots: "My mother is from Rio [de Janeiro], so I grew up with that culture and with those saturated colors and music. They are a large part of my life. I think that, as I work with those large guys and colorful shapes, it's very Brazilian."
Bibi Lei also recalled the short time she lived in Portugal, with her grandmother, saying that Portuguese architecture and colors, such as “green, red and turquoise”, greatly influence her art. He highlighted the iconic ruins of São Paulo and the headlight of the guide that he considers to have come out of a "fairy tale". However, despite being Macaense, the last time he was on his homeland was seven years ago, he lamented.
About the particularity of displaying the pieces in Macau, Cheatwood highlighted the fact that the city was both "new and glamorous" and "old and historical". "It's like a city sewn with various parts. Like my works." “It's a charismatic and cinematic site,” he noted.
In a message for younger artists, Cheatwood encouraged them to “keep strange and curious. They do not need to suppress the artist. If they want to create, do so. Explore it, express themselves. The most important thing is to remain strange and true to your own taste. Trust your intuition, your taste and do the job.”
In the same vein, Bibi Lei expects young artists to "keep the inner child, that pure innocence," installing them to "be brave and telling their stories to the world." Similarly, the artist hopes that the public who visits the exhibition "feel happy and be brave for your own life."
Today, Sands will organize two sessions of “Art Talk”, between 15:30 and 18h00, to “deepen the exchange and connection of the artists and the artistic and cultural community of Macau”. Guest artists will share “their creative travel and transcultural artistic practices,” says the statement.</description><pubDate>2025-07-30 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Firefighters made simulacrum in the east line tunnel of the metro</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/bombeiros-fizeram-simulacro-em-tunel-da-linha-leste-metro/</link><description>The Fire Department (CB) made Monday a firefighting simulacrum in the tunnel using tunnel between ES3 and ES4 segment of the northern segment of the Light Line of Zone A of the new landfills, together with the direction of public works, services for labor affairs, public security police, the work companies and the supervision companies, to improve capacity, to improve the capacity response and communication and coordination mechanisms in the occurrence of unforeseen incidents.

At 1Vers, which made their debut in mid -July, Hyuk and Seok are the only Korean members. Nathan, an American with lacean and Thai roots, Kenny, from the US and Chinese descent, and Japan, complete a group of young people from 20 to 25 that promotes universality as a strong point.
Several North Korean deserter testimonies indicate that since 2020 North Korea has intensified severe punishments and even performed public executions simply by the convicts having watched soap operas and South Korean music.
For Hyuk and Seok, the debate transcends the music. Their songs can represent both hope and danger to those who dare to hear them within the most secret regime in the world.
“If our music is successful and someone I know to listen to, I think it would be a good thing,” says Seok, who, behind his kind and contained personality, used to train 11 hours a day to become a professional soccer or table tennis player.
"Personally, I hope you don't listen (our music). It's dangerous. I wouldn't want to endanger anyone," Hyuk said.
According to Hyuk, access to music was minimal in his social circle. "Although there were devices with South Korean content, many people rejected us due to the risk of punishment," he said, explaining that his true contact with K-pop only happened when he arrived in South Korea.
On the other hand, Seok listened to some South Korean ballads in childhood and only 'plunged' completely at K-Pop when she was recruited by Singing Beetle, the band's agency.
Despite being young, the band 1Verse already has almost one million followers at Tiktok. The remaining members have personal accounts on different platforms, unlike Seok and Hyuk, who shared few details about their private lives due to security issues.
Hyuk, considered the most active on the group's social networks, did not create a personal Instagram account. "I am concerned not only with usual criticism, but also with the negative comments for being North Korean," Hyuk explained, who was the first member recruited by the agency while working in a factory.
The group's first album is “The 1st Verse”, a two -song track. One of them, "Shattered", presents a chorus where the phrase "We Can Never Go Back" is constantly repeated, making it inevitable to think that it is linked to its stories. Hyuk admits that the sentence can be interpreted in different ways, including the impossibility of returning to a place or region.
The difference between its past lives and the present is evident. "In South Korea, I can make three meals a day," Hyuk said. It already confesses that when I lived in North Korea, I longed to know foreigners, something they can do in the South. They both agreed that access to information makes a big difference.
Hyuk and Seok found a new family in 1Verse. Despite their mixed tongues - they call “Kongish” - and the makeshift gestural language, there is a place where barriers disappear among the band members: the table.
“When we eat together, we don't even talk much. We have only one telepathic bond,” says Nathan.
The group has shown interest in digressing Latin America and Spain, recognizing that many of the fans are from these regions. Nathan even revealed that he has a Mexican uncle, with whom he played on the lottery and ate 'tamales' during the summer.
With members of such different origins, the difference in perspectives between Hyuk and Seok about whether their songs should be released in North Korea was not perceived as a conflict, but as a demonstration of their individuality. Instead of dividing them, he reflected that today they live in a reality where it is possible to disagree and sing without fear.
