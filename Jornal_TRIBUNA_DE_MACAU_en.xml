The thunder signal was also in force for almost nine hours. Several Macao zones recorded rainfall with values above 100 millimeters of precipitation. In Hong Kong, the rain was even stronger

At 08:18 am yesterday, the black sign of heavy rain was first lined this year in Macao, having been in force for more than an hour, with several areas of the territory to record more than 100 millimeters of precipitation. It was also the second day of the year when the thunderstorm signal for longer, for eight hours and 55 minutes, between 4:20 am and 1:15 pm. On July 10, the signal was in effect from 09h10 to 19:35, totaling 10 hours and 25 minutes.
According to data from Meteorological and Geophysical Services (SMG), the entire Macau Peninsula recorded precipitation values above 100mm, with the Dr Sun Yat Municipal Park area without registering 121.8mm. The second most affected zone by the rain was the village of Coloane, which recorded 119.2mm of precipitation. The fortress of the Monte and the black sand registered 117.2mm and 112mm of rain, respectively. The bar (105.2mm), Ká-Hó (105mm) and the outdoor port (101.6mm) were the other places to exceed the 100mm mark.
Secondary school classes were suspended in the morning and primary kindergarten was suspended throughout the day. The black signal is the highest of the three levels of the stormy alert system. With the signal in force, outdoor activities are suspended and the population should shelter and avoid slopes, watercourses and underground areas.
The SMG warned at the end of last week that, given the accumulated high precipitation in the Rio das Pearl estuary zone, the likelihood of torrential rainfall, with more than 100mm of precipitation, was "high". An air stream from the southwest will have transported “a large amount of hot, humid and unstable air to the Guangdong coast”, creating “adequate water vapor conditions for heavy rain,” according to authorities.
"Due to the instability of atmospheric conditions, it is necessary to pay attention to the possibility of occurrence of convective phenomena, and associated risks, such as frequent lightning, hail, strong gusts, among others," warn the SMG. The services also explained that "torrential rains are very random and, considering the small area of Macao, it is quite difficult to accurately predict the time, place and intensity of precipitation."
Macao's weather services predict that time remains unstable at the beginning of today, with frequent, sometimes intense and thunderstorm. The body appeals to the population to “pay attention to weather information and warnings, adjust their travel properly and pay attention to the possibility of flooding in low zones during heavy rain in a short time”.
In Hong Kong, local authorities issued the maximum alert at 5:50 am yesterday and installed the population looking for a refuge, while the neighboring region was affected by intense rainfall. The Raehk Meteorological Observatory recorded rainfall with 355.7mm of precipitation, the highest value since August 1884.
According to the Hong Kong press, several floods were recorded that affected public transport, with school classes and public services being suspended. It was the third time that the black signal was issued in Raehk since July 29.</description><pubDate>2025-08-06 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Caeal has already attributed voting places to voters</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/caeal-ja-atribuiu-locais-de-votacao-aos-eleitores/</link><description>The chairman of the Commission of Electoral Affairs of the Legislative Assembly said yesterday that the voting places have already been attributed to voters according to the addresses registered until May 31, under the principle of approximation. Voting warnings will begin to be sent to voters by mail between mid and late this month
 
The Commission of Electoral Affairs of the Legislative Assembly (Caeal) has already attributed the voting places to voters, following the principle of approximation as possible to the addresses declared until May 31 this year, SEG IOI Man, president of the body yesterday told. However, voting warnings will begin to be sent by mail between the mid and final of this month.
The voting notice includes the name of each voter and the data on the attributed voting assembly. The updating of the electoral census made after that date is not considered in the present elections.
According to Seng Ioi Man, since yesterday, voters can already consult the voting assembly attributed through various means, including the single account, the Electronic Elections page, the Open line of Caeal, as well as the self-service kiosks in 50 Macao, Hengqin, Canton, Zhuhai, Zhongshan and Jiangmen.
In addition, the official indicated that this time will be installed two replicas of the Vote Assembly: one in the TAP Seac multipurpose pavilion and the other at the Macao Forum, one more than in the 2021 elections. The period of operation of the replicas will be extended from five to seven days, including Saturday and Sunday.
"We hope that the public, through the visit to the replica of the voting Assembly, can know more about the functioning of the Assembly (…), how it can vote correctly and also about the confidentiality of the vote," explained Seng Ioi Man.
Caeal continued the organization of visits and the simulation of voting for students through the Directorate of Education and Youth Development Services, in order to deepen the younger's knowledge of elections and the voting process, to develop their civic consciousness and prepare them to fulfill the civic duty, after census. According to it, the electoral census service on the replicas of the voting assembly will be available so that young people who meet the requirements make due electoral census to vote in the next elections.
Replicas will be equipped with more interactive resources to deepen the public's knowledge about the operation of the voting meeting.
In this regard, the president of Caeal maintained that the installation of replicas of the voting assembly is a “very good electoral tradition” because it allows voters to familiarize themselves with the voting process. In your opinion, this step also plays a role of civic education.
"Even though young people or citizens are still qualified to vote this time may feel this procedure. There are always new voters who have not voted earlier. And people who had voted before can also feel [the vote] again ... So we think it is well necessary to install replicas of the polling station," said the judge.

Asked about an information on the social networks that a school will have adjusted the date of the opening ceremony of the school year for the first day of the election campaign period and plans to invite candidates to deputies to attend this event to make electoral propaganda, Seng Ioi Man replied that the electoral law requires public services, including public schools, which comply with the duty of neutrality. Therefore, he stressed, these staff cannot campaign or practice activities to earn votes at the time or place of work.
Still, the judge pointed out that the law does not regulate situations of gender in private schools, and these educational establishments may develop electoral propaganda activities within the campaign period according to their own situation. But they will have to follow the requirements of the Electoral Law and the instructions of Caeal, he said.
According to said, if that activity takes place within the campaign period, "no prohibition will be provided for in law." "Caeal appeals to all schools that follow the principles of justice and impartiality and try to treat, as equally as possible, each candidate list," he said.
However, CAEAL will hold a draw this week for the purposes of distributing antenna time to reserve by TDM's television and radio stations and distribution of 18 places for the election campaign, as well as their order to use.</description><pubDate>2025-08-06 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Boss wants “excellent” paintings in the cooperation zone</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/chefe-quer-quadros-excelentes-na-zona-de-cooperacao/</link><description>Sam Hou Fai required the five government tutelage to select “excellent” and “experience” workers to be transferred to the cooperation zone.

In a statement, the Western Hemisphere Office of the US State Department states that, although the judge "has already been sanctioned by the US for human rights violations, it continues to use Brazilian institutions to silence opposition and threaten democracy."
It also considers that "imposing even more restrictions on Jair Bolsonaro's ability to publicly defend himself is not a public service." "Let Bolsonaro speak!", Reads in the note, in which the US "condemning the order of Moraes that imposed house arrest", promising to responsible "all those who collaborate or facilitate sanctioned conduct."
This statement came a few hours after the Supreme Court judge decreed house arrest for breach of precautionary measures imposed in the process of attempted coup d'état, and after the Federal Police had seized Jair Bolsonaro's mobile phone in a search operation. The former president remains at home with the obligation to use electronic bracelet, but precautionary measures have worsened, now being prevented from receiving visits to the residence, except lawyers and persons authorized by the STF.
It is also forbidden to use the mobile phone, or any other communication device, “directly or through third parties”, to communicate with foreign authorities and other defendants in the process of attempted coup. The breach of these measures warned the judge, will lead to decreed "immediate pre -trial detention".
Bolsonaro's defense stated that the former president did not incumbent with any precautionary measure and will appeal the house arrest decree.

On the occasion of the “World Breastfeeding Week” proposed by the World Alliance for Breastfeeding, the Director of Health Services (SSM), Alvis Lo, praised joint efforts in the field of breastfeeding. He noted, "thanks to the commitments of all sectors of society over the years, the work related to breastfeeding in Macao have obtained a remarkable result."

A reforma da Administração Pública, uma promessa do Governo para “elevar a eficiência e qualidade da governação”, foi alvo de críticas por parte de José Pereira Coutinho, que considera que está a ser perpetuada. The deputy recalls that the administrative reform proves to be "chronic" since "the beginnings of mashes". "Already in the 1999 political program of the first chief executive, Dr. Edmund Ho, diagnosed structuring problems," he pointed out in a written interpellation.
O actual Executivo, liderado por Sam Hou Fai, criou o Grupo de Liderança e o Grupo de Coordenação da Reforma da Administração Pública. But Coutinho seems to have doubts regarding the creation of the group, since 18 years ago a regulation was enacted that instituted the Advisory Board for the Reform of Public Administration, an organ with the mission of issuing opinions on administrative modernization, functional improvement, improving the quality of service and creating new administrative culture in the FASM - which was later revoked, “raising legitimate interrogations about the effective continuity of this purpose”.
Returning to Edmund Ho's political program, Coutinho recalls the existing problems, such as “impatience of residents in the face of administrative ineffectiveness”, “the urgent need to stabilize civil service”, “competently use these talents”, as well as “administrative inertia” and “bureaucratic incompetence”.
“This narrative has repeated itself insistently over successive mandates,” said Coutinho, noting that recently the government has announced its intention to review the public workers management regime and the general basis of the organic structure of public administration, diplomas with more than four decades.
Given the “cyclic persistence of diagnoses and promises without visible structural transformation, and under the applicable regimental provisions”, the deputy left a series of issues. First of all, he asked for a balance of administration reform so far, since the creation of the MSAR. In addition, he asked how the executive evaluates the effectiveness of administrative rationalization and simplification measures, modernization, the effective implementation of the electronic government.
On the other hand, he also questioned “what are the specific goals that the government intends to achieve with the reprogramming of the fundamental diplomas that regulate the organizational structure of public services, and what is the scheduled schedule for their short and medium term realization?”.</description><pubDate>2025-08-06 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Liga de Elite vai conhecer campeão na última jornada</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/liga-de-elite-vai-conhecer-campeao-na-ultima-jornada/</link><description>The last journey of the Macao Football Elite League will decide the title of champion, after Shao Jiang won the leader Must IPO, leaving only one point of the rival. The leader faces Ching Fung, while the second classified will face the University of Macao, in games that will not be at the same time, contrary to what would be expected to safeguard “transparency”
 
Victor Rebelo
 
Must IPO missed a good opportunity to resolve the title issue in its favor, when it faced the second classified Shao Jiang on the penultimate journey of the Elite League. Japanese-oriented training Yuki Matsuda was defeated 2-1 in the second round of the final phase of the championship, when he just needed to draw to secure first place.
Must Ipo, which had triumphed in the first round for the same result, could not hold or expand the four points that had a advantage over the rival and is now obliged to earn, or at least do the same result as Shao Jiang on the last journey.
The two games that will end the era of the 1st Division of the MSAR, and which should play today, have been resigned and pass from the field of the canhy to the stadium of Taipa. The first, Shao Jiang-University of Macao, is already tomorrow, at 20h00, while the second, Must Ipo-Ching Fung, will take place on August 10, at 18h00.
Despite these changes, the soccer association chose to mark the challenges for different times and days, although it is the title decision. In a logic of safeguarding integrity in sports, it was expected that the two meetings would occur on the same day and at the same time, in different fields, as usually happens in the world, in favor of “transparency” in the last round.
Must IPO will have to earn to maintain the point of advantage that it has at this time and guarantee the title. If Shao Jiang ties or losing, his rival knows he can get the same result to become champion.
 
Expulsion contributed to the turnaround
In the game played at the Taipa stadium, Must IPO scored first by Leung Chi Seng on 27 minutes, but the expulsion of William Maronesi six minutes later changed the course of events. Playing with 10 players, Matsuda's team began to give more priority to the defensive sector, being able to keep the result until the break.
In the second half, however, as predictable, there was ascendant of Shao Jiang, who tied at 64, in a great penalty converted by Colombian striker Jeim Botero Gomez, and moved to the head of the marker at 77, through the deputy Argentine midfielder Ilan Rapport, who had entered four minutes earlier.
With this result, Shao Jiang, who debuted this year in the Elite League, has gained a new breath in the race race, even though he continues not to depend on himself.
Vitor Almeida, Must IPO player, told the Jornal Tribuna de Macao that it was an "atypical" game. The central defense points out that the team "started well, when scoring the first goal, and then even expulsion controlled the game." Even with one more player, Shao Jiang "had no great opportunities, but when he made the draw unfortunately things changed because they gained confidence," he acknowledges.
The Portuguese footballer says that when Must Ipo consented 2-1, the team "was already very tired and was out of power." In the final minutes, “we still tried to draw, having one or another time for a set ball, but we couldn't,” he said.
Now “we leave everything for the last game and then we are obliged to win, to be champions,” he said.
On Shao Jiang's side, the coach stated that "the game had the intensity everyone expected, because we knew it was a final." Jesús Piñero Rincón says he believed that if the team fulfilled the established plan, until the last detail, would be successful. In addition to being an important game, “this classic is a battle for pride,” says the Spanish coach, born in Venezuela.
"We have shown that even from the II division we belong to the highest place of Macao football and this triumph is a" punch on the table ", with Shao Jiang saying present, leading the league decision to the last day," he said.
About the fact that the two final games were at different times, the coach liked it not to happen. "I preferred it to be at the same time, but it is not me who I have to change," he concluded.</description><pubDate>2025-08-06 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>RAE leaders want to “streamline” cooperation roads</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/lideres-das-rae-querem-dinamizar-vias-de-cooperacao/</link><description>The leaders of Macau and Hong Kong, Sam Hou Fai and John Lee, gathered yesterday to discuss the reinforcement of bilateral cooperation in several areas, including in the “synergistic development of tourism, the contribution to high quality development of the large bay and new opportunities” generated by the second phase of the deepened cooperation zone in Hengqin, among other topics, reveals a media note.

Last year, revenues rose 3.3% to over 13 billion, equivalent to twice the expenses, although they grew about 6%. In 2024, investment profits dropped 17% to about 6.2 billion, but the fund's net result increased by 5% to 6.5 billion

The Net Heritage Value of the Social Security Fund (FSS) was led by about 99.47 billion in the late 2024, translating an increase of 7% or 6.48 billion compared to 92.99 billion accounted for a year earlier, according to the body's latest annual report. The net situation exceeded 15.3 times the current expenses, which rose 5.8% to 6.74 billion last year, after retreating 54.3% between 2022 and 2023.
Given the values of 2024 and the current demographic panorama, the fund's net situation would allow almost 15 and a half years of expenses, including in an unrealistic scenario of absence of revenues in this time interval.
After announcing losses of 11.13 billion of patacas by 2022 and profits of 6.43 billion by 2023, the FSS ended last year's financial year with a positive net result of 6.48 billion, plus 4.9% annually. This growth derived part of the reinforcement of 3.3% of revenues to a total of 13.22 billion patacas.
According to the FSS, the rise in revenues was mainly due to the reduction of the worldwide impact of COVID-19 as well as the “ordered recovery of social and economic activities of Macao”, namely in the sectors of integrated tourism and leisure, which propelled the increase in regular government endowment. In addition, he stresses, "the global financial market had a generally favorable behavior," which translated into a "positive return", along with the rise in interest rate interest rates and the "alteration of the FSS investment strategy, which increased the proportion of timely deposits."
According to the report analyzed by the Jornal Tribuna de Macao, the total income of FSS investments ascended about 6.18 billion patacas over 2024, which, on the one hand, reflects an annual decrease of 16.7% compared to the profits of the previous year (7.42 billion) and, on the other, again contradicted the loss of 7.06 billion suffered by 2022. Based on the weight of term bank deposits and financial investments worldwide, the average investment income rate was 6.78%, 2.04 percentage points than in 2023.
In the previous five years, the global profit of investments totaled about 18.9 billion patacas, with an average annual return rate of 4.49%. By 2022, the return rate had been negative at 7.37%.
In 2024, the report points out, "the global financial market had a generally favorable behavior, thanks mainly to the maintenance of the positive growth of the economy, the moderate fall of inflation, the reduction of interest rates by major central banks and the" boom "of artificial intelligence, among other favorable factors." In this context, the portfolio of international actions and obligations of the FSS obtained positive income, especially the “performance of the market”.
Nonetheless, the document shows that the income of global financial investments dropped 29.3% to 3.82 billion patacas compared to 2023, with an effective rate of 10.16% (less 4.33 percentage points). On the other hand, net income resulting from time deposits increased by 17.4% to 2.36 billion in annual variation, corresponding to an effective rate of 4.42% (plus 0.11 percentage points).
In general, the FSS has again bet on a “prudent and firm investment strategy”. On December 31, 2024, the total investment assets were heading at 96.87 billion patacas (another 6.8%), including 55.52 billion in term bank deposits (plus 4.6%in annual terms) and 41.35 billion in international financial investments (plus 9.9%).
On the same date, cash and bank deposits (55.54 billion) equivalent to 55.8% of the fund's assets (99.53 billion) and financial assets (41.35 billion) had a weight of 41.5%. The fixed and intangible assets (36.05 million) accounted for 0.04% of the total, including FSS property located at Eduardo Marques Street, the equipment and software necessary for its operation, and the works of service remodeling.
In turn, current passives increased 6.1% to 56.68 million, involving essentially amounts due to suppliers and benefits and subsidies to pay.
 
More than 4.6 billion in government appropriations
Government appropriations - the contribution of the game and the reimbursements of 1% and 3% of the central budget execution balance - rose to 6.18 billion patacas (over 33.5%), or 46.8% of total revenues. In addition to investment, interest and dividend (6.28 billion) income, which constituted 47.5%of total revenue, the FSS also received 379.51 million (less 0.5%) in contributions to the Social Security regime and 362.92 million (plus 10.4%) of non -resident workers' hiring rate.
The amount of contributions paid to the FSS integrated 309.62 million of the compulsory regime (less 0.7%) and 69.88 million of the optional regime (plus 0.5%). The mandatory regime was thus responsible for 81.6% of contributions.
In the chapter of expenses, the fund associates the annual increase of about 372.21 million with the growth of spending on the installments of the social security regime and the currency losses resulting from the devaluation of Renminbi compared to Pataca. On the other hand, the FSS states that "the risk of risk of financial assets and the various accounts to be received, and a value of 22.74 million patacas for provisions for impairment and provisions for dubious collection credits was determined."
The installments of the Social Security regime and social allowances implied expenses of 6.28 billion (plus 4.4%), representing 93.1% of the total. Expenses with FSS personnel (181.57 million) rose 5.1%, while financial and other administrative expenses - mainly intended for the payment of service consultants, depositaries and investment managers - grew 2.6% to 129.56 million.
During last year, 351,862 beneficiaries made the payment of contributions, illustrating an annual decrease of 1.5% or 5,325 people. The universe of beneficiaries encompassed 283,978 of the mandatory regime (80.7% total) and 67,884 of the optional regime.
In 2024, 8,968 new beneficiaries were registered (less 1,208 or 11.9%). In the mandatory regime, the new beneficiaries registered (7,556) descended 15.2%, but at the optional (1,412) increased 11.2%.
 
Pension beneficiaries rose 5% to almost 167 thousand
The universe of pension beneficiaries grew 5.3% (plus 8,376 individuals) to 166,895 between 2023 and 2024, indicates the annual report of the Social Security Fund. The number includes 153,923 pension beneficiaries for the elderly (plus 4.7%), representing 92.2%of the total, and 12,972 of the disability pension (plus 13.1%). Already the beneficiaries of subsidies fell 81.8%, from 80.262 to 14,640. By 2024, the fund paid 5.17 billion patacas in pensions for the elderly (plus 4.4%) and 572.10 million in disability pensions (plus 12.6%), in addition to 468.89 million for extraordinary pension (plus 5.8%). The different subsidies required a total expense of 69.75 million (less 39%). Throughout the year, the FSS filed 13,058 requests for the various pensions, which marks a homologous break of 14.8%. The requests for the anticipation of the pension for the elderly of the Old Regime dropped 20.1% to 7,800. The body also accounted for 15,143 subsidy requirements, less 83.1% than in 2023, especially the birth allowance (4,832 cases).</description><pubDate>2025-08-05 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Slaughter and animal adoptions decreased 30% by June</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/abates-adopcoes-de-animais-diminuiram-30-ate-junho/</link><description>According to data from the Institute for Municipal Affairs, in the first half of the year 213 animals were slaughtered, less 30% than in the same period last year.

It is in his workshop in Tasi Tolu, Dili, that Joaquim Surumali preserves the cultural heritage of Timor-Leste by replicating in jewelry, for daily use, pieces used in sacred houses and in traditional ceremonies and dances.
In his hands, the "kaebauk", an ornament with buffalo horns, which represents the sun, strength, safety, protection and power, traditionally used in the head and on the roofs of sacred houses, gains the form of earrings and pending to be used in a necklace.
Already the “Belak”, a bronze disc that symbolizes the moon and is used to the chest and inside the sacred houses, can also be bought in earrings.
In Joaquim Sumali's workshop, neither does necklaces, called “Morten”, are normally listed with the orange color, which bring luck and prosperity and push the evil spirits and negative energies.
“I want to do this work. My father also worked with jewelry, shaped Belak and Kaebauk since the time of the Portuguese, and so far my brothers and sisters sometimes still make jewelry like Kaebauk and Belak in Dili,” Lusa Joaquim Surumali told Lusa.
The 34 -year -old jeweler stressed that his art is a family tradition, which continues to this day. “I learned to make jewelry with my father and my brothers. But our work comes from our own blood, from our father and the elders who also made jewelry like the ones they do today,” explained Joaquim Surumali.
Joaquim Surumali makes the jewelry in gold, silver or bronze, depending on the preference and money of customers.
The material, according to the jeweler, is bought in Timor-Leste, but most come from Indonesia or Singapore, because resources in the country are scarce.
"As people buy in gold to put in holy houses, it is no longer available. So we try to buy abroad. Most of the time, customers are the ones who bring gold and we only charge for our labor," said the jeweler.
Asked about jewelry prices, the craftsman explained that a pure gold "Belak" can cost $ 600 and a $ 100 "death".
"Many Timorenses buy these jewelry, but also many Portuguese, especially teachers," he said. Joaquim explained that the Portuguese appreciate these pieces because they see in them something unique and traditional of Timor-Leste.
The Timorenses buy them to put them in the sacred houses of families and can be seen in all municipalities of the country. The most bought articles are, above all, the “Belak” of gold.
About the monthly yield income, Joaquim Surumali said it can reach the monthly $ 500, but it depends on the number of customers and visits.
