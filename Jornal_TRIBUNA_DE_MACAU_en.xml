António Viseu also told the Jornal Tribuna de Macao that the rainy season, which usually occurs between April and September, can cause very intense precipitation periods this year. The Association recently participated in a seminar in Portugal, during which it became aware of the most advanced international experiences, “which will be brought to the Great Bay area as a model”

Despite all the means currently within the reach of meteorology, a science that focuses on the study of atmospheric processes and the weather forecast, it is difficult to predict situations such as those that happened last March in Macao. The atypical period, with sudden climbs and descents, uncommon at this time of year, may have been caused by the “polar ripple”, he told the Jornal Tribuna de Macao, António Viseu.
The president of the Macao Meteorological Society and ancient subdirector of Meteorological and Geophysical Services (SMG) said that what happened in the territory, especially in the second half of March, was a “natural phenomenon, the so -called polar wave at the North Pole”.
He gave the example of a top: "When it turns and is almost falling it causes a larger area, which in meteorology is the cold wave that sometimes hits the Asian continent and southern California." And "it is this influence that makes people feel cold and then heat."
According to António Viseu, they are nature phenomena that cannot be predicted, constituting cycles that advance or retreat. “When they advance, they feel cold when they retreat, they feel hot,” he explains.
The official, who has been for over 12 years in SMG emphasizes that "usually this happens for a week." In addition, he points out, "rain can cause the atmosphere, the surface of the globe, get more wet and, when it is more humid, the sensation of the cold is much larger, with a few degrees Celsius, a situation caused by such a deviation of that polar ripple."
António Viseu notes that "this is normally reflected on the continents, an extensive area where cold air mass can be cluster, because in the sea no one feels, there is no one at sea."
Asked if, in the future, this rapid difference of temperatures at unusual heights, as happened in March, may happen more often, the meteorologist argues that "this is random, it cannot be said to happen again or when." About Asia is more prone to this type of climate change, António Viseu says that the "globe is whole and, therefore, when here it appears, also happens in other areas".
It is recalled that in the last days of March, SMG issued a statement stating that a cold front hit the southern Chinese coast and originated a significant descent of temperatures in Macao. Under persistently clouded and rainy atmospheric conditions, which favored the intensification of cold air, the minimum temperature of approximately 10ºC to March 31 was recorded, and according to the body, “the temperature felt was below the actual temperature due to the water cooling factor or 'Wind-Chill' (in the English word), which combined with low temperatures, transmits a cold thermal sensation to the body. bigger".
According to records of the Taipa Grande weather station since 1952, temperatures below 10 ° C between late March and early April are rare. However, there is a record, with lower values, that is, at a minimum temperature of 9.8ºC in April 1969.
 
Seismos unresolved to climate change
Regarding global climate change, António Viseu notes that, according to the most recent report of the worldwide meteorological organization, the last decade (2015-2024) has been the hottest since there are records, and 2024 has been considered the hottest year since the beginning of systematic records in 1850.
Regarding a possible influence of climate change on the occurrence of earthquakes, the official states that “current scientific investigation has not yet found any direct relationship”, noting that, according to USGS (United States) and China's seismological service, an average of about 130 magnitude 6.0 or higher, about 12-14 of level 7.0 or higher, and about 1-2 magnitude 8.0 or above a year. "This year's seismic activity remains within normal frequency," he adds.
However, for Olavo Rasquinho, former director of the SMG, "there are studies that relate the defrost of polar hubcaps to the phenomenon designated by isostatic readjustment, or isostatic elevation." The phenomenon consists of the fact that the terrestrial crust, “disagreeing with the weight of large masses of ice, tends to rise, which may influence the movement of tectonic plates in the regions where the defrost or neighboring regions occurs,” he explains.
In principle, it asserts Olavo Rasquinho, "earthquakes in regions far from this phenomenon will not be related to the defrost, and therefore to climate change."
At a time when Macau prepares to face the rainy season, which usually runs between April and September, António Viseu confirms the information already made available on the SMG website that it is predictable that precipitation be intense, or even extreme during this year. “We will have heavy rains, but restricted to that period,” he says.
 
World experiences for the great bay
The Macao Meteorological Society, a non -profit organization, according to its statutes, aims to strengthen the knowledge of MSAR residents of disasters meteorology and prevention, science dissemination and academic research and promote interchange and cooperation with local and foreign weather entities. The association was officially registered on May 16, 2018, a year after the largest typhoon who plagued Macau, the hat.
The most frequent activities are the weather lectures in collaboration with the Science Center.
In the exchange area, he recently participated in Vila Real, Portugal, in a symposium promoted by the Portuguese Association of Meteorology and Geophysics where he presented work on the evolution of typhoon signs from 1861 to today.
The debate, entitled “The Role of Energy in the Meteorological and Geophysical Sciences” brought together dozens of experts and academics from Portugal, Spain, Germany, Cape Verde, Angola and Macao, discussing important issues such as climate change, energy transition and disasters' prevention.
The vice president of the Macao Meteorological Society, Tang Chi Kit, presented in Portuguese a work entitled “The Evolution of Tropical Cyclones in Macao since 1862”, systematizing the development of the Tuphin Alert System in Macao since the mid-nineteenth century. "Communication aroused wide interest among the specialists present, with the president of the Portuguese Society of Meteorology and Geophysics to praise especially the historical value and practice of Macao's Typhoon Sign System, used for over a century," a note from society.
At the seminar, Tang Chi Kit stated that this participation in the conference fully took advantage of Macau's unique advantages as “a center, a platform”, highlighting the role of the territory “as a bridge in the exchange of meteorological technology between China and Portuguese -speaking countries”.
With the participation in the meetings beyond borders, the Macao Meteorological Society ensures that "advanced international experiences will be brought to the area of ​​the great bay as a model."
Society promises to continue to “maintain a spirit of openness and collaboration, striving to promote the research and application of the weather sciences, improve the meteorological knowledge of the population and strengthen academic exchange and cooperation between masters and other regions, contributing to sustainable development and global efforts to respond to climate change and reduction of disasters”, he concludes.</description><pubDate>2025-04-09 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>DSEDJ plans “Dynamic School” to encourage sport</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/dsedj-planeia-escola-dinamica-para-incentivar-desporto/</link><description>The Directorate of Youth Education and Development Services plans to launch the “Dynamic School Program”, with a view to supporting teaching establishments in creating better conditions to increase interest in sports.

Sports in Macau schools deserved special attention at the first ordinary meeting of the Education Council, which with the presence of the Secretary for Social Affairs and Culture, Lam. During the session, the director of Youth Education and Development Services (DSEDJ), Kong Chi Meng, said that the launch of the “Dynamic School Program” is planned to support the schools in the creation of the students to increase students' interest in the creation of students Sport, “cultivating good habits of regular sports”.
At the same time, it was suggested that investment in sports resources be properly reinforced, in order to promote the coordinated physical and psychological development of young people through sports, cultivate a positive perspective of life and raise the level of local sports competitiveness.
In addition, at the same meeting, DSEDJ representatives reported that, for the creation and operation of schools for the students of the hengqin cooperation zone, it is necessary to review the laws on the general staff of teaching staff and the statutes of private schools of non -higher education. This is so that "they can be treated more consistently with the private schools of the local school of Macao in legal terms."
On the other hand, DSEDJ has asserted that it will be continued to optimize the education system and increase pedagogical quality, “in order to promote interdisciplinary collaboration and curriculum integration, closely monitor the needs of the current era and form excellent qualified frames that are equipped with an international view and innovative abilities”.
However, some vowels of the body have been concerned about the way Macau may attract more international qualified paintings of high quality, suggesting the reinforcement of international exchanges between teachers and students and deepening the connection with the large bay.
On the other hand, this year is the 80th anniversary of the victory of the Chinese people in the war against Japan and the world victory against fascism, so the DSEDJ will launch a series of commemorative activities and organize visits and exchanges, "in order to deepen knowledge about historical facts."</description><pubDate>2025-04-09 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>CREDIT WINNED ON BANKS BATH NEW RECORD</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/credito-vencido-nos-bancos-bate-novo-recorde/</link><description>Banparated bank credit increased again in February, albeit less significantly than in previous months, reaching a new record, with 57.62 billion patacas on loans with delays of over 90 days. On the other hand, the expired credit ratio retreated slightly to 5.6%
 
Macao's bank sector ended February with a total of 57.62 billion patacas in loans with over 90 days late. Although only 0.07% or 41.8 million has grown in one month, thus slowing over sequential variations in January (+4.4%) and December (+2.2%), the amount of “non -productive” or overdue (NPL) credit rose 28.5% or 12.79 billion in annual terms and has become the highest since the monetary authority (AMCM) (AMCM). It began publication of these statistics in 1990.
According to official data analyzed by the Jornal Tribuna de Macao, the Malparado credit has increased almost 21 times, or 54.85 billion compared to the 2.77 billion accounted for in late 2019. In the last 24 months, NPL only fell in November 2024, and only 0.1%.
Still, the expired credit ratio descended from 5.7% in January to 5.6% in February, although it risen 1.5 percentage points in the interval of one year and 5.3 points for the end of 2019. The global delayed amount includes 35.62 billion not resident clients (61.8% of the total) and 22 billion residents, which corresponds to ratios of 6.9% and 4.3%, respectively.
Official statistics also show that internal loans to the private sector reached about 513 billion in February, illustrating decreases of 0.2% and 4.1% in monthly and annual terms, respectively. Already credit abroad (519.10 billion) increased 4.0% in a month, but decreased 4.9% compared to February 2024.
Generally speaking, the credit granted to the private sector advanced 1.9% to 1,032.1 billion patacas between January and February. Hong Kong dollar loans maintained a dominant weight (43.4%), right ahead of Pataca (21.8%), US dollar (20.2%) and Renminbi (11.4%).
On the other hand, public sector deposits in local banks ciphed by 211.24 billion, signaling a monthly decrease of 0.5% and an annual increase of 12.3%. Already the deposits of residents (778.68 billion) rose 2.0% and 7.5% in the same comparative bases, while those of non-residents (330.03 billion) grew by 5.0% and 2.5%.
As a result, deposits of bank activity registered an increase of 2.3%to 1,319.9 billion compared to January 2025.
 
Bank sector profit grows 51%
Macao banks exploration results increased by 50.8% to 2.37 billion patacas at the end of February, compared to the same period of 2024, according to data from the monetary authority. It is recalled that by 2024, banks registered operational profits of 4.01 billion, which translated an annual break of 21.3% and was the lowest since 2010. The 2024 profits marked the fourth consecutive descent, after 12 years, including 10 successive records, starting in 2011.

The direction of finance services considers that the data show that the government “has actively responded to public requests”, having released part of the places to “relieve pressure from the absence” of non -disorder.

Public services have been leased, over the years, parking places on private properties, intended for special vehicles and various organisms. But the government guarantees that last year, it took steps to reduce private parking places, with the direction of finance services (DSF) to emphasize that the decrease is visible.
According to the data of that body, compared to the beginning of the year last, “there is a reduction of 80 private parking spaces of motor vehicles, leased by the Government of MSAR”, including integrated services, services with administrative autonomy and services and autonomous bodies. There are currently 772 places, "a descent of about 10%."
In relation to motorcycles and mopeds, there was a decrease of four private parking places, "for a total of 22, representing a decrease of about 15%." The information was advanced by DSF substitute director Chong Seng Sam, in response to Che Sai Wang interpellation.
In total, there were 794 seats, when before 878, a break of about 10% overall.
The deputy criticized the fact that there were leased parking places that were "unoccupied for long periods of time, which resulted in waste of resources and aggravated the problem of the lack of parking places in the various areas of Macao."
In this sense, and because “the insufficiency of parking places and their unbalanced distribution has been issues that concern the population”, Che Sai wang argued that the government should “proceed with statistics on the use rate of private parking places leased by each public service, in order to find out situations where (…) are not properly used”.
In the replica, it is said that, in the face of search of parking spaces from public services, DSF leases private places due to public services, while autonomous services and bodies lease themselves. "As for the daily use and management of parking places, they are the same as the responsibility of the users themselves," he adds.
For the DSF, the statistical data presented are sufficient and "demonstrate that the Government of MSAR has actively responded to public requests, having released part of the private parking places, with a view to relieving the pressure from the lack of public parking places." As for the future, it ensures that the executive "will continue to carefully auscultate the opinions of society and optimize, taking into account the real needs, the distribution of parking places, thus raising management efficiency."
Deputy Che Sa Sai Wang had suggested that the government survey the data on the use of parking spaces for public services and that it would adjust long -term lease clauses of private parking places, for example, change to “flexible lease”. However, these proposals were unanswered by the DSF.</description><pubDate>2025-04-09 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>China warns that “will fight until the end” after a new threat of Trump</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/actual/china-avisa-lutara-ate-ao-fim-apos-nova-ameaca-de-trump/</link><description>China yesterday threatened to “resolutely be contracted to safeguard its own rights and interests,” in response to the threat of US President Donald Trump of applying an additional 50% rate on Chinese products. In a statement, the Ministry of Commerce said the US imposition of the "so -called" reciprocal tariffs "to China is" completely unfounded and is a typical unilateral "bullying" practice. "The countermeasures taken by China aim to safeguard their sovereignty, security and development interests and maintain the normal order of international trade. They are completely legitimate," read in the statement. "The US threat of increasing rates on China is a mistake on a mistake and once again exposes the blackmailer of the US. China will never accept it. If the US insists on this path, China will fight to the end," he said. In turn, the Foreign Ministry spokesman said US actions "do not reflect a genuine desire to enclose serious dialogue." "If the US really want to dialogue, they must demonstrate an attitude of equality, respect and mutual benefit," said Lin Jian, stressing that if Washington "insisting on a tariff or commercial war" without taking into account "the interests of both countries and the international community," China "is prepared to go to the end." Lin added that "the Chinese people are not looking for problems, but they are not afraid of them either" and that "the pressure, threats and blackmail are not the correct way to interact with China." Trump threatened to impose additional rates on Chinese products on Monday, raising new concerns that his effort to reshape global trade intensifies a financially destructive trade war. The threat arose after China claimed that it would retaliate against US rates. "If China does not remove its 34% increase on its longstanding business abuse until tomorrow, April 8, 2025, the US will impose additional 50% tariffs from April 9," Trump wrote on the "Truth Social" network, "besides, all the conversations with China for meetings that they requested with us will be finished!". If Trump make this threat, US rates on Chinese products would reach a total of 104%. The new taxes would be added to 20% rates announced as punishment by fentanyl trafficking and separate 34% rates announced last week. This measure could not only increase prices for US consumers, but also to encourage China to flood other countries with cheaper products and to look for deeper relationships with other business partners, namely the European Union.

Still, four of the six parameters analyzed by UCTM: “Local Economy”, “price level”, “employment” and “Quality of Life” fell on UCTM parameters.
 
In the first half of March, the Macao University of Science and Technology (UCTM) granted 818 18 or older residents in order to know the landscape of the “Consumer Confidence Index” in the first quarter of the year. On a scale from zero to 200, respondents attributed 103.82 points at the general confidence level, which reflects a slight increase of 0.85% compared to the 102.94 points obtained in the previous quarter.
However, according to the institution, only two of the six parameters analyzed recorded climbs, while the other four suffered slight breaks. Specifically, and in contrast to the agitations in the market markets that have been marking the current period, at the time of the study, the respondents attributed 112.37 points compared to “investment in the stock exchange”, which means a quarterly increase of 16.68%. In the same line, the parameter related to “housing acquisition” obtained 100.22 points, plus 2.41%.
On the contrary, the “quality of life” received 108.3 points, representing a decrease of 0.21%. Regarding the “employment situation”, there was a descent from 0.76% to 103.39 points. On the other hand, respondents attributed 98.2 points to the “price level”, a break of 2.32%. As for the “local economy”, the degree of confidence dropped 3.14% to 100.61 points.
Looking at the light increase in the consumer's confidence level, UCTM researchers pointed out that "this illustrates that, in general, the basis of consumer confidence has been consolidated," since, in four consecutive quarters, the general index obtained more than 100 points, a result that symbolizes that consumers "have confidence".
Regarding the “four descents and two climbs”, the institution pointed out that “reflect that consumer confidence and expectations in relation to different areas of consumption and distinct economic dimensions were characterized by diversification”. In addition, he warned that the confidence rate relating to the “local economy” found breaks in three consecutive quarters, a trend that “warns of the need to maintain a cautious attitude regarding the risk -incubated risk factors and future challenges”.
Nevertheless, in conclusion, the study noted that MSar is committed to promoting the proper diversification of the economy, continually deepening integrated development together with Hengqin, and becoming more efficiently and synergestically integrating into the great bay development conjuncture. In this sense, those responsible for the study expressed the conviction that the confidence of Macao consumers "will be even more consolidated and strengthened."
In addition, UCTM recalled the “stability and stable progress” of the economy of the interior of China in the first three months of this year. However, he stressed that "it is necessary to be well aware of the impetus of internal demand that still needs to be reinforced under the current economic operation, as well as the challenges resulting from the intertwining and overlapping of various types of risk and dangers."</description><pubDate>2025-04-09 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Cessation of appointment in focus on the discussion about management and bosses</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/cessacao-de-nomeacao-em-foco-na-discussao-sobre-direccao-chefias/</link><description>At yesterday's meeting on the proposal of amending the fundamental provisions of the Statute of the Board of Directors, the question of the cessation of appointments was in focus
 
The 2nd Permanent Committee of the Legislative Assembly (AL) discussed yesterday, once again, the proposal of amending the fundamental provisions of the Statute of Board and Head. After the meeting, the committee chairman, Chan Chak MO, recalled that the proposal includes 10 reasons that may lead to the termination of the appointment of directors and bosses.
At this point, the deputy said that the commission “is careful” to the issue related to the disclosure, or not, of the specific reasons that led to the termination of the appointment. Because, he said, "he considers that it involves the need for a balance between privacy and the transparency of liability." In this context, Chan Chak Mo said that members are waiting to know the position of the government.
The reasons include, for example, the “lack of commitment to perform the guidelines of the hierarchical superiors” or “non -realization of specific objectives”, but also “personal conduct that negatively affect the image or functioning of the masters or the service to which it belongs”.
On the other hand, before the official appointment of directors or heads, they must be appointed as substitutes, so that the supervisory body has enough time to observe the performance of the person to be appointed to the position. Chan Chak Mo explained that the appointment is temporary, so it is not necessary to take an oath, something that will only be done when they are officially appointed.
It also indicated that the term of appointments to the substitute position is six months. During this period, "if the person is considered inadequate the appointment may be ceased at any time." The appointment period for the position of substitute will not be included within the period of the official appointment, he added.
The bill also suggests the introduction of warning as an internal management measure to replace the previous public censorship. Chan Chak Mo stated that this article will be applicable to “not very serious errors”, aiming to record the person's performance at work and serve as an evaluation rate for official appointment.</description><pubDate>2025-04-09 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Schools should be “neutral” before candidates</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/escolas-devem-ser-neutras-perante-candidatos-a-al/</link><description>During the period of elections for the Legislative Assembly, public schools and employees must maintain a “neutral position,” said the president of Caeal
 
Public schools must maintain a “neutral position” in relation to the candidate lists for the election for the Legislative Assembly (AL), the same should happen with the staff of the schools, warned the chairman of the Commission of Electoral Affairs of the Legislative Assembly (Caeal), Seng Ioi Man, in a session on the elections dedicated to the education sector. In concrete, they cannot proceed to “electoral propaganda during the time or in the work space”.
As for private schools, Seng Ioi Man explained that electoral law does not specifically regulate these institutions in the field of electoral propaganda. In this sense, he said that "the provisions on this matter must be decided and applied by the private educational institutions themselves, but always in accordance with the law and carried out within the period of electoral propaganda."
At the session, which was attended by 200 participants, Seng Ioi Man added that Caeal will install a vote meeting, before election day, "hoping that education institutions actively organize study visits to the site, allowing students to better know voting procedures, which is a civic duty." At the same time, he argued that the elections are “one of the important topics for civic education, and that schools will be able to take this opportunity to make students know the duty of compliance with the law, justice, impartiality and integrity in elections”.
The director of Youth Education and Development Services (DSEDJ), Kong Chi Meng, also stressed that "teaching is an important part in the implementation of mission and social responsibility, so the sector must strictly comply with regulations," safeguarding that elections take place "in a fair, impartial and whole environment."
DSEDJ, in turn, “will continue to improve civic education”, with Kong Chi Meng saying that it will organize study visits to the place where the vote meeting will be installed, as well as to elaborate didactic materials for schools to use, with the aim of deepening their knowledge of the elections for the AL, the rights and duties of voters and the promotion of equity in elections.</description><pubDate>2025-04-09 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Firefighters operations dropped in all strands</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/operacoes-dos-bombeiros-baixaram-em-todas-vertentes/</link><description>In the first quarter of this year, firefighters operations recorded breaks in all slopes. The most pronounced were in exits for special services (-29%) and fires (-15%)
 
The operational actions of the Fire Department (CB) all recorded a break in the first quarter of this year, in annual terms. There were fewer exits for special services and fewer fires, and even the provision of first aid and rescues decreased in the territory.
Data released yesterday show that between January and March, 13,207 cases were registered a break of 6.32% (-891 cases) compared to the same period of 2024. “Special services” were the highest decrease of 29.21%, totaling 1,144 occurrences.
In the field of fire exits, in turn, the firefighters reported 215 cases (-15.35% or less 39 cases), and in 155 (72% of the total) it was not necessary to use hoses. According to the CB, “the main causes of the fires were due to forget to turn off the stoves, the flames not fully extinguished, the burning of incense and votive sails/papers, short circles of electrical installations and mechanical/equipment failures”, with these situations to happen in 137 cases, which represented almost 64% of the total.
CB statistics also indicate that, as for rescue operations, a break from 3.3% for 439 cases.
Ambulance exits for first aid provision totaled 11,409 cases, less 365 in annual terms, translating a decrease of 3.1%. According to firefighters, the breakdown should be mainly "to reduce cases of slight fever indisposition and breathing difficulty." In these operations, professionals dealt, above all, with cases of “dizziness, abdominal pain, breathing difficulty, vomiting, fever and various types of injuries”.
The Fire Department has also performed dissemination and sensitization actions, as well as work safety and tasks related to hazardous substances. According to the statistics yesterday presented, in the first quarter, 155 disclosure activities were organized, with the distribution of 15,467 informative leaflets and posters.
In concrete, the 38 lectures dealt with fire protection, disaster prevention, emergency medical knowledge and fuel security, with the participation of 2,855 people. The CB also performed seven stages of fire fighting, with 153 participants and 15 evacuation and incident simulacres, with the participation of 1,401 people, "in order to strengthen citizens' ability to respond in case of emergency."
In the presentation of the data, the firefighters also indicated that in March, they made inspections on the safety of use of the stoves in 33 fractions, and only six were using the equipment “safely”.
Also in the context of fire safety, between January and March 1,601 inspections were made, 26 cases of the administrative sanctioning procedure were completed. Since the entry into force of the new fire prevention law, 109 cases have been completed, which involved the parking lot of motorcycles in evacuation paths and the placement of various objects. In addition, in 12 cases the administrative sanctioning procedures have already been developed.

The project mixes video projections, physical space and the public itself to demonstrate that “we are all interconnected”
 
The “Impromptu Projects” and the “Ephemera Public Space Cooperative” will present an “unprecedented cultural” exhibition by Austrian Peter Kogler. The inauguration is scheduled for 5 pm on April 10, at “Impromptu Storefront”, and the show will be evident to the public until December 31. The key concept of this immersive experience is Hyper-Network, a visual representation of the “interconnection that extends beyond physical spaces,” according to the statement.
Kogler's work is a work of art that lives on interaction, which invites participation and "transforms everydayness into something extraordinary," according to "Impromptu Projects". More than a visual show, it is an invitation to reconsider our relationship with the world around us, "a reminder that we are all interconnected" and where boundaries between us and our environment are often "more fluid than we imagine."
Complex patterns, generated and computer animated, repeat and become, creating a "feeling of infinite expansion" that emphasizes "the boundaries between foreground and background, reality and illusion." Projections involve the viewer to emphasize "the overwhelming complexity of the systems we inhabit."
For more than four decades that Peter Kogler has been developing a “specific vocabulary of constructive, symbolic and biomorphic structures” that underlie its projects, influenced by modern schools of thought and art. In addition to local architecture, Kogler resorts to wallpaper, video projections and interior design elements to create “illusionist mazes”.
One of the pioneers of his generation in artistic experimentation with computers, Peter Kogler has already seen his work be acclaimed internationally. It was presented at the Venice Biennial, the New York Museum of Modern Art and the Lisbon Berardo Collection Museum, among others.</description><pubDate>2025-04-09 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Gafi Legal Statute motivates reflection in the FRC</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/estatuto-juridico-gafi-motiva-reflexao-na-frc/</link><description>The Rui Cunha Foundation (FRC) presents today, at 6.30 pm, a conference entitled “Legal Statute of Gafafi in the International Order”, under the “Reflections on Afternoon” cycle.

Gafi is the worldwide organization responsible for setting international policies and standards in combating capital bleaching, financing terrorism and proliferation of weapons of massive destruction, and the occurrence of other threats to the integrity of the world financial system. As a legal consultant in international law, Ilda Cristina Ferreira has witnessed over two decades the “gradual metamorphosis of what has begun as a specialized technical organism for a complex and multifaceted organization, whose legitimacy is impaired by the lack of clarity as to her legal position”. The article has special relevance for hearings in areas of international law and for a potential audience of political, academic, law professionals, lawyers, regulators and students. The conference will be conducted in Portuguese, with moderation from jurist Paulo Cardinal.</description><pubDate>2025-04-09 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>China and Scotland “meet” in the literature</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/china-escocia-encontram-se-na-literatura/</link><description>Brill Publishers publisher from the Netherlands published the book “Scotland and China: Literary Encounters”, a study by Li Li of Language Faculty and Translation from Macao Polytechnic University (FLT-UPM) and John Cobbet, a specialist in Scottish Literature.

The Kyoto -based company has also revealed new Switch 2 features -an updated version of the original 2017 model -as a chat button that will allow players to talk to each other while playing.
This new device, which succeeds the first switch, launched in 2017, with over 150 million units sold worldwide, preserves the concept of hybrid console, usable in both travel and connected to a TV set.
In particular, Switch 2 will feature a larger screen, detachable and magnetic commands that can be used as a “rat” and a function called “Game Chat”, which will allow you to talk to other live players. The device will also have a more powerful internal memory and integrated fan, detailed Nintendo during a video watched by nearly four million people.
Among the games available at its release will be "Mario Kart World", developed exclusively for Switch 2, but also titles such as "Split Fiction", "Elden Ring" and "Hogwarts Legacy".
With over 75 million copies sold from Wii U and Switch, “Mario Kart 8” is, in fact, the second best-selling game in the company's history, approaching the record set by “Wii Sports” (82 million).
However, this new console does not represent a revolution for Nintendo, as was the case, in 2006, with the detection of movements introduced by the Wii, or to a lesser extent with Gamepad, Wii U Tablet Command in 2012.
“I believe what (players) want most is simply a better performance,” said Hideki Yasuda, an analyst at Japanese company Toyo Securities. The expert estimates that six million new consoles will be available immediately.
In the long run, Nintendo could sell 19 million units during the fiscal year of 2025 and 21 million next year, calculates Toyo Securities.
Refilling this release is “fundamental” to the manufacturer's survival, recalled Piers Harding-Rolls, a specialist of the British market analysis company Amprere Analysis, because despite a diversification strategy in recent years in cinema and themed parks, Nintendo's activity has been based mainly on video games.
Admittedly, the video game industry is going through a growth crisis around the world, marked by waves of layoffs, and the arrival of Switch 2 should revitalize sales of falling consoles. In the US, they decreased by 35% in 2024, according to data provided by the Leisure Software Editors Union (SELL) and the American Circa Specialized Company.
The brand's recent announcement about lending digital Switch titles to friends through “virtual game cards” could also be a way to encourage consumers to invest in a second console, facilitating exchanges.
