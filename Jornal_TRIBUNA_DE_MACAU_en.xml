Portuguese Minister of State and Foreign Affairs, Paulo Rangel, told this newspaper at the time that the case “will deserve the best attention of the Portuguese authorities, from future meetings at the political level, in the spirit of the joint statement”.
The question of restrictions on the assignment of residence to Portuguese may also be discussed. In March of this year, on a visit to the territory, it is recalled, the head of Portuguese diplomacy linked, in this regard, that he had spoken with Sam Hou Fai "on all the issues that are relevant to the relationship between Portugal and the mashes."
"But, as it is a dialogue that is underway, I have a duty to give the opportunity we can - with the questions that have been raised from one part and the other - now to have space and time to build solutions," Paulo Rangel then added. The minister also indicated that the "follow-up of dialogue" staged with Sam Hou Fai will take place at a meeting of the Portugal-Raem Joint Commission, "which will be organized, in principle, in the second semester here in Macao."
At the time, Rangel described as "very productive" the conversation with Sam Hou Fai, adding that he had "a lot of ability to be continued."

"They have to give us awhelming. If they don't, then we'll impose about 200%rates. But I think we'll have no problem with that," Trump said in the presence of South Korean counterpart Lee Jae-Myung during an impressions in the oval room.
China is the world's leading producer of rare land, which are used in the manufacture of essentials for the automotive, electronic and weaponry industries.
However, in early April, the Chinese state imposed a license to export these strategic materials, a decision seen as a measure of retaliation against US customs rights.
Beijing and Washington then began a large -scale trade war, responding to each other to the increase in the other's customs rights, which reached 125% and 145%, respectively.
Since then, negotiations between the world's two largest powers have mitigated tensions and the Chinese government has pledged to accelerate licensing issuance to several US companies.
"I think we have a great relationship with China, I spoke very recently to President XI [Jinping] and at some point this year we should visit China," Trump added.
Despite recognizing that Beijing has “mango assets,” he stressed that Washington also has “a few amazing trushes,” but he doesn't want to play these assets because if he did, he would “destroy China,” warned the US president without specifying.
US and Chinese employees have gathered three times in recent months to resolve a series of business relationships. At the end of these meetings, the two countries agreed to maintain customs rights that impose each other at 30% and 10%, respectively, for a period of 90 days, which has been extended twice, the last until November.
Beijing, for its part, obtained a flexibility of customs rights on exports of high precision semiconductors in the United States, whose sale to Chinese companies has been progressively restricted, namely during the administration of Joe Biden (2021-2025).

On the other hand, it asks parents to be aware. The objective is to safeguard health and collective security
 
Macau registered the ninth case imported of chikungunya fever during the current year. The patient, a 53-year-old resident worker, is currently in Zhuhai, being his state stable. In response to the notification, health services (SSM) will soon proceed to the work of chemical elimination of mosquitoes, in risk zones near the Fai Chi Kei Health Center.
Following the increased positive reaction situations to the virus, transmitted by mosquitoes, which have been verified in the territory and when it is about to start another academic year, the direction of Youth Education and Development Services (DSEDJ) has a warning to students and parents of students.
DSEDJ has urged educational establishments to rigorously execute health authorities guidelines, including the reinforcement of cleaning and increasing the ability to prevent mosquitoes.
In a statement, the body points out that "after the beginning of classes, schools need to create a health monitoring mechanism", and they will have to "immediately appropriate treatments for teachers or students with suspicious symptoms."
As for parents, he says, "if they notice the less good physical state of their children, such as fever, joint pain and rash, among other symptoms of chikungunya fever, will have to take them to the doctor as quickly as possible and to impose health management according to the diagnosis," in order to jointly safeguard health and collective safety. "
On the other hand, DSEDJ expects parents to pay more attention to their children's exercise and rest time, and to help them “adjust” physical and mental health.

The DSEDJ also takes the opportunity to point out that, to ensure a “without starting” school year 2025/2026.
Also warns parents to help their children as soon as possible in preparing for the academic year, while schools need to review pedagogical facilities in advance and create a healthy school environment.
Finally, given that Macau is in a time of typhoons, and given the situation of traffic that usually comes at the time of the beginning of classes, DSEDJ underlines that it coordinated with the competent services to elaborate response plans, appealing to parents to plan the course as soon as possible.

The show, which marks the 22 years of the gallery, presents works by 24 authors of Macau
 
Victor Rebelo
 
Works by local artists will be exhibited from Thursday at the Center of Macau Creative Industries (Creative), publicizing works that carry to art the concept of “tautology”, which consists of repeating the same idea in different words.
The show is part of the celebration of Creative's 22nd anniversary and gives vision to 24 authors, all members of Creative, namely Alice Costa (Lili), Angel Chan, Coco Cheong Ut Man, Cristina Lu, David Chio, Denis Murrell, Elisa Vilaça, Eloi Scarva, Gigi Lee, Irene Chio, Justin Chiang, Justin Ung, Ken C.I. Chau, Law Sao I, Leong Leng, Li Li, Liesl Lee, Lúcia Lemos, M.CHOW, Maria João das, Mavin Zin, Ng Cheok Ieng and Yaya goes.
To the Jornal Tribuna de Macao, some of the artists said, in general, what they will present. In the synopsis of his works, which will be facilities, Lúcia Lemos points out that "the film that lives between the shell and the egg white, protects its food content and regulates gaseous exchanges with the outside, continuing its formation and culminating in a food of huge protein content." “Marvel by the film transformed into white and opaque petal after drought, suddenly I imagined creating tropical spontaneous flowers,” he adds.
Eloi Scarva, in turn, participates with a “new piece of transfer”, where he applies a “Inkjet” image on a wooden surface worked with a special liquid that transfers the image to the wood.
“The image is a digitally made composition made of discarded black and white photographs, that is, those that do not select for photographic work, reuse in this new digital composition”.
The artist admits that the final product is a kind of “face made of faces”, mentioning that there will be two pieces, “one the negative of the other”.
Elisa Vilaça has confided to JTM that her work will be represented on a 60 × 60 screen, through a mask framed in a context made from natural materials collected in the gardens of Macau.
"Starting from the theme that will body the exhibition, the reasoning of work is based on the analysis and reciprocity between reality, idea and representation underlying the work," he said, considering that "sharing the same perspective of Kosuth, the work presented is a tautology, since it represents my intention as an artist."
It is an art “that defines me as a person and portrays the human being in his relationship with nature,” he says. Finally, it remembers that there is “a connection to the origins, traditions and preservation of Portuguese culture”.
In the curatorial text of the exhibition, by Mann Chow, it is described that artists interpret tautology through various different means and techniques. "His works, based on even numbers, explored the concepts of repetition and ambiguity under the synonym's umbrella."
In everyday language, “we often use tautology unintentionally,” says the document. However, he adds, "in the field of art it can be a profoundly inspiring expressive technique," so this exhibition explores the possibilities of tautology: "Is it a restriction or liberation? Is it a meaningless repetition or a form of self -affirmation with hidden meanings?"
Through this language, artists challenge viewers' expectations regarding “meaning” by repeatedly presenting similar elements, leading them to question whether their understandings are always constructed of constantly repeated language and symbols. “Perhaps, only through repetition can we discover these subtle differences,” says Creative.
It is in this context that the exhibition aims to draw public attention to pair-based works, which exploit the concepts of “repetition” and “ambiguity” under the “synonym” umbrella.
The inauguration will take place between 18:30 and 20:30.</description><pubDate>2025-08-27 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Inquiry reveals decline in business between 54% of SMEs</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/inquerito-revela-declinio-nos-negocios-entre-54-das-pme/</link><description>The Macao Sustadement and Economics Alliance, a association linked to the “Jiangmen countrymen”, released yesterday the results of an inquiry with a view to noticing the business environment of small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Of a total of 1,037 SMPs surveyed, 54% said they had registered a tendency to decrease in business volume, and respondents consider “renowned market competition” and “high operating costs” such as the dominant restrictions on their development. In addition, 62% confessed that they do not know the support measures currently implemented by the government. In this aspect, some consider that the information on the presentation of order to benefit from the support measures are not transparent, and the request procedures are complex. On the other hand, the study reveals that more than 70% of the companies inquired are available or even promoting digital operations. However, only 9% effectively completed this digital transformation. Among these, most are only in the early attempts, which, for the association, shows that there is a disparity between the will of the SMEs and its ability to achieve this objective. In addition, after being heard by 15 academics, the SME interviewed won 51.4 points, from a scale from zero to 100, regarding the general business environment of Macao, results lower than the neighboring regions. As a solution, the Association suggested creating a “One Stop” platform regarding PME policies to simplify procedures and launch a marketing financial support. In addition, the Association defended the expansion of the scope of policy dissemination and the implementation of an effectiveness assessment mechanism.</description><pubDate>2025-08-27 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>“Most common” electronic means in the transfer of illicit funds</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/meios-electronicos-mais-comuns-na-transferencia-de-fundos-ilicitos/</link><description>Although the “exchange of cards without/with reduced game activity” leads for the second year in a row the top of the suspicious transaction reports table, the truth is that the “use of online banks/Internet-related transactions” was the one that recorded “a more significant increase” in 2024, according to the financial information office, and 555 cases were verified. The body says it is a sign that "the transfer of illicit funds is increasingly common through electronic technology." In the general calculation, a total of 5,245 STR arrived, reflecting an annual increase of 13.7% and 78.3% compared to the pre-pound period

The “change of cards without/with reduced game activity” again led for the second year consecutive reports of suspicious transactions (STR, in the English acronym), totaling 1,569 cases, a 24% increase compared to 1,282 registered in 2023. According to the report of the financial information office (GIF) for 2024, the rise is proportional to the “significant increase in the number of cases of suspicious transactions in the game sector in the last two years ”.
Despite being first, it was the “use of online banks/internet -related transactions” that recorded “a more significant increase”, as the body stresses. 555 cases were counted, however, it is not possible to make a comparison with 2023, as this year this type of cases was included in the "others", along with other characteristics, such as "possible correspondence with the" Watch-List "screening system or other black lists," transactions with unknown provenance funds "and" tried, but failed transactions.

According to the GIF, this feature was common in the STR reported by financial institutions, "reflecting that, currently, the transfer of illicit funds through electronic technology is increasingly common."
“Background transfers through check, promising notes or bank transfer,” in turn rose 29% to 599, while “suspicious electronic transfers” also rose, in this case 16% to 411. “The“ cash deposits of high amounts of origin ”increased 10 to 796.
During the last year, there were also 141 cases related “with other crimes” (+20%), ascending a total of 843. In addition, 100 cases of “use of multibanco, telephone board, cash deposits” (633) were reported than the previous year, representing an increase of 19%. In 2024, the GIF also reported 2,723 cases of “other” activities, 337 more than the previous year (2,386).
Overall, throughout the year the GIF received 5,245 STR, reflecting an annual increase of 13.7%. The increase was even more visible compared to 2019, as there was a 78.3%increase. Chu Un, GIF coordinator, an organism that is now integrated into the Unit Police Services, says in the report that the data “reflects the challenges of supervision resulting from the dynamism of Macao economic activities and demonstrate the high degree of confidence of reporting institutions in the professional capacity of GIF”.
“Despite adjusting the GIF structure, the number of suspicious transactions participations continued to grow two digits, demonstrating that the operators of the different Macau sectors have been reinforcing their awareness of the risk and sensitivity to the risk,” says Chu Un.
In particular, the number of STR from the financial sector rose 23.7% to 1,097, according to the GIF report, which considered it to be a "significant increase." The financial industry was responsible for about one fifth of reports (21%) and other institutions by 311 (5.9%).
However, most STR continued to be reported by the game industry, in a set of 3,837 (73%). In 2024, the GIF received another 406 reports from game operators (12%) than the previous year (3,431).
In 2024, a total of 142 reports were re -enhanced to the Public Prosecution Service, a 22% rise in annual terms. The GIF suspects that "some cases are related to the crime of slopping", with "the possibility that their illicit funds are transferred and bleached through the Macao financial system."
STR's main form of participation in 2024 was online, with 91% of reports (4,794) to be digitally submitted. The concessionaires submitted all their reports by this means, while the financial sector institutions sent 957 (87%).
Last year, the GIF continued to promote global optimization of the computer system and the construction of cybersecurity, “with the aim of raising the effectiveness of the analysis of financial information and responding effectively to increasingly complex security challenges”, can read in the report. Main work included, among others, the “updating of the STR online participation system”.
Perspective this year, the coordinator, Chu Un, stresses that the GIF will “build a high and solid defense line against capital bleaching [as well as] establish and improve the financial risk prevention and resolution mechanism in order to create a secure financial barrier”.
 
Information sharing and international collaboration
"Capital bleaching phenomena, terrorism financing and financing the proliferation of weapons of massive destruction are not only in a jurisdiction. Capital flows often involve various regions," the report says. According to the recommendations of the Financial Action Group (GAFI), "different jurisdictions, in addition to identifying and evaluating the risks (…) should also update them regularly to maintain the risk assessment updated."
The GIF claims to have continued “to fulfill its member duties in international organizations against capital laundering”, such as the Asia-Pacific group against capital laundering and the Egmont Group. The cabinet also believes it has established "a long -term solid base for the construction of a more efficient international financial security network."
On the other hand, and according to Gafi reviews, an intergovernmental organization that investigates capital whites and organized crime, updated in July, the MSAR is still poorly effective in the investigation, seizure of revenues and sanctions on money laundering crimes, requiring “fundamental improvements”.
Regarding the combat of money laundering associated with terrorism, reporting suspicious transactions and the application of preventive measures by financial institutions, “non -financial companies and designated professions” (DNFBP, English acronym) and “virtual asset service suppliers” (VASP), performance is moderate and the gafaf indicates that “great improvements” are needed.
By the end of the last year, the GIF has signed 33 memorandums of understanding with other financial information units from various countries and jurisdictions, including Portugal. “Cooperation mechanisms in the exchange of information” were also established, “in order to reinforce the effectiveness of preventing and combating the crime of laundering capital and related crimes,” says the report. Throughout 2024, the GIF received 48 requests for information and made 60, having received 19 occasions and made available on 17, within the scope of international cooperation.
Created in 2006, GIF is an administrative financial information unit, responsible for participating in the prevention and combating criminal activities related to capital laundering, terrorism financing and financing the proliferation of weapons of massive destruction.</description><pubDate>2025-08-26 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Part of the Portuguese sidewalk can be replaced in the alley of Lilau</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/parte-da-calcada-portuguesa-podera-ser-substituida-beco-lilau/</link><description>The AMI is negotiating with residents and the condominium management company about a work to replace the Portuguese sidewalk pavement in Beco do Lilau with non -slip granite, with the contract with an area of ​​about 12 square meters. According to AMI, the IC has already been consulted on this proposal for optimization. To be completed, the work also requires “consensus”, presentation of the request to DSAT and “Light Verde” of the “Road Works Coordination Group”, noted the body
 
The Institute for Municipal Affairs (AMI) is planning to extend the granite floor used on the Lilau Beco Ramp to the Lancil do Passeio, linked to Rua da Barra - which means that the existing Portuguese sidewalk may disappear. The work involves an area of ​​12 square meters, and the body said that the idea is that the materials remain consistent throughout the ramp. To the Jornal Tribuna de Macao, the body said that their materials already take into account the harmonization with the surrounding landscape, and at the same time allow a better non -slip effect for this street section that is going down.
According to the perspective plant sent by AMI to this newspaper, the area of ​​the work is currently fully paved with Portuguese sidewalk, and the contract then consists of replacing the Portuguese sidewalk pavement with granite. As for the Portuguese sidewalk in Largo do Lilau, AMI assured that the work will not cause any change.
It is recalled that Lilau's square and alley are part of the historic center, classified as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. For this reason, AMI stated that it had already consulted the opinion of the Cultural Institute (IC) regarding the respective optimization proposal.
When consulting another AMI plant, it is clear that, in the area of ​​the work, except a small part of the Portuguese sidewalk (not linked to Rua da Barra) that will be preserved, most of the sidewalk will be replaced by gray granite and non-slip red granite, as well as red brick that is currently being used on the side of the alley. According to AMI, all stone materials will comply with the size and colors of the existing materials there.
In this respect, he recalled, there were residents who pointed to the possibility of the vehicles skidded in rain time on the floor in the alley of Lilau, linked to Rua da Barra. Ensuring that it has been following this subject continuously - including through the use of non -slip ink for some years to improve the situation - the AMI has lamented, however, that this measure has “limited effect”.
Since the holding of the street section pavement contract involved will be an impact on the entries and exits of residents' vehicles, AMI indicated that it is currently “communicating actively” with the condominium management company and residents, to coordinate the proposal to execute the work, in order to reduce the impact on those who inhabit.
"When there is consensus, AMI will submit a request to the Directorate of Services for Traffic Affairs (DSAT). Only after approval at the Road Works Coordination Group meeting can the concrete plans for execution of the work be implemented," said AMI.
On the same subject, in turn, the IC stated that “actively collaborates” with the respective work of IAM and had already expressed opinions in the scope of protection of cultural heritage in relation to the proposal in question. To the Jornal Tribuna de Macao, the IC also indicated that, later,, along with the AMI, to proceed to further evaluate the conditions on site, studying the feasibility of the proposal of optimization.</description><pubDate>2025-08-26 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Chief exalts “spirit of resistance against Japanese aggression”</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/chefe-exalta-espirito-da-resistencia-contra-agressao-japonesa/</link><description>Until September 24, the forum complex hosts a photographic exhibition about the 80th anniversary of China's victory in the Japanese aggression resistance war.

The success of the bet on two weekends made in the 2024 edition leads to the organization to keep the event model for this year. The popular party will take place in two periods, from October 24 to 26, and from October 31 to November 2. In parallel, the Cultural Institute also organizes the meeting in Macau - Festival of Arts and Culture between China and Portuguese -speaking countries ”, which will feature a first“ show in the community ”on October 23rd, in the IAO Hon neighborhood

The 28th edition of the Lusofonia Festival returns this year for six days, on two consecutive weekends, after the 2024 experience was considered positive by the organization of the event, in charge of the Cultural Institute (IC). The first period of the popular party will take place between October 24 and 26, and the second between October 31 and November 2, always on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, on the beach Avenue where the Taipa Museum houses are located.
Therefore, it will be six days of celebration, where there will be no shortage of musical action, popular games and matracks, as well as food and drink stalls and stands with handicrafts and other articles representing countries or regions of Lusophone expression.
The names of the artists invited to the musical shows, which constitute one of the most important parts of the festival program, have not yet been released, which should only happen at the press conference, scheduled for September.
Moreover, the associations that usually participate in the festivity already know some points of the program, after a first meeting that kept with the IC, also having details about the other event that is again promoted in parallel with the Festival of Lusofonia, which is the “Meeting in Macao - Festival of Arts and Culture between China and Portuguese -speaking countries”, also under the same Session of the IC and will be released in the same presentation. Lusophony Festival.
According to the Jornal Tribuna de Macau, the model of the two events remains virtually unchanged compared to previous years, varying only the names of artists who will participate in the musical shows. The budget will be equally similar to the past edition.
For Lusophony, there will be 10 solo interpreters, in band, or traditional dance and singing groups, divided into the same number by the two weekends, and there will be two “head of carta”, one for each party period, on Saturday night, and one of them must come from Portugal, as has happened usually. In 2024 came Fernando Daniel and 2023 Carlão, with the expectation of being able to come in 2025 a singer.
JTM knows that there are some strong names on the table, which are being negotiated, but there is no final decision yet. It should be noted that the artists who will come abroad will join several musicians from Macau, many of whom, with a lot of experience, have added quality to the festival's musical shows program.
In addition to Portugal and Macao, nine more countries or Lusophone regions will be represented in the shows to take place at the amphitheater of houses in the museum, in the afternoon and evening. They are: Brazil, Angola, Mozambique, Cape Verde, Guinea Bissau, Equatorial Guinea, Sao Tome and Principe, East Timor and Goa Damão and Diu. Some of these groups will be made up of bands.
Following the same system of previous years, IC will take advantage of the presence in Macao of artists invited to the Lusophony Festival, to also monetize them in the “Traditional Music and Dance Shows in the community”, integrated into the “Meeting between China and Portuguese -speaking countries”.
Thus, four of those who will come to the first period of the festivity, except for the “headlof”, as this will only give a concert, will be displayed in places of the already chosen city. One of these stages will be installed in the Iao Hon neighborhood, with the first scheduled performance for the eve of the Lusophony festival, October 23, between 18:30 and 21h00.
A group of traditional dances from China, Guangdong Province, will accompany the other artists in the 23rd show, repeating the performance on 30 October, as will be present at the opening ceremony of the Lusophony Festival and the meeting, on the 24th, Friday, at 19h00, at Taipa Museum Houses.
For the remaining exhibitions in the community, the organization has also decided the places where the public can watch the events: Leisure Zone of the Lok Yeong Fa Yuen Building, next to Lam Mau, and in the side spaces of Jardim Cidade das Flores, in Taipa. Last year, the places went to the Carmo Fair and the ruins of São Paulo.
Regarding the programming of the meeting, several activities are planned, beyond the musical shows, such as exhibitions, cinema and a book fair.</description><pubDate>2025-08-26 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Korea bets on culture in search of impulse for growth</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/lazer/coreia-aposta-na-cultura-em-busca-de-impulso-para-crescimento/</link><description>South Korean entertainment companies, which “surf” in the Korean wave, or Hallyu, are striving to widen global range, while Asia's fourth largest economy is betting on cultural exports at a time of growing protection barriers to traditional manufacturers.
Although it is growing rapidly from a low base, thanks to the substantial support of the government and the high visibility in the world landscape with some recent successes, the sector's contribution to the economy is still just a fraction of the transforming industry.
The Samsung and Hyundai Industry Giants House is delighting in the success of Boys Band BTS, the winning movie of a Oscar, “Parasite”, from the “Round 6” series “The Vegetarian”, whose author Han Kang won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2024, and, more recently, the musical Maybe Happy Ending.
India, Latin America and the Middle East, in particular, are new promising markets for Korean cultural products that have been revealed global hits, they said executives of major producers in interviews with Reuters.
“The Latin American region, recognized as the cradle of Latin music, is a key focus area,” said Jason Jaesang Lee, executive director of the K-Pop Hybe agency, who manages the BTS, featured his return planned for next spring.
The agency is also holding auditions in Latin America to release another boys Band, after the US -based Katseye group debut last year, whose six members come from four countries.
"It's time to re -examine Hallyu's definition," Lee said. "If the content is created abroad, but produced by a Korean company, or even by a foreign entity with Korean capital, I believe it should still be considered part of Hallyu."
Still, cultural exports are unlikely to replace the traditional transforming industry in the near future.
South Korea Intellectual Property Exports (PI), from music and movies to games, more than tripled over the past decade, reaching $ 9.85 billion by 2024, but representing only a fraction of goods exports, which increased 13%, reaching $ 696.2 billion, according to Central Bank data.
Another company that is expanding the global business this year is CJ ENM, producer of “parasite”, which began to provide K-Damas for the Middle East and North Africa through a partnership with a regional streaming platform in June.
In the case of the Middle East, “we see this market as a promising long term, because Hallyu's popularity is high among the youngest generation,” said Sean Cho, executive vice president of the global business division.
In the main markets in Japan, Southeast Asia and the United States, the company is widening partnerships, more recently with Amazon Prime Video, to offer joint productions that combine Korean elements with local culture, Cho added.
For the game industry, a source of income that represents more than half of South Korea's intellectual exports and is famous for Krafton's award-winning PUBG: Battlegrounds, India promises to be the next growing market, although it represents only a tenth of the South Korean market.
"The India Game Market is still early in comparison with other advanced countries," said Sean Hyunil Sohn, executive director of Game Editor Kraftton India, which plans to explore growth potential, adding new genres and types of games.
President Lee Jae Myung has promised support and investment to make South Korea in a “great cultural power,” with the aim of expanding the market to 300 billion wons in value and exports to 50 billion wons by 2030.
"But we can't leave it in the hands of individual companies," he said in a recent talk show. "The government will play the role of establishing a solid foundation, and it begins now."
Big Five refer to music categories, dramas, webtoons, beauty and food products, which are key elements in President Lee's efforts to reposition South Korea as a cultural power.
For long -term success, sector experts and even the Central Bank have appealed to legislative structures to help national companies compete with global giants such as Netflix.
