The names in the lists admitted to the electoral act to the Legislative Assembly of Macao (AL) of 14 September were released yesterday by the respective Commission of Electoral Affairs (Caeal).

The Union for Development, Promoter Union for Progress, Association of United Citizens of Macao, Popular Liveliod Strength in Macau, Synergy Power, Good Home Alliance, New Hope, and Macao-Guangdong Union.
The list helps Mutual Grassroots was the only one rejected. "This candidacy commission delivered more than 300 signatures. But after the assessment, we found that most of these signatures were not made by voters gathering the conditions," explained Caeal President Seng Ioi Man. In addition, "there is also a subscription repetition, or a person signing several times, as well as situations where the subscription does not correspond to that of BIR."
On the other hand, he continued, in the symbol of the list "There is a certain content that may not correspond to public order", because he had inscribed the slogan "fight to death." The commission notified the agent, requiring, according to the law, five days so that the list could supply the deficiencies pointed out. "We have not received any confirmation, so the candidacy was rejected," he added.
On the case of the five suspects in electoral corruption, sent to the prosecutor after discovery of the commissioner against corruption, Seng Ioi Man said the investigation is underway. "Due to the secret of justice, the identification of the people involved was not disclosed, so I will not do so or mention the connection to any candidacy committee," he noted.
Also questioned about the case of the alleged detention of Wong Wai Man, leader of the election's Iron and Steel Association, allegedly involved in exploration of the game, the official was peremptory: “Caeal will not even comment on the work of police bodies or investigative entities,” he said, stressing that “each one does his work according to his skills”.
Given the insistence of journalists to know if there is police interference in the elections, Seng Ioi Man again stressed the "skills" of each one, no longer making comments.
Other questions also addressed the fewer candidate lists for this year's elections and the possibility of this being reflected in the abstention rate. The president of Caeal did not answer directly to both questions, preferring to emphasize the promotion of the work that the Commission is doing, and saying that between January 1 and May 31 a total of 7,500 voters updated the address, the “highest of the last three years”.
In general, Macau has this year with 333,391 people qualified to vote. As this newspaper reported in January, at the end of 2024 9,759 new singular voters, well below the 2016 (-61%) and 2020 (-39%) records, which preceded equally years of legislatures were counted.

Given the scenario, later this year a pollution control and monitoring plan in that area of ​​Macao will be launched, Susana Wong said

Pollution in the inner port remains a reality, even though the authorities have been boosting the reordering of wastewater drainage in coastal zones, among other measures. For this reason, this year will be prepared “a water pollution control and monitoring plan in the interior port, in order to systematically improve and monitor water quality in this area,” said Susana Wong, director of maritime and water services (DSAMA).
In response to an interpellation of Leong Sun Iok, which pointed to the complaints of residents about the bad smells, Susana Wong pointed out that the provisional wastewater treatment facilities of Avenida Marginal do Lam Mau are already completed and in operation, being currently underway the construction works of the interior water treatment facilities, which is expected to conclude the conclusion for the completion 2026. "These facilities aim to relieve the situation of wastewater entry into the inner port through the rainwater discharge exits along the coast," he recalled.
The director of the body also explained that, due to the limitations imposed by the geographical location and the natural environment, and "although it is not possible to prevent the waste from the amounts from being dragged by the tides and chains to the coast of the inner port", "as far as possible", oil containment barriers and other antipological equipment in appropriate places. These measures have contributed "to effectively reduce waste accumulation in difficult coastal areas."
The deputy had questioned whether it would be possible to install this type of equipment in other areas of the Costa, but Dsama stated that, "not to compromise the functioning of the interior port bridges, the conditions are not yet gathered to widen the area of ​​placement of these barriers."
In the answer, Susana Wong points out that Macau is on the west coast of the Pérola river estuary, so "a large amount of garbage from the river is constantly dragged by the chains to his coastal edge." Measures launched by DSAMA to account for the problem over the years include the “daily patrol of sea areas, the removal of waste in the sea, the placement of oil containment barriers and other antipolding equipment”, as well as the “continuous exploitation of more effective seafood removal methods”.
However, it admits that, "due to the complexity of the inner port coastal edge, waste accumulated in certain locations can only be removed by vessels and manually." Leong Sun IOK had asked if a maritime cleaning plan would be prepared and implemented through the use of technology, "with a view to optimizing the effectiveness of maritime waste removal."</description><pubDate>2025-06-17 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Doctors trained by a vain being able to exercise in Portugal</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/medicos-formados-pela-um-vao-poder-exercer-em-portugal/</link><description>Doctors graduated from the future medical school of the University of Macau (one), from 2028, may also exercise in Portugal, a leader of the University of Lisbon told Lusa (Ulisboa). Ulisboa Medical School is collaborating with one to create a curriculum with a structure “close to what is the structure” of the courses at the Portuguese institution, said the director.
Luís Graça explained that the courses will work in co-tutela, allowing doctors graduated in one to obtain “an equivalence and recognition” by the Ulisboa School of Medicine. Among the advantages will be “thus allowing doctors trained there in the territory [Macau] can also exercise medicine in Portugal”, stressed the investigator.
In December, Uma Vice-Rector Rui Martins said Ulisboa will help create the first Macao Public Medicine School in the institution's new campus in neighboring Hengqin.
The University of Science and Technology of Macao, a private institution, has since 2008 has a Faculty of Health Sciences, officially renamed as Medicine Faculty in 2019.
In an interview with TDM's Portuguese channel, Rui Martins said medicine will be one of four new colleges to be born on the new one in Hengqin campus. "We will have a Faculty of Information Sciences, a Faculty of Engineering, with new types of engineering, as well as a Design Faculty and should include architecture," he said.
"The idea in this campus is terms 'dual degrees' [courses in co-tutela] with foreign universities. Medicine is already with Lisbon and now we are defining for other colleges," added Rui Martins.
The new Campus in Hengqin, whose first stone was launched on December 9, will be inaugurated in 2028 and allows a passing 15,000 to a maximum of 25,000 students, stressed the Vice Rector for global affairs.
Luís Graça, a transplant immunology expert, also demonstrated enthusiasm with potential collaborations between the two universities in the area of ​​scientific research. "If we think in terms of science, the reinforcement of the scientific potential of both institutions with a collaboration close to each other is something that will clearly benefit both sides of this partnership," said the leader.
Graça said that the Ulisboa School of Medicine is organizing the first symposium to bring together the investigators of the institution and UM, with a view to promoting joint research projects.
The college has had “occasional collaborations of researchers with researchers from other Chinese universities” as “it is important to proximity to places where excellent science is made and teaching excellence,” said the director. But Graça said that collaboration with one is "more institutional ... and can allow even greater reinforcement of these partnerships."

On the other hand, it defended a mechanism that allows both the closing and the update of the SMEs
 
Given the “difficult scenario” of the local economy, “impasse in urban renewal”, “lack of vitality in community commercial areas” and the need for “reshaping the city's competitiveness”, Vong Pui Lam, a subdirector of the Macao Commercial Association Commission of Strategic Studies, defended two aspects for which MSar must “make efforts”.
In his opinion, the first is to promote urban renewal by commercial real estate groups, under the model of renewal of old zones “government guidance + business leadership”, which has been adopted in the interior of China. Specifically, the representative of the Commercial Association proposed the transformation of old spaces in the North Zone into a “cultural and tourist neighborhood”, which makes available spaces for retail sales, concerts and experiences linked to intangible cultural heritage.
For this, the associative representative suggested policies of preferred land to attract investment. In the long run, this model of urban renewal is expected to be extended to the central areas of the Macao Peninsula, thus fostering a joint development effect.
In this aspect, Vong Pui Lam pointed out that, as the North Zone lacks a general sectoral update and the development of a set of areas, popular check-in points on social networks, although they can captivate a large flow of visitors in a short term, are unable to form sustainable consumer ecology.
In addition, the associative leader has lamented that the features channeled by old zones operators are only effective in a limited way, failing to “solve ambiguous positioning problems in commercial areas and sectoral homogeneity”, which, in its perspective, is due to the lack of structural innovation.
On the other hand, Vong Pui Lam expects different zones to gain differentiated positioning, that the cultural intellectual property and immersive experience in historical areas will be reinforced, and developed “thematic commercial areas” in new community neighborhoods, such as commercial areas directed to health tourism.
In addition, Vong Pui Lam also suggested a mechanism that allows both the output and the updating of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), as well as a “SME update fund”, linked to the industrial resources of the large bay, in order to boost the digitization and characterization of traditional commercial establishments. In his opinion, in relation to companies with little competitiveness, a solution must be the attribution of a subsidy, in order to guide companies in orderly closure, freeing space and resources.</description><pubDate>2025-06-17 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>XI in Kazakhstan to foster synergies in key sectors</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/ultimas/xi-cazaquistao-para-fomentar-sinergias-em-sectores-chave/</link><description>The Chinese president arrived yesterday in Astana, the capital of Kazakhstan, where he was welcomed by his kazakha counterpart, Kasim-Yomart Tokayev, to participate in the second summit China-Central Asia, centered on multilateral cooperation in several key sectors.

Guo said that transport infrastructure projects, such as China-Tajiquisto Railway connection China Self-Start-Kyrguistan-Uzbekistan, “raised regional connectivity to a new level”.
"Digital economy and green transformation have expanded new areas of pragmatic cooperation between both parties," the spokesman added, while cultural and personal exchanges between China and Central Asian countries have "gained momentum" in recent times.
According to Guo, a series of plans for future cooperation between China and Central Asia will be elaborated together during the Astana Summit.
Last week, Chinese diplomacy stated that collaboration between China and Central Asia "complies with the common expectations of all parts of maintaining regional stability and achieving high quality development."

PlayStation 2, the best -selling console of all time, has not exceeded the mark of two million units sold before two weeks.
Switch 2 is an improved version of the successful Switch model, with a larger screen and more processing capacity.
The console was launched last Thursday, with a scenario of enthusiasm of fans, who waited until midnight by opening stores in several countries.
Since its launch in 2017, the original switch has sold 155 million units and has become the third best-selling electronic game console of all time. The console had a big boost during pandemic confinements, with successful games like "Animal Crossing".
Despite the much more expensive price, the company Nintendo expects to sell 15 million switch 2 until March 2026, almost the same number registered by Switch in its first year in the market.
"It will be difficult to maintain the impetus of long -term sales," said Darang Candra of the Niko Partner Electronic Games Market Research firm. "It may be that consumers want to buy before a possible price increase due to potential US tariffs," he said in statements to the AFP agency.
Switch 2 costs $ 499.99 in the United States, against $ 299.99 from the original model. Both consoles are hybrid and can be connected to TV or used in a portable manner.
New games like “Donkey Kong Bananza” and “Mario Kart World” are also more expensive than existing switch titles.
"Long -term success will depend on Nintendo's ability to keep interest in new titles and attract occasional players in emerging markets, such as the Middle East and Asian countries outside Japan," said Darang Candra.
With this release, Nintendo has a lot at stake: although the company has diversified its activities with themed parks and cinematic overproductions, almost 90% of its revenues come from sales of its main game console.
