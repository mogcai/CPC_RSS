Given the numerous cases of Chinese citizens who have been seduced to move abroad, the Secretary for Security appeals to the population to be suspicious of employment proposals abroad. Wong Sio Chak also ensures that the PJ continues to “optimize” action plans in this field
 
The Secretary for Security has appealed to the population to be careful with the traps of employment proposals abroad. In the usual monthly message published on the website of his office, Wong Sio Chak begins by saying that in recent months there have been frequent cases involving Chinese citizens who have been seduced to move abroad, where they are enticed and sometimes forced to get involved in Burns using telecommunications and the internet.
Since September, five resident citizens of Macau have fallen into the network, four of which were arrested locally for criminal participation, while one managed to escape and return to Macau safely. In this sense, he asked citizens to be suspicious of job offers abroad.
He said, gangs, using telecommunications and the internet, usually offer high salaries, also promising food, accommodation, collection service, free airplane tickets, among others, all allegedly free. "The victims are seduced with false promises, deceived and taken abroad where they are then transferred to dedicated burla centers using telecommunications and the internet and where they are forced to perform criminal acts," he says.
Wong Sio Chak indicates that young people are the main target of these networks. Among the five victims mentioned, most were unemployed or had no fixed job, including a student. Then, when victims arrive abroad, generally, mobile phones and travel documents are removed, and personal and communication freedoms are restricted, making it difficult to seek help.
“It is essential to carefully check whether the content of the work is legal and whether the contracting company or the employment intermediary operates legitimately. Any work offer promises 'high wages with few requirements' and demand work abroad is surely a scam, ”he warns.
It also warns that the blows using telecommunications and the internet are considered crimes anywhere, so that anyone, "regardless of the role they play," can be the target of criminal action. "Under no circumstances should assist in the receipt or transport of funds of unknown origin, nor give up your bank account to move money of dubious origin, avoid becoming an instrument of criminal activities," he adds.
In this field, Wong Sio Chak also ensures that the PJ continues to “optimize” emergency action plans, intensify international police cooperation and actively investigate cases of abroad disappearances. It also proceeds with warning actions, detecting suspicious network information and implementing multiple measures to increase response efficiency.
