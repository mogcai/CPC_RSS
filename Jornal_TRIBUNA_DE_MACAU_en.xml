In the field of Justice, the Macao SAR Government intends to “strengthen” judicial cooperation with the outside world and “even further” expand legal exchange with the outside world, stressed the Secretary for Administration and Justice in the presentation of the Lines of Government Action (LAG) under his supervision. In this context, it is planned to negotiate and conclude an agreement on the “reciprocal confirmation and execution of judicial decisions in civil and commercial matters” between Portugal and the Macao SAR.
According to the LAG report, work on this matter is scheduled to begin in the first quarter of next year. However, a date for concluding negotiations and the eventual signing of an agreement is not specified.
It is recalled that Macau and Portugal signed an agreement in 2019 regarding the surrender of fugitive offenders, the criminal legality of which was called into question by the Portuguese Bar Association. The protocol is not in force, as it was not voted on in the Assembly of the Republic.
Furthermore, and still in this context, at the end of next year it is expected that agreements will be concluded on the transfer of convicted persons, on the surrender of fugitive offenders and on mutual legal assistance in criminal matters with the Philippines and Angola.
On the other hand, the Executive recalls that it is studying the revision of the Code of Civil Procedure and related legal diplomas, as well as the Code of Contentious Administrative Procedure, with consultation work expected to begin in 2026. The priority, it can be said, is to complete the drafting of the proposed law “Amendment to the Code of Administrative Procedure” and its consideration in the Legislative Assembly.
Another objective, in this case for the third quarter of the year, is to carry out the staff allocation and provision process in collaboration with the two judiciary bodies, as the sixth qualification course for judicial officers is completed by that time.
Furthermore, as part of the expansion of the legal dissemination network, from the third quarter of next year, the Government intends to “continuously expand the size of the team promoting legal dissemination and, through the synergy mechanism between the three parties ‘government-school-association’, systematically form a team of professional and regularized legal dissemination volunteers”. Before, in the second quarter, the idea is to install the “Corner of Legal Disclosure Stories” in the territory's libraries, “with a view to infusing legal knowledge into everyday family life”.
The Executive also intends to launch experience activities in mock court, “with a view to stimulating students' interest in the profession of law and helping them to establish a correct concept of the rule of law”. These activities are scheduled for the third quarter of 2026.
 
Government restricted use
of western appliances
The public administration is giving priority to Chinese electronic devices, because those coming from Western countries “with a hostile stance towards China” represent “a risk”. “Instructions have already been issued by the [Administration and Public Service Services], especially for critical infrastructures,” said the Secretary for Administration and Justice. “We considered, as a priority, the use of our country’s devices” in government services and departments, he highlighted. The director admitted that “there is a risk” in the supply of electronic telecommunications devices. “It is a very sensitive issue and one in which there is also a fragility”, said Wong, pointing the finger at “Western countries, especially some with a hostile stance towards China”. However, he stressed that the limitations only apply to public administration. "We have an open market and we will not restrict the private sector to use foreign devices. Entities and the private sector have the freedom to choose these devices", he explained.</description><pubDate>2025-11-24 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>House prices grow again a year later</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/preco-das-casas-volta-crescer-um-ano-depois/</link><description>Entre Julho e Setembro, o preço médio das fracções habitacionais vendidas na RAEM cresceu quase 8% face aos três meses anteriores, reflectindo a primeira subida no espaço de um ano.

The average price per square meter (useful area) of autonomous housing units sold in the Macao SAR during the third quarter of this year increased by 7.7% to 74,190 patacas compared to the previous three months. On the other hand, it remained below the level of the same period in 2024 (-14.3%), according to data compiled by the Directorate of Statistics and Census Services (DSEC) based on the stamp duty charged.
In sequential terms, this was the first growth in the average price after four consecutive quarters of decline. Annual comparisons reflect nine consecutive quarters of decline.
According to DSEC, the average price of houses on the Macau Peninsula (74,590 patacas) rose 12.6% compared to the second quarter of this year, mainly due to the fact that new housing complexes were put up for sale between July and September. In the space of three months, houses also increased in price by 4.0% in Coloane (87,093 patacas), however, Taipa saw a drop of 4.6% to 70,110 patacas.
At a general level, the average price of houses in constructed buildings fell by 3.2% to 65,897 patacas, in the quarterly variation. These autonomous units were sold mainly in “Baixa da Taipa” (114), in “Novos Aterros da Areia Preta” (79) and in “Areia Preta and Iao Hon” (52), for average prices of 72,966, 78,762 and 49,191 patacas, respectively. On the other hand, in buildings under construction, the average building increased by 9.1% to 112,645 patacas, when compared to the second quarter of 2025.
Between July and September, 1,411 autonomous units and parking spaces were transacted for a total value of 6.26 billion patacas, which corresponds to quarterly increases of 5.1% and 29.0%, respectively.
In the housing sector, the number of transactions rose 6.5% in annual terms and 19.2% in the quarterly interval. Specifically, 955 autonomous housing units were transacted for a value of 4.61 billion patacas (+24.8% compared to the second quarter), including 725 in constructed buildings (-4.1%), for 3.26 billion (-6.3%), and 230 in buildings under construction (+411.1%), involving 1.35 billion (+529.7%).
In the first nine months of 2025 as a whole, the number of homes sold rose 0.6% to 2,510. The total value of transactions amounted to around 12 billion patacas.
At the end of September, 5,778 autonomous housing units were in the design phase, 1,357 were under construction and 787 were undergoing inspection. Throughout the third quarter, usage licenses were issued for 327 units, all located on the Macau Peninsula, of which 85.6% were studio units and 13.5% had two bedrooms.
 
70 stores sold
in three months
In the store segment, the number of units sold (70) fell 11.4% in one year, but grew 2.9% compared to the previous three months, with the value of transactions reaching 700 million patacas (+7.0%). The areas of Barra and Manduco (18) and Baixa de Macau (10) stood out in terms of the number of sales completed in the quarter under review.
Statistics on transactions for the third quarter also include five industrial units (-50% compared to the previous three months) for 42 million patacas (-63.5%), 15 for offices (-37.5%) for 60 million (+15.4%) and 361 parking spaces (-16.8%) for 262 million (-17.6%). Between January and September, there were 250 store transactions, 57 office transactions and 32 industrial units, translating to annual decreases of 4.6%, 31.3% and 31.9%, respectively, while sales of parking spaces (1,263) grew 36.2%.</description><pubDate>2025-11-24 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Provider foresees two years of “intense” activity at the helm of Santa Casa</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/provedor-anteve-dois-anos-de-intensa-actividade-a-frente-da-santa-casa/</link><description>The Brotherhood of Santa Casa da Misericórdia elected the governing bodies for the next biennium. The only list presented, and headed by António José de Freitas, was unanimously approved. To the newspaper TRIBUNA DE MACAU, the Ombudsman said that, for this new mandate, “the most important thing is to maintain all projects”, anticipating two years of “intense activity”

António José de Freitas will continue to be the Ombudsman of Santa Casa da Misericórdia de Macau for another two years, with the mandate beginning on January 1, 2026.
Only one list competed in the election, which took place in the institution's Main Hall, made up, without exception, of all current members. The vote was in person. “All the ‘brothers’ showed their willingness to continue and therefore we did not need to make any changes”, the Ombudsman began by telling the TRIBUNA DE MACAU newspaper.
There are 11 effective members who make up the governing bodies. In addition to the Ombudsman, the Board of Directors is made up of José Joaquim das Neves (secretary), António José Dias Azedo (treasurer), and Manuel Gonçalves Pires Júnior and Bruno Miguel dos Santos Nunes (members). At the general assembly, the president is Leonel Alves, while José Ricardo das Neves presides over the supervisory board.
António José de Freitas completes 24 years at the head of the Brotherhood on December 31st, following another mandate to “continue the work that has been done so far”, as he highlighted.
“With regard to the role of Provider, it will be another two years of intense activity, during which I will continue to dedicate myself to this cause, in order to maintain all the projects that we have implemented over these years, which means a lot of work ahead of me”, he anticipated.
He mentioned the Social Store as one of the main initiatives and has been running for 13 consecutive years. “Aimed at families with fewer resources, our basket of consumer products, which has reached more than 374 homes monthly, will continue to be one of the priorities”, he mentioned.
The offers have been covered in full by several sponsors, but next December will be the first exception, as the Brotherhood was unable to raise funds, although it approached some potential companies. “In fact, we were unable to obtain the necessary money to cover the costs, but this does not mean that the Social Store and the basket will remain unrealized, since Santa Casa will completely assume these expenses”, pointed out António José de Freitas.
“We understand that the economic situation is not the best at the moment, and we can give an example of the difficulties in the real estate sector and the closure of VIP rooms in casinos, as well as the closure of satellite casinos, in addition to political instability at a global level, in which people don't know what could happen”, he admitted, to justify the difficulties in obtaining sponsors.
Perante este cenário de excepção, considera que cobrir os custos é uma obrigação institucional: “Está no espírito da Santa Casa, que tem essa possibilidade, uma vez que eu entendo que não podemos fazer só caridade com o dinheiro dos outros”. Conversely, Santa Casa has already guaranteed support for the first seven months of 2026.
Another goal for the new mandate is to “continue to provide subsidies to needy families who have children studying at Escola Portuguesa”.
Regarding the Congress of Misericórdias spread around the world, the Provider confirms that, even though it is about three years away, there is a need to start preparing for the event. “We are going to organize the Congress and we want it to be as successful as 2019”, concludes António José de Freitas, who is also vice-president of the Ou Mun Newspaper Readers' Charitable Fund, and vice-president of the Kiang Wu Hospital Charitable Association, and also a trustee of the Henry Fok Foundation, missions in which he has been involved “for several years” as “volunteer work”.</description><pubDate>2025-11-24 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>“Beijing Imperial Palace” could reopen in mid-2026</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/palacio-imperial-beijing-podera-reabrir-em-meados-de-2026/</link><description>The “Palácio Imperial Beijing” hotel, formerly “New Century”, is undergoing renovation, after several years of vacancy, as noted by the TRIBUNA DE MACAU newspaper on site. According to the newspaper “Ou Mun”, the hotel development could reopen in the middle of next year
 
Unoccupied for several years, the luxury hotel “Palácio Imperial Beijing”, formerly “New Century”, located on Avenida Padre Tomás Pereira, in Taipa, is undergoing renovation work, as this newspaper was able to see on site. According to information from the local real estate sector, cited by the newspaper “Ou Mun”, this five-star hotel, with activity suspended since 22nd July 2016 and license canceled since 13th January 2017, could reopen in the middle of next year. On the other hand, attracting investments could start soon.
Furthermore, according to the online edition of the magazine “Inside Asian Gaming”, the hotel development is being renovated after the change of ownership that took place before August this year, with the buyer linked to the “Yoho Group”.
The TRIBUNA DE MACAU newspaper tried to find out from the Tourism Services Department whether this body has already received a request for a license to reopen an establishment in the hotel industry or whether it is aware of plans for the same location. However, there was no response by the end of this edition.
At the site, several workers could be seen carrying out work at height. At the same time, one side of the hotel building is surrounded by scaffolding, with construction elevators installed, and the project category is listed as “Repair/Maintenance”, with the construction period valid from August 14, 2025 to May 31, 2026, as we can see.
The construction license indicates that the owner of the project is “Victory Success Holdings Limited”, a company controlled by Alvin Chau, former leader of the Suncity group. However, the contact address indicated is “Treasure Island Office Building 16/F”.
The office address of “YOHO Group” is precisely located at “Treasure Island Office Building 16/F”. Also according to “Inside Asian Gaming”, the transaction involved the executive director of the “YOHO Group”, Mike Lam Hin Wai, owner of the five-star hotel “Yoho Treasure Island Resorts World”, located next to Lake Nam Van, close to Praça de Ferreira do Amaral.
Advertising signs surrounding the building mention words like “Gold Coast Hotel,” “five-star hotel standards,” “open line for tenant recruitment,” and “second quarter of next year.”
It is recalled that in July 2016, the “Palácio Imperial Beijing” hotel was sealed by authorities due to involvement in serious administrative violations and insufficient fire safety. This hotel was also the former location of the “Greek Mythology” casino, which closed on December 31, 2015 under the order of the Gaming Inspection and Coordination Directorate.
The same establishment has been involved in disputes over its property for a long time. In 2017, more than 20 travel agencies affected by the hotel's closure created the “Alliance of the Victims of the Hotel Palácio Imperial Beijing”, demanding 99 million patacas from the hotel, because they were not reimbursed for the money they paid for room reservations.</description><pubDate>2025-11-24 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Macao SAR accumulated “invaluable experience” by participating in the National Games</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/raem-acumulou-experiencia-inestimavel-participacao-nos-jogos-nacionais/</link><description>The Chief Executive attended the closing ceremony of the National Games in Shenzhen and declared that Macau will continue to take advantage of its “unique advantages”, contributing “even more to the construction of a sporting power and promoting integrated development in the Greater Bay Area”.

The curtain has come to another edition of the National Games of the People's Republic of China, after almost two weeks of competitions, for the first time in the history of the event held in three locations, Guangdong, Macau and Hong Kong. The closing ceremony, held in the city of Shenzhen, was attended by the president of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), Wang Huning, who declared the Games officially concluded.
The Chief Executive of Macau, as the main person responsible for the Macau Organizing Committee, also participated in the closing of the competition, having pointed out in his speech that, “in the future, Macau will continue to take advantage of its unique advantages, in favor of proactive integration in the context of national development and at the service of the country, contributing even more to the construction of a sporting power, as well as to promoting integrated development in the Greater Bay Area”.
Earlier, in an event included in the program of the last day of the Games, which took place at the OCT Harbor Theatre, in Bao’an, Sam Hou Fai expressed his thanks to President Xi Jinping and the Central Government for their guidance and support, and also to “all friends of Macau for their contribution to the success of this edition of the National Games”.
He added that the event “demonstrates the successes in the development of China's sporting cause in the new era, opening a new juncture of Chinese-style modernization in the Greater Bay Area, in which, together, they present a new chapter in regional cooperation and the implementation of the 'one country, two systems' principle”.
Macau, “as host and participant, has accumulated invaluable experience in organizing sporting events and achieved its best results since joining the National Games, feeling deeply honored and proud”, highlighted the Government official.
Meanwhile, the Secretary for Social Affairs and Culture said at a press conference held in Shenzhen that, according to estimates, more than two million visitors “were attracted to visit Macau, both to watch the competitions and to travel”.
On the other hand, he highlighted that “all competitions in Macau were held successfully” and that the pavilions and facilities “operated stably”, with emergency measures being taken “with high efficiency”, which allowed the “successful” conclusion of the Games held in the territory”.
In the Macau organization, 479 competitions were held, in five disciplines, with the award of 22 gold medals and 74 silver and bronze medals.
At the closing ceremony, Guangdong tennis player Wang Xinyu, Hong Kong cyclist Ceci Lee Sze-wing and Macau karateka Kuok Kin Hang together began the countdown to the conclusion of the Games. Delegations from various provinces and cities participated in the athletes' parade, with the Macao SAR delegation led by table tennis player Zhu Yuling, as flag bearer.
Outro destaque do espectáculo final foi a série de apresentações culturais e desportivas. Com o tema “As Estrelas e o Mar”, os espectadores puderam assistir a uma panorâmica de toda a cidade, tendo o mar e o céu como pano de fundo e a paisagem urbana como cenário. Foram igualmente integrados elementos tecnológicos, a história de Lingnan e as características culturais da Grande Baía.
After the closing ceremony, the National Games flag was handed over to the governor of Hunan province, Mao Weiming, who will organize the competition in 2029.
The Macau sports delegation participated with a total of 420 members, including 295 athletes who competed in 23 events, having won three gold medals and two bronze medals in amateur sports, in the form of karate.

The “mission” was carried out by Hou Jianguo, president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and secretary of the Party Leadership Group, and Zhu Weidong, deputy director of the office of the central financial and economic affairs commission and deputy director of the office of the central rural work leadership group.
The two sessions were attended by around 1,200 guests, including holders of the Macao SAR's main positions, members of the Executive Council, deputies of the Legislative Assembly, senior officials from the judicial body and from different levels of the Government, among other personalities.
Hou presented the strategic tasks of the “15th Five-Year Plan”, which will guide “the advancement of modernization with Chinese characteristics”, according to an official note. He also shared his opinions, based on the “proposals of the CPC Central Committee for the formulation of the 15th Five-Year Plan for national economic and social development”, on ways for Macau to enhance its advantages and better integrate into the country's general development.
On the other hand, Zhu focused on “the great significance of the fourth plenary session of the 20th CCPCC, the prospects and mission of national economic and social development during the period of the 15th Five-Year Plan, interpreting deeply and in a general and systematic way, the guiding aspects and main objectives in economic and social growth”. He particularly highlighted the seven main objectives, including “maintaining the commitment to achieving notable results in high-quality development” and “further consolidating the barrier of national security”.
Zhu also suggested that, in the 3rd Five-Year Plan, Macau continues to stand out as “a center, a platform and a base” and promote “its adequate and diversified growth”.
In a summary, the Chief Executive, Sam Hou Fai, shared “five reflections” on learning and implementing the spirit of the CPC Central Committee plenary session. First, he said it was necessary to “persist with confidence” in development, reform and innovate with determination. “We must firmly defend the country’s sovereignty, security and development interests, comprehensively, accurately and unswervingly implement the ‘one country, two systems’ principle,” he said.
He also highlighted that it is necessary to “promote the patriotic spirit, boost social vitality and increase the efficiency of governance”, as well as encourage the diversification of the economy and the “sustainable development of Macau society”. Fourthly, he spoke of “potentiating Macau's unique advantages, creating a higher quality platform for opening up to the outside world” and, finally, he argued that it is necessary for the Macao SAR to coordinate with the national 15th Five-Year Plan.
In turn, Zheng Xincong, director of the Central Government Liaison Office in Macau, stated that “the MSAR government team is crucial in implementing the Central Government's decisions as well as in articulating the country's development strategies and boosting Macau's long-term prosperity and stability”. He also urged the government team to unite and lead all sectors of society in learning and disseminating the spirit of the plenary session.</description><pubDate>2025-11-24 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Government will reinforce inspection of associations</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/governo-vai-reforcar-fiscalizacao-as-associacoes/</link><description>The proposal regarding the regime that regulates associations is now ready, indicated the Secretary for Administration and Justice, saying that the matter will be the subject of public consultation. Wong Sio Chak explained that the objective is to clarify the Government's supervisory powers over associations, having argued that it is necessary “to have standards linked to State security”
 
The Secretary for Administration and Justice announced that the proposal document on the regime that regulates associations is now ready and will be subject to public consultation soon. Wong Sio Chak was responding to the deputies, within the scope of the Government Action Lines (LAG), when he also explained that the central idea is to clarify the Government's supervisory powers over associations, specifically which body will be responsible for this supervision and what powers it will have.
“Perhaps, there are many irregularities between different associations, so we have to reinforce supervision”, said Wong Sio Chak, in the Legislative Assembly, pointing out that the regime came into force in 1999, when there were 1,700 associations in the territory. “Now there are 12,315”, he stressed, adding that “at the moment, there is no competent or supervisory entity”.
The government official also stressed that it is necessary to deal with “zombie associations”, that is, those that are still standing, but that have not been functioning “for more than 10 or 20 years”. Furthermore, Wong Sio Chak said that “there must be standards linked to state security”.
It is recalled that the Chief Executive, Sam Hou Fai, had said, in the presentation of the LAG, that the Government would “continue to reinforce the mechanism of interaction and collaboration with associations that love the country and Macau, uniting and mobilizing all possible forces and initiatives”. Regarding this matter, he indicated that existing legislation relating to associations will be “optimized”, “planning and guiding the establishment of associations to promote the continued healthy development of the Macao SAR”.
On the other hand, and with regard to administrative reform, the Government intends to optimize the personnel management regime and reinforce training and support for workers. Between the first quarter of 2026 and the fourth quarter of 2027, the Executive intends to study and define criteria to determine the global staff allocation as well as the number of workers at different levels of each service; review legal diplomas relating to careers, to reduce the variety of special careers and improve the mechanism for acquiring and managing services, in cooperation with the Audit Commissioner.
Regarding public servants, Secretary Wong Sio Chak also said that he expects everyone to take an oath of loyalty to the Macao SAR by the end of the year.
Plan for Coloane Market completed at the end of 2026
The Institute for Municipal Affairs (IAM) is developing the architectural project for the Coloane Market, which is scheduled for completion in the last quarter of next year. The idea is to introduce commercial, gastronomic and cultural elements in that space, indicated the Secretary for Administration and Justice, “with the aim of promoting and revitalizing the cultural and tourist economy of the area”. Furthermore, in 2026, IAM intends to implement, as a pilot project, the first butterfly-friendly garden in Seac Pai Van Park.

At the time, Wong decided to dismiss the employee after he was sentenced to nine months in prison, with a suspended sentence, for driving while intoxicated.
 
Last week, the Court of Final Instance (TUI) rejected the appeal request of a Customs Service (SA) employee, who appealed the dismissal from service ordered by an order from Wong Sio Chak, then Secretary for Security, after the worker was sentenced by the Basic Judicial Court to a nine-month prison sentence, suspended for two years, for the crime of “drunk driving”.
At first, Wong Sio Chak had simply defined a 240-day suspension of duties and lowered the worker's behavior classification to level four. After an assessment by the SA regarding the feasibility of maintaining the employment relationship, in accordance with the “Statute of Security Forces and Services agents”, Wong reviewed the penalty and decided to definitively dismiss the worker.
At the time, the employee requested the suspension of the Secretary's administrative act from the Court of Second Instance, which rejected the appeal, having decided to appeal to the TUI.
The TUI argued that Wong Sio Chak based the decision on “inappropriateness for carrying out his duties as a customs checker due to suffering from alcohol dependence syndrome” and that the return of the worker in question, “even if temporary, caused serious damage to the internal management of SA”.
In the opinion of the TUI, the suspension of the dismissal decision would not fail to cause “serious and effective damage to the management of the body” and “serious damage to the public interest”, and the classification of these damages should “prevail over the probable losses caused to the applicant”, which is why it dismissed the appeal. Unsatisfied, the employee complained about this decision to a conference.
The TUI Collective Court noted that the decision of the former Secretary for Security was “clear and free from any obscurity or ambiguity” and “correct in the reasoning and solution reached”. The applicant claimed to have already “recovered”, which in his opinion should be considered “a well-known fact”, and also requested “the verification of the defects” that he attributed to the decision.
For its part, the Collective Court stated that the accused only bothered to contest, going so far as to invoke “the principle of humanity” as an argument. The TUI also stated that the administration's decision “in no way conflicts with the aforementioned principle”, considering it an “adequate and correct assessment of the relevant factual situation, as well as a fair and correct application of the law”.
The judges of the Collective Court agreed, in conference, to “deem the complaint” filed by the customs inspector to be unfounded.

On Thursday, the head of the Delegation, Harvey Rouse, wrote on social media that he had met with the Macau Secretary for Economy and Finance, Tai Kin Ip. The two talked about how European companies can support “the economic diversification” of Macau and “the continued development” of Hengqin. “I also expressed concern about political issues,” he added.
Asked by Lusa whether he had discussed the detention of former deputy Au Kam San with Tai Kin Ip, the British diplomat did not respond. “We do not comment on the specific content of bilateral meetings,” said the EU Delegation, in a written response.
“In our meetings with Macau authorities, we regularly raise concerns about political and legal changes in the MSAR, in line with the EU Annual Report on Macau, including on individual cases,” the delegation added.
In the annual report, released in September, the European Commission considered that the space for “pluralist voices” in Macau is increasingly smaller, pointing out that the legislative changes that intended to apply the principle “Macau governed by patriots” introduced more restrictions in the territory. Furthermore, he noted
Faced with the criticism – which Macau received with “strong displeasure” and “firm opposition” -, the Foreign Affairs Commissariat of the People's Republic of China in the Macao SAR called on the EU to “immediately stop interfering, in any way, in the affairs of the Macao SAR and in China's internal affairs”.
Recently, after the presentation of the Government Action Lines for 2026, Sam Hou Fai briefly addressed the detention of Au Kam San for the first time. “In August, we had the first case related to the national security law,” he said at a press conference, without mentioning the name of the activist.
The accusation is not yet known and there is no information about who will defend the former deputy.

In the annual cycle ending in October, the average general consumer price index (IPC) in the Macao SAR increased by 0.26% compared to the immediately previous 12 months (between November 2023 and October 2024), informed the Statistics and Census Services Directorate (DSEC). After 12-month inflation reached the lowest level since May 2024 in September, October's data thus interrupted a cycle of 15 consecutive months of slowdown.
In any case, as the TRIBUNA DE MACAU newspaper had already anticipated, Macau is preparing to end 2025 with the lowest annual inflation rate after 2021, when it reached 0.03%. In 2022, 2023 and 2024 there were rates of 1.04%, 0.94% and 0.74%, respectively.
Considering the inflation accumulated in a chain until October, DSEC highlights the increases in the price indices of the “miscellaneous products and services” (+1.99%), “leisure, recreation, sport and culture” (+1.60%) and “education” (+1.17%) sections, and the decreases in “information and communication” (-2.51%) and “transport” (-1.85%). Using the same comparative basis used by governments and economists to calculate the annual inflation rate, the IPC grew 0.21% in bracket A, which covers around half of households with average monthly expenses between 11,000 and 35,999 patacas, and 0.29% in bracket B, which encompasses 30% of families whose average expenses vary between 36,000 and 71,999 patacas.
On the other hand, the general CPI increased 0.60% compared to October 2024, partially driven by the “alcoholic beverages and tobacco” (+2.48%) and “leisure, recreation, sport and culture” (+2.35%) sections. The price indices for “food products and non-alcoholic drinks” and “housing and fuel” rose 0.70% and 0.33%, respectively, mainly due to the increase in the cost of meals purchased outside the home and “take-away” and household rent. The “information and communication” (-2.57%) and “clothing and footwear” (-1.07%) indexes fell in annual terms.
Furthermore, the IPC rose 0.03% compared to September this year, with increases in the indices of “clothing and footwear” (+1.30%), “miscellaneous products and services” (+0.92%), including personal care, insurance, jewelry, goldsmithing and watches, “food products and non-alcoholic drinks” (+0.08%). In the opposite direction, there were drops of 0.27% in the “housing and fuel” sections and 0.17% in “transport”.
In the first 10 months of this year, the average General CPI grew 0.26%, compared to the same period in 2024.
It should be remembered that the expenses with the greatest weight in the inflation calculation are those of the “housing and fuels”, “food products and non-alcoholic drinks” and “transport” sections, with weights of 34.47, 29.47 and 8.33, respectively.

The Statistics and Census Services Directorate pointed to the Government's efforts to promote industries and the recovery of the territory's economy as determining factors
 
PEDRO MILHEIRÃO
 
Last year, cultural industry services generated 9.73 billion patacas in revenue, 12.7% more than in 2023, according to the Statistics and Census Services Directorate (DSEC). DSEC attributed this growth to the role of the Government, which “continuously promoted the development of industries”, and to the “constant recovery of the Macao SAR economy”. Gross value added, an indicator that reflects the economic contribution, amounted to 3.01 billion patacas, translating into an annual increase of 4.7%.
In 2024, revenues of 4.12 billion patacas from the “digital media” area represented 42.3% of the total and corresponded to a year-on-year increase of 9%. On the other hand, this area registered a total of 637 organizations and establishments and 4,189 workers, 10 and 194 fewer than in 2023, respectively.
More specifically, revenue from “film production and distribution” stood at 157.3 million patacas. For DSEC, this value, which translates into an increase of 47.5% compared to 2023, was due to the Government's efforts in “promoting local films” and “increasing the production of activities alluding to the ‘Double celebration’”.
Conversely, revenue from “publications” fell 12.9%, in annual terms, to 529.4 million, having been the only category to record a drop in 2024. Furthermore, publications recorded a decrease in terms of personnel employed (-3.8%), as did “Information services” (-12.2%), unlike radio and television programs (+1.8%), film production and distribution (+8.9%) and the operation of cinemas (+12.3%).
In the area of ​​“creative design”, revenues totaled 2.65 billion patacas in 2024, an annual increase of 11.2%. Between 2023 and 2024, seven more organizations or establishments were also established in the “Creative Design” sector, for a total of 1,530. However, in the same period of time, there were 412 fewer workers registered, since, in 2024, 4,734 people were employed in the sector.
DSEC highlighted the advertising sector, which recorded the highest annual growth in terms of revenue (+16.8%), amounting to 695.5 million patacas. However, it was the category that suffered the greatest loss of workers (-13.3%), with 1,982 people in 2024.
In “exhibitions and cultural shows”, revenue stood at 2.89 billion patacas, a year-on-year increase of 22.6% compared to 2023, “thanks to the constant holding of large-scale shows in the Macao SAR”, pointed out the organization. Revenues from “production of performing arts” grew by 19.9% ​​and those from “operation of performing arts facilities” by 35.7%, to 2 billion and 549.9 million patacas, respectively.
In the overall figure for 2024, exhibitions and shows had 575 organizations and establishments, 29 more than in the previous year. The number of personnel employed was 5,605 last year, 13.3% more than in 2023.
Finally, the “collections of artistic works” generated revenue of 76.8 million patacas in 2024, corresponding to a loss of 35.5% compared to the previous year.
Furthermore, last year, there were 126 organizations or establishments responsible for creations, sales or auctions of works and photography services, 17 fewer than in 2023, and the number of workers also decreased. In 2024 there were 356 people working, 13.8% less year-on-year.</description><pubDate>2025-11-24 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Purchase of L’Arc seen as “good deal” for SJM</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/compra-larc-vista-como-bom-negocio-para-sjm/</link><description>With the acquisition of the L’Arc hotel, SJM’s operating earnings could grow between 8% and 9% in 2026, in annual terms, estimates the investment bank JP Morgan, convinced that the gaming operator did “a good deal”
 
The purchase of the L'Arc hotel-casino should have a positive impact on the operational results of SJM Resorts, considers the investment bank JP Morgan, in an analysis of the deal that was announced on Thursday by the gaming operator and could be concluded on December 18th, still requiring approval from the group's independent shareholders and the Macao SAR Government. With the acquisition of the L’Arc hotel, for 1.75 billion Hong Kong dollars (HKD), the development’s satellite casino will be fully managed by SJM, which, on the other hand, decided to give up the gaming space integrated in the Ponte 16 complex, with its closure scheduled for 11:59 pm on November 28th.
“L’Arc offers 283 rooms – in addition to small shops, parking, etc. – so the price of 1.75 billion HKD is equivalent to 6.2 million HKD or 0.8 million dollars per room – an attractive valuation, especially considering its privileged location on the peninsula”, argued analysts DS Kim, Selina Li and Lindsey Qian, from JP Morgan, highlighting that it is a “good deal”.
Furthermore, they believe the hotel will not require major renovation because “the quality of the rooms and offerings are comparable to existing SJM properties on the peninsula.”
According to the banking group, the 45 tables at the L'Arc casino generated gross revenue of around HKD 1.4 billion last year and HKD 1.3 billion in the first 10 months of 2025. With the acquisition of the hotel, SJM's earnings before interest, taxes, amortization and depreciation (EBITDA) could grow by 8% or 9% in 2026, compared to this year, analysts predict.
“Our approximate calculations suggest that L’Arc could generate an EBITDA – earnings before interest, taxes, amortization and depreciation – of between HKD 300 million and HKD 350 million per year as a self-managed casino, at current levels of gross gaming revenue, which implies a margin of around 20% on total revenue of HKD 1.6 billion to HKD 1.7 billion or more, including non-gaming revenue”, anticipate the authors of the report, also maintaining that “there is potential for growth if SJM increases the number of tables, since L’Arc has a physical capacity for 90 to 100 tables”.
The Gaming Inspection and Coordination Directorate (DICJ) indicated on Thursday that SJM's request to directly manage the L'Arc casino will be "evaluated in accordance with current legislation" and promised to maintain "close communication" with the Services for Labor Affairs (DSAL), to "ensure strict compliance with the commitments assumed" by the operator with regard to the relocation of the 1,025 workers at the Ponte 16 casino, including remuneration guarantees, benefits, working conditions and opportunities for transition to other positions.
 
Casino Casa Real 
has already ceased operations
Meanwhile, the closure operation of the Casa Real casino, assigned to SJM Resorts, took place “in accordance with the planned procedures”, on Saturday morning, informed the DICJ. After the casino closed, at 11:59 pm on Friday, the DICJ suspended the operation of the gaming tables and, in coordination with various services, monitored the process of removal from the respective premises.
In turn, DSAL sent staff to the site to provide clarifications to affected workers and provide information on an open line for further consultation.
After the closure of the Ponte 16 casino, SJM will still have to decide on the future of three more satellite casinos: Landmark, Kam Pek Paradise and Fortuna.

The documentary “Bulakna”, directed by Leonor Noivo, and shown on Saturday as part of the Porto/Post/Doc festival, at Cinema Passos Manuel, focuses on the migration of Filipino women to work as domestic workers in the West.
The “Terratreme Filmes” production portrays two Filipino women, a younger one who wants to leave the country to work as a maid, despite the reluctance of colleagues and friends, and another, older one, who left her work on the radio in her home country to take up this occupation, in the home of a wealthy family in Lisbon.
In an interview with Lusa, the director explained that this film has its origins spread over several years, starting from her childhood in Macau, when she first came into contact with the reality of Filipino domestic workers, “very present in the 1980s”.
"[It was] a very different reality, which caused me some confusion, but was quite accepted in society. I was impressed by the arrival of many women, alone. They appeared, some pulling others, and very young. Sometimes, they were 16, 17 years old. They went directly to people's homes. [...] How come they were alone, away from their family, from an early age, and gave up their intimacy, their personal life, to spend practically their entire lives outside?", he asks.
Later, in 2010, he returned to Macau when working on a film with João Pedro Rodrigues and Rui Guerra da Mata, and came back into contact with this reality – which he found in Lisbon.
He recognized these women “on Sundays”, the day they have to be with each other, and from then on, in research, he realized an industry based on agencies and companies that facilitated the training of these young women and all the emigration logistics.
Drawing a parallel with Portugal in which “the maids came from the villages”, this “reproduction” intrigued her, along with the “issue of globalization”, in which “between the global South and the global North, there is half the world serving another half the world, without the halves being even proportional”, she decided to portray this entire theme mainly following two stories.
In the middle of the two women's journey, between the youngest's desire to leave and the oldest's return to the Philippines, one Christmas, the colonial legacy left in that territory also emerges. The figure of Fernão de Magalhães, who was killed there, occupies a few figures, starting with a theater group that puts this figure into question, stages his death, going through a 'video clip' about his legacy in the region.
"There was a need to understand other points of view. We found several theater groups, in Mindoro and Manila, and ended up working with this group, which was very enthusiastic. Most of them are children of emigrant women. They have this pain, this is an issue. They are activists, they do 'flash mobs', they question the government. There is a reflection there, especially among younger people, about this almost inevitable condition of mothers migrating", says Leonor Noivo.
In this plan, the lives of so many women living in the shadows, in a plane of invisibility, so as not to disturb the master's house, come to light and take on a central role – a deliberate effort, explains the filmmaker, to “make visible” precisely this issue.
"It has to do with this invisibility, with the search for invisibility, even instilled by the places where these women were trained, and which I tried, in the film, to give them visibility. This question of the visible and invisible was an intention", he adds.
“Bulakna”, Leonor Noivo’s first feature film, was awarded at the Valladolid film festival, as best film in the Alquimias section, after having premiered in Marseille, in which it received a special prize for the purchase of rights by the Cinemateca do Documentário.
After visiting DocLisboa, he arrived at Porto/Post/Doc on Saturday, as part of a program with a peculiar focus on the theme of migration. After this presentation, it will go to a festival in Switzerland in 2026, the year in which it will be shown in commercial theaters in Portugal, currently scheduled for the second quarter.
Leonor Noivo, born in 1976, studied Architecture and Photography before joining the Higher School of Theater and Cinema, and is one of the creators of “Terratreme Filmes”, and alongside directing, has worked as a screenwriter, producer, annotator, assistant director, among other roles.
His first documentary film, “Macau Aparte”, dates back to 2001, and in 2005 he made his fiction debut with “Salitre”, having, in 2019, won an award at the Marseille International Festival, for “Raposa”.
 
JTM with Lusa</description><pubDate>2025-11-24 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Hong Kong hosts pioneering exhibition on Pharaonic Egypt</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/lazer/hong-kong-acolhe-exposicao-pioneira-sobre-egipto-faraonico/</link><description>The Palace Museum in Hong Kong opened to the public the exhibition “Ancient Egypt Revealed: Treasures from Egyptian Museums”, which brings together 250 pieces from seven Egyptian institutions, on the eve of the 70th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Cairo and Beijing. The collection, provided by seven Egyptian museums under the auspices of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, is part of the Belt and Road Initiative, which aims to strengthen cooperation in infrastructure, trade, finance and culture.



















The current political context reinforces the importance of the event. In July in Cairo, Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang and Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi agreed to deepen cooperation in renewable energy, technology and cultural exchanges. At the same time, the central banks of both countries signed agreements to promote the use of the yuan in commercial and investment transactions, a measure that analysts interpret as part of the internationalization of the Chinese currency.
“This project marks a milestone in the dialogue between Asia and Africa and consolidates Hong Kong as a laboratory for new forms of collaboration between museums and curators”, emphasized the museum director, Louis Ng Chi-wa.
Open until August 31, 2026, the exhibition could attract around 700,000 visitors, estimated Louis Ng, explaining that the pieces were selected from among the 700 exhibited in Shanghai at the beginning of this year. "In a rare gesture, Chinese President Xi Jinping sent a letter of congratulations on the recent opening of the Grand Egyptian Museum in Giza, in which he mentioned the Shanghai exhibition; it is wonderful news that Egypt is displaying its heritage in mainland China", he added, quoted by the EFE agency.
The exhibition was designed around four themes. “Land of the Pharaohs” explores the political organization and religious world of Ancient Egypt, while “The Legend of Tutankhamun” and “The Secrets of Sakhara” connect visitors to the young king and the latest discoveries in the necropolis near Memphis. The exhibition ends with “Ancient Egypt and the World”, dedicated to Egypt's interactions with other Mediterranean cultures.
Among the main works, a 2.8 meter high quartzite sculpture of Tutankhamun, dating from the 18th dynasty (c. 1550-1295 BC), and a kneeling granite figure of Hatshepsut, one of the most important rulers of Pharaonic Egypt, stand out.
The collection also includes feline and bovine mummies, funerary masks, canopic vases, inscribed stelae, musical instruments, bread, sandals and even a toilet seat, an exceptional testament to domestic life in the Nile Valley and its practices in everyday and funerary contexts. The parallel program includes lectures, guided tours and workshops.
For families, activities will be offered such as making amulets, rebuilding pyramids and creating jewelry inspired by pharaonic designs.
The exhibition arrives in Hong Kong after its season in Shanghai and symbolizes a growing cultural rapprochement between China and North Africa, at a time when Chinese companies, such as the state-owned “China State Construction Engineering Corporation”, are involved in urban development projects in Egypt, including the new administrative capital near Cairo.
