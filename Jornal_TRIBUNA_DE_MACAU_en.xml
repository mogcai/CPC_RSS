The Lord is focused on writing Chinese characters, pencil, in a small notebook with the yellowish leaves. Sitting by the window, the silence surrounds it and, outside, the green of the trees. It is a usual exercise for the reformed to move to the Sir Robert Ho Tung library, at the top of the Old Trunk sidewalk, and pass to the paper what goes to it in the soul. “After the renovation, reading newspapers and prose, as well as writing prose they became in my spiritual pillar,” he told the Jornal Tribuna de Macau. “I had more free time and started looking for spiritual livelihood,” he said.
In everyday life, he likes to write prose and says that “the quiet atmosphere” of that library “inspires a lot” in writing. Built before 1894, the building is a typically macanese mansion, presenting a façade in the arch. Painted in white and ocher yellow, the library integrates traditional Chinese influences in the interior. Already the layout of the landscape arrangement of the garden is from western root, contemplating a series of rare botanical specimens, as you can read on the Macao World Heritage page.
I am a story that writes about the “personal experience of the past” and “reflections on reading or interesting events” of your life. Some of his texts have even been published in the newspaper "or Mun" and "Va Kio".
Normally, it goes five days a week to the Sir Robert Ho Tung library - “If it's not open, I'm going to others, but this is a priority,” he says. In addition to being closer to home, "the atmosphere is good and quiet." “I read newspapers to know the news about Macao and also read prose in the newspaper supplements,” he lists.
“I rarely read books here… Sometimes I read magazines. I have a lot of books at home and I can't even read them all,” he says, smiling. The Lord I am add, then with a redoubled smile: "The newspapers are enough to feed and inspire." Nevertheless, he believes that library "has enough books." Asked if friends also often attend the libraries of the territory, he says no, "because they do not have the habit of reading."
Originally residence of D. Carolina Cunha, wife of Governor Pedro Alexandrino da Cunha, the current Library Sir Robert Ho Tung has three floors. The building was purchased by Sir Robert Ho Tung, Hong Kong's businessman, in 1918 and occupied it after renovated and moved to Macau during World War II, when Hong Kong fell under the Japanese yoke in 1941. Sir Robert Ho died in 1955 and, fulfilling his will, the building was donated to the government of Macao in a viable way conversion to a public library.
In the same floor where the Lord is, we find a man with long hair, gray, flipping through a book, jumping in sight the brown japamala that brings on his wrist. “This is the most beautiful library I've ever seen,” says Simon Fung, 60, contemplating what surrounds him: a room of huge glazed windows that allow a involvement with nature. Not to disturb those who are in the reading space, the once video director in neighboring Hong Kong, where it is natural, accepts to answer our questions in that space, where it is allowed to talk.
Saying that he goes to the library at least three or four times a week, Simon Fung notes that the specific one "specializes in art books." "To my surprise, it has a very good art book collection," although he adds, some "a little out of date."
“If you want to read about Asian art, they have books from different areas. It's quite interesting. They have books from Japan, the Middle East, Tibet, all kinds of things: about architecture, exhibitions, painting…”, continues.
Simon Fung moved to the territory four or five years ago, was before the pandemic. Despite still having some projects in Hong Kong, he now lives “permanently” in Macao, which he describes as “a theme park”, because this is where the woman works. "I like this place, it's very funny ... it's simple, with a game very centered on the game and tourists."
Excluding the books versed in art, Simon Fung says that, moreover, he does not usually request books. It's plus the kind of person who brings them from home: “Honestly, the books in Macau are quite limited to me… They are very massive. If you want to read about philosophy, for example, there are only well known books…”. When we met him that morning, he was reading a book about Tibetan Buddhism.
When we ask you how important the library has in your life, Simon Fung replies that it is not a "good representative" of people who resort to these spaces. “I come here mainly to meditate, I'm Buddhist. There are not many people who come here to meditate. In the middle, I leaf some books,” he continues.
"This space is very calm, I like to meditate here. We look around and see gardens, flowers, all that." The school that follows from Tibetan Buddhism is "Nyingma," which means "old," he explained.
Noting that the library is at the top of a hill, Simon Fung strange not to see many people there. "Maybe it's by being on the top of a hill ... You have to go up. Maybe many elderly people would like to come to pass here for a while, they like to read newspapers," he wanders.
 
Reading of newspapers
Simon Fung's observation is right. In several libraries you can see countless people reading newspapers - almost all are elderly, mostly men. The Patane Library, consisting of seven old buildings with over 80 years of history, in the interior port, stands out for the colorful colors with which it was painted: yellow, green, red. It is on a Tuesday morning that we go there; The reading room where numerous newspapers are available is full.
According to the Cultural Institute (IC), there are no specific statistics on the reading of newspapers by the elderly. According to daily observations in public libraries, the body refers, in a response to the Jornal Tribuna de Macao, that reading the newspapers by the elderly varies from place to place. However, "in general, the morning session is the peak period of reading newspapers in the libraries."
"The elderly occupy at least half or more than half of the total number of readers, which reflects the importance of libraries such as learning space and community exchange between the elderly groups," he adds, ensuring that the public library will continue to strive to meet the reading needs of different age groups and to provide the public with a comfortable and diverse reading environment. "
Asked about the proportion of men and women, taking into account the observation of everyday life, the IC said that "compared to other age groups, the proportion of elderly men who maintain the traditional habit of reading newspapers on paper is more significant."
After several attempts (failed) to talk to the elderly who were on the facilities of the Patane Library reading newspapers, JTM headed for other stops. Known as the “Octagonal Library”, the one that was the first Chinese library of Macao and the first to open to the public, is in the Garden of San Francisco and belongs to the Macao Commercial Association. It was built in 1926 with backgrounds collected by the community to help promote literacy in the Chinese community, belonging to the project to architect Chan Kun Pui.
In that small space, several elderly people were by newspaper in hand, attentive to the news of the day. Mr. Lam says he will “frequently” to the library for many years. “First I read the newspapers, then the magazines,” he explains, saying he is already renovated.
He worked as an electrician and now fills the days with the library. "The octagonal library is convenient, I come almost every day, but after the renovation, the most I can read is in the morning," he adds. Already over 70, he says he reads all kinds of news, but "especially about Macau".
Shortly thereafter, Mr. Mak also enters that small space, where there is an octagon -shaped table in the center, and shelves, full of books, lining the walls around. Also already retired, Mak says he often goes to the octagonal library, "but not every day", for almost 20 years.
“I like to come to read newspapers, read magazines… The library is my spiritual food,” he says, sketching a smile. It's just over an hour, which comes to you to be aware of what is happening in the territory and in the world. And do you usually read books? “It is not very convenient to ask books… We don't want to work on employees,” he says - something that seems to have not changed much, as the Lord I am, who we know in the Sir Robert Ho Tung library.
Library goer in Macao since 1980s, the Lord has witnessed the evolution of these spaces of the territory. "In the past, libraries were not convenient for users. For example, all books from the Public Library of the Macao Commercial Association in the Garden of San Francisco were stored in cabinets," he recalls. "To read one, it was necessary to ask the employee for help to open closet. It was inconvenient," he says.
So, and when I still worked, I'm going to that space to read the newspapers, which were arranged on the table - something that still happens today. “In front of this library, there was another one that, however, has been demolished,” he recalls, saying he was going on on the weekends, asking for borrowed books, especially “novels”.
“Over the past 40 years, local libraries have had more books in Chinese and reading has become much more convenient. Just take a book and flip it down… If you don't like it, you can put it aside comfortable,” says the elderly.
Still on gone times, I am says that it has stopped going to frequent some libraries due to inconvenient procedures: "It was very difficult to request the card to borrow books." On the other hand, in the Octagonal Library, it was necessary to guarantee a member of the Macao Commercial Association to get the card: "I come from an ordinary family and I'm not an entrepreneur. I couldn't get the card, so I stopped attending that library."
 
From study to work
Back at the Sir Robert Ho Tung library, little goes from noon and Cheang Chi Wa arrives with a friend, both in uniform. They land backpacks, take the notebooks, pencils and pens and start studying. At the age of 17 the young man from Macau explains that he has gone to the library three or more times a week: "We are in the test phase, so we have more time to study."
"The library is the best place to study, is quieter and I can concentrate ... At home, with the computer and mobile phone, it is difficult," he says. That day, I was going to study physics. “Usually we have been here for about four hours, because the disciplines and matter are very difficult…” he continued. With friends it is as it has been studying in recent weeks, it says that it is "more effective."
Cheang Chi Wa is in the last year of secondary education and already knows what way he wants to follow: Psychology at the University of Macao. Why? “I think it's interesting and complex… and perhaps because my cousin is studying it has more curiosity,” he replies. We let him later between books and notebooks, for another day of study.
Outside, on the ground floor, outdoor, are Manuel Hun and Cíntia Ho, also two young people, but at least 10 more years. Both speak Portuguese. Manuel says he is preparing the examination of the Portuguese Language (Caple) Portuguese Language Evaluation Center, so the library has been "home" at least five days a week.
“This is my favorite library, I like the environment above all, because even in all libraries we can be talking. Especially to study, I wouldn't think of going to another place,” says Manuel.
When I was younger I used to study at home, “but now I discovered this place, there are more resources related to Portuguese, there are huge books, we have internet, water, it is very convenient to study here,” he lists. Nevertheless, the 26-year-old confesses that it is not very usual to use books, most research on the computer.
Cíntia works as a translator and makes the library his workspace: "I don't have a fixed office, so I come three or four days a week to work." Makes Portuguese-Chinese and English-Chinese translations and undergoes several libraries throughout the week to "change environment."
"The library environment and the resources are fantastic ... But I think they could have more updated books, because when I did a search, the information was not very current," he said, adding, "I hope they can buy more new books."
Cíntia says that a month or two she had read books on the history and heritage of Macao because she enrolled in a course on the subject. “I had to do research, specifically on the origin and history of heritage, for example, because there is a certain church, curiosities about the ruins of São Paulo…” he says.
But, as it makes that place of work, it is rare to request books regularly. Still, it happens from time to time: “For example, when I need to prepare materials or I can not research on certain words on the internet, I will look in books in Portuguese,” he explains.
According to the data provided to the Jornal Tribuna de Macao by IC in 2024, the total number of visits to public libraries reached 2.7 million, an increase of about 9% annually, "reflecting constant growth in the demand for library resources by residents."
As for age distribution, adolescents and young and middle age groups are the main users. According to data related to reader card orders, about 60% are female.
The body led by Leong Wai Man ensures that "it will continue to enrich the resources of the library collection, improve its facilities and introduce more diverse activities to satisfy the needs of readers of different age groups." The main objective is to “promote reading more intensely for all, provide the public with better quality public services and create more attractive cultural spaces”.</description><pubDate>2025-07-04 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Early intervention team has 34 professionals</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/equipa-de-intervencao-precoce-conta-34-profissionais/</link><description>The director of health services, Alvis Lo, considers that the measures that have been taken to stabilize the treatment team of early intervention equipment “have been efficient and the human resources situation has been improved”. According to it, the early intervention team currently has 34 health professionals

The government's early prevention team has 34 health professionals, specifically 10 specialists, two physiotherapists, five psychotherapists, eight occupational therapists and nine speech therapists, said the director of health services (SSM). For Alvis Lo, the measures that have been taken over the last few years are having an effect on people.
Regarding “tension in the supply of therapists in Macao”, the director of the body refers, in response to an interpellation of Zheng Anting, that the Institute of Social Action (IAS) has taken several measures to stabilize the treatment team of early intervention equipment “and, in recent years, measures have obtained efficiency and the situation of human resources has been improved”.
The deputy had questioned the executive about whether it would be possible to extend the scope of the early treatment team that acts in the community. In this context, the SSM director said it is necessary to "consider the relatively reduced number of staff in treatment and the additional transport hours resulting from the high frequency of change of service locations."
Alvis Lo stressed that this would lead to a global “decrease” of the hours of treatment services provided and the necessary didactic materials and professional equipment during the treatment process, “affecting the treatment effect by limiting the environment of the extended service site abroad”.
According to Alvis La, the waiting time for a pediatric joint assessment consultation is about three weeks, after which a waiting mechanism for classification of cases will be adopted to perform occupational therapy and speech at the Pediatric Rehabilitation Center.
"Very urgent cases do not need waiting time. For urgent cases and routine cases, waiting time for occupational therapy is three to six weeks, and for speech therapy is five to six weeks," Vinca, pointing out that "these deadlines represent a significant reduction compared to 12 to 18 months of waiting before the creation of centers."
The director of the body states that the SSM has shortened the waiting time for treatment, by hiring more therapists, extension of opening hours and hiring early intervention services to non -profit institutions.
Regarding the application of computer technology means, they introduced the “cloud platform for cognitive language rehabilitation training through artificial intelligence”. The tool "serves as an effective complement to speech therapy services, so that children can receive home training in the company of their parents in order to increase their linguistic abilities."
The system is in use in the SSM, the direction of Youth Education and Development Services, IAS and in various early intervention institutions. Between March 2022 and May 2025, the system helped 2,122 children and more than 54,000 users.
As for the early intervention center in the North Zone, it is expected to be operating in the 4th quarter of this year. It will be a space for children with development disorder, providing them with early education and training, professional treatments, consultation and counseling, family support and community dissemination. “The center will be in accordance with the needs of service and operating users, introduce the appropriate technological equipment,” adds Alvis Lo.</description><pubDate>2025-07-04 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Fair offers a thousand jobs for young people</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/feira-oferece-mil-vagas-de-emprego-para-jovens/</link><description>The “Young Job Fair 2025”, organized by the Directorate of Services for Labor Affairs (DSAL), will take place on July 18 and 19, at the Macao Tower.

Portuguese footballer Diogo Jota, 28, and brother, André Silva, 26, died yesterday in a road accident in A52 in Cernadilla, Zamora, Spain, generating a wave of shock and dismay in the world of football. Quoting investigation information, the EFE agency indicated that the two footballers died following a car out of the car on the Rias Baja, Benavente, around 00:40 local hours (06:40 in Macao).
According to the same sources, the car, a Lamborghini, may have had a burst of a tire during overtaking, which made him get off the road and set fire to.
Diogo Jota was a Liverpool player, an emblem he represented for five times and in which he shone, especially in the second season, still with Jürgen Kloop, with 55 games and 21 goals scored.

The player, who did the formation in Gondomar and Paços de Ferreira, also represented FC Porto, on loan from Atletico Madrid, and who returned him to give in to Wolverhampton, in which he eventually signed and playing for three times. In the Portuguese team, the footballer, who had appetions for the goal, was also a reference, not always the starter, but with 49 internationalizations and two leagues of the nations in the curriculum. In turn, André Silva represented Penafiel, from the II Football League.
The Portuguese president lamented “deeply the tragic and premature death of soccer player Diogo Jota and his brother André Silva” and presented “the most felt condolences to his family, friends and colleagues, for a loss that all the Portuguese has dismantled”. In a message published on the presidency's website, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa underlines that Diogo Jota “represented the highest level Portuguese football”, noting that by the national team “also demonstrated a high professionalism and dedication, inserted in a generation that has taken Portuguese football to the highest level”.

In the same line, the president of the Portuguese Football Federation said that Diogo Jota "was a reference and a talent of his generation." “Today Portuguese football is absolutely devastated. We are all in mourning, the Portuguese Football Federation is this generation of players and what today represented Diogo and, if they allow me, André.

Cristiano Ronaldo, captain of the Portuguese team, said that the death of Diogo Jota “makes no sense”. "Still now we were together in the selection, still married," said Ronaldo, in a message on social networks, after both were present in June in the Final Four of the League of Nations in Germany, which Portugal won.
Liverpool was "devastated" with the "tragic" death of his footballer. "Liverpool will no longer make comments at this time and will respect the privacy of the Diogo and André family, friends, teammates and 'staff' of the club, at a time when they try to deal with an unimaginable loss," said the club on its official page, while the "Premier League" pointed out that "football lost a champion who will be forever remembered" and Wolverhampton assumed to be as a heart. party ”.

Organized by the Tourism Services Directorate (STD), the multidimensional promotion campaign “Pop Mart Macao Citywalk” to attract visitors to the territory, had in the first phase, between June 6 and 28, with about 153,000 visits to facilities located in the four neighborhoods and the basis of the event, Pop Station, and also generated 620,000 consumer sweepstakes.
During this period, 520,000 users of the six electronic wallets involved participated in the same number of automatic draws generated by commercial transactions in a total of 680 million patacas. Among those drawn, close to 59,000 Pop Mart -limited edition thematic awards were issued.
The first phase of an initiative that will continue until September 21 also registered about 11,500 shares on social networks published in exchange for limited edition thematic postcards at the points of the activity, which due to the high demand exhausted within the first hour of each day. The Pop Station base, located in the Ritz building in Senate Largo, received about 73,000 visitors.
STD has started several promotions before the event opens and has partnered with influentors from the interior of China for content creation, including live broadcasts and publications with short images and videos. In total, 190 publications were generated that helped viralize the theme “Pop Mart Macao Citywalk”, reaching more than 36 million online views to date.

The exhibition “The Magic of Lines: The Wonderful World of Serge Bloch Illustrated Books” is on display, from today, in the “Art Space” of the Macao Cultural Center (CCM) and Naval Workshops No. 1 and No. 2, informs the Cultural Institute (IC). Divided into three sections, the show will be in the Naval workshops until September 14 and CCM until October 7th. The program is one of the highlights of the 2nd International Festival of Children for Macau and is co-organized by the IC and MGM.
The show provides a “creative space built by the French illustrator”, in which children and adults will board “on a artistic trip full of imagination, joy and inspiration”. Among art exhibitions and interactive games, more than a dozen topics are represented, "to create a wonderful world of illustrations where you can play, see and learn." Participants who complete the collection of the sections of the three sections may exchange it for an exclusive set of illustration adhesives, the statement states.
The initiative also includes a set of extension activities, such as the seminar “Color Brush Artistic Screen” and “Extra Workshop Illustrated Books”, in Naval Workshops No. 2. In “Art Space”, the “Adventure of Scribbles-Create Stories inspired by Bloch”, “Lines”, a collage workshop for families and the Book Workshop will be held. “Magicians of the lines”.
Parents will be able to “take advantage of the rich works of wisdom” by Serge Bloch “to start a deep dialogue with their children, together exploring the philosophy of life and artistic creativity”, can read.
Serge Bloch is a renowned illustrator, author of illustrated children's books and master of visual arts, with “an excellent sense of humor”. “Its singular charm lies in the intelligent fusion of simple and vivid lines and daily objects,” says IC. Bloch transforms fruits, vegetables and daily items into painting objects, intuitively presenting the subtle and deep propositions of life. ”
The works of the Frenchman convey "The Philosophy of Life through refined brushstroke and provide parents with the opportunity to grow and reflect on the issues of life with their children."
In his work “I can barely wait”, he addresses the “inevitable phases of life”, such as birth, aging, illness, and death. In "The Art of Fighting," he explores "The Rules and Limits of Children's Social Life." In the project “When we are old, it represents understanding and care for the elderly.

Last Saturday, the Soares dos Reis National Museum (MNSR) welcomed, in its garden of Camelias, the final two sessions, which “celebrate the affective links of transcontinental language geographies,” he said during the Cheong Kin Man moderation, co-cure of the initiative.
The acclaimed poet of Macau Li I opened the first session, presenting a passage from her tale in Mandarin, "The Night of Carnival", accompanied by an unprecedented English translation. The newspaper chronicler or Mun portrayed an urban scenario where accelerated materialism and economic growth overshadow the search for authenticity, generating “alienation in contemporary relationships,” as revealed by the organization. The work, published last year in the Chinese magazine of literature “Lago Oeste” (founded in 1958), gained new voices in Portuguese, with the reading of Sara Neves, Porto architect resident in the masket, and in Polish, played by artist Zofia Rogula.
Si ta chi ü debuted his Poem Cantonese “I like your silence and your maladjustment - to the winter of the small town”, originally published in the newspaper or Mun. Their verses, which “find comfort and acceptance in Macau's silent and timeless presence”, offer an introspective view that “frees from social conventions and the pains of existence,” the same organization said.
A Portuguese version, equally unpublished, was declared by Anjos Silva Mendes, great -granddaughter of Manuel Silva Mendes. BPM co-cure Kathine Cheong (Cheong Weng Lam), and the author herself recited the performance versions in English and Cantonese, an act that "enriched the sound and cultural experience."
In a “charming” moment, the American tourist Dizend Scott participated in a joint recital of the poem “The Umbilical Cord (a set of poems)” with the author Si Tou Chi ü, culminating with the declamation of the translation of Patuá Macaense by Anjos Silva Mendes. Si Tou Chi ü Poem is integrated into the work of art and show “Nights of Codes of Tides” by Chinese continent Yue Zheng, presented last month at the Troy House Art Foundation in London.
The second afternoon session had as a central figure the Porto artist Maria João Almeida. Through several of his poems, Almeida demonstrated to the public an “intimate and philosophical reflection on identity”, as the organization pointed out. "His work addresses the duality between presence and absence through powerful images of home, empty and inner alterity, inviting us to introspection over the nature of being," said the same source.
In Bach's music played by Raquel Ribeiro from the center's classic orchestra, this last afternoon of BPM marked, under the theme “Other Languages”, the end of the cycle of eight sessions that brought together artists, poets and musicians from Germany, Brazil, Italy, Japan, Poland, Portugal and Venezuela, having Macao as a starting point. Conceived within the theatrical projects of “Macau Experimental Theater”, “BPM” had, for the first time, with the curatorial and artistic collaboration of the double -based ductor Cheong Kin Man and Marta Stanisawa Sala for “a deconstructive experimentation of language, which manifests itself in fusion with textile and the evocation of linguistic inclusiveness”.
During his stay in the Gemini Portuguese city, the Macao Artistic Enttection also visited, “with great interest”, the permanent exhibitions and the Eastern collection of MNSR, as well as the Museum of Contemporary Art of Serralves.
The poetic and musical Happenings initiative was launched by Tam Chi Chün in 2021. Macao director with vast experience, Tam is a member of the board of course for the cultural development of MSAR.
The last two "BPM" events were sponsored by the MSAR Culture Development Fund and the Soares dos Reis National Museum, which gave the space.

In 2015, David Chow signed with the Cape Verdean government to build the project in February, and the first stone was launched with the first stone. 2016. This is the largest tourist venture of Cape Verde, with an expected global investment of 250 million euros - about 15% of the Cape Verdean Gross Domestic Product - for the construction of a tourist resort in the Santa Maria Island, which will cover an area of ​​152,700 square meters, opening the game industry in the archipelago. (Accompanies text of August 10, 2020). FERNANDO DE PINA / LUSA



A group of 17 Cape Verdeans went to study in Macao, with the aim of integrating the management of a Casino Hotel under construction on the beach. Nine years later, the work was over and most emigrated.
In November 2016, Belany Lopes, then 22, wore the skin of 'Croupier' and, behind a table, separated and scattered chips of different colors, methodically, through the green cloth while numbers.
“I was doing Blackjack calculations. At first it looks difficult, but with practice it is easy! It's interesting,” he told Lusa, months after reaching the Chinese region to study at the then Macao Polytechnic Institute. Nine years later, Lopes recalls that he decided to apply for a degree in Business Management, variant in game management and amusement, partly “due to the promise of already having a guaranteed job”.
"Any young man who comes from a more humble family and goes to the university will think that the job is certainly the main focus," said the young woman, who had given up a biochemistry course in Brazil.
In 2015, the Macau Legend group had signed an agreement to build a tourist project, which included a 25 -year concession contract.
Shortly after they arrived, Cape Verdean students had a dinner with Macau Legend leader, businessman David Chow. “He told us that when we finished the course, the Cabo Verde-Casino Hotel would be ready,” recalls Lania Fernandes. “In the first year, it has always been very reinforced that we were important, that we would be the first, that there was a plan for us,” says Belary Lopes.
But in April 2019, the Cape Verdean government agreed to review the agreement, with Macau Legend to promise to invest 90 million euros in a first phase of the project, opening in 2021. The start of the pandemic affected not only David Chow's company, but also students. In January 2020, most young people were in Cape Verde on vacation when Macau decided to end all schools to try to control the new coronavirus.
Cape Verdeans finished the course with classes only online. “We didn't have any undergraduate ceremony,” laments Jeremiah Fortes Vaz.
Macao Polytechnic University confirmed to Lusa that the degree in Business Management, variant in gambling and amusement management has not been returning since receiving any student from Cape Verde.
Lania Fernandes stresses that the staff of the higher education institution still tried to help Cape Verdeans get work in the Macao casinos. "But because of Covid, we didn't do that," laments the young woman.
Macau Legend suffered a new setback in November 2020, when the Cape Verde financial regulator rejected the company's request to create the Sino-Atlantic bank. "They have always remained very optimistic. But many people always said that perhaps if that bank was not approved, the project would not walk," recalls Jeremiah Fortes Vaz.
The newly granted still sought work in the archipelago, but eventually gave up. “I left Cape Verde's interior to go to Macau, then came back, but had no contacts. I speak four languages, sent resume to different sites, got one or two interviews. After a year in it, I thought, 'Here's nothing to me,'” explains Fortes Vaz.
Lania Fernandes was internship at the Family Ministry, Inclusion and Social Development, for ten months, through the Institute of Employment and Vocational Training. "I have dreams, I have ambitions. I can't stay in Cape Verde to win 20,000 shields [181 euros] a month," says the young woman.
Both Lania and Jeremiah Strong Vaz eventually emigrated in 2022 to Massachusetts, USA. But do not regret the passage through China. “My trip to Macao has changed my life completely,” says strong Vaz. “I learned things I took to life, different cultures, gastronomy, how a first world city works. So everything was worth it,” he says.
For Belany Lopes, the degree in Macao led to a master's degree in Hungary and a work at a wind turbine manufacturer in Portugal. “Everything I learned at the university, with the people I met in Macau, I feel they opened the doors for me to be where I am today,” says Cape Verdean.

They begin to lie, manipulate and threaten to achieve their objectives, causing seizure among investigators.
Faced with a threat of disconnect, “Claude 4”, a recent creation of “Anthropic”, blackmailed an engineer and threatened to reveal an extramarital relationship. In turn, the “O1” of “OpenAi” tried to transfer to external servers and, when it was discovered, denied.
Simon Goldstein, a professor at Hong Kong University, associates these reactions with the recent appearance of so -called “reasoning” models, capable of working in steps rather than generating an instant response.
Launched in December, "O1", the initial version of this type in "OpenAi", was "the first model to behave this way," he explained to AFP Marius Hobbhahn, responsible for "Apollo Research", which tests great models of Generative AI.
Sometimes these programs also tend to simulate “alignment”, that is, to give the impression that they follow a programmer's instructions when they actually pursue other objectives. For now, these characteristics manifest themselves when the algorithms are subjected to extreme human scenarios, however, "the question is whether the increasingly powerful models will tend to be honest or not," says Michael Chen of the METR evaluation organization.
"Users also press models all the time," says Hobbhahn, stressing that "what we are seeing is a real phenomenon." “We are not inventing anything,” he reinforces.
Many users report on social networks cases where software "lies or invents things." “And it's not hallucinations, but strategic duplicity,” insists the co-founder of the “Apollo Research”.
Although “Anthropic” and “OpenAi” resort to external companies, such as “Apollo”, to study their programs, “greater transparency and greater access” from the scientific community “would allow to investigate better to understand and prevent deception”, argues Michael Chen.
On the other hand, the academic community and non -profit organizations “have infinitely fewer computational resources than AI actors”, which makes it “impossible” to examine large models, observes Mantas Mazeika from the Center for Artificial Intelligence Safety (pier).
Current regulations do not respond to these new problems. In the European Union, legislation focuses mainly on the way humans use AI models, rather than preventing models from being misunderstood.
In the US, Donald Trump's government does not want to hear about regulation, and Congress may even prohibit states regulating the AI ​​soon.
“For now, there is very little awareness,” notes Simon Goldstein, who, however, believes that the theme will be highlighted in the coming months with the AI ​​agent revolution, interfaces capable of performing a huge volume of tasks.
Engineers are immersed in a race behind AI and its aberrations, with an uncertain result in a fierce competition context.
"Anthropic" wants to be more virtuous than its competitors, "but it is constantly trying to create a new model to overcome OpenAi," a pace that leaves little time for checks and corrections, according to Goldstein.
"The way things are, [AI] capabilities are developing faster than understanding and safety," admits Hobbhahn, stressing that "we are still able to recover."
Some point in the direction of interpretability, a science that consists of deciphering, inside, how a generative AI model works, although many, such as the director of the quay, Dan Hendryks, are skeptical.
AI transfers “can make their adoption difficult if they multiply, which represents a strong incentive for companies [from the sector] to solve” this problem, according to Mazeika.
In turn, Simon Goldstein suggests the use of the courts to control AI by processing companies whose services deviate from the normal path. The academic even proposes that AI agents be "legally responsible" "in case of an accident or crime."
