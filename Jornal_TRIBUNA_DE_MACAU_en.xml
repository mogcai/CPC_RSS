The canteen, located just at the entrance of the facilities, gives a more modern image and is the most notorious change resulting from the works. In this new school year, the educational institution will have 810 students, plus 5% in annual terms. For now, there will only be missing an English teacher. According to the director, Acácio de Brito, "only the DSEDJ authorization is missing, but this should be resolved soon." In addition, according to the Jornal Tribuna de Macao, psychology and guidance services will suffer “some restructuring”

With the improvement works of the facilities completed and ready to show the Portuguese Prime Minister, Luís Montenegro, who visits the educational establishment today another school year at the Portuguese School of Macao (EPM), on a first day only for the reception of students by the holder teachers and the class directors. Today it will be more seriously, with the beginning of classes themselves.
For the new school year, students and teachers will soon have better restoration conditions, as the new space, which is now just at the entrance of the facilities, is large, modern, in “Open Space” style and integrates a bar. In addition, the recreation area has been increased and there is to register the renewal of the resorts with the Sports Pavilion, with more showers for both sexes, now in a total of 15 in each sector. The music room was also remodeled, as well as the teacher room diverted elsewhere.
These improvements will be shown to Luís Montenegro and Foreign Minister Paulo Rangel, who visit the school this morning.
For 2025/2026, the EPM is maintained the growth tendency of the number of students in recent years, now 37, more than the previous school year. There is, therefore, an increase within 5% in the number of enrollments.
With regard to classes, and according to data provided by the director of the school, there is no change, remaining 39 in total, distributed by 15 in the first cycle, nine in the second, 10 in the third and six in the secondary.
The reception to the students was made between 9:30 am and 1:00 pm, with the Jornal Tribuna de Macao witnessing the usual Aishaphama, both students and parents, with them to queue to address issues related to the students.
One of the parents heard by this newspaper said he hoped the school “can maintain the quality of education”, however, congratulations on the remodeling of some facilities. "They are frankly better," he said.
On the issue of teachers, he said that "last year there was a lack of teachers, but this year apparently is resolved." On the other hand, he stressed that “a fixed school calendar”, believing that “everything can go well, that there is a good start of the school year, to maintain the quality of education and that the school has more representativeness in Macao”.
Another of the parents who was waiting for a time to deal with matters at the Secretariat expressed votes that "students are happy and learn a lot." Pedro Santos Silva and his wife of Chinese ethnicity, who have been in the territory for seven years, have their daughter to study at EPM since the primary. "She loves this school and like her mother - who speaks Mandarin to her, while I talk in Portuguese - she did training in Portugal, we wanted our daughter to come here, because it is the ideal to perfect the Portuguese language," he said.
Meanwhile, the hundreds of students enrolled for this year were distributed throughout the facilities, and may be seen, at the entrance, some conviviality between old colleagues and friends, who proved after another long vacation period. And also those who first knew each other for the first time, that is, the little ones, 5 or 6 years old, who left the kindergarten to attend the EPM for the first time.
In the case of primary education, all classes are in a two -story block, separated from the remaining cycles, which are in a different wing.
Our newspaper was one of the small rooms of the little ones and listened to Professor Lia Dalte: "Being with these classes is a challenge that has their charm and that we hug with all the pleasure, because it's all new, from children to families." The teacher hopes that "above all Portuguese language and culture prevail, as is the Chinese and Macaense, making the possible to incorporate and articulate these cultures."
Going down to the outdoor main courtyard, there were many of the older students to adapt to a new life-free life, following the decision of Youth Education and Development Services (DSEDJ) to prohibit the use of telephone appliances within schools.
As all students have to leave smartphones in the cliffs at the school entrance, the conviviality environment was completely different. Football and games, as well as running among the little ones now replace the addiction that has entered the young people. At least in schools this changes radically with this measure, which seems to gather consensus, or at least acceptance by students.
All students, from the second cycle, heard by the Jornal Tribuna de Macau recognize that the decision is positive. "We can do more things together, which is important," said one of them. "It's a little strange to be at school without using mobile phones in the break, but this will favor our conviviality," said another. "I think not everyone accepts this measure, because it has advantages and disadvantages, but the essential thing is that we can live more, this is the reality," said another student. “From now on I will play soccer so as not to think about the mobile phone,” said one more.
 
English teacher awaits DSEDJ authorization
Regarding the start of the school year, it is known that almost all subjects have attributed teachers, even though there is an English teacher, with special license, who has not yet seen authorized by DSDEJ their inclusion on the list of 86 teachers that the school houses. "We hope this will be resolved quickly," Acácio de Brito told the Jornal Tribuna de Macao, stressing that, otherwise, "there was a positive response to all special licenses requested."
In prior to another academic year, the EPM official expects “everything to run for the best”. Regarding school results, he points out that "if we want to compare it with last year, we had good results, when it has been a practice in the EPM, measured by internal assessment, which the school classifies, and external, which is caused by exams."
The director notes that "almost totality entered the first option, and only one student did not have the possibility of completing secondary education and another did not enter the first phase, but I think it will enter the second." On the other hand, he stresses, “we had good results in a discipline that I think is important too, that it is Portuguese, and therefore we are on the good way”.
Regarding the new year, the official says that the school wants to "develop areas that are more marginal, namely the appreciation, and so we have the new facilities to support the most needy, namely who have some special education situations."
Além disso, reforça, “atenderemos também em termos pedagógicos à valoração daquele programa que iniciámos no ano passado, no sentido de que todos os alunos até ao 4º ano beneficiarão de uma hora por dia de português, para que cheguem ao 5º ano e sejam capazes de resolver os problemas”.
“Muitas vezes os alunos têm dificuldades, mas se fizermos uma análise estratégica a essas dificuldades verificamos que o problema é principalmente na comunicação, ou seja, o não domínio da língua impossibilita muitas vezes um bom resultado a algumas disciplinas”, atesta, rematando que “esse trabalho está a ser feito e há um processo de continuidade”.
Acácio de Brito also talks about “reinforcement in some structures that have to do with the mastery of Portuguese and also some processes that will still be subject to some restructuring”, specifically psychology and guidance services. "At this time there is a new responsible for this service and soon we will launch a contest to hire a psychologist," he said.
About Montenegro's visit, Acácio de Brito says that "it is always good," adding that the head of the Portuguese government "will have the opportunity to see, because it will be accompanied by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Paulo Rangel, who was here a few months ago, significant improvements in school." The Prime Minister will also find that the EPM "will always be a lighthouse space of a certain sense of portugality, being a school in China, but also cultivating the values ​​of culture and Portuguese language."</description><pubDate>2025-09-10 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>China wants to reinforce “strategic” communication with Portugal</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/actual/china-quer-reforcar-comunicacao-estrategica-portugal/</link><description>Prime Minister Luís Montenegro (D) during the meeting with the President of the Popular Republic of China, XI Jinping (E), which took place at the Great Palace of the People, in Beijing, China, September 9, 2025.

China and Portugal are countries with a “deep historical heritage” that share “a spirit of openness, inclusion, initiative and autonomy,” said Chinese president in Beijing, in a meeting with the Portuguese Prime Minister, reiterating that the two nations resolved “the issue of Macao through friendly negotiations”. In recent years, cooperation in various areas has achieved “important results”, establishing “a model of mutual respect and reciprocal gains between countries with different social systems and different national realities,” said Xi Jinping, quoted by the Xinhua agency.
Noting that this year is the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the comprehensive China-Portugal strategic partnership, Xi assured that “China is willing to reinforce strategic communication with Portugal, to guide bilateral relations in the right direction, to make good relationships even better and to contribute even more to the prosperity and progress of both countries and the world through solidarity and cooperation”.
The Chinese leader maintained that the two countries should “continue traditional friendship, confidence and mutual support”, “deepen the alignment of development strategies”, “expand practical cooperation” in the domains of innovation, environment, oceans and pharmaceutical sector, among others, and stimulate “cultural, educational, tourist and scientific exchanges”. At the same time, he stressed the importance of “taking advantage of the unique role of Macau as a bridge and fully using mechanisms such as the Economic and Commercial Cooperation Forum between China and Portuguese -speaking countries, to achieve a higher level of mutual benefits”.
"The more turbulent and interconnected the international panorama becomes, the greater the need for China and Europe to reinforce communication, reinforce mutual trust and deepen cooperation," he said, appealing to Portugal to work with Beijing for sustainable, stable and healthy development of European China-Union relations.
In this context, he insisted, China is available to "strengthen multilateral cooperation with Portugal, to truly practice multilateralism, safeguard the UN authority, defend the free trade system, and promote the construction of a fairer and more reasonable global governance system."
 
Compliments to Guterres, Durão and Costa
According to the Lusa agency, at the beginning of the meeting at the Great Palace of the People, Xi stated that “Portugal is a good friend of China”, and praised the international role of previous prime ministers António Guterres, Durão Barroso and António Costa.
Xi began by saying that it is "a pleasure" to know the prime minister. “Welcome on the visit to China. I remember that in 2018 I made a state visit to Portugal, which left me a beautiful impression, and deep,” he said, taking the opportunity to ask Montenegro to transmit “sincere greetings” to the head of state, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa.
“Portugal plays an important and unique role on the international stage,” he said, highlighting that he has “good relations” with UN Secretary-General António Guterres, European Council President António Costa and former president of the European Commission Durão Barroso.
"Portugal was also the first country in Western Europe to sign with China cooperation acts under the" One Rota, a Route "initiative, and the first country in the euro zone that issued titles" in Chinese currency, he said.
In turn, Montenegro stressed that, in the international context, Portugal and China have maintained "on many occasions a base of cooperation and sharing of values." "China has a key role in the global and international context, a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council and we expect your contribution to build bridges between peoples, bring some of those who are in conflict, promote peace, promote multilateralism, promote respect for human rights," he said.
Montenegro began by mentioning that “it is very tasteful” that he makes this official visit to China and transmitted to Xi the greetings of Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa.
The prime minister expressed agreement with Xi's words about how the transition from the Macao de Portugal administration to China in 1999 took place. “We had in the transition from Macau a good expression of the way we were able to converge and managed to ensure the cultural identity and the relationship between the special administrative region of Macau, Portugal and China,” he said.
 
Ukraine motivates Portuguese appeal
On the other hand, Montenegro took the opportunity to tell Xi that he has his close relationship with Russia so that it is possible to “build just and lasting peace” in Ukraine. Later, on a visit to the forbidden city, he was confident that this Ukraine appeal will not be ignored.
"I believe that the appeal, coming from a friendly country, coming from a European Union country, coming from a country, such as Mr. President XI Jinping also emphasized, who has an identity of values ​​and route, will not fall into a rotor bag," he said.
Saying not being able to answer for the Chinese president, Montenegro has manifested convinced that Portugal has done what is required for this conflict. "My conviction is that, to our dimension and without any kind of pretentiousness, we do what is required to a nation with history and the international respectability that Portugal has. We are builders of bridges, we are protagonists of the approach between peoples, we are advocates of peace, defenders of values, respect for people's rights," he said.
Montenegro considered that, at the meeting with Xi, it was limited to “being frank, loyal and direct in the appeal” so that China's ability to influence can be developed and “bring practical results” to Ukraine.
"We have an active diplomacy that gains credit so that I can speak on behalf of the country, appealing to this sense of collective responsibility on a global scale," he said, emphasizing that the country has a Portuguese who is the United Nations Secretary-General, another who is president of the European Council and another that was 10 years chairman of the European Commission.
The prime minister stated that Portugal "maintains an open dialogue" with China, which he classified as "partner" in many domains. "I have no problem saying this, while I guarantee Portugal and our fellow citizens that we are a country with a position and intervention within the European Union, our NATO partners, and today also within the GOOD WILL coalition that seeks to ensure just and lasting peace in Ukraine," he said.
Montenegro argued that “regardless of many differences” that Portugal has with “some perspectives of China”, this country “and its president have affirmed values ​​such as multilateralism, values ​​such as respect for international law”. "With this also meaning respect for human rights, respect for the access of all citizens to levels of fulfillment, development, which are in line with the values ​​we advocate in Portugal," he said.
Montenegro's agenda in Beijing began in the morning with the deposition of a wreath in the monument to the heroes of the people, in Tiananmen Square, accompanied by the wife and Paulo Rangel, Minister of State and Foreign Affairs, Manuel Castro Almeida, Minister of Economics and Territorial Cohesion, and Graça Carvalho, Minister of Environment and Energy. In addition to the meeting with XI, Montenegro first met with the President of the National Popular Assembly of China, Zhao Leji.
After visiting the forbidden city, he went to a meeting with the Chinese counterpart, Li Qiang, before heading to Macao. On Thursday and Friday, will make an official visit to Japan, with tickets for Tokyo and Osaka.
 
Montenegro thanks Chinese support during the financial crisis
Luís Montenegro thanked Xi Jinping for China's support to Portugal during the financial crisis. "At the level of our bilateral economic cooperation, it is my duty to tell you that we do not forget, on the contrary, we have very well present and respect the bet that China has developed in the Portuguese economy, in one of the most critical moments of our country, when the financial crisis," said the Portuguese prime minister at the beginning of the Chinese president. As had been highlighted moments earlier by Xi, Montenegro also considered that in recent years the two countries have reinforced ties "in various sectors of the economy, from energy to bank, from health to water supply." "Our conviction is that we can continue to follow this path on the basis of trust," he said.
 
Portugal “is a reliable and confident country” for investments
The Portuguese Prime Minister said that, in his visits to China and Japan, he wants to bring the message that Portugal “is a reliable and confident country” for economic investments. Asked if you will be able to get the message to the potential Chinese investors although the program does not include an economic seminar -as happened at the previous visits of the then Prime Minister António Costa, in 2016, or President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, in 2019 -Montenegro rejected this perspective. “I believe that the statement that this program is quite short is only referring to the temporal dimension, because from the point of view of content, this program is vast,” he countered, in statements to journalists, highlighting the importance of direct contacts with Chinese leaders. He also pointed out that Portugal is already “enjoying several investments that originate in China and have been levers for the transformation and economic development of Portugal”. "It is our intention to contribute to our coming here so that we can also open doors to which more Portuguese companies can find in the Chinese market the destination of their products and, therefore, also increase our export share for this geography," he said.

In an interview with the Jornal Tribuna de Macao, the Good Lar Alliance promises to “strengthen, with full force, the Macao's birth and family support system”, concretely so that the birth allowance will increase to 20,000 patacas. Also defends more benefits to consumption
 
What reasons led to the covenant list of good home to apply for the Legislative Assembly?
- List number 6 - Good Home Alliance (GLA) is led by the General Association of Women and constituted by the educational, industrial and commercial, youth, professional and social services sectors. Assuming the idea of ​​candidacy centered on “fighting for the rights and interests of women and children, and the happiness of families, building platforms for young people and creating a future for Macao,” our list competed for two editions of legislative elections and got direct suffrage seats.
Over the course of eight years of course in which our team has participated and discussed policies, as well as pronounced for the people, ABL always remembers fulfilling the promises left in the candidacy for the elections. We have already achieved the realization of the “childhood assistance allowance” in the monthly value of 1,500 patacas, the continuous increase in birth allowance to 6,500, the launch of the “reimbursement program in the treatment of medically assisted procreation”, the realization of the “conciliation regime for the causes of family”, the regular implementation of the “subsidy for caregivers”, the optimization of leisure zones and installations Children's fun in various zones, among other policies and beneficial measures for residents in general and support for family development.
However, the low rate of birth and population aging remains. In addition, under the impact of the complex internal and external economic environment, among other factors, the sustainable development of society faces challenges. ABL will strive to realize the perspectives and desires of residents for a better life. Our political program continues to focus on the rights and interests of women, children and families, the benefits for the elderly and needy groups, and the effective increase in the sense of happiness, safety and gain of residents. At the same time, it focuses on boosting the government to make efforts in many ways to improve employment and business environment in community neighborhoods, raise the effectiveness of governance and improve urban construction, to build a good home for residents, that is prosperous, harmonious, happy, dynamic and healthy.
 
- How is this candidacy from the rest?
- GLA values ​​diversity, having brought together a team of participation and discussion of policies composed of representatives of various sectors. Our candidates are from different professional areas, have already held several professions, have participated in society for a long time and do practical things for the people. On the other hand, the list includes members of various MSAR advisory bodies, with vast professional, social and political experience, which provides the team a more solid base for political participation, and allows our team to transmit, even more scientific and rationally, social conditions and public opinion, as well as further residents.
ABL is a young and dynamic team, having long valued the formation of young political and social services. We have actively formed young cadres for the principle of “Macao governed by patriots”, which reflects our idea of ​​“building platforms for young people”. The average age of the team is about 39 years and we have several candidates born in the 1990s, with the younger candidate only 26 years old. This demonstrates a team full of dynamics.
ABL does practical things for the people, serves the needs of residents, humbly auscultate public opinion and actively convey the voice of the people. For a long time, we have worked deeply in the community through different platforms. Regularly adopting inquiries, studies and community activities, the team knows the current situation of society and what residents think, using this information as an important basis for making suggestions to the government. For example, when we successfully fight for maternity leave, creation of paternity leave and childhood assistance allowance, and housing policy in five scales, we always adopted, first, questionnaires, on -site visits, among other measures, to collect opinions, in order to transform public opinion into viable and viable and viable policies. This shows our professional and pragmatic attitude, oriented to the people with the heart, and to serve society.
 
- What are the priority problems and what solutions do they propose to solve them?
- The family is the core of society. ABL attributes importance to family development, presenting good solutions to low birth rates and population aging. We will fight for the rise in the birth allowance to 20 thousand patacas, extension of the childhood assistance allowance for children aged six, extension of maternity leave to 90 days, increased paternity leave to 10 days, as well as creation of children's care and prenatal care. We expect, through “laws and subsidies working simultaneously, and the social costs to be supported together”, reinforce, with all the strength, the system of support for birth and family.
Regarding the elderly and vulnerable groups, we advocate the continuous increase in the value of the pension for the elderly, the subsidy for the elderly, the disability pension and the disability subsidies and for caregivers. In addition, we advocate the increase of resources for early treatment and special education services, and the rapid review of the “regular social security adjustment mechanism” so that social benefits meet the real economic environment more and fully ensure the quality of life of the elderly and needy groups.
To boost the professional rise of young people, we will try to stimulate the accreditation exams of qualified frames to 10,000 patacas. In addition, we will work to provide diverse training on entrepreneurship, in order to take advantage of businesses started by young people to create more jobs for young people. We will boost beneficial housing policies oriented to young families and the acceleration of the realization of the economic housing exchange regime, to create, with full force, a system of support for “studies, employment, entrepreneurship, professional career and home acquisition” of young people.
ABL knows that “guaranteeing the economy” means “ensuring employment” and “ensuring the well-being of the population”, and good economic development is support for social benefits. Given the lack of clarity in the community economic environment, we will continue to fight for the launch and reinforcement of various consumer benefit measures, to reduce residents' living costs and give “running water” to small and medium enterprises. At the same time, we will boost the accelerated creation of “Community Community Areas with its own characteristics”, development of embellishing and revitalization work, change to various commercial regulations, and simplification of the licensing process, to facilitate the investment of more capital and resources for the development of the community economy. Moreover, in order to promote the healthy development of the labor market, we will boost the widening of professions and the increase in the number of employment vacancies within the “specific employment plan + training”. At the same time, by improving the non-resident workers management regime, and improving the policies to support unemployed residents, looking for employment and changing employment, we will be fully committed to ensuring employment, stabilizing the economy and contemplating the well-being of the population.
 
- What are the expectations in terms of elections? How many seats do you expect to win at the Legislative Assembly?
- GLA is convinced that it will be struggling to participate and discuss policies. Each vote is very important, so our team will do as much as possible to obtain the recognition and support of voters, safeguard the voice of GLA in the hemiciclo, continue to serve residents and fully strive to build society, so that policies advocated by GLA can gain continuity. Let's build a good home and a good future together!
 
JTM and Electoral Act
In accordance with the electoral law, the Jornal Tribuna de Macao continues to cover the campaign for legislative elections on September 14.

On the other hand, it continues to make efforts to decade the electricity grid network
 
Pedro Milheirão
For 2025, the Macao Electricity Company (CEM) has budget 839 million in investment, minus 24.35% (270 million) of what the company effectively invested last year (about 1.11 billion), according to the CEM annual report. The data consulted by the Jornal Tribuna de Macao indicate a decreasing trend, if we consider that 1.27 billion patacas were invested in 2023. This year, investments for the transport network represent about 62.57% (525 million patacas) of total expenses, and investments related to energy production constitute 16% (134 million).
The construction and optimization of the network includes the project of the Tai On Substation, in the new urban area A, which will be completed and placed on this year. The substation “will provide energy to public housing, government buildings and public facilities in the zone, as well as provide energy to the dedicated 22kV network for the macao light meter system”, predicts the company.
CEM also plans to build an integrated storage and loading system of solar energy in the Tai Substation, in order to “feed the substation and store energy during periods of solar production peak, reducing network energy consumption by substation and contributing to the reduction of carbon emissions”.
In this sense, “fixed photovoltaic devices will also be installed on roofs and pavilions”.
The concessionaire also foresees to expand the East Parking Park of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge Border, “to meet the loading needs of transfronist electric vehicles”. “To meet the future growth of demand, the loading infrastructure in this parking lot is prepared to expand to accommodate up to 300 loading spaces,” explains the concessionaire. It also plans to develop the use of fiber optic among public parking parks “to reinforce data transmission between loading stations”.
In addition, “to improve the level of intelligence of the electricity grid, CEM has launched an investigation project on the Macao Electric Network Development Plan in the context of carbonic neutrality. This project focuses on the analysis of the business factors and the long-term vision of the CEM, exploring in depth the needs of updating and transformation of network facilities in the process of decarbonization, digitization and intelligence”.
 
Reached full coverage of smart counters
In 2024, "CEM reached the full coverage of smart counters in Macao, officially launching a new energy management model. The smart accountant system system has successfully collected data from over 280,000 smart counters." "With the full coverage of smart counters throughout the territory of Macao, CEM will continue to use this technology to optimize operational monitoring functions and data collection data from the power supply network."
The hundred predicts that total energy consumption will increase 3.3%to 6,443 GWh this year, also projecting 6,222 GWh. The company also expects this year, “the management of the network's vulnerability will become part of Macao's laws and regulations”.
"Building a smart, green and low-carbon macao is the aspiration of the government and, as the city's only electricity company, we are fully committed to supporting the development of Macao's Baixa-Carbono," said the company, quoted by Macau Business magazine. However, one hundred recognizes that to achieve carbon neutrality, "it is necessary to update and optimize technology throughout the electrical system industry chain."
“Looking to the future, the CEM will closely follow the strategic guidelines of the central government and the Government of Mashes in the construction of a society of reduced carbon footprint and the achievement of 'double carbon' goals,” read the report. "We will fully promote sustainable development, technological innovation and digital transformation, continuing to make efforts to optimize infrastructure, improve service quality and ensure energy supply stability."</description><pubDate>2025-09-10 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Shaquille O'Neal among NBA legends for event in Macau</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/shaquille-oneal-entre-lendas-da-nba-para-evento-em-macau/</link><description>Antigos jogadores do basquetebol profissional norte-americano, como Shaquille O’Neal e Tim Hardaway, vão marcar presença na primeira edição da “NBA House” em Macau. O evento interactivo para adeptos decorrerá entre 8 e 12 de Outubro, período em que estão agendados dois jogos de pré-temporada da NBA, que irão colocar frente-a-frente as equipas actuais do Brooklyn Nets e do Phoenix Suns

Five days of interaction with former players of the world's leading professional basketball league will allow fans of the sport in Macau to participate in the first edition of “NBA House”. The free event, promoted by NBA China, will take place in the venetian, between October 8 and 12, bringing to the past names of the past, such as Shaquille O'Neal, Tim Hardaway Sr, Stephon Marbury, Shawn Marion, Mitch Richmond and Deron Williams.
This is an “immersive basketball experience that celebrates the convergence of game, music, fashion and technology,” according to a National Basketball Association (NBA) statement.
During the activities, clinicals and games of the sport will be organized in real enclosure, including an interactive half court, consisting of “an unprecedented LED basketball source”, which, through a thematic tunnel, “combines NBA elements with sculptural patterns inspired by Chinese classic art in Macao's urban landscape,” says the promotional text.
In addition, a NET -themed photographic cabin will be installed, made up of “Three Infinite Rooms”, where fans can take pictures and buy products from the team. A Suns Tennis Vault will also offer the opportunity to gain tennis. On the other hand, an experience will be made available at the Replay Center NBA, providing fans to “get into the skin” of an NBA referee, as well as an inflatable NBA theme will be intended for children's fun.
In the presentation of the NBA House, NBA Director-General for Asian Continent, Wayne Chang, said the event will be "an immersive celebration of culture and technology involving the current game."
The US Professional Basketball League promotion program moves Macao for the first time, after having passed other stops, such as Brazil, Canada, France, India, Mexico, the United States and the United Kingdom.
These interaction sessions with local fans, whose inscriptions are already open to interested parties, will take place in the same period of the preseason games as Brooklyn Nets and Phoenix Suns teams will play in the territory, with the matches having the venetian arena. The first meeting will take place on October 10th and the second two days later.
The Nets currently feature German Dennis Schröder, the Golden Medal of the World Championship Fiba 2023, the American Cam Johnson, a member of his country's team, and NBA's Australian Ben Simmons. On the suns squad are Kevin Durant, four times Olympic gold medal and NBA champion on two occasions, Devin Booker, also with two gold medals at the NBA Olympic Games and four times Bradley Beal.
The NBA has not played pre-season games in China since 2019, when Daryl Morey, then Director-General of Houston Rockets, demonstrated on social networks support for old protests in Hong Kong. NBA commissioner Adam Silver refused to punish Morey, but Chinese state television CCTV stopped broadcasting NBA games, a hiatus that the US league said it cost $ 400 million in lost recipes.

The idea is to adopt remote inspections and centralized monitoring. For the respective acquisition, CEM established a letter of intent with a subsidiary of the China Southern Power Grid International
 
The use of robot dogs is in the plans of the Macao Electricity Company (CEM) to achieve this year the introduction of an intelligent substation inspection system.
The aim is to replace traditional handicraft inspections with robotic inspection dogs, monitoring platforms and energy systems, adopting remote smart inspections and centralized monitoring. Pioneer in intelligent inspection, the robotic dog is equipped with thermal infrared images, partial discharge sensors and high-default chambers, allowing precise detection of equipment failures and the emission of alerts in real time.
The hundred says in a statement that the system operates daily for 24 hours, conducting comprehensive surveys in the substation within hours. "Your advanced sensors and AI algorithms can identify hidden risks accurately, significantly improving efficiency," the text stresses.
Its introduction "not only establishes the foundations for intelligent energy maintenance in Macao, but also injects a new impetus into the energy development of the great bay, boosting the regional energy sector for new levels."
The theme was on the table at a meeting held between CEM and China Southern Power Grid International (CSGI) integrated at the Session of the Guangdong-Macau Energy Trade Committee.
The two parts analyzed the progress of collaboration in the first half of the year and exchanged ideas about the latest developments in the Electricity Markets of Macao and CSGI, having been signed with China Southern Power Grid Trade, Canton, a letter of intent to acquire an intelligent inspection system.
According to CEM, this collaboration marks the “significant progress” of Macau company in the field of intelligent energy operation and maintenance, “further promoting its digital transformation into alignment with national strategic initiatives, accelerating the construction of new electrical systems and fostering intelligent integration”.
These efforts, the company adds, "aim to provide the since of a more stable, reliable and efficient power supply system."
Bernie Leong, chairman of the CEM Executive Committee, said this partnership "not only highlights the close collaboration between the two parts, but also underlines the company's critical role and mission in conducting the local energy transition."
Chen Shengran, president of CSGI, expressed that CSG's smart inspection system "will inject new scientific and technological innovations into the digitization and intelligence of Macao's energy supply equipment."
The letter of intent was set by Simon Young, director of the Department of Transport and Distribution of CEM (Electric Network Management) and Xu Jinglun, president of China Southern Power Grid International Trade (Canton).

Two Hong Kong consultants have improved their annual predictions, justifying them with the appreciation of Renminbi and the positive performance of investors in different markets
 
Pedro Milheirão
The game sector registered gross revenues of 4.45 billion of Patacas in the first seven days of September, according to the investment bank JP Morgan. The daily average of 635 million thus corresponds to a growth of more than 10%, in homologous terms. Despite a slowdown in gross revenues, in relation to July and August, analysts DS Kim, Selina Li and Lindsey Qian indicated that this would be expected, considering that, historically, September is usually from the “weaker months” to the sector in Macao.
Still, the JP Morgan team predicts that the game's gross game revenues in September 10% and 13% of the same month last year, for values ​​comprised between 19 billion and 19.5 billion patacas. In annual terms, it would translate a 14% to 15% increase to about 63 billion or 64 billion.
It is recalled that the revenues of the game in August rose 12.2% in annual terms to about 22.16 billion patacas, according to the direction of inspection and coordination of games. In July, gross revenues exceeded the first time of 22 billion patacas since the pandemic, and the previous postcovid maximum dating back to May this year, when the billing reached 21.19 billion, driven by the growth of visitors during the “golden week” commemorative worker day.
In addition, the comparison with the 24.26 billion noted in August 2019, the pre-pound year demonstrates a 91%recovery above July (90.5%) and May (81.7%) levels. Closed the August accounts, the amount accumulated in the first eight months of this year was 163.05 billion patacas, translated an increase of 7.2% for the same period of 2024, when the billing reached 152.11 billion. Between January and August, the total gross revenues equivalent to 82% of the first eight months of 2019 (198.22 billion).
 
Two more consultants revolve forecasts
Correct Jefferies Hong Kong now hopes that the game's revenues ascend to 248 billion Patacas later this year, against the 237 billion scheduled for July. These new projections are thus in the “top of market estimates and superior to the government's predictions,” the company said in a memorandum quoted by the Gggrasia portal. In addition, the same consultant foresees that game revenues in the third quarter register an increase of 13.8% to 15.3%, in homologous terms.
The CSSA also reviewed its forecasts for 2025 and 2026, with expected annual increases of 1.3% and 3.5%, respectively, to $ 245 billion from Hong Kong and 255.6 billion. According to the Ggrasia platform, the consultant's analysts Jeffrey Kiang and Leo Pan believe that the appreciation of Renminbi against the US dollar will benefit the sector growth of the game for the rest of the year.
In 800 respondents, “47% of them revealed that they would increase their budget for the game if Renminbi valued against Pataca,” explained CLSA. The corrector also expects casinos to have a lot of movement during the golden week of October, on the occasion of China National Day. "33 of the 38 hotels we follow are exhausted," said the CLSA analysts.
In turn, Jefferies Hong Kong believes that “entertainment events” and “new properties” such as the “Capella” hotel and “Londoner renewal work” will boost this growth. Other reasons are the fact that the gamekeepers offer “more incentives to players” and gamblers benefit from “new wealth”, generated by positive performances in real estate markets, actions and cryptocurrencies, according to Anne Ling and Jingjue Pei.</description><pubDate>2025-09-10 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Prepared Instructions for Medical Devices</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/preparadas-instrucoes-para-dispositivos-medicos/</link><description>Medical Devices and Industrial Lamps in Surgery Room of Modern Hospital.

Instructions on the use of medical devices, as well as the online classification platform will be launched in the second quarter of 2026, said the president of Isaf. The supervision and administration regime of medical devices will come into force on July 1
 
The second quarter of next year is scheduled for the launch of the online electronic classification system on medical devices, as well as the publication of instructions for its use, the Institute's president said for Pharmaceutical Supervision and Administration (Isaf), Choi Peng Cheong, in response to an interpellation by Deputy Wong Kit Cheng. It is recalled that the supervision and administration regime of medical devices will come into force on July 1, 2026.
According to the new law, medical devices are classified into different classes according to their risk level in order to implement corresponding class management. “Isaf will, through a series of dissemination and promotion and consultation services actions in all aspects to the sector, help the sector clearly understand the content of the new law, including medical device classes and supervision and administration standards,” read the answer.
Under the legislation, aesthetic treatments involving medical procedures should be performed by qualified health professionals to exercise the profession in appropriate health facilities, and the provisions related to professional liability insurance should be fulfilled.
“In order to further promote the development of the Big Health industry, health services are monitoring the legislative works of the legal regime for the exercise of activity of private health care institutions, with a view to studying the creation of a new category of 'day hospital',” recalls Choi Peng Cheong.
As already mentioned in the final report of the public consultation on the subject, the idea is that day hospitals can perform surgeries without hospitalization and specialized medical procedures that should be performed earlier in hospitals, including state -of -the -art aesthetic medical procedures, medically assisted procreation technologies. The idea is to “create conditions for the sector to provide more diverse health care services and fully meet the different needs of residents and visitors”.

A set of works that are part of the Neo-Realism Museum Collection in Vila Franca de Xira, Portugal, will be available in the territory, exploring the ability of art to “understand and transform society”. The pieces will be exhibited at the Vila Franca de Xira City Pavilion, integrated in this year's edition of the Macao International Art Biennial, which will be inaugurated on Friday.
The initiative arises in response to an invitation from the Cultural Institute (IC) made to the Portuguese Consulate General in Macau, which collaborated with the Portuguese Institute of the East. “Two years after the successful exhibition of Vila Nova de Cerveira, the choice falls, in 2025, in the city of Vila Franca de Xira who will present a remarkable set of works from the Collection of the Neo-Realism Museum,” an institution that, since 2007, “assumed increasing importance in Portuguese contemporary art”, can read in the press release by the consulate.
The exhibition “establishes a deep dialogue on the urgent social and political issues of today, constituting a pertinent critical reinvention of the real”, in tune with the theme of the Macao Biennial: “Hello, what brings you here?”.
The curator, by David Santos and José Apples de Carvalho, is inspired by a post-minimalist artistic movement that emerged in the 1960s-70, “which radically questioned the place of art in society, rejecting the formalist and autonomous conception of modernist art and alternatively proposing the understanding of art as an instrument of political intervention”.
“Inspired by Hal Foster's 'progressive postminialism' theorized, the exhibition explores the ability of art to understand and transform society, and results in a potent 'of the real' and 'to'-conceptual reinvention that requires active conscientialization of its own responsibility in the construction of artistic meaning,” the statement explains.
The public is thus invited to a critical reflection on discursive regimes, in a saturated world of images, proposing a new conceptual attitude to understand the complex relationships between the creative process, image and language.
The inauguration is scheduled for 6:30 pm, at the TAP Seac Gallery, and will be attended by the Portuguese Ambassador to the Popular Republic of China and the mayor of Vila Franca de Xira. The show will be evident to the public until November 16.</description><pubDate>2025-09-10 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>"Studio Creepy" celebrates "Halloween" for the second year in a row</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/studio-creepy-celebra-halloween-pelo-segundo-ano-consecutivo/</link><description>Melco will celebrate Halloween again this year with a new edition of “Studio Creepy”.

Emperor Naruhito's nephew and second in the line of succession after his father, the 19 -year -old received a black and lacquer silk crown, which marks the beginning of his royal adult life.
“Thank you so much for giving the crown at the age of majority,” said Prince Hisahito, wearing traditional yellow costume for minors, bowing before Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masako, who smiled at him.
"I will fulfill my duties, aware of my responsibilities as an adult member of the imperial family," he told parents at the ceremony in Tokyo, which was attended by several members of the royal and family family.
Although the Emperor has a daughter -Princess Aiko -the 23 -year -old was part of the royal family's succession rules, who predict that only men can continue the imperial lineage -which, according to legend, dates back to 2600 years -, opinion polls show a high public support on the climb of a woman to the throne.
"For me, it makes no difference whether a woman becomes an imperative or a man," said Yuta Hinago, Tokyo barista.
The 33 -year -old believes that there may be “space for more flexibility” in the rules of succession.
"The genre doesn't matter," he told AFP Minori Ichinose, 28, a part-time counter, adding that he supports the idea of ​​an imperator.
Japan has debated the real succession for decades, with an important government panel to recommend in 2005 to pass to the eldest son, regardless of sex. This seemed to pave the way for the Emperor's daughter to rise to the throne of chrysanthemum, but the birth of Prince Hisahito the following year silenced the debate.
Politicians have been slow to act, “postponing the issue” and a solution in view of the young Hisahito, said Kenneth Ruoff, director of the Japanese Study Center at Portland State University.
Traditionalists claim that the “uninterrupted imperial line” of male succession is the basis of Japan, and major changes would divide the nation.
According to the postwar constitution, the royal family has no political power. With the daughters of royalty forced to abandon the family after marriage, a modernizing proposal would oblige them to continue their public duties after marriage.
Conservatives, in turn, press for the royal family to bring distant relatives back to the group. But it is not clear if these men would be willing to give up their careers and freedom to continue the lineage.
Prince Hisahito said in 2025 that he “had not yet deeply reflected” about his own prospects of marriage, which could be challenging.
Historically, women who marry royal members face intense pressure to have boys and become a constant target of rumors.
Empress Masako, a former high -level diplomat, fought for years against a stress -related disease after joining the family, which some attributed to the pressure to have a child. Empress Emérita Michiko, mother of Emperor Naruhito, also suffered from diseases caused by stress.
Prince Hisahito's sister, Mako, married her university boyfriend Kei Komuro. It has faced intense tabloid coverage of the allegations that Komuro's family would have faced financial difficulties, leading the former princess to develop a complex posttraumatic stress disorder. The couple left for the US, where he recently had a baby.
Despite the broad public support for changing the rules of succession, far from pomp, people are focused on other issues, such as increased inflation, royal historian Hideya Kawanishi told AFP.
"If the people who usually support (the imperators) become a little more expressive, politicians can become more serious," said associate professor Kawanishi, who tends at Nagoya University.
"But when the ceremonies end, society, including the media, calms down and moves on," he noted.
