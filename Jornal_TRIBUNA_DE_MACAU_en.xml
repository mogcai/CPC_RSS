Despite the drop in the number of crimes, the director of the Judiciary Police warned that investment scams, false customer support and online purchases have remained at a “high level”. On the other hand, the number of cyber attacks in the Macao SAR stood at a daily average of 5,700, 10% below the figure in 2024. Inquiry cases related to gambling rose 63%, for a total of 2,314, which Sit Chong Meng attributed to the “addition of the crime of ‘exploitation of illicit exchange’” to the gambling law
 
PEDRO MILHEIRÃO
Last year, the losses caused by fraud using telecommunications amounted to 300 million patacas, close to the value recorded in 2023, said Sit Chong Meng, director of the Judiciary Police (PJ) yesterday. As revealed, there were 277 cases of telephone fraud and 533 of cyber fraud, corresponding to 21.8% and 41.2% fewer incidents in 2024, respectively.
Sit Chong Meng, who was speaking at the Lunar New Year meeting between the PJ and the media, explained that, despite the general drop in fraud cases, investment fraud, false customer support fraud and online shopping fraud have remained at a “high level”. As part of the fight against fraud, the PJ arrested a total of 178 members of criminal networks involved in fraud schemes last year. With the help of the telecommunications sector, 545 phishing sites were also blocked.
In fact, in 2025, "there were three cases linked to 'deepfakes' with artificial intelligence (AI) related to fake investments. Some criminals pretended to be influencers to convince people to invest in fake projects." Others presented themselves as “investment platform assistants and enticed people to write down their personal details and bank account number”, reported Sit.
The director of the PJ said that the organization is studying “deepfakes” and AI technologies that could help authorities intercept false messages. "We want to see if there are measures to prevent these scams", he said, noting that "for now there is no technology to intercept these messages. This has to do with our right to privacy", he clarified.
Sit Chong Meng said the police have been cooperating with telecommunications operators “to find out whether it is possible to intercept these fraudulent messages before people receive them”.
Throughout the year, banks assisted the police by stopping payments in 683 cases, totaling more than 84 million patacas. In turn, the PJ reported 551 suspicious accounts to the banks.
The PJ continues to focus on the integrated strategy “Prevention”, “Recovery” and “Combat”, guaranteed the organization's number one, noting that “the anti-fraud program has demonstrated remarkable effectiveness”, with more than 50 thousand visits throughout the year and the issuance of around 5,100 high-risk alerts.
With regard to cybersecurity defense, the Cybersecurity Incident Alert and Response Center (CARIC) detected an average of 5,700 attacks per day, which represents an annual decrease of 9.5%. Still, the PJ considers it to be “a high number”, which keeps the Macao SAR’s cybersecurity in a “quite serious” situation, warned Sit.
In this context, 295 alert communications were issued, the highest number in recent years. For Sit Chong Meng, the PJ has done “a very good job in prevention”. “We issue a lot of alerts, but the number of cases is few.” In 2025, CARIC received only 23 incident reports, of which four were cyber attacks, the lowest figure in recent years.
 
Legislative review increased crimes in the game
Contrary to scams and cyber attacks, the PJ opened 2,314 investigations and complaints related to gambling, an increase of 62.6% in annual terms. The organization justified this increase with the “addition of the crime of ‘exploitation of illicit exchange for gambling’ and the improvement of the statistical method in this context”.
Furthermore, “due to the increase in the number of tourists and gambling activities in the mass area (…) it is easy for there to be collisions between people, thus creating opportunities for thieves, which has led to an increase in cases of harm to physical integrity, theft and illegitimate appropriation”. In response, Sit Chong Meng stated that “communication with gaming companies has been improved to reinforce security personnel in hotels”.
Until the end of December, the police resolved 567 cases of “exploitation of illicit exchange for gambling”, including 492 cases of illegal money exchange and another 75 related to offenses of this nature. These cases resulted in the arrest of 867 people and the seizure of 94 million Hong Kong dollars in cash and tokens.
"We are currently facing a big challenge because these money exchange groups do not do this in public spaces. Our colleagues are also reinforcing work in casinos. These crimes are generating more problems because lately there have also been more cases of robbery", acknowledged Sit.
"Victims are usually also members of these illegal exchange groups. They exchange in hotel rooms because it is more difficult to be detected. And criminals often take advantage of these opportunities to steal from these rooms," he explained.
The 192 cases of illicit gambling loans and the 28 cases of kidnapping registered last year correspond to annual declines of 23.8% and 40.4%, respectively.
 
Three homicides due to “emotional problems”
Similarly, serious and organized crimes related to gambling continue to maintain “a downward trend and low rate of occurrence”, highlighted the director.
On the other hand, last year, three cases of homicide were recorded, whereas in 2024 there had been none. The director of the PJ, however, clarified that these cases were not related to gambling and that “they only had to do with emotional problems or labor conflicts”.
In relation to drug crimes, authorities registered 61 cases of trafficking and 29 of consumption, representing respective increases of 24.5% and 93.3%. Sit Chong Meng believes that this increase is due to “the deepening of the concept of ‘information-driven criminal investigation’”, better cooperation with neighboring regions and the resolution of several cases.
Over the past year, Macao SAR and Zhuhai police investigated 29 cases of cross-border drug trafficking, with Macau authorities arresting 31 individuals. With regard to drug addicts, of the 146 people registered, 75 were foreigners and 51 residents. “The number of foreigners who use and traffic drugs is growing, [among] those who work in Macau and seek comfort through drugs.”
In another context, arson incidents fell by 34.9%, to 28, in the same time period.
In the overall year 2025, the PJ initiated 14,308 criminal cases, including 6,916 investigations and complaints, 5,502 summary investigations and 1,890 requested due diligence. The total number of cases opened increased by 1.84%, compared to 2024, and 15.48% compared to 2023.
 
They committed sexual crimes against minors
In general, almost all crimes of a sexual nature increased between 2024 and 2025, except for rapes, which fell from 48 to 32 and cases of sexual harassment, which rose from 31 to 28, according to statistical data released by the Judiciary Police. Sexual abuse of children soared by 73%, to a total of 26 cases last year, while there were four cases of recourse to prostitution of minors, three more than a year before. Crimes of pornography against minors more than doubled, from 14 to 28. Episodes of sexual coercion increased from eight to 13 and situations of exploitation of prostitution rose from seven to 12, statistics reveal. The 12 “other crimes against sexual self-determination” represent almost double the previous year (7), while seven “other crimes against sexual freedom” were recorded, repeating the figure from 2024.</description><pubDate>2026-02-06 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Lawyers cannot appeal the decision of the State Defense Commission</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/advogados-nao-podem-recorrer-da-decisao-da-comissao-de-defesa-estado/</link><description>The Chinese national flag (R) and Macau's flag are seen behind a lotus flower sculpture in Macau July 25, 2009.

The Legislative Assembly has already received the bill from the Commission for the Defense of State Security, which will amend the Basic Law of the Judicial Organization, creating a special authorization for lawyers who want to intervene in national security processes. Basically, the Commission, which is chaired by the Chief Executive, has to give a binding opinion on whether or not the judicial representative will intervene in the process. Lawyers cannot appeal the decision, in addition, they must provide a series of information, particularly about family, nationality and connections to organizations or individuals abroad.

The proposed law from the Macao SAR State Security Defense Commission (CDSE), which introduces, through an amendment to the Basic Law of Judicial Organization, a special authorization for lawyers to deal with cases related to national security, has already been submitted to the Legislative Assembly. According to the first version of the proposal, the judge's decision on whether or not to authorize the judicial representative to deal with the case - and based on the “binding verification opinion” of the Commission, which is chaired by the Chief Executive -, “there is no room for complaints or contentious appeals”.
In judicial proceedings, whatever their nature, as long as the judicial authority has “founded reasons” to believe that there is a need to protect the interests of State security, “the judicial representative must obtain special authorization from the competent judge before intervening in the process”, it can be read. In this sense, the lawyer must present the application to the judge, “accompanied by the forensic power of attorney, proof of the applicant's capacity as agent, information relating to the members of the household, nationality and connection with organizations or individuals abroad and others”.
The judge may then require the judicial representative to present, within two days, “other information that he considers essential for verification”. Both the application and the information must be sent to the State Security Defense Commission, “so that it can issue a binding verification opinion on whether or not to grant special authorization to the judicial agent”.
If in the “urgent” judicial process the judge has officially granted “prior authorization to the judicial representative to intervene in a specific procedural act”, and in the event that the Commission’s “binding verification opinion” is negative, the judge must cease the authorization granted to intervene in the process.
On the other hand, if after granting the special authorization there is “a fact demonstrating that the respective authorization should not be granted to the judicial agent”, the judge is obliged to “immediately suspend” the effectiveness of the authorization granted.
 
New composition
Furthermore, the proposed law states that the CDSE assumes the main responsibility for “defending the security of the State” and is “subject to supervision and accountability before the Central People's Government”. It is responsible for assessing whether certain matters are “in the interests of State security and making decisions with enforceable force”.
As the spokesperson and Secretary for Administration and Justice, Wong Sio Chak, had already mentioned, a secretariat will be created within the Commission, which will be headed by a secretary-general, who is inherently the Secretary for Security.
Regarding the composition of the Commission, all five Secretaries now form part of it, instead of just the Secretary for Administration and Justice and the Secretary for Security; in addition, the director general of the Customs Services, the commander of the Public Security Police Corps, the director of Games Inspection and Coordination, the president of the Cultural Institute and the director of the Education and Youth Development Services are also added.
A post of advisor for national security matters was also created by the Central People's Government, whose duties include “transmitting Beijing's decisions and programming” on State security, “supervising the implementation”, by the Macao SAR, of decisions and programming, as well as fulfilling the “constitutional responsibility to defend State security”. It must also “guide the Macao SAR in strengthening its work” in this area, as well as issuing “guiding opinions on important policies, production of relevant legislation and matters of great relevance in the context of defending State security”.
With the new law, the position of technical advisor will also arise, responsible for, among other functions, “participating in the analysis, study and evaluation of the Macao SAR situation in the context of defending State security, as well as making suggestions to the advisor for national security matters and the CDSE on important policies, production of relevant legislation and matters of great relevance in the context of defending State security”.
With regard to the themes, contents, minutes and supporting documents related to the CDSE meetings, “as well as the matters to which access occurred in the course of carrying out duties and under a duty of secrecy, are confidential in nature”. “The declassification of confidentiality can only be carried out by the president”, it adds.
According to the proposed law, decisions, opinions, directives and guidelines “cannot be published, unless otherwise decided by the president”. Furthermore, “in the absence of a provision to the contrary, those interested in the administrative challenge or the contentious appeal cannot yet be given access to matters subject to secrecy (…) without prejudice to access restrictions arising from other legal provisions”.
 
“There is a lot of evidence” against Au Kam San, says PJ director
The director of the Judicial Police, Sit Chong Meng, was questioned yesterday about the detention of Au Kam San, under the Law on the Defense of State Security, and was asked for more details about the case. Furthermore, he was asked to indicate whether there are currently more cases in this area being investigated. Sit Chong Meng stated that “there is a lot of evidence” against the former deputy. "[The case] is entering the trial process, we cannot disclose the details. National security is a very important topic for us", he highlighted, in statements to journalists, on the sidelines of the PJ's Spring Lunch. Sit Chong Meng did not say whether there are other cases to be investigated under the national security law. He then mentioned the creation of the secretariat of the State Security Defense Commission, under the new law, whose proposal has already been submitted to the Legislative Assembly, and stressed that, with regard to national security, the main work is “prevention”. It is recalled that the only case so far in Macau is that of Au Kam San, who was detained for allegedly colluding with external forces. Au has remained in prison since the end of July last year, and the formal accusation, who his lawyer will be or when he will begin trial is still unknown.

The director of the Liaison Office, Zheng Xincong, left four demands
 
The Chief Executive, Sam Hou Fai, highlighted yesterday that 2026 is “a crucial year for aligning with national strategies, valuing development opportunities and deepening reforms”. In this sense, he promised that the Macao SAR will take the third Macau Five-Year Plan as a guiding framework, to coordinate with the 15th National Five-Year Plan, in order to better integrate into the context of national development and serve the country.
In a speech given at the Spring Festival Reception hosted by the Liaison Office of the Central Government in the Macao SAR, Sam Hou Fai also urged concentration “on two main axes”. As he stated, first, the predominance of the executive power must be defended and improved, the reform of public administration must be improved, the effectiveness of governance must be improved and the constructive interaction and efficient collaboration between the executive, legislative and judicial powers must be reinforced, to “create a robust synergy for the development of the Macao SAR”.
Secondly, he emphasized the axis of “determiningly advancing” the adequate diversification of the economy and “pragmatically promoting” the development of the Hengqin Deep Cooperation Zone. “The coordination and interaction of these two axes will contribute to promoting Macau’s long-term prosperity and stability”, he argued.
"We will continue to implement the principle of 'one country, two systems' in a comprehensive, precise and resolute manner, firmly safeguarding sovereignty, security and national development interests and resolutely upholding the insurmountable line that 'there can be no chaos in Macau. We will strictly implement the full governance power of the Central Government to ensure the solid foundation on which the principle of 'Macau governed by patriots' rests", said Sam Hou Fai.
The Macau leader also promised to continue “listening carefully” to the voices of citizens, “maintaining focus on their concerns” and “making efforts to resolve the problems that affect their lives, improve urban organization, improve the well-being of the population and build a smarter Macau, with ideal living conditions, safer and more inclusive”.
Furthermore, he assured full support for the development and strengthening of the patriotic forces that love Macau and the creation of “a broad stage” for the growth and development of young people.
Recalling last year, Sam also said: "Within the scope of safeguarding national security, we took decisive measures, handling cases in accordance with the law, in order to resolutely prevent and prevent infiltration and interference by external forces. This ensured the effective maintenance of stability and harmony in Macau."
 
Four Liaison Office Requirements
In turn, the director of the Liaison Office began by urging joint work “for Macau to fly higher and go further”.
“We must achieve new advances in promoting the development of adequate diversification of the economy”, highlighted Zheng Xincong, demanding the launch of “emblematic projects and programs that can leverage progress in other sectors”, the acceleration of the development of new industries with international competitiveness and the concentration of efforts in the second phase of the construction of the Deep Cooperation Zone.
He also called for “new steps” in increasing the efficiency and capacity of the Macao SAR’s governance. On the other hand, he highlighted that “we must have new results in strengthening the foundations of love for the country and for Macau”, as well as “new efforts in safeguarding national security and social stability”.
“We must have in-depth awareness of the complex developments in the international situation, comprehensively implement the holistic vision on national security, continuously improve Macau's system and mechanisms in defending national security, intensify awareness and publicity on national security in an innovative way, resolutely combat the forces that oppose China and destabilize Macau, and resolutely prevent interference, infiltration and sabotage by external forces,” said Zheng Xincong.</description><pubDate>2026-02-06 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Portuguese in Macau return to the polls to choose between Seguro and Ventura</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/portugueses-em-macau-voltam-as-urnas-para-escolher-entre-seguro-ventura/</link><description>Portuguese voters residing in the territory return tomorrow and Sunday to the Consulate to vote in Portugal's presidential elections. The second round will decide Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa's successor for the position of Head of State and the choice is now limited to two candidates: António José Seguro and André Ventura. As in the first round, there are two polling stations available and people can exercise their civic rights on one of the two days, between 8:00 am and 7:00 pm
 
VÍTOR REBELO
 
Macau once again votes for the elections for the President of the Portuguese Republic, this time to choose between the two candidates with the most votes in the first round, held around three weeks ago, and which placed António José Seguro and André Ventura in the final fight for the position of Head of State, as neither of them received more than 50% of the votes.
Voters residing in the territory will be able to exercise their civic rights during Saturday and Sunday, between 8:00 am and 7:00 pm, at the Consulate-General of Portugal in the Macao SAR.
As in the previous act, there are two ballot boxes available and the procedures remain the same, that is, people must register at the entrance of the Consulate, armed with their citizen card, identity card or other valid identification document, and then go to the rooms where the voting receptacles are located.
The bulletins with the only two candidates arrived at the Consulate this week, according to Consul Alexandre Leitão, to the TRIBUNA DE MACAU newspaper.
The early election was held over three days, 27th, 28th and 29th January, aimed at people registered in Portugal, but who are temporarily displaced in the Macao SAR, for various reasons, including the exercise of public or private functions, in official representation of a national team, or as a student, researcher, teacher and research fellow at a higher education institution.
According to information published on the website of the Consulate General of Portugal in Macau and Hong Kong, turnout was three times higher than in the first round, with 78 in total, compared to 25 in the January vote, with emphasis on the presence of young voters, university students who are on exchange in the territory.
It should be remembered that Seguro, independent candidate, former secretary general of the Socialist Party, was the winner in the first vote, after the results of the vote in Portugal, on the islands of Madeira and the Azores and in emigration circles, with 1,755,563 votes (31.12%), followed by André Ventura, leader of the Chega Party, with 1,327,021 votes (23.52%).
With regard to voting outside the country, which includes Macau, Ventura won in the first round, gaining 40.93%, followed by António José Seguro. Still, none of them won in Asia and Oceania.
In the Macao SAR vote, Luís Marques Mendes, who had the support of the Social Democratic Party, received the highest number of votes (1,073), which represented 45.2% of the total number of ballots (2,374) entered into the ballot boxes of the two tables. António José Seguro totaled 477 votes (20.09%). Soon after, André Ventura was positioned, with 282 votes (11.9%), João Cotrim de Figueiredo (191 – 8%), Henrique Gouveia e Melo (133 – 5.6%) and Catarina Martins (128 – 5.4%).
In Macau, there were still 24 blank votes (1%) and 66 invalid votes (2.8%). Altogether, the percentage of both points to 3.8%. The first round recorded a participation rate of 4.1%, taking into account that 57,748 voters were registered in the territory. In 2021, during the pandemic, the rate stood at around 2%.
Regarding the release of the Macao SAR results in the second round of the Portuguese presidential elections, Alexandre Leitão confirmed to JTM that the notice will only be published on Monday morning, as happened during the previous election. The decision has to do with the closing of the polls in the Azores, which will take place at around four o'clock in the morning, Macau time.</description><pubDate>2026-02-06 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Portugal experiences flood drama</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/ultimas/portugal-vive-drama-das-cheias/</link><description>The River Sado flooded the riverside area due to bad weather, in Alcácer do Sal, February 5, 2026.

Civil Protection in Portugal recorded almost six thousand incidents related to floods between February 1 and 12:00 today (8:00 pm in Macau), said the organization's national commander. “To date, we have registered 5,793 incidents, 20,328 operators involved in these actions and with a total of 8,007 land resources”, said Mário Silvestre, at the headquarters of the National Emergency and Civil Protection Authority (ANEPC).

According to the official, Civil Protection maintains “surveillance with three helicopters, which continue to monitor and evaluate all flood impact areas”.
Silvestre indicated that falling trees continue to represent a significant number of incidents, but are beginning to be accompanied by an increase in flooding. “The number of floods (…) is currently quite high, with 1,593 occurrences”, he added.
The President of the Republic considered that Alcácer do Sal, in the district of Setúbal, “is perhaps the most serious flood situation” in the country. On a visit to the city, whose downtown has been flooded since Wednesday last week, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa had a panoramic view of the floods on the River Sado. Observing the riverbed, which now looks more like a sea, he admitted that the scenery “is impressive”.
Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa highlighted that the situation is “a test of people's resistance”, particularly those who have to be removed from their homes. But also, he continued, to “the resistance of those who are seeing their businesses, their small commercial houses and things like that being affected, but above all from isolated populations”.
In the balance she presented to Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, the president of the municipality, Clarisse Campos, revealed that 143 people had been evacuated from their homes since last Wednesday, when flooding began in the city's downtown, due to bad weather and the Kristin depression, which was followed by the Leonardo depression.
Portugal continues to closely monitor the rise in river levels, which caused flooding in several cities, as a result of the release of water in Spain and with the forecast of more rain in the country due to Storm Leonardo, which has already caused one death. The areas close to the Tagus, Mondego and Sado rivers have been greatly affected by the floods.

The famous gold bars that covered the emblematic entrance floor of the Grand Emperor Hotel, located behind the Iao Hon shopping center, in the central area of ​​Macau, were sold for approximately 99.7 million Hong Kong dollars, which means a profit, after deducting costs, of 90.2 million.
The information emerged following a statement submitted to the HKSAR Stock Exchange by the Emperor Entertainment Hotel group, in which it announced the sale of gold bricks, whose total weight is 79 kilos, previously installed as a luxury element in the hotel unit's lobby.
In the same statement, the company highlighted that the operation represents an opportunity to materialize and unlock the value of the asset, also allowing savings on future security and insurance costs associated with maintenance. “Proceeds from the transaction will support Emperor Entertainment Hotel’s financial position and fund potential future investments,” the company noted.
The buyer is the Hong Kong subsidiary of Germany's Heraeus Holding GmbH, a specialist in the precious metals industry.
No final do mês passado, utilizadores das redes sociais assinalaram o desaparecimento das barras de ouro, facto que suscitou um debate online, uma vez que a empresa havia anunciado inicialmente que a remoção dos lingotes, a 29 de Janeiro, se devia a obras de remodelação.
O “caminho de ouro”, instalado há duas décadas como parte do design opulento do hotel, tornou-se uma atracção do Grand Emperor, criado para promover o seu agora extinto Casino Emperor Palace.
The hotel operated a “satellite” casino under the concession of SJM Resorts, which closed in October 2025.</description><pubDate>2026-02-06 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>FRC marks Year of the Horse with votive papers</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/frc-assinala-ano-cavalo-papeis-votivos/</link><description>The Rui Cunha Foundation continues to organize today the traditional “good luck messages” event, as a way of joining the Lunar New Year festivities. “Fai Chun – Votive Paper Offering” will be attended by 41 master calligraphers and local poets
 
The Rui Cunha Foundation (FRC) is holding today the second day of the traditional event “Fai Chun – Offer of Votive Papers”, providing good luck messages in Chinese calligraphy, which the public can request, free of charge, between 10am and 4pm. O evento é co-organizado pela Associação de Poesia dos Amigos do Jardim da Flora.
The population is invited to choose wishes of good luck and prosperity, under the guidance of 41 master calligraphers and poets who create happy phrases and verse couplets alluding to the Year of the Horse celebrations.
Fai Chun is a traditional decoration used during Chinese New Year, which marks the arrival of the spring season. In Portuguese it can be translated as Onda de Primavera. “People place Fai Chun on doors to create a happy and festive atmosphere, as the calligraphed phrases mean good luck and prosperity”, highlights the FRC.
Normally, traditional Fai Chun are red in color, with black or gold characters inscribed with a brush, which aim to protect the houses with good wishes for the year ahead. Nowadays printed versions are more common and produced on a large scale. They can be square or rectangular and hung vertically or horizontally, usually in pairs. They not only exist in China, but also in Korea, Japan and Vietnam.
2026 is the Year of the Fire Horse, which begins on February 17th (first day of the Chinese New Year) and lasts until February 5th, 2027. The Horse is the seventh of the 12 signs of the Chinese zodiac.
“As we leave behind the introspective and intuitive Year of the Snake, the Year of the Horse arrives at a gallop with a vibrant energy, which symbolizes adventure, vitality, but also impetuosity”, highlights the note. According to Chinese astrology, the Horse is confident, sociable and responsible, although it does not like to be controlled by others.
People of this sign are natural leaders, active and motivated in everything they do. This can manifest itself in the form of tenacity, resistance, and even stubbornness or even recklessness in certain situations. “But the Horse personifies enthusiasm, speed and vivacity, bringing a year 2026 that promises to be a dynamic, energetic and transformative period, defined by ambition and independence”, adds the FRC.
This situation encourages bold and decisive actions on a professional and personal level, which may seem intense or unstable for some. Nevertheless, it is a time to take risks, embrace change and make rapid progress.

The exhibition opens on February 11th and is open to the public until March 15th
 
The exhibition “Splendid Colors: Embroidery Art Exhibition from Chongqing and the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region” will present at the Tap Seac Gallery a selection of 154 works/sets of artistic embroidery from those regions of China. According to the Cultural Institute (IC), the inauguration will take place on February 11th, at 6:30 pm, and the initiative will also include a series of workshops.
"The art of embroidery is one of the most representative traditional crafts of ethnic Chinese, containing a deep historical heritage and rich artistic creativity, with multiple practical, aesthetic, etiquette and cultural transmission values. Over time, different ethnicities and regions gradually formed embroidery with distinct artistic styles", says the organization led by Leong Wai Man in a statement.
The hundreds of embroideries that will be on display include marriage embroidery from Wuxi, Miao from Youzhou and “Xilankapu” brocade (traditional Tujia weaving), as well as the three embroidery techniques of the Uyghur, Kyrgyz and Kazakh ethnic groups of the Uyghur Autonomous Region, according to the press release. “All of these techniques were inscribed as representative items of intangible cultural heritage at national or municipal level, and all works are created by transmitters of intangible cultural heritage and masters of crafts and art, respectively showing the elegance of southern embroidery and the vibrant and bold colors of northern embroidery”, adds the IC.
For the organization, the works – which will be on view to the public until March 15th, including holidays, from 10:00 to 19:00 – “not only reveal a remarkable technique and a varied style, but also contain the cultural depth of the ethnicities involved”. The IC also states that the materials, motifs and color schemes “incorporate the aesthetic sensitivity and creativity transmitted from generation to generation, expressing the aspirations and desire of the people for a better life”.
On the opening day, at 6:00 pm, and on the first day it will be open to the public (February 12th) at 10:00, 11:30, 3:00 pm and 5:00 pm, several intangible cultural heritage transmitters will demonstrate embroidery techniques, lasting approximately one hour per session.
Furthermore, so that the public can deepen their knowledge of the embroidery techniques of the intangible cultural heritage of both regions, a workshop on the Chongqing Shu embroidery technique and a workshop on the Xinjiang embroidery technique will be held on the 7th and 8th of March, at 10:00 and 15:00. Participation is free and sessions will be conducted in Mandarin, with a maximum of 16 participants. Registrations can be made through the Single Account.
The exhibition is organized by the Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan Affairs Office of the Ministry of Culture and Tourism of the People's Republic of China, the IC, the Chongqing Municipal Cultural and Tourism Development Commission and the Culture and Tourism Department of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. Coordination was carried out by the Center for the Development of Ethnic and Popular Arts and Literatures of the Ministry of Culture and Tourism and the Department of Advertising, Culture and Sports of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Macao SAR.

The master is accompanied at the GalaxyArt exhibition by his son, who continued the living legacy of his father's craft
 
The exhibition “Golden Fortunes: the debut in Macau of Zhu Bingren's copper art”, on view until April 12, at GalaxyArt, from 11am to 9pm, presents a series of works by the renowned Chinese master, national heir to the intangible cultural heritage of copper sculpture. The exhibition brings together various types of his creations, accompanied in this exhibition by his son, Zhu Junmin, who continued the living legacy of his father's craft.
Copper, with its “warm and sparkling” shine, as stated in a statement from the Galaxy Entertainment group, has symbolized blessings and prosperity for millennia in Chinese culture.
Zhu Bingren represents a centuries-old family cultural heritage while opening new chapters in the art of molten copper. In addition to preserving the traditional “gengcai” technique, the artist also innovated with unique methods, such as “molten copper”.
From the early integration of copper into architecture, to the development of art pieces, the master “expanded the medium of structural art to modern art, reinvigorating this ancient craft with talent and dexterity”, highlights the same note.
“Golden Fortunes” is presented in five thematic zones: “Success within reach” – celebrating the countless forms and vitality of noble steeds; “Year-end elegance” – refined floral arrangements, rituals and cast copper vases that evoke festive grace; “Official gifts and global blessings” – copper masterpieces offered at diplomatic ceremonies, which embody the splendor of Chinese culture; “Colors of Spring” – pieces that capture the grandeur of the landscapes and the unwavering symbolism of copper seals; and “Mold Light of Macau” – creations imbued with the essence of Macau, bringing prosperity to the Pearl River estuary and harmony between cultures.
In the exhibition, the public can enjoy 68 emblematic works by members of the Zhu family, 38 of which have an equestrian theme.
Carved with high-temperature enamel, the pieces intertwine the bold, dynamic style of Tang Dynasty horses with Western realism and contemporary influences. “Their balanced and galloping forms symbolize good luck, vitality and progress in the Year of the Horse, bringing blessings and vitality to visitors”, highlights Galaxy.
Among the works are symbolic creations, such as “Song of the Fisherman in the Rain”, which employs the molten copper technique developed by Master Zhu, capturing the “vivid movement of golden awnings and flickering stove flames amidst the light rain”.
The green-hued fused texture at the bottom evokes drifting seaweed or running water – an artistic reflection of Macau's transformation from a small fishing village to a global tourism and leisure center.
Zhu also has a special affection for the auspicious peacock. Two works of art featuring this bird are on display, one created exclusively for GalaxyArt. “Standing with eyes fixed forward, symbolizing the hope of a brighter future, the elegant feathers of the peacock's tail are painted, layer by layer, in an exquisite shade of purple – a color of serenity”, highlights the exhibition's introductory text.
The two lotus flowers at the base establish a close connection with Macau. The exhibition also showcases several copper sculptures of year-end ritual flowers by Zhu Junmin.
To help Macao's younger generation better understand the craftsmanship of intangible cultural heritage, Zhu Bingren gave a lecture at UCTM for students of artistic disciplines. During the session, he shared ideas with more than 100 students from arts-related faculties and discussed topics such as the sustainable development of China's intangible cultural heritage.

A book that brings together, for the first time, anecdotes published about Pablo Picasso reveals how his contemporaries saw the artist born in Málaga and the opinions that his art provoked, both among friends and enemies.
"These anecdotes capture the way journalists at the time saw Picasso. There are, for example, many jokes about Cubism, because when the artist began to be famous, he was not appreciated by the press from the beginning", explains Rafael Inglada, author of this book published by the Museu Casa Natal de Picasso, in an interview with the EFE agency.
With a preface by the Catalan journalist Lluís Permanyer, recently deceased, “Pablo Picasso. Livro de Anecdotas” is part of a tetralogy that began with “Pablo Picasso. Livro de Conversas” (2023), which will be followed by two more volumes dedicated, respectively, “to statements to the press and defenses, the latter of a more political nature”, explains Inglada.
Compiling these more than 260 anecdotes required thorough research in newspaper archives. The vast majority of texts were published in France, with only a few in Spain. According to the author, the texts sometimes reveal “a lot of malice, but also, at other times, a lot of kindness and an approach to the topic”. According to Rafael Inglada, “through the press, a new Picasso is revealed, seen by his contemporaries”.
“These are anecdotes that appear in articles and rarely appear in biographies, therefore, this is a way of publishing an unpublished book, something increasingly difficult to achieve when it comes to Picasso”, he highlights.
The French press dedicated many more pages to Picasso than the Spanish press during the Franco regime, with an approach that encompassed “everything”, since “sometimes a certain irony or malice on the part of the writer shines through in the texts”.
“This is a book that can be opened on any page, with brief anecdotes, organized chronologically, ranging from 1910, at the height of Cubism, to 1973, the year of Picasso's death”, highlights Inglada.
In its pages, you discover, for example, how the Malaga artist reacted when asked to explain his work. A woman who had just bought him a drawing asked: “What does this represent, master?”, to which Picasso replied: “Exactly 3,000 francs, my lady!”
Another buyer boasted to Picasso that he owned paintings by Degas, Cézanne and other painters, purchased for considerable sums. He stated that works by deceased masters “had to be paid for at exorbitant prices.”
When Pablo Picasso asked him for 5,000 francs for his painting, the buyer was surprised, and the Malaga artist explained: “It's my posthumous price, sir.”
About the beginning of the artist's career, it is said that Picasso wanted Rodin's opinion on his first futurist work. He showed it to Rodin before signing it, as he wanted an authoritative opinion.
Rodin picked up the painting, turned it over several times and said to Picasso: “In any case, boy, I advise you to sign it, so at least we will know how to hang it.”
On another occasion, a press photographer visited the artist, who received him in a large, empty room. There, the visitor was surprised to find none of his paintings. "Nowadays, a Picasso costs more than 500,000 francs. It's a luxury I can't afford," said the artist from Malaga.
Resuming the interpretation of his works, Picasso took the opportunity to needle critics. At the opening of an exhibition, someone asked him what those paintings represented and he replied: “You'll read it in tomorrow's newspapers”.
