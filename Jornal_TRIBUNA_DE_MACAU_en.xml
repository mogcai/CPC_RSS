Although promotional actions made abroad for tourism services contributed to a homologation of 16.9% to more than 682 thousand international visitors in the first three months of this year, the economic impact of this bet will be far from expecting expectations. According to DSEC, the 'per capita' expense of international visitors (1,644 patacas) suffered a homologous decrease of 23.9%, still translating a decline of 23.2% compared to the 2,140 patacas noted in the globality of 2024.

Last month, during the presentation of the government lines for 2025, the head of the Executive of the MSAR has again recognized that there is a “loss of consumers” and that “the impact caused to small and medium enterprises is very large, even though there are many visitors”, because they have changed their consumer standards.

This homologous decrease, the first in two years, "was due, among other factors, based on relatively high comparison of the first quarter of the previous year and the alteration of the consumption pattern of visitors," he reiterated.
Overall 2024, GDP advanced 8.8% compared to 2023 and reached 84.6% of 2019 level. However, homologous growth slowed from 23.0% in the first quarter to 7.1% in the second, 3.8% in the third and 3.4% between October and December.

Pedro Gonçalves, at 55 minutes, inaugurated the marker and Gyökeres, at 82, sealed the result and paved the way for the roundabout of Marquês de Pombal, in Lisbon, where this achievement celebrated.



















Prior to the initial whistle of the Leiriense referee Fábio Veríssimo, the party was doing outside the José Alvalade Stadium. As a habit has been, thousands of fans 'swallowed' the bus chanting in unison: "I want Sporting Champion."
It was with this motto that Rui Borges's men assumed the expenses of the game. Gonçalo Inácio, at 8 minutes, gave the first sign of danger, but it was the goal of Braga Zalazar, who received Benfica, first to be celebrated. Benfica lost (1-0) and to keep this result the 'lions' would be two-time champions.
Almost simultaneously, Sporting was deprived of Diomande, who was injured, being surrendered by St. Juste.
Playing almost by step, the teams seemed more concerned with not making a mistake than really 'damage' on opposing networks, but Sporting was having some ascendant about Vitória de Guimarães.
Gyökeres, 41 minutes, saw Bruno Varela's goal post to deny her goal in a move where the Vimaranens goalkeeper walked to the papers. However, the guardian was largely responsible for keeping the null to the interval by defending the Swedish shots at 30 and 45+5, and from Trincão at 33.
The entrance of Nuno Santos, in the reaction, seemed to bring new life to Vitória de Guimarães, who began to share the balls with Sporting, but would become the formation of Alvalade to untie the knot that seemed to attach the game.
At 55 minutes, Debast received the ball from Eduardo Quaresma in the center hall, opened to Maxi Araújo, on the left, the first one, for Pedro Gonçalves to do the 1-0. Lose, Guimarães Vitória was out of the 'European places', launched on Sporting, but when doing so was exposed and, after 66 minutes, Geny Catamo saw the post 'defended' 2-0.
The nervousness was taking over the benches. The Sporting that played more with his heart than with his head, retreated as much as he could and began to play in counterattack, because the chronometer played in his favor.
To undo all the doubts, Gyökeres, at 82 minutes, took the ball to two opponents, stained Bruno Varela and made the 2-0. A result that coincided with the number of consecutive titles, 71 years later, and made the audience shout "two -time champions."
The party was doing on the benches, and in the compensation the Swedish International could have done 3-0, but the prompt departure of Bruno Varela made it impossible to crown the game with a 'bis' on the day of the two-time championship.

As for the game, Carlos Carvalhal surprised with the only change he made by launching to the starting lineup the young boss and pushing Fran Navarro to the 'bench'.

After six minutes, Benfica wasted an excellent occasion to inaugurate the marker when Leandro Barreiro, isolated by a ball;
At 24 minutes, Zalazar put the worms ahead in the conversion of a great penalty, which punished Tomás Araújo about Ricardo Horta. Referee Miguel Nogueira only signaled the maximum punishment after visiting the images, called by VAR.
Benfica felt the goal and 'disappeared' from the game - only Pavlidis created some danger, like 37 minutes, in an attempt to 'hat', but that Hornicek held without great difficulty.
Benfica failed many passes and it was Sporting Braga to be closer to scoring again on the break (45+4 minutes), but a huge turbin defense prevented the second of the house's team after Roger's shot, assisted by Zalazar.
On 59 minutes, Bruno Lage reinforced the attack, throwing Di María, Bruma and Belotti and, four minutes later, took dividends, with Di María serving with a large pavlidis pass and the tight -angle "rifle" Hornicek. On 66 minutes, the 'incarnates' began to play with another unit, for expulsion of João Moutinho (second yellow card), but after the goal and numerical advantage, they did not create clear opportunities to score, except for a Belotti (70) shot.
Bruno Lage also launched Arthur Cabral, coexisting three-ends in Benfica, but it would be Sporting Braga to be closer to the second in some counterattacks, worth Trubin.

The emirate's royal family should offer Washington a Boeing 747-8 valued by $ 400 million experts described by the American press as "a palace in the sky." The US Constitution prohibits employees to accept gifts from a king, prince or other state.
Trump visited Qatar last week and generated controversy in his country by indicating that he would not refuse this type of offer. Prime Minister Mohammed Al Thani told CNN TV network that she doesn't know why the subject has become so important.
"This is a transaction between governments. It has nothing to do with a personal issue, but with the Defense Ministry and the Defense Department," said Qatar's head of government, who denied that his country is using the present as a way of influencing Trump.
"Qatar has always been a reliable US partner, always stepped forward to support this country, because we believe this friendship must be mutually beneficial," said Al Thani, adding that the offer "is still under legal review."
Trump plans to replace the two current Boeing 747-200B, which went into operation in 1990 and which complains about the maintenance cost. Unhappy with Boeing's delays, the president said earlier this year that "alternatives" were being studied for the future presidential plane.
 
Qatar Airways Order 160 new planes to Boeing
Certamente, por acaso, a companhia aérea Qatar Airways fez à Boeing um “pedido recorde” de pelo menos 160 aviões, anunciou o Presidente americano, Donald Trump, na visita ao Qatar.
The order was the most important of wide fuselage aircraft ever made to Boeing and reinforces ties between the American manufacturer and the Middle Eastern airline.
Qatar Airways will comply with “a $ 96 billion agreement to purchase 210 Boeings 787 Dreamliner and 777x of US manufacturing equipped with GE Aospace engines,” the White House said. "It's the largest request for Boeing's wide fuselage aircraft, and the largest of 787 Dreamliner."
The manufacturer explained that the agreement includes the purchase of 130 dreamliners and 30 Boeings 777-9, in addition to the optional acquisition of another 50 planes 787 and 777x. "We are deeply honored with this record request," said Boeing Commercial Planes Division, Stephanie Pope.
Although the manufacturer and its customers do not usually disclose the price of purchased planes, it is, it seems, the largest request ever registered by Boeing in terms of value. The most important in number of devices was made in 2023, when the airline Air India commissioned 220 planes, but most of them were 737 max models, single corridor.
The US president was the first to announce the order, by a larger global amount than reported by the White House. "It's the biggest request for aircraft in Boeing's history, this is quite good," Trump said, stating that the deal represented more than 200 billion, one of Trump's usual exaggerations, as the 777x and 787 Dreamlineiner planes price list suggests that the contract value is well below this figure.
The $ 96 billion released by the White House seem to include business for GE Aerospace.
