Specifically, she points to a “reorganization” of activities, especially the School of Arts and Crafts, because it is time to “give them a different impetus”. The president of the association, who is expected to remain in office for another term, despite continuing to try to find someone capable of replacing her, wants the anniversary also serves to raise awareness among the Government of the importance of the work it has been carrying out
 
VÍTOR REBELO
 
On the first day of June this year, Casa de Portugal (CPM) celebrates the 25th anniversary since its creation, in 2001, and Amélia António says that the important date “forces us to look at everything that has been done so far” and to “reassess the work and the conditions in which it is carried out”. The president of the Portuguese-based association revealed to Jornal TRIBUNA DE MACAU that she is “very keen” for this to be a “remarkable year” in the life of the institution, with the need for “a certain amount of reorganization”.
“The continuity of our activities will not be in question, but the truth is that we have to give them a different impetus”, states the CPM leader, focusing essentially on the work carried out by the School of Arts and Crafts.
“Almost everything we do comes from those workshops in Areia Preta, but over the years we have experienced many difficulties in carrying out this work, mainly because of the conditions and income that are imposed on us, which have constantly increased”, he laments.
Considering that people's journeys to that location are “increasingly complicated”, in addition to the poor conditions of old industrial buildings, such as the building in the Areia Preta area where the school operates, Amélia António says that all of this makes the activity increasingly difficult.
“Access for people who participate in our training activities, for children who go there with their parents, has been getting worse, due to traffic, with full buses, which is a reality that has made the development of our work quite difficult”, he mentions. Hence, he reinforces, “we have to carry out this reassessment, because conditions have changed over these 25 years”.
The CPM leader notes that the workshops “do a lot of work on the side, since for participation in parades and other similar events everything is built there, involving all the available labor we have, for which it is not easy to do quality work with these difficulties”.
Therefore, he continues, “these 25 years force us to look at this, although there is no question of continuing to do so, but what we wanted was to be able to improve and expand these activities, particularly in the work carried out with children”. “We have parents asking, this is systematic, but the conditions for events with kids are very difficult there, so we need to understand what other alternatives we can have”.
In this sense, the president of Casa de Portugal wants to know whether the Government considers the work that has been carried out to be important. “In fact, it will be good to know if this type of work is really important for the Government and if it is open to helping us come up with some solutions”, he states. For this reason, he considers that these 25 years “require a serious and considered reflection on what can and should be done, and what is important to continue doing”.
 
Continue without ever giving up
The CPM manager does not talk about giving up, but rather about “analyzing what needs to be done, providing improved continuity, understanding if there are projects”. “There are things that we think are important, but we also have to understand whether this is the Government's opinion so that we can count on some logistical support, as I am not asking for more money”, he emphasizes.
Regarding special events that will mark the association's anniversary, Amélia António does not yet know specifically, since all activities depend on the completion of the requested subsidies. “Towards the end of this month of February, or beginning of March, the decisions of the Macau Foundation (FM) will come out and then I think we will be able to have an idea of ​​the projects for 2026, that is if our requests are accepted”, he says, clarifying that there are 22 projects presented to the FM for this year, after 18 in 2025, all approved. To the Culture Development Fund, CPM sent five event proposals, four of which received a positive response.
Regarding the details of the projects, he prefers not to highlight any, nor lift the veil on them, “because they are all important”, promising to disclose them later, “when everything is defined”.
Furthermore, everything that is not part of these subsidy request blocks, “happens throughout the year”, he highlights, giving examples of parades, participation in the Festival of Arts and other shows, partnerships with schools, the 10th of June, the 25th of April, the 5th of October, among others.
 
Presidency prepared for 10th term
2026 is also the year of elections in the CPM, which should take place in March, all pointing towards the current management bodies remaining for a new two-year term, with one or another possible change.
For the main position, that of president of the board, there seems to be no replacement in sight. “I really wish someone could take my place, but I haven’t been able to”, he admits. Therefore, he must continue to lead the institution's destinies, for what will be his tenth term.
Amélia António has been linked to Casa de Portugal since the 2003/2005 biennium, when she was president of the general assembly. Since yesterday, he has led the association until today, and it is expected that he will continue for at least another two years, that is, until 2028.
 
Ephemeride about Pessanha will bring artists from Portugal
Casa de Portugal plans to organize an event in June to mark the 100th anniversary of the death of Camilo Pessanha, as revealed by Amélia António to the TRIBUNA DE MACAU newspaper. The president of the institution's board of directors said that the activity will consist of an exhibition that addresses the life and work of the Portuguese poet, who lived in Macau for 32 years. The day and location of the exhibition have yet to be defined, but the director said that the inauguration will have a different nature than usual. “The exhibition, which will feature works about the writer, will be accompanied by a musical moment, with the performance of two artists from Portugal”, he highlighted, adding that there will also be trips to various schools, “to recite Camilo's poetry to the sound of music”. Regarding the opening, initially scheduled for March 1st, precisely the day of the poet's death, “it will have to be changed and take place after that date”, he stated. “It was not possible to confirm the space we had planned, so we have to look for another location that is suitable for an event of this nature”, he explained.</description><pubDate>2026-02-25 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>DSEDJ outlines new measures to support schools with fewer students</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/dsedj-traca-novas-medidas-para-apoiar-escolas-menos-alunos/</link><description>The Government is studying new support measures for “smaller schools or those with fewer students in early childhood education”, indicated the director of Education and Youth Development Services. The idea, as Kong Chi Meng explained, is “to finance the transformation of schools for continuing education or create ‘other classes’”. Furthermore, DSEDJ is also awaiting the study on the impact of demographic variation on the educational system, ensuring that it will coordinate its action based on the resulting suggestions
 
PEDRO MILHEIRÃO
The Directorate of Education and Youth Development Services (DSEDJ) is studying the implementation of new measures “to support, as a priority, smaller schools or those with fewer students in early childhood education”, according to Kong Chi Meng. In response to a written question from Loi I Weng, in which the deputy addressed the impact of the low birth rate on the non-higher education system, the director of DSEDJ suggested “financing the transformation of schools for continuous education or creating ‘other classes’”, the nature of which he did not explain.
Estimating that next year “the number of school-age children will be around 3,400, 500 fewer than in the previous academic year”, Loi I Weng expressed concern about the possibility of the drop in the number of students affecting “even more the stability of educational institutions and teaching staff”. In this sense, he urged the Government to “adopt more active measures, in order to effectively support the sustainable and high-quality development of Macau’s educational system”.
More specifically, Loi asked if the Executive was “considering expanding transition possibilities, allowing teachers to move between different levels of education”. Kong Chi Meng assured that the Government “has paid attention to the stable development of the teaching staff”, noting that schools can “transfer teachers internally”, as long as they have worked for at least five years.
Kong further explained that teachers can teach at other levels of education, as long as they meet the requirements set out in the “General framework for teaching staff in private non-higher education schools”. According to the organization's director, between 2021 and 2025, more than 320 teachers were transferred to other levels of education.
At the same time, “DSEDJ continues to support the professional development of teaching staff, through various channels”, assured the director, having highlighted the various training actions carried out by the organization, which aim to “deepen teachers' capabilities” for different levels of education. According to Kong Chi Meng, in the last academic year, DSEDJ's 946 training actions provided more than 207 thousand hours of professional development for teachers.
Loi I Weng also questioned whether the Government intends to adjust the minimum and maximum limits of students per class and the allocation model of “two teachers and one assistant per class”, allowing for more adequate and high-quality teaching, during “this crucial phase of demographic transition”.
The director stated that the Government “attaches great importance to the balance between educational quality and the group training development needs of students”, adding that there is already a “flexible mechanism that allows the number of students per class to be between 25 and 35”. Furthermore, DSEDJ also takes into account the different situations of school units and “coordinates school places and the organization of classes, promoting the optimization of class planning by schools”, he argued.
On another point, the deputy also suggested the creation of a specialized working group, with the purpose of “promoting and coordinating the mechanisms for admitting students and integrating resources between educational institutions”.
Recognizing that “the low birth rate in recent years is an issue faced globally and that inevitably affects the admission of students”, Kong recalled that DSEDJ has already commissioned a local research group to carry out a study on the impact of demographic variation on the educational system, and that “it will take as a reference the suggestions arising from this study and coordinate its action with schools to face the situation”.
 
Vacancies for non-higher education open on March 1st
Registration for early childhood education (children who already attend this level), primary and secondary, for the 2026/2027 school year, starts on March 1st, informed the Directorate of Education and Youth Development Services (DSEDJ). In the next academic year, 54 secondary schools and 67 primary education units will admit students. Students and guardians can now access the “school access guide” on the DSEDJ website to consult information about school access, the classes and years of schooling available for admission at each school and access the registration form. DSEDJ states that the payment date for the vacancy reservation fee “should not be before April 13th”. Furthermore, so that student admission work goes “smoothly”, DSEDJ calls on those in charge of education to collaborate with the organization of schools.</description><pubDate>2026-02-25 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Chinese New Year brought 1.7 million visitors</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/ano-novo-chines-trouxe-17-milhoes-de-visitantes/</link><description>Over the nine days of Chinese New Year, around 1.6 million visitors arrived in Macau, an increase of 5.5% compared to the same period last year. About 77% of the total came from Mainland China. If we count the eve of the Lunar New Year, February 14th, the territory received 1.7 million visitors during this festive period

During the Chinese New Year period, which ran from 15 to 23 February, more than 1.55 million visitors arrived in Macau, according to data from the Tourism Services Bureau (DST), which is based on statistics from the Public Security Police Corps. The volume was equivalent to an average daily value of 172,699 visitors, translating into an increase of 5.5%.
On New Year's Eve, that is, on February 14th, 146,964 visitors entered the Macao SAR, which, together with the rest, amounts to more than 1.7 million visitors during those 10 days, according to preliminary data.
The best day was the 5th on the lunar calendar, that is, February 19th: 227,905 visitors arrived in the territory, an increase of 4%, according to the organization led by Helena de Senna Fernandes. But the biggest increase compared to last year's festive period occurred on the last day (23 February), when visitor arrivals reached 157,249 (14.6% more).
More than 1.2 million visitors who came to Macau during the nine-day Lunar New Year Golden Week were from Mainland China, accounting for about 77% of the total. 250,898 visitors arrived from Hong Kong, with a 3.5% drop in the average daily value to 27,878 visitors. It should be noted that annual drops were observed on four of the nine days, the highest, of 18%, on the 6th day of the lunar calendar (February 20).
During the Chinese New Year period, the Horse brought “a notable increase in traffic” to Macau International Airport. Between the day before Golden Week, February 14th, and the last day, February 23rd, the Airport received 267,235 passengers and processed 1,943 flight movements, “representing an increase of 11% and 9%, respectively, in relation to the same period in 2025”. The peak in passenger traffic occurred on the 21st and 22nd, with the daily number of passengers reaching 29,000 and 28,000, respectively.
“Analysis of the overall market structure during the Chinese New Year season revealed that passengers on mainland China routes accounted for 43% of total passenger volume, while international routes accounted for 39% and routes to Taiwan accounted for 18%,” the press release adds.
To manage the peak passenger and flight traffic during Chinese New Year, approximately 60 flights were added on routes to and from Southeast Asia, the Airport said, adding that it “actively coordinated” with various departments to “ensure smooth operations and orderly operation of flights” during the festive period.
On the other hand, the infrastructure highlights that it continues to implement “various incentive schemes to encourage airlines to increase international passenger capacity and launch new routes”. “These initiatives aim to comprehensively improve the quality of service, constantly drive the growth of passenger traffic and jointly support the sustainable development of the tourism market”, it can also be read.
 
Game below expectations
The game's gross revenue reached a daily average of 785 million patacas last week, falling below the expectations of investment bank JP Morgan, which pointed to 850 million. In the first 22 days of February, Macau's casinos earned 14.3 billion patacas, at an average of 650 million per day, according to analysts DS Kim, Selina Li and Lindsey Qian, who decided to revise downwards the projections for February, now anticipating a value close to that recorded in the same period of 2025 or a growth of 2%. Previously, the JP Morgan team expected a year-on-year increase of between 2% and 5%. “The holidays started slowly, with the first four to five days registering a daily rate of around 450 million patacas”, reflecting a double-digit annual drop, according to the trio of analysts. However, from the sixth day onwards, the daily average exceeded 1.2 billion, translating to a year-on-year increase of 10% to 15%.
 
Arrested for fire stunt
Police detained a man from Mainland China after the individual breathed fire for fun in Taipa, reported the “Macau News Agency”. According to the news portal, images circulating online show the 30-year-old man breathing fire on Avenida da Nave Desportiva. According to authorities, the suspect said he intended to add a “festive atmosphere” to Chinese New Year. The man was detained at a hotel in NAPE, with authorities considering the stunt a violation of rules in public spaces. The police also detained two men from Mainland China for begging near the A-Ma Temple. According to reports, the two held signs asking passersby for money to finance a trip. They managed to raise at least a thousand patacas.</description><pubDate>2026-02-25 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Deputies to the ANP and CCPPC urged to “foster social consensus”</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/deputados-a-anp-ccppc-instados-fomentar-consenso-social/</link><description>At a dinner offered to ANP deputies and CPPCC members, the Chief Executive urged them to “foster social consensus”, stressing that they are “the central force of the principle of ‘Macau governed by patriots’”. Sam Hou Fai also asked them to present “insightful opinions” and to serve as an “example” to “promote progress”, remembering that the Two Sessions are almost to be held, and stressed that they must “firmly” defend the predominance of the executive power
 
The Chief Executive hosted a dinner for Macau's deputies to the National People's Assembly (ANP) and local members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), saying he hoped they would “contribute with insightful opinions to help Macau open new horizons and reach new heights, promoting all projects to a new level”. In his speech, Sam Hou Fai noted that the deputies and members “are the elite and leaders of the various sectors in Macau, playing an important role as representatives of the Macao SAR to participate at the highest level in national governance”.
Sam Hou Fai also highlighted that they are “the central force of the principle of ‘Macau governed by patriots’ with an honorable mission and considerable responsibility”. On the occasion, the Macao SAR leader shared “three points of view, in line with the spirit enshrined in President Xi Jinping's important instructions”, urging, for example, that they play a role in promoting “social consensus”. The idea, he stressed, is to “guide with ideas to create consensus”.
In this context, Sam said he hopes that APN deputies and members of the CPPCC will “expand the forms and deepen the content of exchange and interaction with residents, effectively strengthen unity and ties, fully play the role of bridge, connection”, at the same time that they must focus “on the concerns of the population”, transmitting public opinion and social aspirations.
“They must adopt a comprehensive vision, foster social consensus, diligently promote the essential value of love for the country and Macau, jointly defend national security and social stability, and continue to open new horizons of high-quality development for the cause of ‘one country, two systems’”, stressed the Chief Executive.
Furthermore, Sam Hou Fai asked them to be “skilled in combining the main guidelines and policies of the Central Government with the reality of Macau, promoting their transformation into ideas and actions widely recognized by society”, according to a statement from the Social Communication Office.
On the other hand, he noted that they must “serve as an example to promote progress”. Defending that “APN deputies and members of the CPPCC are of recognized prestige, with a wide network of contacts”, the Chief Executive pointed out that “every word and action of theirs has influence and serves as an example”. Therefore, he expects them to “actively play a leadership role in their professional career, firmly defending the institutional arrangement of the predominance of executive power”.
Taking into account the “two main axes” – the development of adequate diversification of the economy and the reform of Public Administration –, Sam asked them to “collaborate with the Macao SAR Government in governing according to the law, and jointly promote integrated development between Macau and Hengqin”.
“When it comes to matters of principle, they must be unequivocal and firm in their position”, he warned, and then added: “In the diverse exchange of ideas, they must maintain the correct direction, find the greatest common denominator to foster a powerful synergy to promote the great revitalization of the Chinese nation and contribute to the stability and lasting prosperity of Macau”.
Finally, the Macao SAR leader mentioned that they must “present opinions and suggestions with a sense of duty”. Noting that “participating in national affairs and fulfilling the duties inherent to the position is an honor, but above all a responsibility”, Sam Hou Fai recalled that the Two Sessions will soon be held, and he hopes that “NPA deputies and CPPCC members will continue, as always, to serve the country with dedication and fulfill their responsibilities to the people, to tell the truth and to present frank opinions with constructive proposals, fully demonstrating the sense of mission, wisdom and the strength of Macau”.
Regarding the Government's work for this year, he stated that “they are progressing steadily”, while the Macao SAR's third five-year plan “is also under intensive preparation”. Last year, on the other hand, “Macau's economic and social development progressed in a stable manner”, according to Sam Hou Fai, for whom “the first year of the Executive ran smoothly, stable, innovatively, with achievements and positive results”. The “successes”, he added, “are inseparable from the strong support and commitment of the deputies to the ANP and the members of the CPPCC”.
For this year, the priorities include the persistence in the predominance of executive power, the defense of national security, the strengthening of the “forces of love for the country and for Macau” and the construction of the Deep Cooperation Zone in Hengqin.

At the first meeting of the civil protection structure this year, chaired by the Secretary for Security and Joint Action Commander, Chan Tsz King, several issues were discussed, including plans for 2026. Namely, the preparation of the “Crystal Fish 2026” exercise, the review of specific contingency plans and community awareness strategies, “with a view to the effective implementation of civil protection work”.
The Unitary Police Services (SPU) emphasized that this year marks the beginning of the implementation of the 15th National Five-Year Plan, “in which it foresees the establishment of a strategy that aims to improve the public security system and promote the transformation of the public security management model for the prevention of incidents”.
Furthermore, the statement states that members of the civil protection structure will continue to promote specific contingency plans for different types of public security incidents, “increasing the capacity for interaction between services, making every effort to ensure the well-being of the population, peace and social stability”.
Regarding last year's review, Secretary Chan Tsz King thanked all members of the civil protection structure for their efforts, highlighting that Macau faced severe extreme weather conditions, as the number of tropical storms that affected Macau was 14, the highest since there were records in 1968.
The civil protection structure activated a total of four response operations, including during the passage of super typhoon “Ragasa”, when the red “Storm Surge” warning was issued (the highest level). During this storm, the Macao SAR Government fully activated the contingency mechanism and strictly complied with the measures of “prevention, timely treatment and post-incident recovery”, said Chan Tsz King, quoted in the statement.</description><pubDate>2026-02-25 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Review of compensation on the Social Concertation agenda</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/revisao-das-indemnizacoes-na-agenda-da-concertacao-social/</link><description>The Permanent Council for Social Coordination will give priority to amending the Labor Relations Law regarding vacations and the period of maternity leave. Furthermore, the agenda for 2026 will also focus on reviewing the limits on compensation for accidents at work and the maximum amounts of compensation for dismissal.

VÍTOR REBELO
 
The Government and the labor and employer parties approved the work plan to be developed during the year 2026, during the first plenary meeting of the year of the Permanent Council for Social Concertation (CPCS). The organization published six items, including the review of the limits of compensation for damages arising from accidents at work and occupational diseases and the maximum amount of basic monthly remuneration used to calculate monetary compensation for dismissal.
The CPCS will also amend the Labor Relations Law regarding vacations and the period of maternity leave.
Furthermore, at yesterday afternoon's meeting, at the “World Trade Center”, the need to comply with the standards of the World Labor Organization Convention, the recognition of associations and renewals and matters that the Administration deems necessary to discuss was analyzed.
In statements made at the end of the meeting, held as usual behind closed doors, the secretary general of the CPCS did not specify which of the issues would take place first. “These are works that the Law determines that we have to do annually and they are different things”, said Chan Un Tong, remembering that two are reviews, one is an amendment. "If we can do everything together, we will do it. But, in principle, we will give priority to what society pays more attention to, which is the change in the number of vacation days, maternity leave", he pointed out.
Regarding vacations and maternity leave, matters that are under public consultation, until March 16, the secretary general of the CPCS assured that, after that date, “we will analyze all the information, opinions, suggestions that we collect online and even on paper”, and prepare a report”, followed by the discussion of the bill.
With regard to compensation for dismissal, specifically regarding the maximum amount of basic monthly remuneration, “the Law determines that it is done once, every two years”. This means that “we have to carry out the review”, he said, adding that “on these two items we will certainly carry out work and studies”. “We need to have information, data at hand and also talk to the insurance sector to find out the situation”, he stressed.
Furthermore, he pointed out, “we need to collect more opinions, more information, market data over the last two years”. “Based on all this data, we will then be able to dialogue, discuss and reach a conclusion as to whether there is a need to increase these amounts”, he said, remembering that these matters have not been the subject of public consultation.
In turn, Vong Kok Seng, representative of the employer side, highlighted that the employer sector “will pay close attention” to the work that will be carried out, particularly with regard to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and micro-enterprises. “The increase in these costs, in these compensations, specifically due to dismissal, will be a burden for them, or even in terms of increasing vacation days and maternity leave, it will be an additional cost”, he highlighted.
On the labor side, Choi Kam Fu said that he hopes to "be able to collect more data and information" in order to "give opinions in a more scientific way" about "the plans to be handled and the labor policies being reviewed, particularly regarding compensation for accidents, illnesses or dismissals. "We also have to know the market well, know what the market situation is like, operational costs, etc.," he said.
Regarding holidays and the period of maternity leave, he recalled that “we are now in a period of public consultation and we hope that this work can be completed this year”.</description><pubDate>2026-02-25 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>CPSP denies refusing visas to Japanese artists</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/cpsp-nega-recusa-de-vistos-artistas-japoneses/</link><description>The Macau Public Security Police Corps (CPSP) denied that it was refusing visas to Japanese artists, stating that it “did not receive any official request” after the cancellation of a music festival in the Chinese region.
On January 28, South Korean broadcaster MBC, which was organizing the ‘Show! Music Core in Macau’, a music festival in South Korea, which included bands featuring Japanese artists, canceled the event. The festival was scheduled for the 7th and 8th of February, at the Outdoor Performance Venue, in the COTAI area, created by the Government.
MBC did not provide any explanation for the decision, saying only that it was taken “after a thorough analysis of local circumstances and general logistical conditions”.
Even before the official announcement by MBC, the South Korean press had already discussed the possible cancellation due to the alleged difficulty of Japanese artists in obtaining visas to perform in Macau.
In response to questions posed by Lusa, the police clarified that the Japanese artists' case never came under their jurisdiction. “This service did not receive any request or consultation from the competent entity”, the Directorate of Services for Labor Affairs (DSAL), indicated the CPSP.
Under the law, the authorities explain, employers who wish to hire workers without resident status for functions in Macau, including staff for shows, “must first submit a request for work authorization to DSAL. "If the request is authorized, the employer must subsequently request the Public Security Police Corps to issue a residence permit to the non-resident worker, granting him the status of non-resident worker. The non-resident can only begin working in Macau after the issuance of this residence permit", he adds.
Lusa requested, on January 26, clarification from DSAL and the Macau Cultural Institute (IC) for Labor Affairs, but has not yet received any response.
On February 7 and 8, the South Korean male group Riize performed in the city without one of its members, Japanese singer Shotaro, due to “unforeseeable circumstances”, said the organization of the two concerts, the company IME Macau.
On December 12, the president of the IC denied any interference in the cancellation of concerts with Japanese artists scheduled for the region and assured that these were solely commercial decisions by the organizers. "It is normal to have adjustments regarding concerts or different events. Situations of cancellation due to force majeure are common," said Leong Wai Man, at a press conference.
Asked by Lusa whether there were instructions from the Government not to hold cultural events with artists from Japan, Leong Wai Man assured that “this is a matter for the commercial sector, it is the organizer's decision”.
In December, shows with Japanese artists had been canceled in at least three different hotel-casinos in Macau.
In November, the Prime Minister of Japan, Sanae Takaichi, caused controversy by admitting Japanese military intervention in a possible conflict between mainland China and Taiwan. Days later, Beijing advised against traveling to Japan, an example later followed by the regions of Macau and Hong Kong.

Macau International Airport (AIM) “successfully” achieved the third level of the Airport Carbon Crediting Program (ACA), according to a press release. Stefano Baronci, director of the International Airports Council of Asia-Pacific and the Middle East, described AIM “as a leader in efficient carbon management” and praised the reduction in carbon emissions and the airport’s “strong commitment to a more sustainable future”.
AIM began participating in the program in 2014, which covers more than 600 airports across multiple countries and regions and is the only global carbon management certification program for airports. Since becoming part of the program, AIM “has contributed to continuous efforts to reduce carbon emissions each year in order to maintain its second level accreditation”, it can be read.
According to the note, AIM “actively led interested parties” in contributions to the reduction of carbon emissions”, in aircraft landing and take-off operations, in airport staff movements and business and passenger trips, as well as with regard to airport waste management and wastewater treatment.
Stefano Baronci also took advantage of the milestone to highlight AIM's approach, which “is fully aligned with the industry's collective vision of achieving decarbonization by 2050”.
AIM management is committed to “continuing to work with the local community, stakeholders and airport operators to actively address climate change and achieve greater emission reductions, accelerating the stable development of the sustainability of Macau’s aviation industry, as well as providing concrete support for global carbon emission reduction targets and the national ‘Double Carbon Goals’”.

The essay, recently published in the newspaper Ou Mun, focuses on the performative actions carried out in October at the old Tempelhof airport, in Berlin, a place with a dense historical burden as it hosted rallies of the Nazi regime in 1933 and, later, the Allied airlift during the Soviet blockade. According to the author, the duo's work “sought to recognize language as a living organism”, inviting the public to “abandon prejudices and preconceived ideas”.
The project involved participants from different backgrounds, including Helen Ko, an actress recognized in the local scene, who participated in dialogue exercises through the imitation of sounds and improvised gestures. For Si Tou, this exercise allowed us to return voice and movement to a “primordial dimension of language”.
Quoted by the chronicler of the Chinese-language daily, Tam Chi Chün, member of the Advisory Council for Cultural Development who also performed at the event, argues that only through “deconstructing the frameworks of expression imposed by society” is it possible to “achieve a more authentic self-awareness”, free from “pre-defined scripts”.
The event culminated with an ephemeral exhibition at the “Mayer Pavilion”, an artist's studio located in a space under the supervision of the Berlin Senate, where 12 textile pieces were presented. As Si Tou observes, in these works, “the symbols and textures of different cultures appear interwoven”, visually materializing the multilingual “flow” proposed by the duo of artists.
“Neukölln Trans-lingual” was financed by the Berlin Senate, after selection by a jury, and also had the support of Fundação Oriente (Lisbon), the Camões Institute in Germany and the French Institute of Berlin, among other international entities. The work is part of the research that Cheong Kin Man carries out at Universidade Nova de Lisboa, financed by a grant from the Foundation for Science and Technology, within the framework of the Macau Scientific and Cultural Center.</description><pubDate>2026-02-25 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Catholic Movement raises funds due to “financial difficulties”</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/movimento-catolico-angaria-fundos-por-dificuldades-financeiras/</link><description>The Catholic Family Support Movement of Macau, a social service organization of the Diocese, which provides “various services to local residents and Catholic families, imbued with the spirit of charity” will raise funds, according to a statement from the Diocese, signed by Father Cyril Jerome Law, Jr. The fundraising stems from the fact that, in recent years, the Ilha Verde Counseling Center has been facing “financial difficulties, resulting in continuous losses that affect the stability of its services”. Therefore, to support the continuity of these services, on the third Sunday of Lent (March 8), during mass in all parishes, a collection will be held. “All funds raised will be used to support the operating expenses of the Ilha Verde Counseling Center”, says the Diocese, appealing to everyone to be “generous” and support the Catholic Family Support Movement, so that “more families in need can continue to benefit”. Founded in 1981, the Catholic Family Support Movement in Macau focuses its activity on caring for and promoting family life, through improving relationships between its members, especially couples.</description><pubDate>2026-02-25 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Session offers more than 130 vacancies in technology companies</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/sessao-oferece-mais-de-130-vagas-em-empresas-tecnologicas/</link><description>A job matching session, which will be launched by the Directorate of Labor Affairs Services (DSAL) and the Directorate of Economic and Technological Development Services (DSEDT), will provide more than 130 vacancies in technology companies.

This appears to be one of the ways people demonstrate cultural confidence as China consolidates itself as a global power.

Leading the trend is a fridge magnet made in the likeness of the fengguan (phoenix crown) worn by Empress Xiaoduan of the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), which is on display at the National Museum of China. More than 2.3 million units have been sold since its launch in July 2024, with some fans queuing up since 6am, even in the rain.
Starting this year, the fengguan and nine other iconic artifacts will have their own section on the e-commerce site Tmall. Among them are the “golden rice bowl” from the Shaanxi History Museum, from the Tang Dynasty (618-907), and the renowned “fat sword” that belonged to King Fuchai of the state of Wu, around 2,500 years ago.
Alibaba, the parent company of Tmall, announced that it will invest resources to create more than 100 new products and promote collaboration between museums and other brands.
These wenchuang, in the form of stuffed animals, bookmarks, key rings, mugs and other items, tap into China's growing emotional economy. Consumers are increasingly looking for products and experiences that provide emotional value, be it joy, comfort or stress relief, such as opening surprise boxes, buying products with historical references and going to concerts. Netizens praised the beauty of the cultural souvenirs and the happiness of owning them. Some also delved into the story behind the replicas.
The fengguan's owner, Empress Xiaoduan, for example, is celebrated as the longest-reigning queen in Chinese history, a virtuous woman who held the crown for 42 years despite not having a son. According to provincial meetings held since January, policymakers in China hope to harness the country's growing emotional economy to boost declining domestic demand.
A report by iiMedia Research, a Chinese consultancy firm, estimated that the country's emotional economy is expected to exceed 4.5 billion yuan in 2029, based on capital market calculations – almost double the 2.3 billion recorded in 2024.
Official data from May 2025 showed that revenue from museum gift shops grew 63.7% compared to the previous year. The turnover of the first half of 2025 exceeded the total sales of 2024, reaching 9.7 billion yuan.
Citing a market study, China Newsweek magazine reported that young consumers are driving this shopping trend, with those born after 2000 representing 49.7% of respondents who indicated an interest in purchasing cultural and creative products from museums. Another 29.4% were born after the 1990s, according to the study, which adds that 61.7% of respondents cited “emotional value” as one of the main reasons for wanting to buy museum souvenirs.
President Xi Jinping has been encouraging Chinese people to develop cultural confidence since 2012, when he took office, as a way to foster national pride and promote Chinese culture.
Years of consistent government messaging and investment in related industries have created a nationalist wave known as guochao, which leads Gen Z to embrace local brands, celebrate the “Made in China” label and connect with Chinese cultural heritage.
China Newsweek reported this month that the number of companies producing cultural and creative items has quintupled in the past six years, reaching 45,000.</description><pubDate>2026-02-25 00:00:00</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
