In the first nine months of this year, the Directorate of Labor Affairs Services (DSAL) registered 981 cases of labor disputes, said the organization in response to the TRIBUNA DE MACAU newspaper, which corresponds to an average of 109 cases per month. According to official data available, the cases involved 1,537 workers – 675 of which are residents and 862 non-resident workers -, as well as 723 employers.
“The complaints mainly referred to unpaid salaries, payment of overtime and compensation for contractual termination”, adds DSAL. Although this newspaper requested the number of specific cases relating to each labor conflict situation, the organization led by Chan Un Tong did not provide this information.
Regarding the branches of economic activity involved in the conflicts, the employees who filed complaints worked mainly in hotels and restaurants, civil construction and real estate and commercial services.
According to DSAL, there was a 22% drop in the number of cases of labor disputes compared to the same period last year. In the overall count for 2024, the government body recorded a total of 1,582 cases of labor disputes, meaning that the 981 cases registered between January and September 2025 make up 62% of the total recorded throughout the entirety of last year.
“To prevent labor conflicts, DSAL continues to promote labor laws and regulations to the public, through a combination of legal education and preventive monitoring measures, using diverse and multilingual methods to further improve the legal knowledge of both employers and employees”, can be read in the response sent to this newspaper.
During the period under review, DSAL also highlighted that it held around 40 information sessions, which had approximately 2,700 participants. It also carried out 123 labor inspections at 97 large construction sites and provided legal awareness to 660 companies.
DSAL's mission is to “create harmonious labor relations”, “raise the quality of human resources”, as well as “promote the profitability of labor” and the “development of occupational health and safety”, according to what can be read on its online page.</description><pubDate>2025-12-01 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Government donates 30 million to support fire victims in Hong Kong</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/governo-doa-30-milhoes-para-apoiar-vitimas-de-incendio-em-hong-kong/</link><description>epa12556619 People pray for the victims of the fire at the Wang Fuk Court residential estate in Hong Kong, China, 29 November 2025.

To support the HKSAR Government in responding to the recovery work from the serious fire that occurred in Tai Po, the Macau Government decided to donate 30 million Hong Kong dollars. The Chief Executive launched appeals to various sectors of society to help the HKSAR through various means. Meanwhile, the Macau Red Cross also channeled 500 thousand Hong Kong dollars to support the emergency rescue and relocation of affected residents
 
The Government of the Macao SAR decided, through the Macau Foundation, to donate 30 million Hong Kong dollars to support the Government of the HKSAR in responding to and monitoring the recovery work from the serious fire that occurred in the “Wang Fuk Court” housing complex in Tai Po, in the New Territories. In this way, it also intends to “express Macau’s feelings in facing the difficulties and challenges together with the population of Hong Kong”.
In a statement released by the Social Communication Office, the Government highlights the “deep friendship” and “long-standing humanistic, economic and commercial relations” between the two SARs. The Chief Executive, Sam Hou Fai, took the opportunity to appeal to various sectors of local society to take initiatives and support the HKSAR through various means.
According to the same note, Sam Hou Fai is convinced that, in the spirit of President Xi Jinping's instructions, attention and support, as well as the support of the Hong Kong and Macau Work Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, HKSAR Chief Executive John Lee and his government, “will undoubtedly lead and unite the various sectors of society in helping affected residents overcome difficulties, so that their lives return to normal and their houses are recovered as soon as possible”.
The Macau Red Cross also donated 500 thousand Hong Kong dollars for emergency rescue work and relocation of residents affected by the disaster.
In turn, MGM and Chef Nic Holdings Limited announced that they will jointly donate five million Hong Kong dollars in the name of “MGM Chef Nic Gastronomusic Fest 2025”. The funds are intended to provide emergency assistance to those affected, with the aim of helping them rebuild their lives and return to normality.
On the other hand, in an article published by the SAR Affairs Office of the State Council, it was highlighted that the attention and support from the Central Government “give the public strong encouragement and full confidence”, and that, with the “strong support from the Central Government and the Motherland – Mainland China”, the Hong Kong Government will certainly carry out the disaster recovery work well, overcoming the difficulties.
According to the most up-to-date data, the fire in Hong Kong caused at least 146 deaths, including one firefighter, 79 injuries, 12 of which were firefighters, and an undetermined number of people missing.
 
Intensified fire inspections on several fronts
Meanwhile, since last Thursday, several public services formed two teams to begin joint inspections of construction sites and scaffolding contracts in different areas of Macau. According to a statement, after checking the fire-fighting equipment, management of the storage of dangerous substances and emergency evacuation routes, they all comply with the applicable safety requirements. The contractors also presented, as stipulated, the fire resistance qualification certificates for the scaffolding protection nets.
According to the Government, there are currently around 566 construction sites in the territory, of which more than 60 involve scaffolding works. The Government promised that it will carry out, in the short term, intensive inspections of all scaffolding works, requiring contractors to strictly comply with fire prevention responsibilities, reinforce preventive measures and alert workers.
Furthermore, there are 73 temporary pegging licenses: Siding and Scaffolding, valid and issued by the Institute for Municipal Affairs (IAM), including 66 relating to siding and seven to scaffolding. From August to November 25, IAM inspected 34 construction sites with similar licenses, having issued improvement opinions for nine sites, which have already carried out all the requested improvements.
For its part, the Directorate of Tourism Services stated that it had adopted a series of measures to comprehensively increase the capacity for fire prevention, disaster mitigation and emergency response in the tourism sector. The measures include reinforcing inspections of establishments under its supervision, establishing a communication mechanism with the industry, and carrying out inspections to ensure the safety of visitors and workers in the sector.
The Cultural Institute inspected several places where works are being carried out on heritage buildings. And, together with the Fire Department (CB), it carried out inspections of heritage items such as temples, comprehensively reviewing fire safety measures, eliminating potential safety risks and reinforcing alerts to heritage managers and construction teams.
On the other hand, the Chief Executive chaired a meeting on winter safety, coordinating the inspection, correction and prevention of serious risks. Sam Hou Fai stated that the Government must improve awareness about fire and disaster prevention, strengthen publicity and awareness among society, keep society on alert to together create a solid fire safety defense line.
The Macao SAR leader highlighted four demands: reinforce inspections and corrections on security risks in large areas, such as supermarkets, entertainment venues, cultural and sports facilities; increase awareness and knowledge of fire prevention and evacuation procedures; intensify patrols and surveillance in places with large concentrations of people, such as transport hubs and border posts, strictly preventing the occurrence of terrorist acts, serious crimes, individual extreme incidents and accidents with multiple victims; and further improve emergency response mechanisms and response plans for sudden major public events, natural disasters and cybersecurity incidents.
In a program on “Ou Mun Tin Toi”, Wong Kin, commander of the CB, stated that, between January and October this year, 9,224 inspections were carried out within the scope of fire prevention and 103 punishments were completed.

The third phase of attracting qualified staff is about to be launched, said the director of Education and Youth Development Services (DSEDJ), Kong Chi Meng, in the presentation of the Lines of Government Action of the Social Affairs and Culture department. According to him, “improvements” will be introduced, including a plan to “add points to staff who have worked in Portugal or Brazil and also in the area of ​​traditional Chinese medicine”.
In addition, Kong Chi Meng also said that another 800 cadres have been included in the cadre capture recommendation list. On the other hand, the Secretary for Social Affairs and Culture, O Lam, said that she will collaborate with youth associations to create one-stop services related to support resources, to encourage the return of cadres to Macau.
In the session, Lam also promised to work to facilitate access for local students to universities in Brazil and Spanish-speaking countries. Deputy Kevin Ho defended the extension of mutual recognition of secondary school final exams to “other jurisdictions, for example Spanish-speaking countries”.
Recalling that Macau has already signed protocols with the Council of Rectors of Portuguese Universities and with the Coordinating Council of Higher Polytechnic Institutes of Portugal, Kevin Ho added: “Students can use these results obtained in exams here in Macau to access university courses in Portugal”.
Lam responded positively, but asked for patience: “We will follow this path to reinforce this work, for example in Brazil and Hispanic countries, but this is not easy”. Mutual recognition of secondary school final exam results could also facilitate access to Macau universities for Portuguese-speaking students.
The LAG report points out as a priority for 2026 the creation of the 'Study in Macau' brand platform, including a scholarship program for students from abroad who want to continue their studies in the region. The objective is to “strengthen the attractiveness for students from the PLP and countries and regions covered by the ‘One Belt, One Route’ initiative”, states the document.
On the other hand, O Lam said that in 2026 DSEDJ will open another three thousand places in an exchange program that brings students from mainland China to Macau. On the other hand, Kong Chi Meng promised to study suggestions to open primary and secondary education to students from mainland China, in response to the reduction in the school population.
However, Kong stressed that it is first necessary to ensure that students from across the border can take advantage of the facilities provided to local students in accessing universities in Macau and Mainland China.
 
Revised support for athlete training
The Government will review the support system for the professional training of athletes, with the intention of improving the sporting conditions of these professionals. In the Legislative Assembly, the Secretary for Social Affairs and Culture said that Macau's elite athletes can benefit from special admission mechanisms, the reservation of places during periods of intensive training, as well as establishing contacts with national sports institutions. As for secondary school students, he stated that the Education Services and the Sports Institute (ID) are collaborating to create flexible learning conditions to allow athletes to relieve the pressure of studies during periods of intensive training. On the other hand, regarding the merger of the Cultural Institute, Culture Development Fund and ID, O Lam said that these works will involve 1,188 workers.</description><pubDate>2025-12-01 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Architects with ties to Macau appointed curators of the Venice Biennale</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/arquitectos-ligacao-macau-nomeados-curadores-da-bienal-de-veneza/</link><description>Wang Shu and Lu Wenyu have been appointed curators of the 2027 edition of the Venice Architecture Biennale. The two Chinese architects have a connection to Macau, as they oversaw the territory's pavilion at this year's event
 
VÍTOR REBELO
 
Architects Wang Shu and Lu Wenyu, responsible for the Macau pavilion at the 2025 edition of the Venice Architecture Biennale, were appointed curators of the 2027 event. The Biennale, chaired by Pietrangelo Buttafuoco, recognizes, in a statement published on its website, the ability of the two experts to combine “cultural responsibility with experimental genius, offering a contribution of extraordinary quality at a moment in history that requires knowledge, balance and imagination”.
Its guidance “will inspire broad and necessary reflection”, projecting the “Biennale Architettura 2027” towards “new perspectives and new ways of understanding our relationship with space, memory and the community involved”, he adds.
Shortly after being nominated, Wang Shu and Lu Wenyu released joint statements, considering that the invitation “is a great challenge” and that in today's world, rapid and multiple changes in architecture “are more of an appearance phenomenon, the result of excessive conceptualization or accentuated commercialization”.
They add that “conceptual experiences taken to the extreme are often divorced from reality and excessive commercialization tends to be merely popular and ephemeral”. This phenomenon, they point out, “changes quickly in order to survive, breaking the connection with the real place, which will lead to the death of architecture”.
Therefore, they continue, “architecture becomes a kind of delirious expression about the future”. “In the face of the real crisis of this world, insisting on a simple and true concept and method of architecture has a special value”, they conclude.
It is worth remembering that when curating the Macau pavilion of the Biennale that ended in November, Wang Shu and Lu Wenyu were responsible for the “Parallel Worlds” exhibition, which presented “the urban fabric of the city where Chinese and Western cultures, old and new styles have coexisted for more than 400 years”, according to information released at the time by the Cultural Institute (IC).
The exhibition, executed by the Macau Museum of Art and supported by MGM, combined images of Macau's urban landscape captured by well-known humanist architecture photographer Iwan Baan and installations created by teachers and students from the Faculty of Architecture of the Chinese Academy of Arts and the Faculty of Architecture and Design of the University of São José.
The photographs and installations by the two curators aimed to “transform the multiple faces of Macau into a poetic narrative in the language of architecture”.
Wang and Lu are architects and educators, with more than 20 years of experience in the field of contemporary Chinese architecture, and co-founded the Faculty of Architecture of the China Academy of Arts in 2003, committed to reconstructing the study and practice of contemporary Chinese architecture.
Wang Shu, winner of the 2012 Pritzker Architecture Prize, was a member of the French Academy of Architecture in 2023. In 1997, he founded “Amateur Architecture Studio” in partnership with Lu Wenyu. Together, they founded the Department of Architecture of the China Academy of Art in 2003 and, in 2007, created the School of Architecture, of which he is the first dean.
He received the Gold Medal from the French Academy of Architecture in 2011. Two years later, he was distinguished as one of the 100 most influential people in the world by Time magazine. From 2018 to 2024, he was a judge for the Pritzker Architecture Prize.
Lu Wenyu was a member of the French Academy of Architecture in 2023 and a visiting professor at the “Harvard Graduate School of Design”, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, “University College London” and “Rice University”, having been awarded the Schelling Architecture Prize in Germany, a Special Mention at the “Biennale Architettura” in 2010 for the “Decay of a Dome” project. She was a judge for the UNESCO Asia-Pacific Prize for the Conservation of Cultural Heritage.
Like Wang, the architect maintains a sustained focus on the existing materials, the traces of the everyday lives of ordinary people, the vitality of these common and nameless structures, and the process and skill of the artisans at the construction site.
As a form of “double contemplation” – a critical resistance against reality and a challenge for the future – Wang Shu and Lu Wenyu together founded a new Department of Architecture at the Chinese Academy of Art, in Hangzhou, in 2003, launching a new teaching model that begins with “understanding materials, manual work and the representation of Chinese gardens”, highlights the Venice Biennale.</description><pubDate>2025-12-01 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Unemployment fell to 1.7%</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/desemprego-caiu-para-17/</link><description>Unemployment fell again, between the months of August and October, compared to the previous period, standing at 1.7% and marking a second consecutive sequential decline.

In the presentation of the Governing Action Lines (LAG), the president of the Cultural Institute added that “the parish of São Lázaro has a unique and very important location, because in this parish there is the largest set of Western-style buildings in Macau”. In this sense, Leong Wai Man said that the authorities' objective is, through the study of planning for São Lázaro, to “deepen knowledge of the current situation, as well as revitalize the vitality and economy in the surrounding area”.
Leong Wai Man also indicated that short, medium and long-term plans will be launched, exemplifying that in the short term, based on the results of the studies, historic buildings with conditions and potential to be targets for revitalization will be optimized.
The São Lázaro Neighborhood includes Rua do Volong, Rua Nova de São Lázaro, Rua de São Roque, Rua de São Miguel, Calçada da Igreja de São Lázaro, Churchyard of the Church of São Lázaro, Rua Eduardo Marques, Beco de São Lázaro and Pátio de São Lázaro. It was, in other times, the area of ​​residence of the Chinese Catholics of Macau, being classified as cultural heritage, in the ensemble category.
On the other hand, Secretary O Lam said that Avenida do Coronel Mesquita will be transformed into a typical cultural and creative area.

During the debate on the Governing Action Lines (LAG), the Secretary for Social Affairs and Culture, O Lam, said that the region will focus on disease prevention.
The LAG report foresees the launch, in the 2nd quarter, of an incentive program for health management, through the electronic platform ‘Minha Saúde 2.0’. “Residents who adopt behaviors such as healthy eating, regular physical exercise, disease screening and vaccination will be able to accumulate points and exchange them for rewards”, states the document.
The objective is to “encourage the adoption of good lifestyle habits and implement proactive health self-management”, explains the report.
“We are going to do this work to assess health and prevent chronic diseases”, explained O Lam, referring to the Macau Health Survey. The initiative will also be launched in the 2nd quarter and will, by the end of the year, collect and analyze health data from a sample of the population.
The goal is “to determine the epidemiological situation and the evolution trends of the main chronic diseases, some communicable diseases and (…) risk factors, establishing scientific bases for defining health policies”.
Last week, authorities launched a campaign that offers rewards to overweight residents who manage, in the first five months of 2026, to lose at least 3% of their body mass. The campaign is part of the Chinese national initiative 'Year of Weight Management' and O Lam highlighted that preventive health is part of the 15th Five-Year Plan.
Investing “in a health assessment and screening our diseases”, defended the secretary, “will be very important for an aging society” like Macau.

The Portuguese Association of Travel and Tourism Agencies (APAVT) once again chose Macau to hold its 50th National Congress, which officially starts today, kicking off three days of thematic presentations and debate sessions.

He adds that, as the most representative association of Portuguese tourism, APAVT “has played a fundamental role over the years in deepening tourist cooperation relations between Portugal and Macau”.
Post-congress trips, including a familiarization visit to Hengqin, along with tours organized by the Chinese Ministry of Culture and Tourism to Shenzhen, Xiamen, and Guiyang, will also allow delegates to experience the potential for cooperation in the development of multi-destination itineraries, which include Macau and Mainland China, targeting Portuguese travelers.
Speaking to Lusa, the president of APAVT, Pedro Costa Ferreira, said that the “strategy of approaching the main tourist source market, China, was one of the reasons for choosing Macau for this Congress”.

Considered one of the largest annual meetings in the Portuguese tourism industry, this edition of the APAVT Congress, which features DST as host and the Galaxy Entertainment group as co-host, will take place at the Galaxy International Convention Center.

DST opened its official TikTok account in 2022, where it has shared around 900 short videos in multiple languages, on creative themes, emblematic tourist attractions and itineraries, among other topics, accumulating more than 3.1 million followers from Southeast Asia, Northeast Asia and the Middle East.
The organization intends to continue promoting innovative creations on social media, expanding markets abroad and strengthening Macau's brand image internationally, the statement said.

The application provides tourist information, leveraging Artificial Intelligence to improve the tourism experience
 
The Tourism Bureau (DST) and Gaode, a company providing digital mapping, navigation and location services for Mainland China, launched the “Smart Travel to Macau with One Click” platform. The product launch and strategic cooperation ceremony was attended by the director of DST, Helena de Senna Fernandes, and the president of Gaode, Liu Zhenfei, among others.
The platform aims to “deepen the promotion of community tourism, through a global system of intelligent tourism services, boosting the intersectoral development of tourism + technology”, says the organization. Provide “one-stop” tourism services such as “food, accommodation, travel, entertainment” among others, in order to build an all-in-one intelligent tourism service platform.
Already in operation, the platform is available as a mobile phone application, integrating official DST information, festive events, real situations of points of tourist interest, traffic navigation and entertainment itineraries, among others, “to offer personalized recommendations”, taking advantage of Artificial Intelligence to improve the tourism experience. At the same time, the application is equipped with a sharing function, encouraging users to exchange practical suggestions and travel strategies.
In addition, it also contains a “List of street establishments” in Macau, reflecting the degree of popularity of traders from different sectors, “helping visitors to discover and deepen experiences, boost the flow of people and increase the economic vitality of community neighborhoods”, says DST.
In the future, the organization hopes, through the use of new technologies, to explore the application of smart tourism, enhancing the synergies of “tourism +” with intersectoral integration, to attract visitors to community areas and promote the tourist economy.</description><pubDate>2025-12-01 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Aircraft update affects Air Macau flights</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/actualizacao-de-aeronaves-afectou-voos-da-air-macau/</link><description>The Civil Aviation Authority informed that Air Macau has already carried out software updates for its A320 aircraft and that it will continue to monitor the situation to “guarantee the safety of air services”. The update, carried out following an alert from Airbus, affected several Air Macau flights
 
Air Macau has already updated the software for its A320 aircraft, requested by Airbus, the aircraft manufacturer, the Civil Aviation Authority (AACM) assured in a statement. According to the press release, the Macao SAR flag airline “immediately carried out the necessary software update”, as well as “the appropriate organization of the affected flights, in order to minimize the inconvenience caused to passengers”.
AACM also assured that it “will continue to monitor the situation to ensure the safety of air services”. According to TDM, a total of 12 Air Macau planes were affected. The Macau Airport Society indicated that, on Saturday, eight Air Macau flights were delayed by around two hours.
AACM's request followed a notification from Airbus, which announced, last week, the recall of around six thousand A320 models for an “urgent replacement of the flight control software”, due to possible vulnerabilities against solar radiation. The manufacturer had requested the immediate suspension of flights from all airline customers using this software.
“Thales”, manufacturer of the “Elevator Aileron Computer”, the affected device, clarified to the AFP agency that the software problem was not its responsibility. Airbus did not specify which company designed and updated the software. A source linked to the process revealed to AFP that around a thousand planes will have to change computer parts.
Hundreds of flights were canceled last Friday, reported the EFE news agency, with many airlines managing to relocate passengers to other flights in most cases. The Japanese company ANA canceled 65 flights, the Australian company a hundred and the Philippine companies “PAL” and “Cebu Pacific” suspended 80.
Air France suspended 35 flights, at the same time that the Colombian operator “Avianca” indicated that 70% of its fleet needed to undergo update procedures and expected “significant disruptions”, with ticket sales suspended until December 8th. On the other hand, TAP, Lufthansa, EasyJet, Brussels Airlines, Iberia and Swiss did not cancel any flights.
On October 30, a JetBlue flight between Cancún, Mexico, and Newark, USA, was forced to make an emergency landing in Florida. Analysis of the incident demonstrated that solar radiation could corrupt data essential for the operation of flight controls.
The Airbus A320 is currently the best-selling aircraft in the world. By the end of September, Airbus had delivered 12,257 A320 aircraft.

The exhibition under the theme “Nostalgia of Macau” will open on the 5th, and will be open to the public at the IAM Gallery until March 1, 2026
 
The story of Macau's salesmen will be told on display, in an initiative by the Institute for Municipal Affairs (IAM) in collaboration with the Macau Vendilhos Mutual Aid Association. The exhibition will open on the 5th, at 6pm, at the IAM Gallery.
“Crossing the tunnel of time, walking through the streets and alleys of the past, remembering the traces of the moneylenders”, this is the motto for the first large-scale exhibition dedicated to the history of the moneylenders. The exhibition will include texts, old photographs, old objects, as well as old sales licenses and utensils, in combination with videos with interviews, presenting different development paths of the activity.
The exhibition's core is the timeline, organized in three parts, presenting the 40s and 50s of the last century, in which the vendors' stalls were found in large numbers, from the 21st century to the present, gradually demonstrating the pace of development of the activity. “The content of the exhibition is well illustrated and three-dimensional”, emphasizes the IAM.
In addition to the articles on display, videos were produced with interviews and several “check-in” points were installed, simulating the tents of old vendors, in order to increase the feeling of being there and allow visitors to enter the time tunnel.
The IAM points out that changes in sales activity resemble a mirror of social ecology, “reflecting not only culture and social experience, and the consumption model, but also social changes, economic development and the life of the population”. Through the ancient objects on display, both residents and tourists can better understand the physiognomy of ancient Macau.
“Nostalgia de Macau – Exhibition on the History of Salesmen in Macau ‘Marcas nas Esquinas’” will be on display until March 1st next year, daily between 9am and 9pm. During the exhibition period, several guided tours will be available.
In recent years, IAM has been promoting, in collaboration with civic associations, a series of exhibitions under the theme “Nostalgia for Macau”, which this year has the activity of salesman as its theme.

“Pamela’s creative spirit and her work touched many people, and she leaves a magnificent legacy that will continue to inspire, joy and encourage people to live beyond the limits of convention,” her loved ones wrote.
Without revealing the cause of death, family members thanked staff at a care center in east London, where she was surrounded by “dear friends and family” during her final days.
They also did not reveal her age, about which the designer has always remained a mystery. The British newspaper “The Guardian” estimates that Hogg was 66 years old.
Many celebrities paid tribute to the designer on social media, such as actresses Rose McGowan and Patricia Arquette, who described her as an “interstellar diamond”, as well as the rock band “Blondie” and fellow designer Roksanda Ilinčić, who praised “the light and her incredible spirit”.
Born in Paisley, a Scottish city known for its textile tradition, the designer studied at the Glasgow School of Fine Arts and then at the “Royal College of Art in London”. He presented his first collection in 1981.
Often compared to Vivienne Westwood for her “punk rock” side, she was an emblematic figure of London Fashion Week with her futuristic looks, bold hairstyles and extravagant clothes, dressing big names in show business such as Rihanna, Beyoncé, Kate Moss and Lady Gaga.
Passionate about music, Pam Hogg also played in several bands, including “Rubbish”, which used to open for the group “The Pogues” at the end of the 1970s.
