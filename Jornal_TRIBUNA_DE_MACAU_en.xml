Rita Santos, previously appointed by leader José Pereira Coutinho as part of the list, is left out. Both denied any relationship between the departure of Rita Santos and the process underway in the Public Prosecution Service about an alleged crime against the Portuguese Electoral Law. Meanwhile, the current deputy Che Sai Wang appears in third place, behind Chan Hao Weng. “Full and essential” questions such as employment, housing, health and education are among the priorities of the candidacy

The choice of the 11 names that are part of the New Hope list with the elections for the Legislative Assembly (AL) was made according to the “availability of people” proposals. Therefore, Rita Santos was left out, contrary to what was expected, taking into account what was previously announced by José Pereira Coutinho.
The leader of the Macao Public Function Association (ATFPM) and deputy for several years, confirmed the absence of “who would like to be by his side”, but the unavailability of Rita Santos turned out to be decisive in not being part of the group of direct suffrage on September 14.
Following the delivery of the political program and the list of candidates to the ALC's Electoral Affairs Commission, Coutinho stated that “there was no political pressure” for Rita Santos to be outside the new Hope list. "Our list is not political, but civic, so it is a list of comrades, friends, but those who assume this place have to follow the new hope moth," he said, adding that "there was complete freedom to prepare the list of candidates."
Asked if the decision will be related to an investigation, launched by the Public Prosecutor (MP) of Portugal about an alleged crime against the Portuguese Electoral Law, both Coutinho and Rita Santos dismissed this scenario.
It is recalled that the MP da Mige has already “promoted the steps of investigation and proof collection” about the eventual practice in Macau “of crime against the electoral law of Portugal”, in order to determine whether a “responsible for a Macaense association has committed a crime against the Portuguese electoral law”. The steps were requested by Portugal, under the request for judicial cooperation, due to complaints of irregularities in the Portuguese legislative elections, the MP indicated, not to mention names.
In early May, the Socialist Party filed a complaint to the National Commission of Portuguese Elections, accusing the ATFPM to interfere with the vote by mail to the legislatures of the 18th of this month. "The presence of individuals who identify themselves as volunteers at the door of a Macao Post station was reported and observed, addressing voters to indicate where they should vote," he said in the complaint.
With the visa behind her, Coutinho reinforced the idea that the “childhood friend” has no full availability to hold the position. "Those who do not have temporal availability, who have family, children, grandchildren to accompany ... It is not possible and that is why she is not on the list as I always intended," he said, adding that Rita Santos is still very linked to Lusophone countries. He let escape, however, that Rita Santos will briefly return to the counselor's place, to which Macaense confirmed, shooting, "He's the one who speaks for me."
A few hours earlier, the president of the ATFPM General Assembly published a video on social networks in which he said she would not participate in the elections to spend more time with her family. However, he stressed that he will continue to support José Pereira Coutinho and ATFPM. “I hope they accept and respect my decision,” he said.
Rita Santos had requested in October the suspension of the mandate of counselor of the Portuguese communities, allegedly to prepare the elections for al.
 
Deputados têm de ter “pedalada” 
With regard to the composition of the new hope list, Pereira Coutinho spoke of the exchange of Che Sa Wang, current deputy at AL, Chan Hao Weng, who becomes number two. "The position of deputy is very demanding, because we have to intervene, to work, handle law projects, and not everyone can follow the pedaling," he said.
Referring to Che Sa Sai Wang, Coutinho acknowledged that "he has not been able to follow this step, since the projects are increasingly bulky, complex and so we have to be prepared."
Thus, the bet on Chan Hao Weng for the eventual hope of having two voices in the next Hemiciclo, has to do with “this preparation”, which adds the fact that the candidate speaks Portuguese and being in the active, as an employee of the Institute of Sport. "He is young and will be a good representative of the sports sector," he said, adding that "his role will be very important to pass on the image that we need to change the mindset a little within the civil service."
Regarding the political program, Coutinho revealed that he was delayed in two days, because "we have come to our hands many opinions and this reflects that we are not doing well, namely in business, employment, public health, sports infrastructures." "We had to change the entire initial project of the political program, fit in a more rational way and translate into the Chinese language," he said.
The head-to -ist manifested satisfaction by the group of proposed candidates, "which actually shows that there is a consistency and the new hope has come to last since it was created 20 years ago."
The program has 10 main coordinates that circulate based on “Full and Essential Questions for the Sustainable Development of Macao, since what we want is that the populations live satisfied,” he said.
Detailing, he said the job first: "We are currently debating with a severe crisis of unemployment and lack of quality jobs." Secondly, the quality of housing. "We have to have housing for all residents, a house leased to the state until people have financial capacity to be able to acquire a housing in the private market," he advocates.
Third, public health. "It is necessary to divert patients to the Islands Hospital," he argued, adding that the Conde de São Januário Hospital Center has 26 operative blocks "and is saturated, needing the consultations of some specialties to be improved."
Another important issue for new hope is road traffic. “It is an eternal problem that there is no way to straighten,” he says.
Already on the satellite casinos, it lamented that the government has “always delayed the implementation of concrete measures to resolve and only now at the end of the year is trying to see if it can remedy the situation, which is quite late,” he reflects, asking for merchants to know what they can count on three years from now.
As for the elderly, "we suggest that survival pensions will be increased by 70%." Regarding the monetary reimbursement, the deputy suggests that he goes to 15,000 patacas and does not discuss, for now, the issue of 183 days, as it is “a fait accompli”.
 
Requests direct flights between Macao and Europe
Deputy José Pereira Coutinho defended the existence of direct air routes between Macao and Europe, namely to Portugal. However, he says, “although the largest airplanes in the world can already land on the mashed track, there is necessary space for aircraft parking”, a problem that wants to be resolved with the expansion of the airport. "We hope that in the future it will not be necessary to move to Hong Kong to take an international flight to Europe or America and we can start the trip in Macao, which is our home," he said.</description><pubDate>2025-06-26 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Profits from bus operators grew again by 2024</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/lucros-das-operadoras-de-autocarros-voltaram-crescer-em-2024/</link><description>By 2024, the profits of Macao public bus companies continued to grow. TCM has accounted for gains of 46.2 million patacas, while Transmac made profits of 40.7 million patacas. None has yet to reach the values ​​of 2019. According to accounts of accounts, as a whole, the two companies signaled earnings of almost 87 million

The profits of the two public bus companies of MSA have continued to grow last year. As a whole, the Macau S.A. Collective Transport Society (TCM) and Transmac - Macao S.A.R.L. They accounted for gains of around 86.9 million patacas by 2024, an increase of 64% compared to the previous year. The highest growth was observed in TCM profits.
According to the TCM account report, published yesterday in an official bulletin, the company ended the last year with profits of 46.2 million patacas, translated into a climb of 231%, as in 2023 the profits had been below 14 million Patacas. Still, the company failed to reach the 2020 level, when it registered profits of 52.85 million, and stayed even further from the results of 2019, the year it achieved earnings of 72.36 million.
In the last year, the company transported 119 million passengers, another 6% in annual terms, having recovered 97% of the total number of passengers of 2019. “We continue to increase operational capacity, optimize routes and fully support diverse electronic payments. All bus careers operated safely and efficiently, ensuring the flow of passenger travel” read.
The Transmac account report shows that the company made net profit after taxes of more than 40.7 million patacas, an increase of 4.7% annually, since in 2023 it had accounted for gains of 38.86 million patacas. Like the previous year, in 2024 the company again had gains higher than 2020 (33.95 million), but has not yet been able to reach the profits of 2019 (45.26 million).
The volume of passengers carried by the company was over 108 million, with a daily average of 298,000 - almost 7% in homologous terms. The mileage of operation, in turn, increased by about 5% compared to 2023. “Last year, Transmac intensified the frequency of services provided during the tip hours in order to improve passenger transport efficiency,” says in the report.
Regarding electric buses, 80 with extensive autonomy were purchased, “concluding in 2024 the replacement of 410 public buses powered by new energies, which went into full operation”. Although these investments have raised operating costs, and fuel prices in the first three quarters of the year have remained above 2023, Transmac points to the profits achieved, stressing that possible thanks to “efficiency management and cost control”.
 
Safety, digitization and “humanized management”
Stressing that the Board of Directors “developed work in an active and effective way”, fulfilling the functions and coordinating operational development, reform and innovation, the TCM report states that “annual tasks were fully completed”, with the operation of the company “advanced in a stable way” and the quality of the bus to be “even more improved”.
In addition, TCM points out that it continued to update the operational fleet, with the proportion of vehicles powered by new energy to increase to 95% over the year, of which 100% are moved to new energy. "The new ecological buses have significantly improved the travel environment of passengers, helping to accelerate the construction of green public transport in Macau," he added.
He adds that the promotion of security through technology was also a priority, and management standards were elevated. In this field, various training actions in security services, emergency simulations, emotion management and vocational training were implemented. This increased “employee safety awareness, implementing security responsibilities and improving intrinsic security levels”.
By 2025, TCM ensures that "it will continue to maintain its original mission to serve the public, working with determination in improving bus services and dedicating itself to providing the public safe, quality and convenient bus services."
The Transmac report says, in turn, that vehicle inspection line equipment has been installed in accordance with government specifications, which can help reduce waiting time for inspection at the vehicle inspection center from this year 2025. “Looking to the future, we will continue to improve the formation of bus drivers, team formation, system digitization and implementing human management with digital approach in parallel, ”says Transmac.</description><pubDate>2025-06-26 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Ia Generative grows in Macau but threatens security</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/ia-generativa-cresce-em-macau-mas-ameaca-seguranca/</link><description>About half of the Internet users on MSAR already use Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI). In addition, most netizens find that the internet is safe, but the authors warn of the potential risks of AI use to defraud users
 
Pedro Milheirão
Almost half of residents (45%) and Macao's Internet users (49%) use Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), a report on the use of the Internet on the MSAR indicates. According to the Macao Internet Study Association (Mair, in the English acronym), the percentage of cybernauts using AI Generative was only 27% in 2024 and 17% in 2023. This technology “is entering a rapidly expanding period in Macao”, read on the study report on “Macao Use Trends in 2025”.
The tools most used by moth cybernates are “Deepseek”, with a 67%use rate, followed by chatgpt (47%), “POE” (20%), “Doubao (13%) and Kimi (7%). The most common AI use frequency among users in the territory is“ one or several times a week ”(37%), followed by“ one or “37%) Several times a month (21%), “once every few months (18%) and“ one or several times a day (15%).
The investigation group included Angus Cheong, Athena Seng, Jing Li, Wandy Mak, Candy Fong, Karen U and Huina Xiao. For the study, 1,213 residents were asked, aged between six and 84.
According to respondents, the main reason for using Generative AI tools is to "look for information and answer questions." On the other hand, use rates for other types of functions are still relatively low. For researchers, this reflects that the use of tools is still in a “superficial testing and use phase”, despite the growing popularization of technology.
The main users are usually "students, highly educated individuals and young groups." On the other hand, the use rate between people 55 or older, housewives and retired is below average, which demonstrates “significant barriers” in the adoption and use of technology.
The authors argue that “rapid development of technology” is remodeling the “global industrial scenario and the innovation ecosystem” and demonstrates a “strong potential to promote the development of digital economy”. To this end, the government must actively “explore AI-applying scenarios in areas such as education and health”, transform technology into a “daily infrastructure” and allow it to “benefit more residents”.
"Due to changes in work patterns and labor market brought by the Generative AI, the government also needs to be aware of the potential impact of new technologies on Macao's employment structure, proactively planning a work formation system to increase the competitiveness of residents in the labor market," they suggest.
For researchers, “it is essential to maintain a balance between technological development and humanistic care. Through the positive interaction between government orientation, academic support and business practice, ensuring that the achievements of IA innovation benefit the wide population of Macao residents, creating a virtuous cycle in which technological progress and social value creation complement”.
 
SECURITY AND PRIVACY IMPROVEMENTS
In terms of security and privacy, 61% of users consider that Macau's internet is safe. On the other hand, 38% reported having had online problems related to their privacy or security, which include virus detection in stolen devices, accounts or passing words, circumvents and privacy violations.
However, the data suggest that there was an improvement, in terms of protection or sensitization measures by users, since last year 49% indicated to have experienced this type of situations.
The proportion of users who were victims of online blows fell from 31% in 2024 to 15% this year. The authors of the study attribute this fall to “anti -fraud campaigns and technical interception of relevant organizations”. The types of online problems that users face also vary depending on the demographic groups to which they belong.
Highly educated and employed individuals are more likely to face safety problems than younger and lower levels of education. Investigators suggest that this phenomenon is due to the fact that they have more limited internet use, which makes them less likely to identify risks or problems.
However, the authors warn that threats to cybersecurity are increasingly diverse and concealed. Device infections and account theft in Macao "continue to be prominent problems." The use of Generative AI to “realistically imitate the appearances and voices of specific individuals,” called 'Deepfakes', or using technology to defraud users are other problems that require attention, they argue.
Giving television lectures, and live, focused on the “phishing links identification, called fake and deepfake fraud” and issuing public alerts are some of the recommendations listed in the study that the government should consider.
In the same vein, companies need to regularly implement and organize cyber security training for their employees. Community centers and elderly associations could also conduct initiatives to increase the literacy and digital security of the elders, ensuring an inclusive and safe internet for all.
 
Wechat leads on social networks
The rate of use of social networks in the MSAR is 99% among netizens, a value that has kept stable in recent years and shows that "social networks have become an indispensable part of residents' daily lives."
Among the different platforms, “Wechat” stands out with a penetration rate of 90%. For some demographic groups, the value is even higher, and this network has become in the “main communication tool in all age groups. It is even the most used platform among people aged 55 or over.
Youtube ranks second, used by 74% of residents and 80% of internet users, which means it is the most popular video platform in Macao. Children are the group with the highest use rate.
Here are the "WhatsApp" and the "Facebook", both used by two thirds of users. These two platforms are more popular among young people and highly educated, middle-aged and middle-aged adults. Adults up to 34 years old and with higher levels of education prefer networks such as Instagram, used by 53% of cybernauts, or tiktok (43%). In turn, the “XiaoHongShu” platform (51%) is more popular among women from 18 to 54 years old and with high levels of education.
Maintaining contact with others remains the main function of social networks, followed by entertainment and information research. MSAR social networking users use the various platforms to communicate with friends (48%), view streams or straight videos (35%) and look for information other than news (27%).
Outside social networks, and in general, leisure and entertainment constitute the main reason for internet use for 87% of users, 32% use it to access information and 28% to communicate with others.</description><pubDate>2025-06-26 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Suspended building project for the building for experts</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/suspenso-projecto-de-construcao-edificio-para-especialistas/</link><description>The government intends to change this year's budget with a reduction of 200 million Patacas in expenses, due to four public projects adjusted at budgetary or suspended, which led to a reduction of more than 610 million.

Citing the government, Chan Chak Mo said that “SME scanning services” will provide this year 1,500 vacancies, with 750 available in the first phase. However, only 1,680 requests were received at this stage, so the government decided to reinforce the budget, anticipating the eventual increase of vacancies.
In addition, it revealed that, according to the government, taking into account changes in the economic environment, especially the closet casinos and the impact on the peripheral business environment, it is necessary to prepare in advance. Although it has not advanced the budget and calendar of revitalization projects, the government has ensured that it has heard opinions, including from traders in Zape, and will focus on measures that may contribute to attracting a greater flow of people.

Offered mainly in low -cost coffees, such as Mega MGC Coffee, Compose Coffee and Ediya Coffee, the innovative dish brings all common features of the snack in a plastic cup normally used for drinks: frozen milk or cream, sweetened red beans, small rice dumplings, syrup to choose from, and of course, the piece of shagged ice that makes it one of the summer snacks more summer popular here.
Bissu in cups is just the latest of a long line of snacks and popular meals packed in a glass.
What can sound like a dystopian Wall-E Dystopian nightmare is actually a very pleasant and accessible form of food in South Korea, expanding its traditional instant pasta for the Bap (rice), Cup Tteokbokki (spicy rice dumplings) and, apparently, practically anything, in the palm.
Bissu is rarely considered a dessert for a person due to its price and size. Sulbing, one of the most popular Bingsu restaurants, offers its most basic, Injeolmi Bingsu (bean -covered rice bingu) by 9,900 wons (almost 60 patacas). Served in a large cup, it is an ideal snack to share with a friend.
The price of the instant Bingsu is usually located in the range of 4,000 wons (about 25 patacas), rarely exceeding 6,300 wons (38 patacas). This makes it an ideal snack to taste alone.
In South Korea, the accessibility of an individual dish has been the main attractive of the plates in the glass since the ancestor of the meals in modern glass, the Cup Ramen, was introduced in Japan. Momofuku Ando, ​​Taiwanese-Japanese that made and lost his fortune in World War II, invented the famous instant Ramen and packed him in a cup-known as Cup Noodles - To attract the international market.
In 1972, the Korean company of Samyang Foods food and beverage launched the first local version of South Korea Cup Noodles, which quickly gained popularity over the next few decades, especially with the introduction of convenience stores franchises in the mid -1990s.
Another popular glass plate is the Cup Bab, a roofed rice version that emerged as street food in Noryangjin-Dong in Dongjak district in Seoul. In the 2000s, Noryanjin had its peak as a center for aspiring civil servants, with numerous private gyms to offer courses for the public tender.
The students of the preparation courses sought cheap and fast dishes, which was attended by the street vendors who sold Cup Bab. Since rice is the main source of carbohydrates for Koreans, the BAB Cup was sold by about 2000 wons (12 patacas) and was a welcome change from the traditionally consuming cheap sandwiches and hamburgers.
Today's Noryangjin Cup Bab sellers are neither far nor close, as prominent as before, but the once popular dish found its place in convenience stores. The BAB Cup is now sold in cup packaged containers, which can be stored longer and instantly heated for consumption.
At the same time as adult students ate Cup Bab, their youngest colleagues filled their belly with Tteokbokki Cup. Restaurants and street vendors started selling the popular snack in small portions to children with little money, but since then found their place in the official menus.
Perhaps the more unusual cup food is nothing less than sushi, such as the “cold soup of sashimi with meat tartar” offered by local franchising. The plate of small portions is a limited time offer, only for summer, although the price is questionable for a meal of 13,900 wons (82 patacas).
