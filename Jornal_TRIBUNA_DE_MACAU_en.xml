The new Secretary for Security also suggested that the adoption of technology could help meet the growing need for personnel in security forces and that smart channels at border posts should be expanded
 
PEDRO MILHEIRÃO
The Government will create “a system of monitoring and warning indicators of risks related to the defense of national security and the respective implementation mechanism”, announced Chan Tsz King yesterday, which will improve the organization and functioning of the State Security Defense Commission. The Executive plans to continue to “improve the legal system and the law enforcement mechanism” within the scope of national security, as stated by the new Secretary for Security, during the presentation of the Governing Action Lines (LAG) for 2026.
Promoting “the legislative work of the Macao SAR State Security Defense Commission Law and the ‘Law on the prevention, investigation and repression of terrorist conduct’”, the Government intends to combat, “in accordance with the law”, “acts of interference” and destroy “external forces”. In this sense, Chan Tsz King also hopes to deepen cooperation with Mainland China and Hong Kong and review the “Blue Sky Action Program” plan to respond to “sudden security incidents” at the airport.
According to the Secretary, work has also begun on organizing annual educational activities on national security for next year. “With a view to consolidating and improving the knowledge of different sectors of society about the General National Security Perspective”, “diversified dissemination and training actions” will be carried out throughout 2026, he stated.
Chan also stressed that one of the Commission's functions is to “strengthen national security publicity and continue to disseminate education to all the people”. However, “it is worth highlighting that promoting education in national security is not a unique objective that can be achieved in the field of security”, he highlighted. “The entire Government needs to participate and perform its functions to achieve the best results, and it is necessary to reinforce interdepartmental cooperation”.
Remember that, last week, during the presentation of the LAG, Sam Hou Fai had already stated that, “in due time”, he will prepare the law on the State Security Defense Commission and the review of complementary diplomas. In addition to promoting legislative work to prevent, investigate and repress acts of terrorism, public consultations for the proposed law will take place next year, he indicated at the time.
In recent years, the Government has been strengthening legislation in the field of national security, having revised the Law on the Defense of State Security, which had been in force since 2009. This year, authorities announced the first case of alleged violation of the law, which involves former deputy Au Kam San. So far, the accusation remains unknown.
 
Technology will make it possible to compensate for staff shortages
In the context of the stability of society's security, Chan Tsz King also highlighted the need for the different services to rely on technology, especially to overcome the growing lack of human resources in the different security forces.
“When I visited the various services, I also noticed this problem,” he said, pointing out the lack of staff. “All service managers expressed this problem.” "But given the Government's policy, regarding the staff quota, we have to face certain limitations. I believe we have to be pragmatic, consider the use of technology and be realistic", stressed the Secretary.
“There is still a certain need for personnel”, reiterated the Secretary. In the Public Security Police Corps, the Customs Services (SA) and the Judiciary Police (PJ), “within two to three years, several workers will reach retirement age and the problem will be more serious”, warned Chan. "Maybe, we won't be able to make up for this lack of 100 workers. We'll hire 50 and we'll see if it's possible to compensate with technology."
Chan Tsz King was also “open” to studying the issue of “additional remuneration” for security force personnel, raised by deputies Nick Lei and Ella Lei, considering the “increased workload and pressure” that workers in the sector face with the increasing frequency of large-scale events in Macau. “We cannot forget or neglect the work of other services such as the health sector”, he highlighted. “We have to make a global and not partial consideration”.
In terms of technology, and in light of the progress of work on the sixth phase of the “Eyes in the Sky” system and the reinforcement of surveillance in Zone A of the New Landfills, which foresees the installation of 800 cameras, the government official said that they continue to run “in an orderly manner”, with completion scheduled for 2027. He also said that a new police post will be established in Zone A.
The Secretary also anticipated that the camera system will be expanded to more popular tourist spots and that “the collection of data and the use of intelligent algorithms” will make it possible to predict the formation of crowds and anticipate emergency situations.
According to the general commander of the Unitary Police Services, Leong Man Cheong, the more than 1,920 cameras distributed across the region have already helped solve more than 38 thousand cases since 2016.
Updating security forces will also involve optimizing “smart policing”, advance passenger information systems, monitoring the flow of people through artificial intelligence algorithms and network security, among other measures. In turn, the SA will also study the work on the 3rd phase of the “Intelligent maritime surveillance system” and update the night vision equipment and the drone management platform.
In the field of cybersecurity, Chan Tsz King said that a “manual of more concrete technical recommendations” has already been prepared, which will be published later this year and will come into force next year. The government official responded to deputy Leong Pou U, after a question about security and digital literacy, that education “will be reinforced because it is crucial for the security of the State”.
 
Expansion of smart cross-border channels
Between the end of this year and the beginning of next, and referring to the smart channels recently opened at the Hengqin Border Post, the Government intends to “extend the technology to the vehicle corridor, to allow Macau drivers to use easy recognition for crossing”, explained the Secretary.
Furthermore, a passenger under the age of 14 will not need to exit the vehicle, he added. “That Macau resident who lives in Hengqin sometimes needs to transport his child”, remembering that minors cannot cross the border alone. “We will adjust the measures so that minors can accompany their parents.”
According to Chan, since the beginning of the month, 100,000 tourists have already registered to use the new smart channels and 300,000 people have already used the technology. The official also anticipated a plan to “extend this new formula to other posts”, such as the Qingmao Border Post.
On the other hand, Nick Lei pointed out the problems of “abuse” of vehicle passenger channels by non-passengers. The Secretary acknowledged the situation and assured that he was already “collaborating with the competent services to guarantee order and efficiency”.
 
Secretary promised to reinforce the fight against illegal work networks
Chan Tsz King will continue to reinforce the joint work of the Public Security Police Corps and the Judiciary Police, in combating illegal work. In a response to deputies Nick Lei and Ngan Iek Hang, the Secretary stated that, so far, 76 cases involving 173 people have been registered this year. In the same period last year, authorities registered 63 cases involving 117 people. Illegal workers come from Mainland China, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. Chan said it was “a serious issue” and he understood “the damage it can cause to society”. The deputies had mentioned “the new ways of operating” of criminal networks, pointing out the cases discovered in the organization of concerts. "At concerts, we can contact the respective organizers and improve supervision of the organization. We have the means to do this. It is not a situation that we cannot combat", he stressed.</description><pubDate>2025-11-27 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>PJ will reinforce its ability to respond to AI-related scams</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/pj-vai-reforcar-capacidade-de-resposta-burlas-ligadas-ia/</link><description>Next year, the PJ will add and reinforce equipment dedicated to combating fraud using “deepfakes”, among other artificial intelligence technologies, revealed the Secretary for Security. Furthermore, in order to tighten the fight against smuggling, the Customs Services will invest in the introduction of various high-tech equipment
 
Asked by deputy Chui Sai Peng whether it is now necessary to optimize laws in order to better respond to cases of fraud using “deepfakes”, the Secretary for Security assured that the Judiciary Police (PJ) “has already done a lot of work” and “will not stop”. According to him, in 2026, the PJ will “constantly add and reinforce” its respective equipment to monitor the evolution of criminal methods.
Chan Tsz King pointed out that the problem does not lie in the lack of legal tools, but in the “too rapid” development of fraud techniques, comparing the issue to the fable of “The Hare and the Tortoise”.
"We have to run faster to keep up with emerging fraud methods. But, in any case, law enforcement services will always be left behind. It will not be easy to stay one step ahead of criminals, as the development of science and technology is too fast", he acknowledged. Even so, he highlighted the need to focus on combat methods and tools, so that they “advance with the times” and “meet, as much as possible, current needs and the development of science and technology”.
Sit Chong Meng, director of the PJ, revealed that, since April this year, authorities have received three cases of fraud involving artificial intelligence (AI) with “deepfakes”, in which the fraudsters disguised themselves as well-known figures in the territory with the purpose of enticing people to make false investments. None of these cases generated losses.
The director of the PJ highlighted an “interactive experience area on AI with ‘deepfakes’”, available at the Coordination Center to Combat Fraud, whose function is to help citizens learn about the characteristics of this type of crime.
According to the Secretary, in addition to organizing visits by young people to the Center, to experience “deepfakes” scenarios, the Government will add, in crime prevention activities, “tips on preventing scams linked to AI and protecting personal data”. Furthermore, he noted that the PJ's “Anti-Scam Mini Program” on Wechat already allows electronic reports to be made to the police.
Sit Chong Meng also warned that many fraudsters began to receive virtual currencies from victims. Giving as an example a situation that occurred in 2024, he said that, through the application of the Law to combat computer crime and communication with the respective virtual currency platform, among other procedures, the funds involved in the case are being returned to the victim.
In general terms, the Secretary highlighted that, as frauds have a cross-border and transnational nature, there are cooperative relations and contact mechanisms between the Macao SAR and foreign police authorities, especially ties between the PJ and anti-fraud centers abroad.
In another context, Chan Tsz King said that, in 2026, the Customs Service will introduce high-tech equipment, including large X-ray vehicles, robots for inspection under cars, industrial endoscopes and technology for electronic analysis of postal package data, in order to increase the accuracy and efficiency of investigations into smuggling.
Given the drastic increase in the number of young smugglers in the first 10 months of this year, the government official highlighted that notification mechanisms have been established with several secondary and primary schools, and intends to reinforce the alert through the press and social media. Furthermore, he promised to deepen information sharing and joint actions between Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau.
According to the Secretary, between January and October, 126 cases related to smuggling networks were detected, 136 individuals were charged and products valued at 28.42 million patacas were seized.
Also with regard to borders, it announced plans to expand, next year, smart crossing through facial recognition instead of document scanning to the Qingmao and Delta Bridge border posts. The authorities are expected to implement the same measure for drivers at the Hengqin Post, from the end of this year or the beginning of 2026.
He also took the opportunity to highlight that the exclusive vehicle service for Hengqin-Macau cross-border students already has 145 students registered, and demand has been increasing.
Regarding the idea of ​​opening four more borders with Hengqin, Chan Tsz King said that the Macao SAR will take measures according to the final planning, believing that the simultaneous existence of land and sea borders is preferable.
On the other hand, as he indicated, the cross-border ambulance service registered five or six cases between the SARs and six uses between Zhuhai and Macau.
 
Adjustments to prevent natural disasters
The general commander of the Unitary Police Services pointed out that, as of the second quarter of this year, 155 of the 201 action plans foreseen in the “Ten-Year Disaster Prevention and Reduction Plan in Macau (2019-2028)” had been completed or were in continuous implementation, while 41 were ongoing or planned. There are still four action plans that need to be adjusted and one that cannot move forward. In general, the Ten-Year Plan has progressed well, said Leong Man Cheong.
According to him, the optimization of dikes between Porto Interior and Portas do Cerco will be replaced due to the work on the East Line of the Light Rail. Furthermore, since the existing reservoirs already have sufficient water storage capacity, the authorities decided to abandon the plan to build another reservoir located at a high place.
The project to build a liquefied natural gas supply station has also undergone adjustments, as the Macao SAR has close connections with the gas pipeline network in Mainland China, thus having a stable supply. A plan that calls for the creation of an air support service team in Macau may also not be implemented, as cooperation agreements have already been signed with similar entities in Guangdong and the HKSAR, with a view to jointly carrying out rescue work in the Greater Bay Area.
 
Review of the anti-money laundering law
Furthermore, the Secretary added that the Government plans to launch, in 2026, proposals to review the law “Prevention and repression of the crime of money laundering” and the relevant administrative regulations, with the aim of increasing regulatory effectiveness. In this aspect, the sector's opinions will be “widely heard”, he assured.
When drafting the law proposals, it will be necessary to make horizontal comparisons and take practices from other regions as a reference, to guarantee the rationality and viability of the diplomas, he pointed out. The Secretary stressed that, in any region, information about shareholders is mandatory for companies opening accounts, a procedure that cannot be simplified.
Chan Tsz King also said that the security area will continue to promote the legislative work of the “Law on the prevention, investigation and repression of terrorist conduct”, stressing that he agrees with the need to follow the same reasoning as the Law on the defense of State security in legislative work in that area. According to the Secretary, the Government will consider the establishment of a specialized jurisdiction, as well as standards and requirements for judges who judge similar cases.
 
Beijing team asked to use PJ's image in a series
Yesterday, the Secretary for Security was pleased to see the image of the Macau Security Forces highlighted in films. As revealed, a Beijing production team recently submitted a request to use the image of the Judiciary Police (PJ) in a series. “The PJ will analyze the script to understand the impact on the image of the Macau police”, said Chan Tsz King, stressing that the authorities must take a “cautious and optimistic” attitude in relation to the stories included in the scripts and the way Macau will be interpreted, evaluating the positive and negative effects separately.</description><pubDate>2025-11-27 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Casa da Família Chio will host activities on intangible heritage</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/casa-da-familia-chio-vai-acolher-actividades-sobre-patrimonio-intangivel/</link><description>The restoration work on the structure of the Chio Family House will be completed later this year, the Cultural Institute told TRIBUNA DE MACAU newspaper. The organization will continually promote work to revitalize and use this classified property, with the aim of opening it to the public next year. In addition to presenting the history and original appearance, the Chio Family House will integrate cultural and creative activities and experiences linked to intangible cultural heritage

“The restoration and revitalization work on the Casa da Família Chio is being carried out in an orderly manner”, assured the Cultural Institute (IC) to the TRIBUNA DE MACAU newspaper, expecting that the restoration work on the structure of this classified property will be completed this year.
“In addition, revitalization and development work will be promoted on an ongoing basis, to try to have [Casa da Família Chio] open to the public next year,” said the organization, in a response sent to this newspaper.
Remember that, in 2024, the Chio Family House was classified as an immovable property, in the monuments category. Located in Travessa da Porta, this property was the second residence of the prominent Chio family, when they moved from Povoação de Mong-Ha to the city center, and also the only surviving residence of the family in Macau.
The main building is believed to have been built no later than 1875. The House is a Lingnan-style residential building, organized in a system of “three bays and three halls” with two corridors between them.
According to the IC, part of the House's spaces will be used to present its history and display its original appearance. At the same time, elements of experience and activities linked to intangible cultural heritage and cultural and creative activities will be integrated.
Furthermore, the organization led by Leong Wai Man promised that it will encourage society to participate in the enjoyment of this historic building, “injecting into it more cultural content that highlights Macau's unique characteristic of fusion [of Eastern and Western culture]”, in order to “enrich the cultural experience of residents and tourists”.
The IC has also completed the removal of various objects, structural consolidation, 3D scanning and the topography of the buildings in the Chio Family House, on which it also collected previous historical data.
In the presentation of the first Lines of Government Action of his mandate, the Chief Executive, Sam Hou Fai, revealed his intention to transform the Chio Family House into an “education base on traditional Chinese culture”.
Meanwhile, in response to a written question from the current vice-president of the Legislative Assembly, Ho Ion Sang, the IC confirmed that functions to promote Chinese culture and education through history will be added to this heritage building, pointing to the objective that the opening of the Chio Family House to the public will contribute to “better connecting points of historical and cultural interest and the surrounding facilities, reinforcing the dissemination of excellent traditional Chinese culture…”.
In the historical aspect, according to the IC, after settling in Macau, generations of descendants of the Chio family studied and obtained “excellent results” in the imperial exams. Furthermore, the Chio family actively participated in local social affairs, acting as representatives of the Chinese gentry community.</description><pubDate>2025-11-27 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Part of the Park in Canídromo will cost 1.34 billion</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/parte-parque-canidromo-custara-134-mil-milhoes/</link><description>The contract for the construction of the first area of ​​the sports park in the former Canídromo has already been awarded and will cost the Government 1.34 billion patacas

The ceremony will take place on Saturday, with a different route to that held at the beginning of November, but with the same 2.6 kilometers in length
 
VÍTOR REBELO
 
This Saturday morning, the Macau Peninsula receives the transport of the Torch for the 12th edition of the National Games for People with Disabilities and the 9th edition of the National Special Olympics Games. The route will be different from that used during the ceremony for the National Games.
The route, with the same 2.6 kilometers in length, but passing through different locations, will start at 9:30 am, simultaneously in the two RAEs and in Cantão. Half an hour before, the torch will begin its route through the streets of Shenzhen.
On the Macao SAR side, transportation will be carried out by 50 couriers, made up of Macau athletes from the Special Olympic Games for the Disabled, representatives of service institutions for people with disabilities, renowned social figures, members of the territory's sports sector and sponsors of the Games.
Eight couriers were chosen by the Organizing Committee and 42 by various sectors in Macau, encompassing the concepts of “cultural integration” and “inclusion of people with and without disabilities”, as the person responsible for the organization, Pun Weng Kun, said in a press conference.
The itinerary will start at the Government Headquarters, heading towards the avenues of Praia Grande, Doutor Mário Soares and D. João IV. It will then pass through Rua do Campo, Avenida do Conselheiro Ferreira de Almeida, Rua de João de Almeida, Rua de Ferreira do Amaral, Avenida do Infante D. Henrique and Avenida de Almeida Ribeiro “to show the urban physiognomy of Macau, characterized by the fusion of Chinese and Western cultures”. The event will end in the city center, at Largo do Senado.
The path outlined for the torch “will focus on accessible circulation, ensuring that all couriers can participate on an equal footing, fully reflecting the great spirit of diverse integration of the people across the country, of inclusion of people with and without disabilities and of joining hands to dream”, highlighted the coordinator.
 
Rehearsal scheduled for today
To ensure that the ceremony runs smoothly, a rehearsal is scheduled for today, between 9pm and 11pm, during which provisional traffic measures will be implemented in the vicinity of the Government Headquarters, the Octogonal Pavilion, the Tap Seac Multi-Sports Pavilion and Largo do Senado.
Regarding the bus service, from 8:30 pm until the end of the test, more than 10 stops located in the torch transport areas will be temporarily suspended, affecting more than 30 transport lines, which will have their stopping points adjusted.
Meanwhile, the Civil Aviation Authority will apply the measure prohibiting the flight of unmanned aircraft (drones) in the Peninsula, during the transport of the torch next Saturday. The ban will run between 8am and 12pm. Anyone who violates the measure will be punished with a fine of 2,000 to 20,000 patacas.
 
Tickets available for badminton games
Badminton is the only sport that will take place in Macau during the Games for the Disabled and Special Olympics, with competitions taking place in the men's and women's singles categories in the East Asian Games Sports Hall (Macau Dome).
Tickets for the National Games for People with Disabilities are sold as a “multi-day pass”, which means that the holder can attend all the events with a single ticket. The price is 10 patacas, there are no reserved seats.
As for tickets for the National Special Olympics Games, they will be distributed free of charge. In both cases, tickets can be collected at the Tap Seac Multi-Sports Pavilion and at the Mong Há and Olímpico (Taipa Stadium) sports centers.
According to the organization, sports facilities have places with reduced mobility for spectators with mobility disabilities or special needs, “fully demonstrating the initial objective of the service ‘to be based on the population’”. There is a limited number of reduced mobility seats at each competition venue, and tickets are only for sale in person.</description><pubDate>2025-11-27 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>“Remarkable Rhythms” at the Military Club with kite and yangqin</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/ritmos-marcantes-clube-militar-pipa-yangqin/</link><description>The pipa and yangqin instruments will be in focus in another edition of Clube Militar's “Musical Journeys”, this Friday. The interpretation of “Remarkable Rhythms” is performed by artists Sami Cheong and Kaia Kuok
 
Clube Militar presents tomorrow, at 7pm, in the Stanley Ho Hall, another concert as part of the “Musical Journeys – Young Talents”, with the participation of artists Sami Cheong and Kaia Kuok, playing pipa and yangqin, respectively.
The pipa is a traditional Chinese stringed musical instrument, also known as the “Chinese lute”. It has a half-pear shaped soundboard, a long neck with frets and four to five strings.
The yangqin is a Chinese struck string instrument from the dulcimer family, played with two bamboo sticks with rubber tips. Similar to the piano or the Persian santoor, the yangqin was introduced to China centuries ago through trade routes with the Middle East.

The Court of Final Instance (TUI) partially granted the appeal of a man who struck his ex-wife several times in the head with a metal hammer, having upheld the sentence imposed by the Base Judicial Court. Thus, he was sentenced to a prison sentence of eight years for one crime of murder (attempted) and one count of detention and use of a prohibited weapon. The man appealed after the Court of Second Instance (TSI) sentenced him to 11 years and six months in prison. The TUI considered that the TSI “did not fulfill its obligation to carry out a new trial, made an error in the interpretation and application of the law and determined an excessively severe sentence”. The case dates back to 2023, when the man attacked his ex-wife when she arrived home from work. Since 2017, the defendant “held a grudge” because his wife had reported acts of domestic violence and other family disputes.

However, several deputies asked for more measures to encourage consumption and the attribution of electronic cards. The Secretary for Economy and Finance stressed that forecasts must be cautious, due to uncertainties, and did not respond to these requests. Tai Kin Ip also said that the “savings” from cash checks – due to the ineligibility of residents who are not in Macau for at least half of the year – will be channeled into social support. On the other hand, he refused to advance forecasts for the Macao SAR's GDP for next year
 
CATARINA PEREIRA
 
Despite some doubts and requests for incentives for consumption and the launch of electronic cards, for example, the deputies approved yesterday, in general, and unanimously, the proposed law for the 2026 Budget. In the Legislative Assembly, the Secretary for Economy and Finance, Tai Kin Ip, stressed that “uncertainties persist in the external environment and in the economy”, despite the number of visitors having been growing and the integrated tourism and leisure sector maintaining a trend of “balanced growth”. In this sense, he stressed that forecasts must be “prudent”.
According to the proposal, revenues of 118.8 billion patacas are expected in 2026, expenses of 113.5 billion and a budget balance of 5.3 billion. As for the game's gross revenues for the entire year, the estimate is that they will reach 236 billion patacas, a value below that initially estimated for this year (240 billion), but above the revised value in the middle of this year (228 billion). As for measures to promote the well-being of the population, the amount to be channeled is 26.8 billion patacas, an increase of 3.8%, seen as “adequate and proportional” by the government official.
Despite the increase in the scope of support for residents, deputies defended the launch of other measures. Ella Lei was the first to speak, asking whether any measures are planned to encourage consumption. "We continue to see difficulties in the business environment of community neighborhoods, taking into account the change in the consumption behavior of visitors and residents. How will the situation be resolved? How does the budget take these difficulties into account", he asked, adding that policies to encourage consumption will "contribute to the reconversion and appreciation of the business fabric".
In the same vein, Chan Hao Weng pointed out that the consumer market “is weak” and that small and medium-sized companies and the population are struggling with “difficulties”. "In low seasons, will a consumer card be issued? For example, 10 thousand patacas", he said, stating that a traditional household appliances store in Macau, "Tai Peng Electronics and Appliances", will close its doors. His colleague, José Pereira Coutinho, followed the same path: "This electronic card, in addition to helping vulnerable families, can also support companies. Injecting 3,000 or 5,000 patacas into the consumer card could help a lot of people and revitalize community areas."
Pereira Coutinho also said it was “regrettable” that there would not be an increase in public servants’ salaries next year. Salaries will not change, following the opinions of the Public Service Workers' Remuneration Assessment Committee, indicates the justification note on the Budget law proposal.
 
“Savings” from checks allocated for social support
Ella Lei also asked Tai Kin Ip about how the amount saved under the cash contribution plan will be used, given that, from this year onwards, changes have been implemented, with eligible residents having to be in Macau at least 183 days a year.
In his response, the Secretary said that the “savings” will be allocated to social support. According to him, in the Budget for 2025, spending on checks was set at 7.48 billion patacas, based on 750 thousand beneficiaries. However, due to the introduction of new eligibility criteria, only 575 thousand people were “qualified”, resulting in a real expenditure of 5.6 billion patacas.
Due to the three-year period to appeal the decision, next year's budget will be a little more flexible, with an estimate of 6.64 billion patacas, explained Tai Kin Ip. As noted, although expenses with the granting of cash checks have decreased, expenses with welfare measures have increased by 800 million patacas. "The amount we keep will be used for the well-being of the population. It will be used for different assistance services to the population", he highlighted.
As part of measures to support the population, the Government will disburse 26.7 billion in 2026, an increase of 3.8%, said the Secretary. In addition to the cash check, there are also health vouchers, subsidies for the payment of electricity tariffs for housing units and the continuous development and improvement program, among others.
There are also measures aimed at education and support for the most vulnerable sections of the population, on which the Government will spend 15.3 billion. As part of the allocation of funds, as an extraordinary distribution of budget balances, the Executive will spend 3.68 billion.
On the other hand, in addition to continuing the tax deduction and exemption measures implemented throughout this year – such as the return to residents of 60% of the 2024 professional tax collection, up to a maximum of 14 thousand patacas, for example – the Executive also decided to move forward with the exemption from stamp duty on transfers of assets up to a value of six million patacas, in the acquisition of autonomous housing units by residents of legal age.
In this context, Chan Hao Weng wanted to know when the stamp duty exemption will come into effect, but the Secretary did not respond. "The main objective is to alleviate tax burdens for those interested in buying a house. We hope that residents will benefit as well as the real estate market", said Tai Kin Ip only. Kevin Ho asked the Government to consider moving forward with the same policy, but for commercial buildings.
 
Secretary does not risk making a GDP forecast
Noting that the budget “is very prudent”, deputy Joey Lao wanted to know how the Government arrived at the figure of 236 billion patacas in gross gaming revenue. “If we divide it by 12 months, it’s 19.66 billion patacas”, he said, also asking the government official to talk about the estimates for GDP in 2026.
In his reply, Tai Kin Ip said that, in terms of the game for this year, “five months did not meet expectations”. “Looking at the uncertainty inherent in the economy, this could bring a significant impact or challenge to our microeconomy”, he argued.
As for GDP, the Secretary did not venture a number. "It's extremely difficult to make an accurate forecast, no one can do it. The previous year we didn't make an optimistic forecast either, but in the end we came to know that it was better than what we predicted", he stated.
"Taking into account the geopolitical tension that we are seeing around us, there are uncertainties. On the one hand, we can count on the development of our country to support our economic growth, but on the other we have to be prepared against any slippage. As for GDP for next year, it is difficult to make an accurate forecast", he reiterated.
Joey Lao asked again about GDP, saying that cities and provinces on the Mainland make objective forecasts, and pointing out that this information is important for investors. Tai Kin Ip later said that in Mainland China “the conditions are much more stable”, which is why it is easier to make estimates. “We are subject to external factors, we are an economy exposed to the outside,” he added.
 
“Green light” for Advertising law and private health institutions
The Advertising Law and the Law on the activity of private institutions providing health care received the “green light” from deputies yesterday in the Legislative Assembly. Regarding the first, the discussion revolved around online advertising and misleading advertising involving other jurisdictions. In this context, the Secretary for Economy and Finance explained that, if other jurisdictions are involved, “it is necessary to see the connection link, to know if in Macau there is any center of activity, any headquarters or individual carrying out activity”. "If it exists, it is a connecting link and we can regulate and prosecute. If it is in another jurisdiction, we can do nothing," said Tai Kin Ip. Regarding private health institutions, several deputies asked questions about the role they will play in the development of 'big health', with the Government believing that it could be a “significant role”, in the words of the Secretary for Social Affairs and Culture, O Lam.</description><pubDate>2025-11-26 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>José Maneiras leaves an architectural legacy and an “example of civics”</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/jose-maneiras-deixa-legado-arquitectonico-um-exemplo-de-civismo/</link><description>Architect José Maneiras passed away in Macau at the age of 90. His work included collaboration on urban plans and the creation of residential and institutional architectural projects. He was president of the then Leal Senado, between 1989 and 1993. In the reactions to his death, recorded by the newspaper TRIBUNA DE MACAU, Carlos Marreiros highlights the “work together” in the requalification of Tap Seac and the activity that José Maneiras maintained until the end of his life as a member of the Albergue. Rui Leão praises his professional colleague as someone who “fought hard for the city’s issues” and Jorge Neto Valente highlights his “example of civility”. Anabela Ritchie was “shocked” by the disappearance of the architect, with whom she had a “strong connection”
 
VÍTOR REBELO
 
José Maneiras passed away in Macau on Monday night at the age of 90. The architect dedicated his professional life to Macau and was one of the first professionals to begin practicing architecture from local studios. He was, in fact, one of the founders of the Macau Architects Association, in 1987.
His work, considered to have a “very unique style” by professional colleagues, was mainly aimed at residential buildings. He also worked on the project to requalify the Tap Seac square, alongside Carlos Marreiros and civil engineer José Chui Sai Peng, and also coordinated the design team for the road reorganization of the Carlos d’Assumpção roundabout.
José Celestino da Silva Maneiras was born in the territory in 1935, into a Macanese family rooted in local society. He remained in Portugal for nine years, where he arrived in 1953, in the post-war period, and when the Estado Novo regime allowed specific openings to the international context, as evidenced by the holding, in Lisbon, of the III congress of the International Union of Architects.
The return to their homeland was part of a brief migratory movement that brought a group of young Portuguese architects to Macau, such as Manuel Vicente, Natália Gomes, Ramires Fernandes and Jorge Silva. They then joined the local government's technical staff, developing urban plans for the city.
The team, coordinated by Manuel Vicente, chose to propose partial plans, containing guidelines for alignments and heights. He succeeded Manuel Vicente in overseeing the work on the Liceu Pedro Nolasco by Raul Chorão Ramalho (one of the most significant modern buildings in the Portuguese presence), later fighting against its demolition.
From 1967 onwards, José Maneiras embarked on private business, maintaining a “handmade” production studio, with the collaboration of one or two designers, and selecting orders, which allowed him to survive times when projects were less requested.
Of his work built during this phase, and located essentially in Macau, it is difficult to find intact examples. In the 1960s, the architect designed and created a set of residential buildings with a brutalist bent, within the framework of the demands of tropical regions, which probably constituted his most important creative phase.
Of this list, we highlight the housing complexes on Rua da Praia Grande (Conjunto São Francisco, 1964), on Estrada do Visconde de São Januário (two residences, 1965), “Belle Court” in Penha (house and block of apartments, 1968) or the residential program for the blind, at the request of Santa Casa da Misericórdia (1970), on Rua Sete do Bairro da Areia Preta.
The city's recent growth, however, has stigmatized “modern” buildings. The Si Toi – Hong Kong Bank commercial building (currently HSBC – “Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank Corporation”, 1982), also designed by him, is an exemplary case of this phenomenon.
He favored small-scale projects, such as renovations of buildings of heritage value, and continued “old” practices, such as monitoring the work or creating detailed drawings. The Monument to the Macanese Diaspora, on Rua São Tiago da Barra, opened in 2001, fits into these concerns.
He also became a consultant at the company Nam Van, for the Praia Grande Bay Plan, and president of the General Assembly of the Macau Civil Engineering Laboratory. In 2006, he was named honorary member of the Order of Architects of Portugal. His work in defense of the dignity of architectural practice, in a context of high professional competition, is considered an ethical example for new generations.
 
Great dedication to the land and “valuable” professional
José Maneiras' work, his way of being in society and his love for the city are evident in the reactions that the TRIBUNA DE MACAU newspaper recorded.
Jorge Neto Valente lived with the architect for half a century. “As I came to Macau as a soldier, I met him through his father who was an army officer, and from then on we were friends throughout our lives”, recalls the lawyer, for whom the two were “companions in many struggles”, such as the founding of the Macau Democratic Center.
“He was an example of civics, putting great commitment to the civic activities in which he was involved, always showing great dedication to the land where he was born, as well as an example in his profession”, highlights Jorge Neto Valente. “Everyone sympathized”, he points out.
Carlos Marreiros expresses “enormous sadness” over his death. “He was a great friend, colleague and partner at the Albergue, who even at the age of 90 had ideas, always collaborating in activities”, he highlights, also pointing out the fact that José Maneiras was an honorary member of the Círculo dos Amigos da Cultura.
As a person, “he was a serious man, with principles and values, someone who did not question his independence and freedom”, he highlights. As an architect, he was a “very valuable” professional, he emphasizes, recalling the “work together” in the requalification of Praça do Tap Seac and the space. On the other hand, “it helped me a lot”, as president of Leal Senado, in pedestrianizing Praça do Leal Senado, he adds.
Among the works produced, Carlos Marreiros highlights the Center for the Blind at Santa Casa da Misericórdia, in the Areia Preta area. “It is closed today, but it was an advanced work for the time, all of it ramped to avoid stairs and architectural barriers.”
“This in the 60s was something innovative, a brutalist piece, with exposed concrete, the walls painted white”, he highlights, concluding that there are other works with an important mark by José Maneiras, such as a house for public servants, close to the Conde de São Januário Hospital, and a building located in front of the Military Club. “This is a building with a very rigorous geometry, very functionalist and one would almost say minimalist today, with no decoration, but a very well designed piece”, he points out.
 
“Big picture” of architecture
Rui Leão also spoke, heartfelt, about his now missing colleague. “First of all, he was a great friend and a person who played a very important civic and cultural role in Macau, having always been a reference for me”, he asserts. “Even as a studio architect and later as president of the Leal Senado, he was a person who fought hard for the city's issues, and in that sense he was a great figure in Macau's architecture”, he adds.
Rui Leão believes that his colleague leaves a legacy. “It has a very rich set of works and very good architecture, which it built between the 60s and 90s”.
Anabela Ritchie was “shocked” when she learned of the death of the Macanese architect. “I didn’t expect it, because he was well, despite his age”, said the former president of the Legislative Assembly, highlighting that she had a “strong connection with him”.
Both had, together, spent more than three years in the Leal Senado. They belonged to the administrative commission appointed by the Government of Portugal to prepare the elections for the Leal Senado. “I really enjoyed working with him, I on the culture, archive, public relations side, and he on the technical side, in a very interesting period”, he recalls.
José Maneiras was a “brother” of the Santa Casa da Misericórdia of Macau. The Ombudsman says he met him in the mid-70s, shortly after the 25th of April, and with him he had “the privilege of depriving and respecting”.
António José de Freitas emphasizes that he was “a prestigious figure recognized by all, who was part of those who believed in staying in Macau and in the continuity of our Holy House, of which he was a regular and participative Brother since 1997”. From his perspective, “Macau lost a reference Macanese who felt perfectly at home in the two cultures present in this city”.</description><pubDate>2025-11-26 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Cultural exhibitions in Macau grew 905% in 10 years</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/exposicoes-culturais-em-macau-cresceram-905-em-10-anos/</link><description>Between 2014 and 2024, more cultural and entertainment spaces were established in the Macao SAR, such as museums and cinemas, and, in general, the number of sessions and visitors increased significantly. On the other hand, cinemas, theaters and variety and dance shows have seen smaller audiences. However, artistic director Tam Chi Chun explained to TRIBUNA DE MACAU that reduced audiences are not necessarily a negative phenomenon. Rita Wong, director of operations at Cinemateca Paixão, also believes that, although there are now more convenient options than cinemas, such as streaming platforms, both can coexist



































PEDRO MILHEIRÃO
The cultural and entertainment offer in Macau soared between 2014 and 2024, according to data from the Statistics and Census Services Department analyzed by the TRIBUNA DE MACAU newspaper. During the period under review, the number of cultural sessions increased by almost double. In 2014, there were 41,441 cultural events, and last year this number reached 80,555. Similarly, and in general, the total number of spectators at cultural events grew by 158%, to 17.6 million, in 2024, which represents an increase of 10.8 million, compared to the 6.8 million recorded in 2014.
In terms of infrastructure, at the end of last year, there were 36 museums, 14 more (+64%) than in 2014. In the same period, the number of cinemas doubled to 10, with the number of screens almost tripling, from 16 to 47 (+194%). However, not all types of events registered positive developments, if we consider the relationship between the number of visitors and the number of sessions.
Cultural exhibitions grew 905% in 10 years, from 691 to a total of 6,946 last year. In 2024, there were also more than 4.3 million people visiting artistic exhibitions, 77% more than in 2014. However, the significant increase in the frequency of exhibitions diluted the average number of visitors per exhibition, which fell from 3,594 to 632.
For Tam Chi Chun, producer, director and artistic director of the Experimental Theater Group “Pequena Cidade”, “when the cultural audience in a city reaches a certain volume, visitors can go from spectators to ‘cultural curators’”, with increasingly specific interests, and choose to explore “alternative themes in greater depth”. “Under these circumstances, the number of spectators naturally becomes small”, he pointed out.
“I lived in Europe for some time and noticed that many cultural activities there have a relatively small number of visitors”, said Tam.
However, the member of the Cultural Development Advisory Council stressed that “this does not entirely reflect the situation in Macau”. “It is true that many activities are being organized, but with the aim of achieving some ‘key performance indicators’. Perhaps because the Government wants to hold more events, while the private sector also needs to organize activities”, highlighted Tam Chi Chun.
The theater producer argued that the city should invest in “in-depth projects, instead of looking for quantity”. "However, I believe that the emergence of more alternative cultural activities demonstrates that culture has really taken root in the territory. It is no longer just the model in which a master speaks on stage, while thousands of people worship him, then return home to wash clothes and cook, without transforming their own thinking."
Tam continued, with an example: "A master gave a lecture in Macau, having aroused someone's interest. A decade later, and after studying, this person decided to organize his own activity in Macau, with his own interest. His activity may attract only 10 spectators. But, isn't this the true transmission of culture? I think this has much more meaning than always following the model with a famous master in the lecture and a thousand people worshiping him", he asserted.
The artistic director believes that “a spectator who values ​​diverse perspectives and ways of thinking expects to be able to find activities on specific themes”. "I don't mind seeing more cultural events with a smaller audience, precisely because these activities are aimed at minority groups. It is through the abundance of alternative cultural activities that the cultural diversity of a city can be seen", he maintained.
“The cultural activities that we find on the streets of New York, Paris and Berlin are never repetitive, but quite diverse”, argued Tam Chi Chun. "Why do we perceive these cities as vibrant and dynamic? The ideal final form lies in an abundance of distinct cultural activities, each one not requiring a high number of visitors", he stressed.
“If the public has many options, the organizers do not need to feel sad because of a reduced number of spectators, or the difficulties in obtaining financial support, since the cultural themes they intend to explore are ‘alternative’”, he asserted.
Saying that the population is small, he considers that, “with a 900% increase in cultural activities, it is impossible for us to also gain 900% more time per year to attend these activities”. “The most important thing is not just to produce more programs, but to make society believe again that culture is not a mere accessory, but has its own reasons for existing”, concluded Tam.
However, Tam Chi Chun admitted that his perspective represents “a relatively idealistic desire that one still has to strive for.” “The central meaning of the existence of culture in Macau has not yet been seen as a social consensus”, pointed out the director of “Pequena Cidade”, stressing that this issue “represents a crucial issue for citizens, cultural creators and political decision-makers”.
 
Growth of Macau cinema
Last year, 68,846 film screenings were recorded, 91% more than the 36,133 recorded in 2014. In fact, 1,897 different films were shown throughout 2024, representing an increase of 277% compared to 2014. Furthermore, the screening of films produced in Macau more than quadrupled in that decade, going from 50 to 206 (+312%).
Rita Wong, head of operations at Cinemateca Paixão, believes that the number of local productions should continue to grow. “In 2014, Macau cinema was still taking ‘baby steps’”, recalled Rita Wong. "In the 2000s, there was no Macau cinema. It started around 2007, but only with documentaries and animations, without even short films and I believe the first short film appeared in 2012." “Local directors and students started producing short films between 2012 and 2013. Hence, there were already some films produced locally in 2014, with only one or two being feature films”, noted Rita Wong, also remembering the film “Sisterhood” by filmmaker Tracy Choi as a cultural landmark.
Rita Wong explained that the return of students from abroad, the organization of film festivals in Macau and other Government initiatives have encouraged film production in the territory, giving the example of the Panorama do Cinema de Macau festival. At the same time, “the Cinematheque was also established with the aim of presenting more Macau films”, he added.
Despite an explosion in the supply of films, in the decade under review, the number of spectators in cinemas fell by 41%, to just over one million, in 2024, coinciding with a period in which streaming services rose in terms of popularity. In 2024, the average number of spectators for each film showing in Macao SAR cinemas was 15, compared to 48 in 2014.
The director of the Audiovisual Association “CUT” also recognized that cinemas face challenges, however, she considers that the two consumption experiences are “completely different”. "Before Netflix, we also had 'DVDs,' 'Blu-Rays.'
The director added that, “especially nowadays, there are different types of experiences, like ‘IMAX’, in Taipa”. Furthermore, “different events are also organized, such as bringing directors or some guests to speak after the session, so that it is not just a film”. "After the film we can communicate with other people. It doesn't have to be one or the other, both [the experiences] can coexist", he considered.
With theaters, the same phenomenon occurred. Despite there being 524 more sessions than in 2014 (842), there were 19.7 thousand fewer spectators. The average number of viewers per session fell from 240 to 133.5 in 2024.
In the same period of time, variety shows and dances suffered drops of 22% and 56%, respectively, in session frequency. In terms of audience, variety shows lost 43% of spectators and dances lost more than half (-57%).
In the opposite direction, the concerts attracted more than 1.8 million spectators last year, compared to 481 thousand in 2014. Taking into account that 1,096 concerts were held in 2024, 291 fewer than a decade before, the average number of spectators per concert shot up to 1,701 people (+390%).
 
Students from abroad “monopolize” local art courses
In the field of education, if we look at higher education, comparing the 2014 and 2015 academic year with the 2024 to 2025 academic season, the total number of students enrolled in arts courses increased more than five times, from 1,129 to 5,855 (+419%).
However, within a decade, these vacancies began to be disproportionately filled by students from abroad compared to local students. Of the 5,855 students enrolled in the last academic year, 5,054 came from outside Macau, representing 86% of the total. A decade earlier, the 627 students from abroad represented just over half (56%).
If we only analyze the number of finalists from art courses, these increased from 140 to 1,143 (+716%), between 2014 and 2024. In 2014, the proportion of finalists resident and abroad was practically balanced, with 68 local and 72 coming from outside Macau. However, after 10 years, 998 students from abroad represented 87% of art course finalists, compared to just 145 local students.
Tam Chi Chun considers the phenomenon to be "a coin with two sides. On the one hand, it proves the attractiveness of Macau's artistic education, as it manages to attract students from abroad. However, the most important thing is that, in four years, students are able to absorb the local culture of Macau, by feeling and learning in this land", he emphasizes, "instead of simply acquiring knowledge that could be obtained anywhere in the world".
In this context, Tam rejected the idea that there is a risk of loss of cultural identity. “If students understand Macau, and learn the city’s cultural language, it can be known abroad, through these students who will take it to the world”. "In my opinion, this is what we should strive for. The presence of international students is a good start. By studying in Macau, they will feel the life, culture and humanistic environment of this land", reinforced the director.
At the same time, "local students or teachers they meet will probably discuss local arts with them. Or they might attend film festivals," he suggested. “All of this constitutes the process of cultural experience in Macau”.
However, although Tam Chi Chun recognized that there is a certain marginalization of local artists, he did not attribute full responsibility to the presence of international students. "It is known that international students tend to represent a high percentage among students at art institutions around the world. However, I consider that local artists are marginalized because the focus of the cultural market, such as concerts and highlight programs at art festivals or international music festivals, is usually biased towards artists from abroad", lamented the director.
Tam Chi Chun defended “financial support to be able to produce more localized programs and reissues”. "Essentially, a type of support that can allow artists to develop in a more stable way. But this financial support should not be short-term, for just one year, for example, or merely for the organization of a limited number of events", he concluded.

Sakie continues to regret the long period without progress in the case.
Mrs Yokota, 89, told journalists ahead of the anniversary that the prolonged separation leaves her “in shock” but still clings to the hope of a reunion, after she and other family members of those abducted appealed to Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi and US President Donald Trump to bring their loved ones back.
Megumi disappeared at the age of 13, while returning home from badminton training at her high school in Niigata, on the coast of the Sea of ​​Japan, on November 15, 1977.
“It was as if I had been thrown into total darkness,” said mother Yokota, recalling her desperate search for her daughter. “I cried and screamed every day.”
Twenty years later, in 1997, Japanese police stated that Megumi had been kidnapped by North Korea and, in the same year, Yokota and her husband, Shigeru, founded the kidnapped families group. Since then, the couple have led the campaign to bring the victims back. But her husband passed away in 2020.
Over the years, Yokota has repeatedly expressed outrage at the lack of progress regarding the abductions, describing them as “a terrible thing.”
Mrs. Yokota, who turns 90 in February, admits that she feels exhausted: "I have exhausted my energy and willpower. Sometimes I think I may never see her again."
However, he said he has “high expectations” that Prime Minister Takaichi can move things forward. Takaichi met with the families of kidnapping victims just two days after taking office, and also stated that he had proposed a summit meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.
"There is no time to waste when it comes to solving this problem. I would like to obtain a concrete result" through a meeting with Kim, Takaichi told reporters on November 14.
Donald Trump, during his visit to Japan for talks with Takaichi, also met with the families, including Yokota, and reiterated his commitment to the issue, saying: “We always have this in mind”.
Ms Yokota said at a recent meeting with her supporters: "I have had a truly sad feeling for many, many years. I know she is there (in North Korea), but I can't see her or hear her voice. But, I believe she is fine."
Megumi is among 17 Japanese citizens that the Japanese government officially lists as having been abducted by North Korea throughout the 1970s and 1980s. The government also alleges Pyongyang's involvement in many other disappearances.
The Kyodo agency recalls that in 2002, five kidnapped people were returned, after the then Japanese Prime Minister, Junichiro Koizumi, met with Kim Jong Il, in Pyongyang, on September 17 of that year, the first summit between the two countries that do not maintain diplomatic relations.
