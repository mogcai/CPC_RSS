Macao should not be immune to commercial conflict between the US and China, but it is still early to draw conclusions. This is the conviction of some specialists in economics and commerce. Customs tariffs imposed by the Trump administration may mean "direct or indirect risks" for Masters, "particularly in tourism, foreign investment and business logistics," Macao de Macao António Felix Pontes told the newspaper. José Luís de Sales Marques considers that although "it cannot be said that the impact will be great, it will surely affect the low textile industry that Macau still has." José Isaac Duarte, for his part, states that "the problem is the uncertainty created." Already Bernardo Mendia admits that there is still the possibility of the US reversing tariffs, or part of them, “following any concessions from other countries or more harmful effects than initially foreseen” by Donald Trump

The announcement of the application of global customs cuisines by the Trump administration and the consequent response of China, which decided to impose a 34% tariff on the imports of all US products from next Thursday, April 10, aggravated negative reactions in international markets, after the bags have already reflected concerns about climbing the commercial war. Macao has not been included in an extensive list of countries or regions where US tariffs will be applied, but, directly or indirectly, may suffer consequences.
António Félix Pontes told the Jornal Tribuna de Macao that Macau will not be immune to commercial conflict, as it is an integral part of China. "Although MSAR is not a goods production center, the United States are from its main business partners and, inevitably, will emerge several direct and indirect risks, in particular, in tourism, foreign investment and business logistics," he foresees.
Thus, the economist points out that Macau “will face several consequences”, highlighting some such as the “economic impact on related efforts, on the one hand, with commerce, due to commercial tensions between China and the American state and, on the other, in economic diversification, inducing the one that gives a greater effective acceleration in this domain”.
To these possible reflexes, “risks to the tourism industry can also be added, with the reduction of the number of visitors -if there is economic recession -and also in the investment from abroad, due to the uncertainty that is already felt in capital markets”.
José Isaac Duarte, in turn, says that the exports and imports from Macau to the US is not very significant, so it views the question "more because of the effect it may have in China, the Chinese market, and on Macao customers."
The economist considers that "everything is still very incipient and no one has realized very well in which game we are." "It is very premature to make great predictions," he says, warning, however, that "to continue in this trend, this can have consequences on the level of activity of the Chinese economy."
As Macau depends on “much of what comes from China, if investors have yields or uncertainties, it is natural that this has an impact on our tourism funds and associated recipes,” he says.
According to Isaac Duarte, "China has a commercial surplus with the United States, so it's very open game." "Let's see how things evolve in the coming days," he added, saying that the problem is the uncertainty created.
"Regardless of its evolution in short-term prices, uncertainty tends to lead people to inhibit themselves into consumption and investment, and therefore, it has consequences itself," he reiterated.
Several experts already talk about a possible global economic recession. Isaac Duarte assumes that "if there is a recession, we have to handle it as we endured the others," "Macau is fortunate to have had over the past 20 years, even with ups and lows, a global trend of accumulation, having a parallel financial reserve in the world."
The economist says that "it is natural that there are demonstrations of concern of the authorities, but we are not surely the most poorly placed in the world to survive another recession."
Regarding the non -inclusion of Macao on the list of countries or regions affected by the tariffs, Isaac Duarte is unaware of the reasons and asks whether the US will treat Mand as China or not. "This is another matter, which has to be clarified."
Recognizing that there is "expectation and uncertainty," the economist insists that "this uncertainty in itself will lead economic agents to retract and this may have some consequence." However, he believes that it takes a few more days to "start realizing how this situation will be consolidated."
 
US exports “will be affected”
For José Luís de Sales Marques, the punitive tariffs that Trump administration has just imposed imports from goods from around the world to the US are, "in principle, extended to Macao." The 54% rate on the amount applicable to imports from China “are also applicable to Hong Kong, although the neighboring territory is, like Macau, an autonomous customs territory,” he says.
Thus, it goes on, "except for some exception for announcing, Macao exports to the US will also be affected." For the economist, the balance of goods between Macao and the US is "highly favorable to the first," that is, "Macao matters much more than exports to that market."
By way of example, he adds, “the largest share of Macao's domestic exports to the US is made up of clothing in the form of meshes”, indicating that the value reached last year of the total exports of this merchandise was about 157 million patacas, representing more than 90% of this rubric.
So, says Sales Marques, "we cannot say that the impact will be great, but it will surely affect the low textile industry that Macau still has."
Regarding the Macao foreign trade with the US, "what will be seen is that the prices of products imported from this market, such as the clothing and footwear of some well -known brands will rise, because the supply chain is multinational, and both raw materials and imported intermediate products will also have their prices aggravated." That is the other way, “we will all lose,” he warns.
 
Service -based economic structure
Meanwhile, Bernardo meant, secretary general of the Luso-Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry, notes that tariffs harm the world, including the US themselves. "Some countries will be directly affected, namely China, which is the factory of the world, but the same will succeed the less industrialized territories, such as Europe or Macao, whose economic structure is based on services, which, in turn, are the more rendered the greater the confidence of economic agents."
"Unfortunately, after the announcement of the imposition of tariffs, financial markets have suffered abnormal losses, which proves the loss of confidence," he says, "in reality, it is the people who will suffer the most, that is, each of us, as the fall in confidence and markets are probable inflation and economic recession, which always affects more who has less."
Bernardo Mendia admits that there is still the possibility of Washington to reverse the tariffs, or part of them, following any concessions from other countries and/or more harmful effects than those initially provided by the Trump administration. In this scenario, "we may have a softer and less aggressive economic activity for people."
For the analyst, "in the ideal world of US administration, the dollar will remain the resting border of the rest of the world, China will leave Renminmbi float freely-that is, valuing currency and making its exports less competitive-and will also liberalize capital movement, while the US will be an industrialized nation again, thus correcting the current imbalances of the global financial system."
However, it considers that "China will not give in without compensatory counterparts, while it is evident that the next possible stabilization agreement of the global financial system will undergo a negotiation between the US and China, perhaps without European participation."
 
Maintain privileges and benefits of the dollar
It reminds you that President Xi Jinping has declared the possibility of "changes not seen in over 100 years." "Meanwhile, President Trump seems to want to accelerate this transition, but apparently without realizing that the transition needed planning and negotiation, because America will not industrialize by decree," he continues.
From a point of view, what the US wants is, "probably, maintaining the privileges and benefits of dollar hegemony as a reserve currency, as well as continuing to use the dollar as a financial and geopolitical weapon (economic sanctions, swift, currency impression, etc.) and, at the same time, Americans want to reduce the costs of this system, namely the deindustrialization of their country and elevated debt."
Menda judges that China will seek, for its part, "occupy the position it considers to be its own merit and thus obtain respect from its peers."
Also in a general analysis of the US's imposition of tariffs on a large number of countries or regions, António Felix Pontes understands that the rationality underlying the establishment of these tariffs encompasses "a set of economic, political and strategic objectives." Its main justifications are “protecting US industries from external competition and giving greater guarantees to domestic employment,” as well as “reducing commercial unbalanced, as the US commercial balance records a high and worrying deficit, given that the country's product exports have historically been much lower than imports of goods.”
On the other hand, it goes on, "they intend to generate greater revenues, constituting tariffs one of the largest sources of US treasury revenues" and "using high tariffs as a geopolitical instrument to press certain countries to solve matters of a non-commercial nature, such as immigration."
To these justifications, the former member of Donald Trump's “ideological and historical precedents” Board of Monetary Authority “who has presented, as an example, the identical initiative taken by US President William McKinley, in his term (1897-1901), but not referring to the then economic and financial context, which was not yet taxes on income”.
It recognizes, however, that there are cases “of a certain justice in the application of tariffs”, pointing out situations indicated by Karoline Leavitt about 50% of the European Union on US dairy products, the 700% Japanese rate on US rice and the 100% Indian rate on US agricultural products.
Consulting the new table, presented by President Trump, and decoding the formula used to determine the rates “that other countries, he said, focus on the export of American products”, Felix Pontes attests that “this customs justice ceases to make sense and becomes a true and unjustified tariff obsession”.
As for the formula that the new American administration has used to indicate the current rate of other countries applied to American products, says it is “biased, misleading and manipulating”, although “apparently complex”, saying it comes down to dividing the US deficit of each country, by total US imports and multiply by 100. deficit regarding imports and not the value of tariffs, ”he explains.
It gives China's example, noting that the American deficit rose to $ 295.4 billion for a total of Chinese imports of 438.9 billion. “Dividing these two values ​​and multiplying by 100, we have the 'famous' 67.3% as the value of the tariff that Trump said that China applies to American products that matters, which corresponds to nothing to reality, falsifying it in an irresponsible way,” he says.
 
Increased costs for consumers
Reflecting on the possible major consequences of the application of US reciprocal tariffs, Félix Pontes immediately highlights “increased costs for consumers, situations of quarrels in product supply chains and commercial conflicts, by applying at least the European Union and China - which has already decided on 34%reciprocal fare”.
There is also “high risks of abrupt drop in scholarships, greater currency volatility and global economic slowdown and evident damage in diplomatic relations between the US and the affected countries”, fearing that, in the midfielder, economic recession may arise.
Incidentally, he concludes, "In the latest issue of" The Economist "magazine, he considers the Liberation Day Tariffs (" Ruin of Ruin "), proclaimed by President Trump on 2 April 2025 and classifies the new American commercial tariff as" the greatest economic error of the modern era ".
Also about the measures taken by the Trump administration, Isaac Duarte attests that the issue of tariffs "is not purely economic, but political and, therefore, when we invoke reciprocity, we are already in the field of politics and not pure economy." It points out that this is "an instrument clearly used to change the rules of the game in international trade and the position that US administration understands to be of disadvantage and abuse of other countries compared to the US."
"I would say this is another political issue and, therefore, in an economic plan, I do not believe that there are many economists who do not recognize the advantages and interest of opening international trade, without denying that there are many countries that complain to be in favor of liberalization of commerce and, if we observe carefully their customs practices, history is also more complicated than it seems," he said.</description><pubDate>2025-04-07 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>EPM establishes class days on two Portuguese holidays</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/epm-institui-dias-de-aulas-em-dois-feriados-portugueses/</link><description>April 25th and December 1st, holidays only in Portugal, but celebrated so far without classes at the Portuguese School of Macao, will have mandatory activities for students. The decision was made by the educational establishment and comes into force next school year

Two of the holidays celebrated in Portugal, but not at Mishes, 25 de April and December 1, respectively commemorative the revolution of blackheads and the restoration of independence, will become classes at the Portuguese School of Macau (EPM). The decision was taken by the educational establishment and becomes mandatory in the next school year.
Filipe Figueiredo, president of the EPM Parents and Parents Association (APEP), told the Jornal Tribuna de Macao that classes in those two days will make life easier for families. "These days people work, since it is not a holiday in Macao, so the situation ends up benefiting families," he said.
On the other hand, adds to APEP, the obligation for students to go to school on April 25 and December 1, not necessarily to have normal classes, “will provide activities to celebrate those important dates and even promote Portuguese culture in another way, and students are more aware of what is being marked”.
This measure is part of a document sent by APEP to members, to which we had access, and which resulted from a meeting between APEP leaders and EPM director Acácio de Brito. Filipe Figueiredo, who was displeased by the fact that the email addressed to APEP members was sent to journalists, stressed that several points were discussed at this meeting.
In addition to those days that have been holidays in school and will cease to be in the school year 2025/2026, it was also made public to create a support office for the guardians of education in the registration of children in higher education in Portugal. The cabinet, oriented by teachers Nélia Melo and Teresa Sequeira, is already working and registration for national exams are taking place in the school's secretariat.
The two news, released by the TDM, constituted the most important points during the discussion of issues related to the normal functioning of the EPM.
The same document received by parents informs that "enrollment becomes automatically renewed to students who already attend school." It is also noted that the map of teachers and their renewal is being prepared, and that there are two or three teachers who should return to Portugal, on their own initiative.
"Teacher hiring rules are prepared to be approved by the Board of Directors," says the email sent by APEP to its members.
In other matters of interest, highlighting the information provided that “there will be no increase in classes in the next school year”
During the meeting between APEP and the EPM management, the issue of bullying, or inadequate behaviors, was also addressed within the educational establishment and outside it, being established to promote civic formation actions and alert parents to vandalism or theft. APEP also appealed to greater vigilance in the recess and the lack of space in them.
With regard to the use of mobile phones, APEP states that “there is no consensus”, considering there is a need for more rigorous control, as well as a greater conviviality in the recess. On this, the EPM continues to await indications of the Directorate of Youth Education and Development Services.
Finally, APEP aims to increase a collaboration with the school, through study visits, sports tests, library reading, workshops and competitions for parents, children and teachers.
 
Rising 36 positions in the exam ranking
In an assessment of the secondary school exams of Portuguese schools, including those abroad, in 2024, EPM qualified in 128th position. It is a 36-seat climb over the previous year. Comparing with all private schools in the country, this average is 0.89 values ​​below and, compared to public schools, is 0.96 values ​​above. Highlight for the grades in the math exams that were in the 14 values, which puts the EPM above an average of 10.7 of the other students in Portugal. Biology and geology, the average examination notes was 12.6 values, above 11.3 at national level. Physics and chemistry, students from Macau's school had 12.8 values, above 11.2 from colleagues from all over the country. In total, at EPM, there were two reviews with a grade between 19 and 20 values.</description><pubDate>2025-04-07 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Ipor wants to contribute to discussion about</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/ipor-quer-contribuir-para-discussao-sobre-ia/</link><description>IPOR aims to contribute to the debate on the use of artificial intelligence, with the director, Patrícia Ribeiro, to point out that “there is a lack of studies, there is a lack of analysis of all these tools and the impact they have on people's lives”.

It has already started the fifth festival Letras &amp; Companhia, which is addressing “The Impact” of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on education. "The use of artificial intelligence tools is being introduced very quickly," the director of the Portuguese Institute of the East (IPOR), Patrícia Ribeiro, to Lusa, stressing that "there is a lack of studies, there is a lack of analysis of all these tools and the impact they have on people's lives."
Patrícia Ribeiro stressed the alerts that have been made, namely by UNESCO about the need for the states to regulate the use of AI. “Looking for [doing it] in a playful and closer way, the festival will address this that is a very current theme for children, parents, educators, for the community in general,” he said.
An expert, Adelina Moura, researcher at the Higher Institute of Engineering of Porto and the University of Coimbra, will give teachers training and a lecture to parents and children on digital literacy, including “critical analysis of digital sources”. The lecture is scheduled for April 14 at 6:30 pm at IPOR.
However, the exhibition “The Robot and I” exhibition is already evident, which brings together works “in the area of ​​digital sculpture” by artist José Nyögéri with work by local students, including from the Portuguese school. “We also challenged children and young people to present works they have done with the use of tools of this kind,” explained Patrícia Ribeiro.
The Portuguese Company Disrupts will present on the 12th the show ‘Peripeças - The History of Portugal with artificial intelligence’, “a comic piece” that seeks “reflecting on the possibility of using AI to amplify our humanity rather than decreasing it”.
The program also includes the launch of the Portuguese-Chinese bilingual version, edited by IPOR, from Luísa Sobral's children's book “The Weight of Words”. The session takes place tomorrow at 6.30 pm at the Portuguese Bookstore. Written by Luísa Sobral and illustrated by a slightly left -handed man, the book "explores the effects that words can have, both on our lives and in the life of those around us."
The author will also “make a series of history dynamizations” in at least three schools in Macau, “to also reach another audience,” said Patrícia Ribeiro. Yesterday, Luísa Sobral gave a concert open to the public at the D. Pedro V. Theater.
The festival will also be the scene of the presentation of the book “Once upon a time… My Language”, which brings together the tales and illustrations of the second edition of the children's tender “Once upon a time… my language”, organized by Somos! - Communication Association in Portuguese Language, with the texts translated and adapted to the Chinese language.
The Chinese language version of the children's book “The Adventurous Trip of the Fatherland-from Portugal to Macao on plane (1924)” will also be launched, which marks the 100th anniversary of the first Portugal-Macau air trip, written by Filipa Brito Pais, bouther of Aviator António Brito Pais.
As it is already usual, for the last day of the festival is scheduled the delivery of mini-biblotecas to primary and secondary schools of MSAR that teach Portuguese, at 10h00 at the Consulate General of Portugal. A set of publications of authors who write in Portuguese will be offered and, whenever possible, the respective editions translated to Chinese, as well as other Portuguese language editions aimed at children and youth.
The “Letras &amp; Companhia”, with a budget of over 500,000 Patacas, is organized in partnership with the Portuguese Consulate-General in Macau and Hong Kong and the support of Galaxy Entertainment, also with the collaboration of Fundação Oriente, Camões-Ministry of Cooperation and Language, Portuguese Bookstore and the Portuguese School of Macao, Porto Editora, among others.
The activities are free input, and the participation in some programs should be done through registration.

Next to the Temple of Kun Iam and the Nossa Senhora da Piedade Cemetery, on Colonel Mesquita's Avenue, the Jornal Tribuna de Macau observed several people and families fell on the temple and the cemetery, carrying piglets, incense and branches of flowers.

Many, including children, were also at the Nossa Senhora da Piedade Cemetery and Sá Kong Municipal Cemetery of Taipa. Some people highlighted, according to the Chinese language press, the importance of children's participation in this ritual, so that tradition can be transmitted from generation to generation. On the last day of Cheng Ming, some local cemeteries still received many citizens.
At the same time, the territory recorded a large flow of visitors. Between Friday and 11 am yesterday, Macau welcomed more than 349,000 visitors, including 173,256 on the first day. In addition, according to data from the Public Security Police body, on the 5th, 148,705 visitors were reported, while until 11:00 yesterday, the number reached 27,671.
In Rua do Cunha, in the mud, there were queues waiting with some stores. However, according to traders, including some who operate grocery stores or memories, the increase in the flow of people has not stimulated the growth of turnover.
In Avenida do Infante D. Henrique, the crowds were also notorious, including on bus stops. On the same day, crowds of people near the ruins of São Paulo forced the police to take action to control the flow of people for two hours. On the second day of this prolonged weekend, despite the rain, the large flow of people remained, for example, in the central zone.
On the other hand, according to the Delta Bridge Customs, on the 4th, the bridge accounted for more than 23,500 vehicle tickets, a 32.8%homologous climb.

The number reflects a daily average of 109,000 visitors and an annual rise of 11% and equals 95% of the level reached in the same period of 2019. According to CPSP, 7% of visitors are international (690 thousand), while those from the interior of China represented 72.9% (7.3 million).

The Court of Second Instance rejected the jury's appeal of a Judicial Police competition, which refused to provide documents requested by one of the candidates and relating to his own evidence
 
The Collective Court of the Court of Second Instance (TSI) considered that the jury of the Judicial Police (PJ) was unable to prove that the documents requested by a candidate, regarding a competition vacancy, had a secret or confidential nature. The TSI thus upheld the decision of the Administrative Court (TA), which had given order to provide the requested information.
According to a note from the office of the president of the last court, the candidate was excluded from a competition for a technical place in the legal area of ​​PJ for obtaining a classification of less than 50 values ​​in a written test and requested the jury president a copy of the examination of the examination, the examination, the criteria of correction, translation and other correction support elements.
After his request was refused by the jury “based on confidentiality”, the candidate resorted to the TA, so that the jury would provide him with the copy of the documents and to “be suspended the respective deadlines for administrative challenge and contentious challenge”. The Court ordered the jury to provide the information requested from the candidate.
Disagreeing, the jury appealed to the TSI, and the court ruled that the candidate is entitled to access “the minutes and documents in which the jury's deliberations are based, including his proof” and the documents that serve as the basis of the jury's deliberation, according to the same statement.
The TSI also rejected the appellant's claim that the provision of the documents “impair the equality of the examination and the public faith of the government. For the collective court of the second instance,“ no legal provision is seen that impose that the oral examination has to repeat the questions asked in the written exam, and the jury may adopt appropriate methods to avoid situations of inequality ”.</description><pubDate>2025-04-07 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Hospital das Ilais already has weight management consultations</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/hospital-das-ilhas-ja-dispoe-de-consultas-de-gestao-de-peso/</link><description>The Integrated External Weight Management External Consultation is already in operation at Hospital das Ilhas.

The Macao Labor Market continued to give signs of dynamism last year, with unemployment and underemployment rates to decrease, and the population employed to rise. At the same time, there were also more people - especially young people - to change jobs, motivated by seeking better pay. As for this aspect, to note that there are more people to earn high wages.
The employment survey in 2024, prepared by the Directorate of Statistics and Census Services (DSEC) and analyzed by the Jornal Tribuna de Macao, reveals that 12,800 people changed their jobs, translating an increase of 8% in annual terms. The number is equivalent to 3.7% of the full -time population (plus 0.2 percentage points), whose numbers point to a total of 330,500 (plus 13,500 people).
The year 2024 thus marks the third consecutive growth of this phenomenon, since between 2018 and 2021, the number of people who exchanged work was decreasing from year to year, specifically 12,300 to 8,400 people. The situation was later reversed in 2022, a year much marked by the pandemic, when 10,300 people changed their jobs.
People aged 25 to 34 years were the ones that took the most step, representing 50.5% of the total (plus 7.4 percentage points in annual terms). Then follows the age group from 35 to 44, equivalent to 27.6% of this universe.
The main motive pointed out by 6,900 people to have done it was to “look for better remuneration conditions” (53.7% of the total and 5.2 percentage points). In general, this ambition was reached, since the median monthly income of people who changed jobs increased by 1,000 patacas or 7.1% in annual terms from 14,000 to 15,000 patacas.
However, it should be noted that differences between genres are observed. Men, whose median of monthly income was 15,000 patacas before the change of employment, went to earn another 1,300 patacas overall to 16,300 patacas. The women, who earned 12,300 monthly patacas, began to receive only 700 patacas after completing the exchange, raising a monthly median of 13,000 patacas.
The “end of temporary employment or termination of contract” and “extinction of the establishment or company/dismissal”, in turn, were pointed out as factors that contributed to the change of employment by 2,300 workers, equivalent to 18% (minus 6.7 percentage points). There were also 3,100 people who invoked “personal or family reasons” (plus 0.7 percentage points) to follow this path.
Still in the field of employment change, groups of people aged 45 to 54 years (11%), with 55 or older (5.5%) and from 16 to 24 years (5.4%).
The data also reveal that 6,700 people remained in the same branch of activity, while 6,100 completely changed work life. In addition, only about 1,100 had changed two or more work in the previous year, with most having done so only once.

In the analysis of the main causes of unemployment, the “personal or family reasons” prevailed again, presented by 2,400 individuals, ie 37.8% of the total. The “end of temporary employment or contract termination” was followed, which affected 1,100 people (17.8%) and the “extinction of establishment or company”, a factor that “weighed” 14% by leaving 900 in unemployment. DSEC also pointed out to 700 “dismissal” and 800 situations that pointed to “unsatisfactory working conditions”.

In absolute terms, DSEC has accounted for 7,000 unemployed (less 3,000) and 5,300 underemployed (1,200 minus).
Under the population employed, the average monthly income was 18,000 patacas, plus 500 in annual terms, and the residents also increased by 500 patacas to 20,500. In the case of full-time workers, a group consisting of 330,500 people, the median monthly income settled in 19,000 patacas, ie another 1,000.
Regarding remuneration, statistics show that the number of full -time workers who earned 40,000 patacas or more totaled 52,500, equivalent to an increase of 18.8% or more 8,300 people in absolute terms. This sectoral echelon thus became the one that most people housed, followed by the remuneration between 20,000 and 24,999 patacas, with 51,100 (+2.7% or 1,400 people).
The DSEC inquiry also highlights that the number of workers who earned a yield between 8,000 and 11,999 patacas decreased to 41,200 people, a break of 4.5% or less 1,900 people.

In terms of academic qualifications, it was observed that 46% of the population employed, equivalent to 173,100 people, had higher education (plus 1.1 percentage points), and that 58,900 had overall secondary education (15.7% of the total and less 0.8 percentage points).
The number of workers due to others increased by 13,300 people to 351,600, but those of employers (12,200) and workers on their own (12,000) descended 1,900 and 600 people, respectively. Weekly, almost half of the population employed (47.3%) worked between 45 and 49 hours, with 12.5% ​​worked a total of 50 or more hours.

She is responsible for trips, tickets, meals, however, "the main challenge," says the young Ukrainian, are the air strike alarms who shoot every day because of Russian bombing.

The “Susidy Sterpliat” (“The Neighbors will tolerate”), a Pop-Punk duo, have 12 performances in Ukraine in this Boreal Spring.
“If an air alert lasts more than an hour, we canceled and reactive,” explains Kukla, a 30 -year -old Ukrainian, with a hoarse voice. Power cuts are another problem.
Given this violence, in a country full of wounds, cultural resistance strikes the eyes and ears. The show continues.
But, “The Show Must Go On”, the show has to continue, as they say in slang.
Drummer Oleksander Pavlov, 28, and 27-year-old guitarist Artur Zubarev joined in 2017 in Mikolaiv, in the south of the country. Since then, they have produced “joyful” songs with lyrics that “do not necessarily make sense” but “strengthen” the listener, according to Oleksander.
Since 2022, according to several sector actors, unaccreated Ukraine culture goes through a "Renaissance".
The public has moved away from Russian and Russopon productions and has a real headquarters for national work, and therefore the gains of Ukrainian musicians on streaming platforms have increased.

One of his themes is about "a neo -Nazi," a "typical Ukrainian" who "drinks the blood of Russian babies," a right joke about Vladimir Putin's Kremlin, who claims to be fighting Hitler's heirs in Ukraine.
For Nazar, 19, music helps you forget “The Madness of the Environment”. "The situation is very stressful, many family members are fighting. This allows people to try to get away from all this and return to time before war," summarizes widespread feeling.
