Since 2004, 892 Macau service provider certificates have been issued under CEPA, mostly linked to the areas of health and logistical transport

The value of exports of goods from Macau that enjoy exemption from customs duties in the Mainland China market will record the second consecutive year of year-on-year growth in 2025, and could even reach a new absolute record. This projection, drawn up by the newspaper TRIBUNA DE MACAU, is based on the fact that exports covered by the Agreement on Strengthening Economic and Commercial Relations between Mainland China and Macau (CEPA) have increased in 12 of the last 14 months, in annual terms.
Between January and November this year, the total amount of exports with the CEPA “seal” amounted to 107.27 million patacas, marking an increase of 54.2% in relation to the 69.59 million recorded in the same period of 2024, according to provisional data from the Directorate of Economic and Technological Development Services (DSEDT). Overall for 2024, there was an annual increase of 12.8% to 79.82 million patacas, although with different developments in the two semesters, as the 34.9% increase in the second half of the year ended up offsetting the 13.4% drop between January and June.
In 2025, exports “protected” by CEPA reached the end of November with a monthly average of 9.75 million patacas, a value that exceeds the level of 2022, marked by an annual record of 115.33 million, at a monthly average of around 9.61 million. In other words, Macau will establish a new annual maximum if exports exceed 8.06 million in December, a value lower than that recorded in the same month of 2024 (10.23 million).
The results of the last six years were characterized by year-on-year fluctuations, with three drops (6.9% in 2019, 11.5% in 2020 and 38.5% in 2023) and three increases (32.6% in 2021, 10.2% in 2022 and 12.8% in 2024).
According to data from DSEDT analyzed by this newspaper, August was the month with the highest volume of exports in 2025, with 13.01 million patacas, despite reflecting a 5.8% drop in annual terms, followed by September, with 12.83 million (more than 166.8%), November, with 11.40 million (more 1,078%), and July, with 10.24 million (37.6% more). At the opposite pole come October, with 6.91 million, and January, with 6.95 million patacas, representing a drop of 7.1% and a growth of 64.3%, respectively.
In the remaining months, export values ​​totaled 9.96 million in March (plus 153.8%), 8.82 million in April (plus 59%), 7.41 million in May (plus 12%) and 8.38 million in June (plus 24%).
Since January 1, 2004, the date of implementation of trade in goods under CEPA, the accumulated amount of duty-free exports has exceeded 1.60 billion patacas.
Official statistics also indicate that, between the beginning of 2004 and June 2025, 892 Macau service provider certificates were issued, including eight in the first eight months of this year. The majority of certificates involve medical and dental services (340) and the transport sector (including freight forwarding, logistics, conservation and storage), with 309, which represented around 38% and 35% of the total, respectively.
The list also includes certificates for conventions and exhibitions (41), real estate (33), travel agencies and tour operators (28), banking and other financial services, excluding insurance companies (24), construction and engineering (16), hiring and placement of personnel (13), retail trade (nine), research and development in natural sciences (two) and “other” unspecified services (77).
On March 1st of this year, CEPA entered a new stage of expansion, with the removal of the requirement of at least three years of substantial commercial activity for Macao SAR service providers in most sectors. Furthermore, the implementation of pilot measures was announced to support MSAR-owned companies registered in the Greater Bay Area to choose Hong Kong or Macau as a place of arbitration, as well as the strengthening of liberalization in the “cutting-edge technology, financial, audiovisual and cultural services sectors”, with the aim of supporting Macau’s “1+4” economic diversification strategy.
Among other measures, the amendments to CEPA II also include the repeal of the requirement of five years of carrying out substantial commercial activity for Macau banks and the restriction on the total assets at the end of the year of foreign financial institutions for their shareholding in insurance companies. On the other hand, the limit on the proportion of local enterprises' share capital in providing Internet data center services in pilot areas has been abolished.</description><pubDate>2025-12-30 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Works on the Guia Chapel begin in 2026</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/obras-na-capela-da-guia-arrancam-em-2026/</link><description>Starting next year, the Guia Chapel will be subject to restoration work, namely the restoration of the murals, which illustrate motifs of religious and mythological inspiration. The Cultural Institute revealed to TRIBUNA DE MACAU newspaper that the Center for Preservation and Transmission of Cultural Heritage of the Palace Museum will set up a team of Chinese and foreign experts to outline the restoration plan

The Chapel of Nossa Senhora das Neves, next to the Guia Lighthouse, will be subject to restoration and recovery works starting next year, the Cultural Institute (IC) told TRIBUNA DE MACAU newspaper. “For this purpose, the IC hired professional institutions to carry out the study, inspection and analysis of the building and the murals”, can be read in the organization’s response.
The restoration work will be monitored by the Cultural Heritage Preservation and Transmission Center of the Macau Palace Museum, as the president of the IC, Leong Wai Man, had already announced in February this year, at the same time she announced that the bronze statues of the Ruins of São Paulo would be recovered.
Built around 1622, the also known as Capela da Guia was originally managed by Clarissa nuns. In 1998, during conservation work, mural paintings were discovered inside.
The frescoes illustrate both Western and Chinese themes, with motifs of religious and mythological inspiration “which are a perfect example of the multicultural dimension of Macau”, can be read on the World Heritage page. The Fortress of Nossa Senhora da Guia, the Chapel of Nossa Senhora das Neves and the Lighthouse are part of the Historic Center of Macau.
To this newspaper, the IC has now announced that the Center for Preservation and Transmission of Cultural Heritage at the Palace Museum will set up a team of “Chinese and foreign experts” to “develop a restoration plan based on the results of the report”.
“From 2026 onwards, the Center also plans to gradually carry out environmental improvement works in the Capela de N.ª Sr.ª das Neves building, as well as the reinforcement, recovery and safeguarding of the murals”, added the IC.
Featuring a simple facade, with a triangular pediment resting on pilasters painted yellow on a white background, the Guia Chapel has a sacristy on the left side and a small high choir above the entrance area.
In the Lines of Government Action for the next year under the supervision of Social Affairs and Culture, it had already been said that restoration projects such as the bronze statues and the facade of the Ruins of São Paulo, the frescoes of the Chapel of Nossa Senhoras das Neves in Fortaleza da Guia and the structural components of the Temple of A-Má will be prioritized.
The Center for the Preservation and Transmission of Cultural Heritage was created, it should be remembered, following a memorandum signed between the Macao SAR Government and the Ministry of Culture and Tourism, with the Palace Museum being responsible for providing professional advice and technical support for the restoration of the territory's cultural heritage.
Located on the ground floor of the Art Museum, it occupies approximately 900 square meters and is equipped with specialized laboratories, being prepared to carry out preservation and restoration work related to Macau's world heritage sites, immovable heritage assets and built heritage components. All of this through advanced technologies and the “strengthening of local talents in the area of ​​heritage conservation”, according to the IC on its website.</description><pubDate>2025-12-30 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Melco will hire a company to explore Mocha rooms</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/melco-vai-contratar-sociedade-para-explorar-salas-mocha/</link><description>Melco closed the Mocha room at the Royal hotel, but was authorized to continue operating three slot machine spaces from January 1st. The game concessionaire will maintain the employment relationship established with the workers
 
The closure of the Mocha Hotel Royal, a gaming machine room belonging to Melco Resorts (Macau) took place in accordance with the established procedures, yesterday morning, December 29th. The closure was coordinated by the Gaming Inspection and Coordination Directorate (DICJ) in close interdepartmental collaboration, thus ensuring compliance with legal terms and the orderliness of the respective process.
After the closure, the organization suspended the operation of the gaming machines, having ensured coordination, with various services, to monitor the process of removal from the respective premises, among other aspects.
According to the DICJ, during the closure of the slot room, the Directorate of Services for Labor Affairs sent staff to the site to provide clarifications to the workers in question, having provided them with information about an open line for further consultation. Furthermore, the Public Security Police Corps and the Judiciary Police preserved public order at the site and in its surroundings, “with the closure taking place in an “orderly manner”, adds the note.
On the other hand, taking into account that the three-year “transitional period” granted to “satellite casinos” ends at the end of this year, and after a comprehensive analysis and evaluation, the Government granted authorization to the request presented by Melco to operate the three existing Mocha rooms (Golden Dragon, Porto Interior and Hotel Sintra), by hiring a management company.
In this sense, Melco will continue to operate those spaces from January 1, 2026, maintaining the employment relationship established with the respective workers.
In the same statement, the DICJ reiterated that it will continue to ensure the coordination established with concessionaires operating games of chance and the competent services, “jointly promoting the healthy and orderly development of the gaming sector in Macau”.

However, the proportion of affiliated women rose in the main modalities and, in general, the number of casual practitioners also grew. For Alice Lei, a sports professor at the University of Macau, these trends can be enhanced, while teaching can be reconfigured in favor of greater physical literacy

PEDRO MILHEIRÃO
In the space of a decade, subsidies granted by the Sports Institute (ID) fell by more than 40%, official data indicates. In 2014, the ID allocated 155 million patacas from the public treasury, while in 2024 this support totaled 91 million. During this decade, the number of associated athletes decreased by 9.6%, to a total of 35,787. Furthermore, at the end of 2024, there were 948 sports clubs, 195 fewer than a decade earlier.
Except for athletics, all sports categories received less subsidies last year, compared to 2014. In 2024, “ball sports” received 25 million patacas, corresponding to a 36% reduction. Similarly, last year, the Government allocated 23 million to “martial arts” (-24%) and 13 million to “water sports” (-43%). For “other” sports, 24 million patacas were allocated in support, less than half of 2014 (58 million). On the other hand, “athletics” received almost 5.9 million in 2024, compared to the 5 million allocated in 2014.
Despite the drop in funding, “martial arts” registered a considerable increase in affiliated athletes, going from 7,949 to 11 thousand (+39.2%). In “athletics”, the number of associated practitioners almost doubled, to a total of 1,478 athletes (+91.5%). Conversely, “water sports” and “ball sports” lost 534 and 4,194 affiliated athletes, respectively, registering 3,525 and 8,722 at the end of last year.
For Alice Lei, professor at the Faculty of Education at the University of Macau, and specialized in pedagogy and sports psychology, the growth of martial arts is linked to the fact that “it resonates culturally, due to the deep roots of Chinese heritage in Macau”. Furthermore, “support policies such as subsidies for free community classes” also contributed, Lei explained to the TRIBUNA DE MACAU newspaper, and improved “accessibility in a densely populated urban environment”.
In turn, “athletics benefits from minimal entry barriers, not requiring special equipment and the presence of events that attract large crowds”. “Both modalities serve as effective responses to sedentary lifestyles in an economy dominated by gambling, contrasting with the resource-intensive need of water sports and the dependence of teams on ball sports”, noted the teacher.
 
Female athletes gain ground
Data from the Statistics and Census Services also reveal another trend. Between 2014 and 2024, the proportion of female athletes affiliated in “ball sports” and “athletics” rose by 12 percentage points, to 27% and 24%, respectively. In “martial arts” and “water sports”, this growth was more modest, with an increase of one and three percentage points, respectively, to 40% and 32%. Conversely, in “other” sports, the number of men increased.
Alice Lei recognizes that in general “the level of female athletes has improved, with particular progress in martial arts and athletics”. However, he admits that, “ball sports still remain largely behind due to a panorama traditionally dominated by men”.
The UM professor also highlighted that "women are more inclined to participate in sports that benefit from policies designed to promote inclusive curricula and aligned with traditional sports culture. Furthermore, post-pandemic events and media coverage played a crucial role in encouraging women's participation in sports, as many reports highlighted the benefits of physical activity for mental health."
However, “despite these advances, inequalities persist”. “Funding often prioritizes male ball sports and leadership positions remain disproportionately occupied by men”, lamented Alice Lei.
Last year, sports centers and halls had 7.8 million users, 52% more than in 2014. "As a sports psychologist, I see the recent boost in [physical] activity as a significant opportunity for public health. It aligns well with the guidelines of the World Health Organization and addresses the prevalent risks of a sedentary lifestyle in Macau, particularly those associated with prolonged periods of gaming", said Alice Lei.
"Overall, I see this phenomenon as a direct response to the growing well-being needs that followed the Covid-19 [pandemic], when many looked for ways to relieve stress and opportunities for social interaction through sports and group activities. To fully take advantage of this boost, it will be essential to incorporate mental health support on-site", argued the teacher.
For Lei, “this growth in physical activity could potentially reduce the incidence of cardiovascular problems while also fostering social connections that combat urban isolation”.
“However, the impact on the development of athletes is more complex”, he countered. "While this increase improves self-efficacy and encourages retention by providing better access and attracting casual exercisers to clubs, there is also a risk of overcrowding. This can lead to rushed training sessions that impede the development of deeper skills," he warned.
 
Curricula with “Physical Literacy”
School sports fields also registered a 135% increase in terms of participants, with 311 thousand in 2024. "I recognize progress in schools and universities. Yet, they often remain focused on performance-based models", contested Alice Lei.
“Physical Education classes tend to emphasize direct instructions, using exercises, competitions and quantifiable metrics such as speed”, he exemplified. “This instruction-based approach can neglect cognitive aspects, such as strategy, and affective components, such as fun, contributing to high dropout rates.”
Universities demonstrate some promising programs, such as mixed models of theory and practice, noted the professor. However, “a competitive environment persists”. To align physical education with “Physical Literacy”, one of Alice Lei’s areas of focus, sports teaching should be oriented towards “promoting autonomy”.
"Without a focus on building confidence and motivation, lifelong engagement in exercise is difficult. My observations indicate that low self-confidence can double the likelihood of quitting."
The UM professor suggested four key reforms. “Multidimensional curricula” would assess skills, knowledge and factors such as enjoyment and confidence, based on teaching games for learning. “Holistic assessments” would consist of self-assessments and peer assessments with consideration for the affective domain. The implementation of “workshops for educators” would serve to reduce competitive bias and, finally, “lifelong connections” between schools and local clubs would support the integration of former students.
At the same time, “starting with just one Physical Literacy module per semester, as I have experienced, can significantly boost engagement, transforming physical education from an inflexible experience into an empowering journey”, concluded Alice Lei.</description><pubDate>2025-12-30 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Young people demonstrate “highly active” cross-border involvement</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/jovens-demonstram-envolvimento-transfronteirico-altamente-activo/</link><description>More than 83% of young people in Macau are willing to look for a job in the Deep Cooperation Zone and more than 86% are interested in doing business in Hengqin. This is the result of a survey carried out among residents aged between 18 and 44, which recorded more than 1,000 valid responses. The research revealed that local young people present characteristics of high practical involvement, latent desire and dependence on conditions in relation to the Cooperation Zone

The evaluation of the effectiveness of the implementation of various policies in the Deep Cooperation Zone among the territory's young population was the basis of a random survey promoted by the Chinese Association for the Progress of Youth of Macau. Employment attracted special attention among respondents, with more than 83% of responses pointing to the “desire to look for work” in Hengqin.
The results of the electronic questionnaire, sponsored by the Macau Foundation and carried out between September and December this year to residents aged between 18 and 44, were released during a session that took place at that association's Youth Services Center.
The consultation, which recorded 1,052 valid responses, sought to accurately assess young people's genuine aspirations and their main concerns in relation to employment, entrepreneurship and daily life, systematically identifying “structural barriers and prominent challenges” faced during their integration into the Deep Cooperation Zone.
“This provides empirical evidence for future optimization of policies and improvement of services”, highlights the association responsible for the study.
The survey shows that young people in Macau present characteristics of “high practical involvement, high latent desire and high dependence on conditions” in relation to Hengqin: Almost half (46.58%) of respondents visit the Cooperation Zone at least once a week, demonstrating “highly active cross-border involvement”.
Under political incentives, more than eight in ten (83.08%) expressed a desire to look for a job in the area, 86.41% showed interest in entrepreneurship and more than half (52.47%) maintained an open attitude towards residing in the region.
However, according to the association, the implementation of these intentions faces systemic barriers: at an institutional level, lengthy administrative approval processes (55.13%) and difficulties in cross-border recognition of professional qualifications.
Furthermore, 66.73% point to a “significant negative impact” when faced with the fact that periods of residence in Hengqin for non-permanent residents of Macau do not count towards applications for permanent residence in the territory.
At an economic and social level, wage disparities (49.81%), the scarcity of high-quality educational and healthcare resources and the lack of living amenities in line with Macau customs (67.49%) also significantly reduce the desire to settle down in the long term.
Based on the research data, the association proposes four key recommendations, including “deepening institutional integration” by jointly formulating and publishing with Hengqin an Implementation Guide for Facilitating Cross-Border Professional Practices, clarifying conversion pathways and deadlines, and establishing a unified consultation platform to improve young people’s “perceptual behavioral control”.
From his perspective, it is also important to “strengthen political support and the development of the ecosystem for entrepreneurship” and respond mainly to the call from entrepreneurs to “simplify the procedures for applying for preferential policies” (65.57%), creating a single online application and consultation portal.
Thirdly, “optimize the socio-cultural environment for residential living”, proposing the planning and construction of a “Macao-Style Good Quality Living Demonstration Community”. This, he notes, would involve the “introduction of commercial and service offerings with Macao brands”, the promotion of “cross-border services by community associations” and the implementation of an “Integration Partner Program”.
Another appeal aims to “strengthen regional synergistic development, accelerate the entry of vehicles with a single Macau license plate into other regions of Guangdong through Hengqin and jointly establish industrial synergies and public service networks with other cities in the Greater Bay Area”.
In assessing the results of the survey, the association maintained that, simultaneously, an ultra-simplified business registration service must be implemented that promises “one-day completion and free start”.
Furthermore, he defended the importance of “systematically building a complete support ecosystem, from concept validation to mature expansion, including the provision of business training, the establishment of Government-led early-stage venture capital funds and the acquisition of professional services to assist in market development”.</description><pubDate>2025-12-30 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Policies to attract cadres promoted in Shenzhen</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/politicas-para-atrair-quadros-promovidas-em-shenzhen/</link><description>At the invitation of the Human Resources and Social Security Department of Guangdong Province, the Qualified Personnel Development Committee (CDQQ) participated, over the weekend, in a recruitment fair under the “Millions of Talents Gather in Guangdong” initiative, held at the Shenzhen Convention and Exhibition Center. The objective is to “promote Macau’s urban advantages and its qualified staff policies”, as well as “capture more high-quality qualified staff to develop in Macau”, highlighted the commission.
Specifically, CDQQ installed stands at the recruitment fair, presenting the current situation of Macau's social and economic development and the advantages and opportunities that the city has, among other aspects. In particular, the 3rd edition of the Qualified Staff Recruitment Programs, which began on December 2nd of this year, was announced, including application details for recruitment programs related to key industries.
Looking to the future, the committee promised to continue participating in thematic activities on qualified cadres at home and abroad, with a view to enhancing Macau's urban image and notoriety and deepening the knowledge of qualified cadres from all over the world about Macao SAR society and its cadre policies.
Furthermore, the CDQQ stated that it will “further deepen” the promotion and dissemination of Macau's cadre development policies, through interdepartmental cooperation mechanisms with Macao SAR representations abroad and with the services responsible for attracting investments, economics and science and technology, as well as strengthening cooperation with commercial associations and local associations.
Through the aforementioned work, the commission aims to “capture more outstanding international qualified professionals with the potential to develop here, thus creating conditions to transform Macau into a place for the aggregation of outstanding international qualified professionals”.</description><pubDate>2025-12-30 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Financial sector went to Guangzhou and Foshan to promote investment in PLP</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/sector-financeiro-foi-cantao-foshan-para-promover-investimento-nos-plp/</link><description>Visits to companies based in Guangzhou and Foshan and promotional sessions focusing on practical business operations in the markets of Portuguese-speaking countries (PLP) filled the program for the recent trip of a delegation of representatives from financial institutions from Macau to those cities in the Greater Bay Area. The actions coordinated by the Institute for the Promotion of Commerce and Investment (IPIM) aimed to promote business and investment opportunities for companies that wish to expand into the PLP markets.
On the first of two days, the promotion session “Harnessing Sino-Lusophone Cooperation Opportunities, Expanding Trade and Investment of the Blue Ocean Strategy” took place in Foshan, co-organized by IPIM and the Shunde District Import and Export Association. Financial institutions from Macau and Foshan addressed practical operations issues, such as commercial settlement in PLPs and the mitigation of exchange rate risks, “providing professional explanations and with the participation of more than 130 representatives of commercial associations in the region”, according to IPIM.
On the occasion, Sam Lei, member of the organization's Administrative Council, stressed that the Macao SAR is committed to strengthening its role as an “infallible link” between China and the PLP.
Representatives of the participating companies “reacted enthusiastically”, highlights IPIM, noting that one showed interest in taking advantage of the Macau platform to further explore the development potential in Brazil and Portugal. The objective is to use the financial services offered by Macau institutions, covering cross-border financing, settlement facilitation and risk management solutions adapted to PLPs.
Before and after the promotion session, the delegation visited four leading companies in the Guangzhou and Foshan sector with “express intentions” of development in the PLP markets, in key areas such as cutting-edge manufacturing, 'big health', traditional Chinese medicine, consumer-intensive trade and railway transport engineering, presenting in detail the services and support that Macau can offer to connect with the Sino-Portuguese-speaking market.

Around 1.2% of the wealth generated in the Macao SAR last year was transferred abroad, according to data on Gross National Income (GNI) released by the Statistics and Census Services Directorate (DSEC). This percentage had reached around 2.6% in 2023 and 0.4% in 2021. In 2022, the Macao SAR did not suffer an outflow of wealth, as it recorded a net inflow of almost 38.37 million in income from external factors, corresponding to 19.8% of GDP.
According to DSEC, the value of GNI (including natural and legal persons) amounted to 392.81 billion patacas in 2024, illustrating a real increase of 9.4%, compared to 2023. On the other hand, it was 4.75 billion patacas lower than the value of GDP at current prices (397.56 billion patacas), which is equivalent to 98.8% of the GDP and represents a net outflow of income from external factors.
Last year, GNI per capita was 572,614 patacas and GDP per capita was estimated at 579,533 patacas.
Total inflows of income from external factors (income obtained by residents who invested abroad) increased by 3.0% to 111.77 billion patacas in 2024, in annual terms. DSEC attributes the upward variation to the fact that income from the investment portfolio obtained abroad by resident companies and investors (35.55 billion patacas) grew 22.3% compared to 2023.
Income from reserve assets (10.29 billion), income from direct investment (1.48 billion) and employee remuneration (139.8 million) recorded annual increases of 14.1%, 75.6% and 122.1%, respectively.
In turn, total outflows of income from external factors (income obtained by non-residents in the Macao SAR) amounted to 116.52 billion patacas, falling 2.5% year-on-year. The decline was mainly due to the 8.4% decrease in income from other investments obtained in the Macao SAR by non-resident companies and investors (38.20 billion patacas).
DSEC also highlights that, with the intensification of exchanges between Macau and Hengqin, the income obtained by Macao SAR companies and investors in the Deep Cooperation Zone reached 761.4 million patacas in 2024, of which 621.6 million involved direct investment and 139.8 million from employee salaries. Income from direct investment obtained by companies and investors in the Cooperation Zone in the Macao SAR stood at 29.6 million patacas last year, with factor income obtained by Macau in Hengqin recording a net inflow of 731.7 million patacas, that is, 2.0% more in annual terms.
GNI refers to the total income obtained by residents (including natural and legal persons) in economic activities inside and outside the local economy. Its value corresponds to GDP added to the income of residents who invested abroad, and subtracting that obtained by non-residents in Macau (total outflows of income from external factors).

“All graduates were promoted, some rising to supervisory or similar positions, fully demonstrating Wynn's commitment to promoting the professional advancement of local talents”, highlighted the company, which also awarded certificates to 28 graduates from the previous class.
Adopting a “Hiring and Training” approach, the Wynn program encompasses between 12 and 36 months of specialized training in departments such as butlering, food and beverage, culinary, facilities management and front desk services.
"The Wynn Local Development Program has seen a significant increase in the number of interested participants compared to last year, which reflects the enthusiasm and aspiration of local talents for the hospitality and service industries. We will continue to work closely with DSAL and invest more training resources to further improve our talent development system", thus creating long-term career opportunities for residents and "supporting the sustainable growth of tourism in Macau", assured Stephanie So, Senior Vice President of Human Resources of Wynn Macau and Wynn Palace, mentioned in the statement.
The company has also launched other employment and training programs, such as offering culinary courses in partnership with professional and technical schools and offering internships at higher education institutions.
 
Double certification on sustainable fishing
Meanwhile, the Wynn Macau resort has completed an audit carried out by external agencies to obtain “Chain of Custody Standard” certifications from the “Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) and “Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC). Wynn thus became the first operator of integrated resorts in Macau with both certifications in all of its projects, after Wynn Palace was already approved in 2021.
“This achievement means that the wild and farmed seafood products offered by Wynn comply with internationally recognized standards for sustainable fishing and traceable supply chains,” the company highlighted. Certifications ensure that seafood is traceable at every stage – from procurement to table – and comes from sustainable fisheries or responsible aquaculture sources.
“This not only ensures that Wynn maintains globally recognized standards for the sustainable sourcing and handling of seafood, but also reflects our commitment to establishing a standard of operational excellence in the hospitality sector,” the note adds.</description><pubDate>2025-12-30 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Macao SAR wants to attract overseas Chinese businesspeople</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/raem-quer-atrair-empresarios-chineses-ultramarinos/</link><description>At the opening of a conference focused on the “One Belt, One Road” initiative, the Secretary for Economy and Finance, Tai Kin Ip, yesterday challenged overseas Chinese businesspeople to invest in Macau
 
In 2026, the year that marks the beginning of the 15th National Five-Year Plan, the Macao SAR will continue to take advantage of its advantages, improve the “political support system” and the “optimization of the business environment”, said the Secretary for Economy and Finance yesterday, when speaking at the opening of the 3rd Conference on Support of Overseas Chinese for High-Quality Development of the “One Belt, One Road” Initiative. According to Tai Kin Ip, the local government intends to provide “a more solid guarantee for businesspeople and leaders from Chinese communities abroad to invest and develop businesses in Macau, in order to support a deeper integration between the resources of Chinese communities abroad and Macau's industries, such as finance, technology and cultural tourism, among others”.
At the same time, he added, “we will continue to consolidate the economic-commercial cooperation platform oriented towards ASEAN and radiating to Portuguese and Spanish-speaking countries, taking advantage of the bridge function of Chinese communities abroad, to promote exchange and mutual learning between civilizations, telling the story of China well and transmitting the voices of Macau”, to help accelerate the “One Belt, One Road” plan.
The Secretary highlighted that this conference, which brings together around a thousand guests in the territory, including leaders and young people from Chinese communities abroad from 80 countries and regions, as well as representatives from various social sectors, constitutes “a vivid illustration of the successful exercise” of the “one country, two systems” principle in Macau, as well as “an important support to promote Macau's integration and service in the general panorama of national development”.
“Macau, as an important nodal point of ‘One Belt, One Road’, has a unique history of more than 400 years of cultural exchange between China and the West, it has always been dedicated to ‘meeting national needs, taking advantage of the strengths” of the territory, and “contributing to the construction of ‘One Belt, One Road’”, highlighted Tai Kin Ip, also highlighting the impact of this mega plan launched by Beijing. “Since the proposal of the ‘One Belt, One Road’ initiative, a strong impetus has been injected into improving the living conditions and economic development of countries and regions along its route, with the breadth, depth and level of cooperation in multiple areas continually increasing”, he maintained.
Tai Kin Ip also praised the role of Chinese businesspeople and community leaders around the world, describing them as “a valuable force in promoting global economic development” and supporting the “One Belt, One Road” initiative, and a “crucial link in connecting China and abroad, facilitating global trade and investment flows and cultural exchanges”.</description><pubDate>2025-12-30 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Macau roller hockey wins Zhaoqing tournament</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/hoquei-em-patins-de-macau-vence-torneio-de-zhaoqing/</link><description>One of the Macau roller hockey teams, in the under-19 category, that participated in the Zhaoqing International Tournament returned home with the main trophy. In the final, the territory's A team beat Kaoshiung, from Taiwan, 3-0. Formation B, made up of young people with an average age of around 15 years, was ranked fourth
 
VÍTOR REBELO
 
Macau won the International New Year's Tournament in the Chinese city of Zhaoqing, in roller hockey, after winning the title fight with the Kaoshiung-China Taipei team, 3-0. In the semi-finals, Macao SAR team A, coached by Nuno Antunes, overcame the “five” from Guangdong province with more difficulty, 3-2.
According to information from the Skating Association (APM), the Macau under-19s, reinforced by senior Augusto Ramos, “proved to be the best and best organized team in the tournament, adding yet another title to their already vast history of victories”.
In the first round of the competition, Macau, which included female elements such as Joana Freitas, Vanessa Santos, Mariana Aguiar and Jacinta Ng, drew 1-1 with Kaoshiung and beat Hong Kong B 7-0, finishing in second place in the group, which earned them qualification for the semi-finals.
The tournament was held over two days last weekend and, in addition to the under-19 team, the Macao SAR presented a B team, made up of very young field players, with an average age just over 15 years old, and also four girls, as the regulations allowed it, defining the teams as mixed.
The territory's “five” finished in fourth place, among six teams, after losing 3-0 in the semi-final to Kaoshiung, which played with senior elements, all male, and the challenge counting for third and fourth place, against Guangdong (also with male seniors), 2-1. Despite the defeat, “the team showed a very strong performance growth, which makes us sure that we have many good players, male and female, for the future”, can be read in the APM text.
Speaking to the newspaper TRIBUNA DE MACAU, the president of the association said that the competition played a very important role in providing competitiveness to a majority of players who have had few opportunities to play at this level. “Although it was a tournament that came at the end of the season, it was very good for young people to gain more experience”, said António Aguiar.
The director, who is also president of the Roller Hockey Committee for Asia-Oceania and a member of the sport's International Committee, highlighted that the Zhaoqing competition is already very old, but only from 2024 did it add roller hockey to the “inline” and “free style” modalities.
“It was at my insistence that hockey became part of the program”, he highlighted, adding that the idea is to have “even greater quality next year, to be even more serious, no longer having mixed teams and integrating male and female formations”.
In 2026, Macau roller hockey is expected to participate in the New Zealand Easter Tournament in April. “I would like to take the under-19s and the women's team, but there is no decision yet”, he mentioned.
Next year is also the World Cup, which will be held in October, in Paraguay. “It is also too early to know how many teams we will take to a competition in which we can participate in three categories”, concluded Aguiar.</description><pubDate>2025-12-30 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>China and the SAR discussed combating money laundering</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/china-rae-discutiram-combate-a-lavagem-de-dinheiro/</link><description>The Financial Information Office (GIF) of the Unitary Police Services (SPU) sent a delegation to the Macao SAR, between 18 and 19 December, to participate in the “6th Exchange Activity on Combating Money Laundering between the three regions (Mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau)”, with the purpose of promoting cross-border cooperation in this field.

Prostitution network detected in ZAP
The Judiciary Police uncovered a case of prostitution exploitation, having arrested three men from the interior of China, while a fourth member, who will be the leader of the group, is on the run. During the operation, the PJ discovered three prostitutes from Continente, two of whom were under 18. The six people involved, all from Jilin province, were intercepted at a ZAPE hotel. Police believe the network offered women plane tickets to come to Macau, sharing part of the profits from sexual services. One of the prostitutes told the PJ that she was attacked by members of the group due to disagreements in the division of the money raised, as she was supposed to receive 30 thousand patacas, but 19 thousand were distributed by members of the network.

The move triggered a series of other profound changes, including Ministry of Defense units displaced by the previous move.
However, President Lee Jae Myung's return to the Blue House, also known as Cheong Wa Dae, is more than a simple logistical change. This reignites the old, still unanswered question of whether the Blue House facilitates leadership or perpetuates isolation.
The change is already visibly underway. On the morning of December 22, the presidential office held its daily press conference with the press team at the Blue House (Cheong Wa Dae) complex for the first time since May 2022. At that time, Lee Kuan Yew's discredited predecessor, Yoon Hegde, led the office's move to Yongsan-gu in Seoul, 6 km south of the Blue House in Jongno-gu.
All presidential press conferences will be held in Chunchugwan from now on. The location is approximately 500 meters from the main hall, has a press room and seating for members of the presidential press team.
This is one of many changes in the relocation process that began on December 8, the day after Presidential Chief of Staff Kang Hoon-sik announced plans for President Lee and his secretaries to “return to where the President used to be and where the President should be.”
As announced, some Casa Azul employees had already left before the arrival of the presidential press. The entire process should be completed this week, but the Blue House has not yet confirmed when President Lee will begin working at the presidential complex.
According to the presidential office, the new President Lee's workspace will be both in the main hall of Cheong Wa Dae (Blue House) and in Yeomingwan. A Cheong Wa Dae official added that this will allow for closer communication between the president and his advisers – Kang, director of national security Wi Sung-lac and chief secretary for national policy Kim Yong-beom – as their offices will be in the same building.
The official residence in the Cheong Wa Dae complex, located east of the main hall, is still under renovation, and is expected to be moved from Hannam-dong in Yongsan-gu in the first half of 2026.
With great importance as the seat of the presidency in the modern history of South Korea since 1948, when the country's first President, Syngman Rhee, assumed power, the complex was renamed Cheong Wa Dae or Blue House, in 1960.
As it is difficult to access for ordinary citizens, there are those who argue that the location isolates the president from public life in a country that has experienced decades of dictatorship. This is how Yoon presented the plan to move the office to the former headquarters of the Ministry of National Defense and the official residence of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, both in Yongsan-gu, Seoul. However, he also faced criticism due to its high cost and lack of public consensus, given that the change took place just two months after he took office.
President Lee, who took office in June, two months after Yoon's dismissal due to his disastrous imposition of martial law, stated during the election campaign that he would return the presidency to the Blue House and the process is nearing full completion.
