At the meeting with Lam, Carlos Monjardino will address, among other topics, the need for greater support to the Portuguese Institute of the East by the territory executive. The leader of the East Foundation considers that the role of IPOR is "very important in the work that has been done in terms of teaching from Portuguese to Chinese." About the Portuguese School of Macao, it stresses that the government of Portugal has not shown as much “will” as it wanted to solve “pending problems” in the educational establishment

The work carried out by the Instituto Português do Oriente (IPOR) in Macau, with regard to teaching the Portuguese language, “will have to be more supported by the Government of the territory”, considers the president of the Board of Directors of Fundação Oriente.
In one more visit to MSA, before Ruma to Goa, where he will participate in the 30th anniversary of the East Foundation's installation in that former Lusa Colony, Carlos Monjardino insists on the need for greater help to IPOR, an issue that had already emphasized about a year ago when he moved to the territory.
As he did then, the president of Fundação Oriente will once again draw the Macao SAR Government's attention to this matter, through a meeting scheduled for tomorrow, with the Secretary for Social Affairs and Culture, O Lam.
“I will sensitize it to the need for greater help to the work that has been developed by IPOR in the teaching of the Portuguese language, and not Portuguese or other nationalities,” said Carlos Monjardino, by stressing that “IPOR It has a major role that deserved greater support from MSAR entities. ”
In an interview with the newspaper TRIBUNA DE MACAU, the director of Fundação Oriente also addressed the issue of the lack of teachers that the Portuguese School of Macau (EPM) has been experiencing in recent times.
Carlos Monjardino considers that “there must be goodwill from the Portuguese government to solve the problems that are pending”. So far, "this desire has not existed, or at least it has not been as good as it would be expected for a school that has a key role in teaching Portuguese outside Portugal," he lamented.
“The Portuguese School should be more cherished and problems resolved more quickly”, stressed the head of Fundação Oriente, an institution whose departure from the EPM management structure was made official in September 2015, at a time when it no longer contributed to the establishment's budget. of teaching. At the time, with the formalization of the new statutes, the permanent move to Macau of the headquarters of the Fundação da Escola Portuguesa was also established.
Regarding the old issue of the facilities at the Escola Portuguesa building, the president of Fundação Oriente regretted that this had not been resolved years ago. The location of the former Hotel Estoril was highlighted as a hypothesis for a possible change of facilities, among several possibilities explored over several years, including the sale of the land to Sociedade de Turismo e Diversões de Macau (STDM ).
“The building was right next to the casino [Grand Lisboa] and it didn’t make sense to have a school so close to the casino”, recalls Carlos Monjardino. Probably, “it would be useful for STDM and we would look for money to then install the EPM in another location”, he added.
Asked about the factors that prevented these plans from being implemented, the director of Fundação Oriente said he had no idea why. “That is beyond me, it was outside my reign, so to speak,” he said, confirming that, at the time, the Foundation allocated a sum, which was not reciprocated due to the fact that there was no change of facilities. “At the time, there was certainly a reaction on my part, but the budget wasn’t that large either, from what I remember”, he observed, without indicating a specific amount.
In April 2014, the then Minister of Education and Science of Portugal closed the EPM dossier, formally announcing that the institution would remain in the facilities where it currently operates. The decision took into account two aspects: the stability of the location and the students and teachers and the duration of the chosen location, as Nuno Crato explained at the time.
Regarding the allocation of the funds granted by the Macau Games Society, owned by Stanley Ho, to the Fundação Escola Portuguesa de Macau, of around 65 million patacas, for the change of EPM facilities – which did not take place – the minister then attested that “there is, in fact, a donation”, deposited in the Foundation’s accounts, so “there is a process of dialogue that the foundation will now have to start with SJM, because part of that donation was guaranteed for the operation of the school.”
In an interview he gave to JTM in April 2023, Carlos Monjardino said that there would have to be a solution to the issue of EPM's facilities, however, he noted: “Quite frankly, I also see no reason to greatly increase the facilities at the Portuguese School , because the demand is relatively small, it is that which is and will grow little. Because it is the children of expatriates who want to take courses in Lisbon…”. Faced with the reality of the growth in the number of Chinese mother tongue students entering the School, Monjardino insisted, even so, that the increase in demand for teaching at the Portuguese School or for teaching Portuguese here would be “little”. “If I’m wrong, that’s great,” he added.
 
Works at Casa Garden finished in May
Regarding works at Casa Garden, Carlos Monjardino - who also held the position of substitute governor of the Macao government between 1986 and 1987 - wants the conclusion to be a reality in April. "But, delegate Catarina Cottinelli told me that perhaps only in late May," he said.
This historic building, located in the Historic Center of Macau and classified as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is considered a significant landmark in the region's cultural heritage. Built at the end of the 18th century, Casa Garden has been a space for cultural and social exchange, as well as being the headquarters of Fundação Oriente, whose mission is to serve the local community and promote culture.
The works, which began in December, include the restoration of the exterior, the consolidation of the roof structure and facades, as well as the restoration of the architectural elements that make up the facade, such as the shutters and other decorative details.
The endeavor will be subsidized by the Cultural Institute, to whom the East Foundation thanked the “fundamental support” and the “contribution to the implementation of the Macao Historical Heritage Settlement Plan,” according to the body.
“This collaboration is vital to ensure that Casa Garden not only maintains its structural integrity, but also continues to be an active space for culture and dialogue”, highlighted Fundação Oriente. He also highlighted that the renovation is a reason for enthusiasm, and once the works are completed, Fundação Oriente hopes to restart cultural activities, “which are essential for the Macau community”.</description><pubDate>2025-01-24 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Road accidents rose 14% to more than 15,500 in 2024</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/acidentes-de-viacao-subiram-14-para-mais-de-15-500-em-2024/</link><description>Last year, more than 15,500 road accidents were counted on the roads of Macao, a 14% rise in annual terms.

In yet another meeting in the context of the elaboration of the Governing Action Lines (LAG), the Secretary for Economics and Finances met with the Federation of Macao Workers' Associations (Faom), which made a series of suggestions related to Good -Gest of the population. Firstly, he asked the government to "optimize measures that benefit the population, relieve their economic pressure and reinforce their feeling of happiness."
The employment of the most disadvantaged and the community economy were, therefore, topics that were on the table at the meeting between the parties. FAOM leaders understand that “several measures” must be taken to revitalize the community economy and keep up with the times. The continuous improvement of the legal regime for labor rights was another proposal, along with “optimizing job training plans and increasing high-quality employment for residents”.
In an official note, it is also said that FAOM asked Tai Kin Ip to “improve employment policies for young people and support professional career development”.

Thailand yesterday celebrated its first LGBTQ+ marriages with the entry into force of a law that authorizes same -sex union, a novelty in Southeast Asia. Hundreds of couples “knotted” in various places in Thailand, including in the capital, Bangcoque, where a mass marriage took place in an atmosphere of celebration supported by the government of Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra.
Thailand thus joins Nepal and Taiwan in the small list of countries or Asian territories leading LGBTI rights, while in nations such as India and Japan the legalization of same-sex marriages is locked in the political sector and in the courts. On the other hand, the gay community continues to face stigma and persecution in countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia or Brunei.
Two well -known Thai actors, Apiwat “Porsch” Apiwatsayree, 49, and Sappanyoo “Arm” Panatkool, 38, received the wedding certificate at a Bangkok Registry, while two women, Sumalee Sudsaynet, 64, and Thanaphon Chokhongsung, 59, they officialized the union in another neighborhood of the capital. "We are very happy, we have waited 10 years for this day," said Thanaphon, quoted by the agency AFP.
Meanwhile, dozens of LGBTQ+ couples dressed in traditional and contemporary wedding attire flocked to a large hall in a shopping center for a collective ceremony organized by 'Bangkok Pride' and city authorities. There, rows of staff at tables helped couples fill out marriage forms before receiving their certificates.
Ariya “Jin” Milintanapa, transgender, said she was “enthusiastic” with this day after two decades of waiting. “This day is important not only for us but for our children. Our family will finally be one, ”he said.
The egalitarian marriage law was passed in June and ratified in September by King Maha Vajiralongkorn. The legislation uses terms of neutral gender instead of “men”, “women”, “spouses” and “wives”, and grants adoption and inheritance rights to same -sex couples.
Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra stated last week that, regardless of the genre, "love has no limits or expectations." "Everyone will be protected by the same laws," he said.
Thailand has an international reputation for tolerance towards the LGBTQIA+ community and surveys published by local media reveal broad support for equal marriage. However, much of this majority-Buddhist kingdom maintains traditional and conservative values, and sexually diverse people say they face obstacles and discrimination in everyday life.

The exhibition “Boom And Bloom”, which releases creations by artists from the Great Bay and represents one of the highlights of the celebrations of the new Chinese year at Galaxy Macau, combines creativity with Chinese cultural traditions, “offering blessings of prosperity and joy for Festive epoch ”, according to a text to publicize the event.
On the day of the inauguration, the artists organized a workshop with local college students, sharing their creative concepts and inspirations.
Gary Mok turned Galaxyart's 6,500 square feet into a traditional Chinese garden, with characteristic architectural elements, vibrant plants and colorful flowers. The “Serene and Sinuous Landscape” serves as a backdrop for Sanchia Lau's “Wishing Doll” debut and Ray Chan's “Shake Money Tree”.
"Shake Money Tree", designed as a "Rocamboles toy," inspires young people to keep a positive mindset and embrace the hope and aspirations of life. It is a work that revolves around a pine tree that attracts the fortune, symbolizing the harmonious coexistence between wealth and nature and highlighting the importance of financial management.

The exhibition features three themed works specially ordered in Macao, along with five creations from the “Shake Money Tree” series, which comes to life with the interactive installation “Boom and Bloom”.
The three exclusive designs, known for their intricate craftsmanship and auspicious symbolism, are particularly noteworthy. “Joy and Glory” is inspired by jewelry and precious metals, showcasing large, shiny “pearls” and sparkling “gold ingots” that symbolize opulence and blessings for a prosperous year. Meanwhile, “A Propicious Omen” incorporates the concepts of love and prosperity, with the lotus – the symbol of Macau – giving a unique touch and representing fortune and harmony for the new year.
At the opening ceremony, Ray Chan shared the underlying vision to her collaboration, mixing pop art with popular tendencies among young people to reinterpret the traditional Blessings of the Chinese New Year. "This is not just a visual and artistic banquet, being also a journey through cultural heritage," said the artist, who is based on Macau.
Sanchia Lau introduces a new series of blessing-themed characters, explaining that “the combination of the money tree and the wishing doll represents love and wealth.” Gary Mok, in turn, said that the exhibition “offers both visual attraction and entertainment, benefiting both artists and art enthusiasts”.
The exhibition has free admission and will be patent until March 9 at Galaxyart, on the first floor of the Galaxy Promenade, and can be visited between 10:00 and 22:00.</description><pubDate>2025-01-24 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Pianist Tra Nguyen performs tonight at Clube Militar</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/pianista-tra-nguyen-actua-esta-noite-clube-militar/</link><description>Tra Nguyen, an artist born in Vietname and naturalized British, will give a solo piano concert tonight in Macau.

The image of General Vasco Rocha Vieira with the flag of Portugal next to his heart, on December 19, 1999, just hours after the transfer of Macau to the People's Republic of China, will forever remain in the memories of many. “I felt like I wasn’t the one there. There were many generations. I felt like it was a moment that represented centuries of history. Which represented the effort and life of generations and generations of Portuguese”, he described, in the book “All the Ports to which I Arrived”. In memory, there are also the nine years that Rocha Vieira was in charge of the Praia Grande Palace, in a decisive period for the territory. The last Governor of Macau died yesterday in Portugal, aged 85. He leaves behind his wife, Leonor Rocha Vieira, whom he married in Lisbon in 1976, and three children.
Born in Lagoa, Portugal, on August 16, 1939, Vasco Joaquim Rocha Vieira was the son of João da Silva Vieira and Maria Vieira Rocha. He spent most of his childhood across borders: at the age of one, he went to Mozambique, where he remained until he was 10. He then went to Portugal, having been a student at the Colégio Militar, in Lisbon.
He held many positions throughout his career, until in 1991 he was appointed governor of Macau by President Mário Soares, having been confirmed in office in 1996, after the election of the new president, Jorge Sampaio. Rocha Vieira took office as governor on April 23, 1991. Macau, a place to the East where he had already been in committee service in the 1970s, became home.
As governor, he was responsible for a vast program that was intended to reinforce Macau's own identity, the consolidation of his autonomy and the promotion of territory as a regional platform, with a specific role, at that time and for the future, in the relations of the China with the outside. Under his administration, Macao has watched, in recent years, to reinforce the local political system and the rule of law, namely through the consolidation of the judicial system, the reform of the education system, the formation of staff, the modernization and extension of the systems of health and assistance.
Three days before the transfer of Macau, in an interview with RTP, when asked about what it was like to be the last Governor, Rocha Vieira said he had the feeling that he played the role “at a historic moment”, but he described himself simply as being “the interpreter of the sovereign bodies here in the territory” and the “interpreter of the fulfillment of the obligations that Portugal assumed in the Joint Declaration”. “I take it naturally”, he said then.
He said he was convinced that Portugal administered the territory “in a unique way”. And this, he stressed, was seen in the way the Chinese said goodbye to the Portuguese: “They come to us, they hug us, they want to take photographs, they say they will miss us”. “I think Portugal has fulfilled this over the centuries (…) I think we have left here a good work, of which we can be proud”, he argued.
“There is no future if there is no history, if there is no memory. And this history is fundamentally linked to the presence of Portugal and the Portuguese here in Macau”, he continued, adding that there were “very many things” from Portugal in the territory. From the outset, a political system based on the separation of powers, laws, judicial instructions, and an administrative culture were enumerated.
Asked whether Deng Xiaoping's “one country, two systems” formula gave any security in terms of rights, freedoms and guarantees in the future of Macau under the sovereignty of the People's Republic of China, Rocha Vieira stated: “I think that when he signed and wrote what he wrote, and when he wrote the chapter on fundamental rights in the Basic Law, he did so in a sincere and responsible way. Then I think that the future authorities of the Macao SAR share the same values, the same principles that we share, the Portuguese Administration”.
As for his relationship with China while he served as Governor, he said it was “always good”. “I managed to have a very frank, cooperative, very open relationship with the Chinese. Naturally, we had many disagreements (…) But this understanding, in a context that has always been favorable, of friendship, which is traditional and historical between the Portuguese and the Chinese, helped a lot. And I think that disagreements never led to rupture situations.”
On Portugal's side, the relationship was also “always good,” he said at the time, but stressed: “Of course Macau and Portugal are physically separated, but they were always together by affection, solidarity and the sense of responsibility that the bodies of Sovereignty always had before Macau. ”
For the future, the last Governor asked for attention to the territory. “Portugal must continue to pay attention to Macau and I think the international community must pay attention to Macau, naturally without interfering with Chinese sovereignty, which must exercise it. But it must follow this process, because the Joint Declaration is an international treaty, signed by two countries”.
About the criticism that Portugal could have been “submissive” in relation to the Popular Republic of China, Rocha Vieira said, on days of transfer, that he no longer heard such accusations. “Today people realized that we took advantage of it - in the good sense of the term 'to enjoy' - the good relationships with China to the best of our interests. Because having good relationships, Franco speaking, friendly being, having a sense of future, being serious in purposes is not incompatible with firm, determined being. On the contrary. We took advantage of this climate so that we can be very determined and very firm, say what we thought and beat for the interests we think is the interests of Macao, ”he said in the same interview.
On the night of the transfer, after the official ceremony, the presidents of each country, Jorge Sampaio and Jiang Zemin, exchanged formal greetings, but they were not the only ones. Among the various greetings, special mention goes to Vasco Rocha Vieira, who was finishing his position, and Edmund Ho, his successor and first Chief Executive of the Macao SAR.
If it is true that the last governor was cherished by many, and his role in transfer negotiations was recognized “in the country and within the international community”, it is also certain that Rocha Vieira was the target of much criticism. Especially within the Case Jorge Álvares Foundation, which caused controversy, either in the first month of Chinese administration in the territory and in Portugal.
Formalized on December 18, 1999, the eve of the farewell of the Portuguese Administration of Macao, the Foundation had an initial allocation of 100 million patacas from the equal parts of the Macao Tourism Society and the Foundation for Cooperation and Development, based on the territory and fueled by local public funds. The chairman of the curators of this latter foundation was Rocha Vieira himself at the date on which the transfer of 50 million Patacas was decided to the newly created Jorge Álvares Foundation.
Over the years after the transfer, the General sporadically returned to Macau. The last time he was in the territory, at least as far as is publicly known, was in March 2023. He came to receive an honorary doctorate in Social Sciences, awarded by the Macau University of Science and Technology. “Returning to Macau is always very pleasant. All the people who were, lived and worked here have Macau in their hearts, as I do, so returning here under these circumstances is very pleasant”, he then told journalists, stating that he was still optimistic about the future of the territory.
Rocha Vieira was head of the Army Staff and, in care, a member of the Revolution Council between 1976 and 1978. In 2015, he was awarded the Grand Cross of the Tower and Sword Military Order by former President Cavaco Silva. Previously, he had been awarded the Grand Cross of the Order of Infante D. Henrique (1986), attributed by General Ramalho Eanes, with the Grand Cross of the Order of Christ (1996), conferred by Mario Soares, and with the great necklace of Order of Infante D. Henrique (2001), attributed by Jorge Sampaio, an exceptionally attributed award, as it is usually intended for heads of state.
 
“A huge loss”
"Deholate", thus reacted Anabela Ritchie to the death of the last governor. “I was very dismayed. I knew him seriously sick, but we are never prepared. I am not, ”he said in statements to the Jornal Tribuna de Macao. He deprived closely with Rocha Vieira, as president of the Legislative Assembly, and ensures that, besides the work relationship, they eventually created a friendship.
“I had an excellent working relationship with the Governor. A relationship of great solidarity, also very determined by the fact that we were aware that we were in the transition period. And we had a lot of work ahead of us”, he recalled. “It was possible for us to become friends”, he added.
Anabela Ritchie points out that she always felt that she “could speak at ease” with Rocha Vieira. “I can say I had a very good relationship. Sometimes we agreed, sometimes we disagreed. But there was room to explain our way of thinking, the meaning as we were seeing things. ” The goal was always to "find solutions."
Stressing that he liked to work the governor, Anabela Ritchie also praised the "important figure" that went to the transition: "I admired the determination with which he did things, competence and dedication."
He also recalled that Rocha Vieira “listened to others and allowed them to speak,” heard different opinions from the most varied people. "It was a facet that I admired a lot," he noted, also saying that he was a "calm, serene" man.
In turn, Jorge Rangel stated that it was “an enormous honor” to serve Portugal alongside Rocha Vieira, “in the Government of Macau, as part of its government team, and in civil society institutions, such as the Historical Society of the Independence of Portugal, military associations, foundations linked to Macau and the Macau Scientific and Cultural Center, in Lisbon, of which he was the founder”.
"I highlight its sense of state, attachment to fulfill the mission, intelligence, leadership and accomplishment, dignity, responsibility, dedication to the family and causes and love to Portugal," said the former secretary For the administration, education and youth of the Government of Macao, adding that it will always remember "with respect and admiration for the example of life that went to how many worked with it and somehow collaborated."
“It was a privilege to get to know him up close, to accompany him on multiple and diverse journeys serving Portugal and Macau, to live with him within civil society institutions and to deserve his trust and friendship”, he concluded.
José Luís de Sales Marques worked directly with Rocha Vieira for about eight and a half years during the transition period, as president of Leal Senate and also as a member of the governor advisory board. Subsequently, the economist continued to work with the general within the Portuguese school.
"It is a huge loss, in terms of the importance of the figure that was General Rocha Vieira, its importance in the history of Macau as the last governor, but not only for this, because it actually worked the transition from Macao," he said.
“At the same time that infrastructures were being built and the material conditions were being prepared for the transfer of administration to China, this was also done through his wisdom, his diplomacy and the vision he had of things”, he continued.
For Sales Marques, the former governor has always been careful to maintain Macao's stability and prosperity. "It is known its role in the transition process and its role even of moderator under certain circumstances of what has happened, and so it is an unavoidable figure," he told this newspaper.
 
“It dedicated Macau a lot”
Meanwhile, Jorge Neto Valente stared that he lost a friend and recalls the last governor of Macao as a "man who is in history, not at the footer, in the center of history." The lawyer considers that "Macau was due to him a lot." For Neto Valente, Rocha Vieira was very important in the transition period, "that he accompanied until the end, as we know, and left Macao with all his dignity."
After returning to Portugal, recalls the lawyer, “the General continued to be interested in things in Macau and contributing to the good of Macau”. Rocha Vieira returned to the territory a few times and on one of his last visits he received an Honoris Causa doctorate from the University of Macau.
The lawyer stresses that the former governor “did what he had to do and was a person who dedicated much of his life to Macau”, having been long before that in the territory, in the 1970s, as a troop engineer.
“I met him at that time,” says Jorge Neto Valente, to add that Rocha Vieira returned to be governor “by the hand of Mario Soares, after not running well the experience of civil governors from the point of view of Portugal, from the point Politically, and Mario Soares went to the Azores. ”
After remembering that Rocha Vieira was a member of the Board of Trustees of the Fundação Escola Portuguesa de Macau, an educational establishment founded during his mandate in 1998, agreed in the Liaison Office, Neto Valente points out that the former highest representative of Portugal in Macau left many things that are still valid today.
“He and the people he chose to accompany him in governance in recent years faced a very difficult period, with a lot of work and only people with a lot of desire and love for Macau and Portugal were able to do what he did”, he considered. After leaving Macau, he concludes his statement, “the General always remained linked to the territory”.
Also José Rocha Diniz, co-founder of JTM, lamented the death of Rocha Vieira. "I am sorry, but it was something that has not surprised me, because I followed the last months, when he was hospitalized, gravity," he said, adding: "I was with him at a dinner after the honor of Dr. António Aresta at the Cultural Center and Scientific of Macau, in Lisbon ”.
Recalling that the last governor “managed to mobilize the majority of Macau's population during the last years of the transition”, Rocha Diniz pointed out that he had a “great advantage”. “I knew the Territory very well, because I had already been deputy secretary, I knew the two diverse communities and also the way the Chinese understand power, so I had a great advantage over previous governors,” he said.
“April 25 and November 25,” Purchase Rocha Diniz, “Nowadays, when it comes to General Rocha Vieira Portugal almost everyone stresses the way he put the Portuguese flag to his chest” at the time of transfer . "In Portugal, all the complexity of the transition process is unknown, in which Macao was not called to negotiations, which were between Portugal and China, but Macau had, however, numerous fundamental questions to resolve," on loco "."
“Rocha Vieira was very creative and firm in the way he always maintained Macau's positions, sometimes even against Portuguese institutions”, he recalled, adding that “contrary to what some people might think, he was a man of dialogue, with a deep spirit mission of the interests of Portugal and the Portuguese who lived in Macau, but always recognizing that it was at a decisive moment in the solution of a 'problem inherited from history', in which Portugal had to do well”.
"The Portuguese administration left Macau, but the Portuguese remain here, continuing to contribute to their progress and development." Rocha Diniz concluded with a word of deep condolences, in this hour of pain, "to Dr. Leonor Rocha Vieira and her children."
In turn, António José de Freitas began by stating: “More than the last Governor of Macau, I lost a great friend”. Then, he remembered that three months ago he had spoken to Rocha Vieira on the phone.
The provider also recalled that Rocha Vieira came to Macau annually, being part of the curators of the Portuguese School Foundation, and in 2019 came at the invitation of Santa Casa, on the 450th anniversary of the institution. "At the time, he was proclaimed meritorious from Santa Casa," he said, reiterating that he lost "a great friend."
“For me, it was the best governor of Macau,” continued António José de Freitas, adding that they always had a lot of contact.
Antonio Félix Pontes, an economist and former administrator of the monetary authority, said that Rocha Vieira "was a good governor, loved and respected by the entire population of Macao, and that honored Portugal at a historical phase of this territory."
“I owe him the appointment as deputy to the Legislative Assembly of Macau, from 1991 to 1999, having never interfered in my political activities in that role”, he also recalled, regretting having lost “a great friend”.
 
“It fulfilled”, but it was not “to everyone’s liking”
Jorge Fão said he was also saddened by the news, which was given to him through JTM. On the mandate of the former governor, the president of the General Assembly of the Association of Retirees, Reformed and Pensioners of Macao points out that “complied with what he had to fulfill, but was not totally the liking of public administration workers”.
However, Jorge Fão says that General Rocha Vieira pleased the general population and also businesspeople. “I think he did well there.”
Regarding public service workers, “he wasn't that worried, but in the end we had a happy outcome, let's say, since the entire public administration achieved what it wanted, that is, what it was fighting for: for a pension, for a transfer of his functions to Portugal”.
Fão says he personally has no reason to complain. “I had many contacts with him due to the role he held outside the public service, but I was attached to the Public Service Workers' Association, having spoken a lot with him, although these conversations were not very satisfactory”, he acknowledges.
Despite everything, the caveat, the association “happily managed to achieve the intended results, also because we moved to Portugal and had several meetings with Mario Soares and Cavaco Silva and were in Beijing to talk about our yearnings, our concerns”.
Jorge Fão concludes by highlighting that the former Governor of Macau, as the highest representative of Portugal in the territory, “fulfilled the mission given to him, even if, I repeat, it was not to everyone's satisfaction”.
The Association of Public Service Workers, led by José Pereira Coutinho, also lamented the loss of Rocha Vieira and thanked him “for resolving, during the transition phase, many issues facing public service workers, Macanese and Portuguese who chose to continue providing services in the Macao SAR”. In a message, Coutinho also recalls that the use of the association's current headquarters was authorized by Rocha Vieira.

Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa also points out that Rocha Vieira was “very close to President António Ramalho Eanes”, having been “designated chancellor of the old military orders”. "The symbolism of the moment of transferring the Portuguese administration to the Chinese will remain in the memory of many Portuguese as an example of meaning, meaning of the public cause and marked patriotism," can be read. The President of the Republic, who claims to have followed “closely the last months” of Rocha Vieira's life, “presents to his family, and, much in particular, to his widow and children, the testimony of gratitude of Portugal, with very longing friendship". Also the Prime Minister recalled Rocha Vieira as "one of the most brilliant military personnel to give body to the patriotic meaning of being Portuguese", highlighting his "historical and striking and macau" connection. “General Vasco Rocha Vieira was one of the brightest military personnel to give body to the patriotic sense of being Portuguese, with special services in the consolidation of our democracy and in the historical and striking connection to Macao, where he was the last governor,” wrote Luís Montenegro, In a publication on the social network X.

Cavaco Silva expressed “deep sadness” over the death of Rocha Vieira, a “remarkable figure” in recent history, with whom he maintained “close bonds of friendship”.

The PS expressed regret at the death of Rocha Vieira, praising a life “entirely dedicated to the service of Portugal”.

The socialists also refer to the transfer ceremony, in which the way in which Rocha Vieira “personified and symbolized the dignity and tribute to the Portuguese presence in Macau for centuries” was undeniable. “And it marked the friendship and respect that the Portuguese maintain with Macau and the People's Republic of China, and which allows, after 25 years of transition, to preserve the uniqueness of Macau, which continues to be a meeting point between cultures”, he added. The PS thus gives “public note of its deep respect for services to the country” and “addresses its deepest condolences to his family and friends”.
 
He performed public functions “always with dignity”
The president of the Government of the Azores, José Manuel Bolieiro, lamented the death of Vasco Rocha Vieira, recalling that the lieutenant general “always performed his public duties with dignity”. “I pay tribute to a man who, throughout his career, always performed his public duties with dignity, a sense of duty and a deep commitment to the public interest”, he stated, quoted in a press release. He also adds that he “leaves a legacy of service to the country, which will be remembered with respect and gratitude”, expressing “deep regret at the death of the lieutenant general”, who “performed relevant functions in the service of Portugal”. Rocha Vieira, who was minister of the Republic for the Azores between 1986 and 1991, “stood out for the integrity and responsible way in which he held his position, contributing to the strengthening of relations between the Autonomous Region of the Azores and the State, always with respect for regional autonomy and the specificities of the Azores”. The Azorean executive also refers to his performance in the role of Governor of Macau.</description><pubDate>2025-01-23 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Chinese young people accelerate savings due to increased economic risks</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/lazer/jovens-chineses-aceleram-poupanca-por-aumento-dos-riscos-economicos/</link><description>The frugal tendency that began in China during the economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and has deepened in the midst of the real estate crisis is intensifying as generation Z rejects government appeals to spend and redoubles savings .
On Xiaohongshu, similar to China's Instagram, or RedNote as it is known in the West, many under-30s are exchanging notes about how to spend less on lunches and shop cheaply.
Influencers are also sharing tips on how to turn financial discipline into a lifestyle. Publications on how to save money total more than 1.5 million, with over 130 million views.
"I feel the economy is very bad and it seems that it is difficult for everyone to make money, so I think it's important to protect my own wallet," said Ava Su, who joined Alibaba after having licensed just more six months and earns a relatively comfortable salary.
Ms Su, 26, who sees the Internet industry as "unstable", said she cut expenses on impulse and has a long-term plan to save two million yuan - 100 times her monthly salary.
According to data from Yu’e Bao, a popular online money market fund on the Alipay payment app, users born after 2000 made an average of 20 deposits per month by the end of 2024, double the number in May.
May's number was 10% higher than the previous year. Yu'e Bao also said that the funds in each person's account this month were almost 3,000 yuan, 50% more than the same month of the previous year.
Some economists warn that rooted savings can empty the search, at a time when political decision makers are having domestic consumption to boost China's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Pessimism, which has already led to falling consumer prices, also impairs the long -term potential of the second largest economy in the world.
