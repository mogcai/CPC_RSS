There are just over 1,600 household aggregates in a waiting list to receive social housing, and the Housing Institute (IH) has houses available for the vast majority. The scenario of a year ago, when the waiting list exceeded 13 times the available social houses, now gives signs of inversion.
The latest data reveal that 1,166 social houses are available for a total of 1,675 family nuclei, which means that the ready -to -handed fractions cover about 70% of candidates on hold. Applications statistics report to the period from August 20, 2020 until yesterday, March 17, and the data related to the available fractions are referred to until March 14.
Most (890), they are aggregates composed of only one element, but T1 typology apartments are available only 88. Family nuclei with two members (567) are followed, and T2 are free 957; and the families of three people (203). There are also 12 aggregates made up of four people and three formed by five or more elements. As for T3 and T4, IH has 121 houses.
Regarding the age group, candidates stand out between 23 and 44 years old, totaling 679 (41%), and aged 45 to 64 years, totaling 677 (40%). In addition, there are still 312 with 65 years or over and seven aged 18 to 22 years.
There are still 275 repair fractions. Of these, 128 are T1, a total of 133 are of T2 typology and only 14 are T3 or T4. The works to which they are being subjected include “painting, replacement of doors and windows, repair of electricity and supply facilities and water drainage,” says IH. When these jobs are ready, the truth is that the waiting list as it exists will now be greatly reduced, with just over two hundred aggregates. However, it should be noted that the candidacy for social housing is a permanent mechanism, so new requests are always emerging.
But most social housing fractions, in a total of 4,088, are still under construction. They are all in zone A of the new landfills: 1,736 in lot A5; 1,064 in Zone A6; 728 in lot A10; and 560 in zone A11.
Most candidates on the waiting list (1,444 of the 1,675) have not yet been notified for the presentation of the documents for assessment before the home assignment, so only 231 have already received the notification to move forward with these procedures.
According to official data, IH number 8,510 applications with all documents delivered, of which 5,978 were admitted. Regarding the appreciation phase, 1,574 were rejected for breach of the requirements, 265 gave up, 91 are undergoing legal procedure and 602 are under consideration.
Regarding the admitted candidacies, much (4,303) has seen the treatment is completed, and the 3,467 candidates were assigned, 414 were excluded because they did not meet the requirements and 422 eventually gave up.
 
13 cases on suspicions of misuse of houses
According to IH, there are currently 17,548 social housing fractions in the territory. The January data this year point out that 14,817 tenants increased income not exceeding the maximum limit, while 653 received yield not exceeding double the fixed ceiling. On the other hand, only six tenants were calculated in accordance with Decree-Law 1/91/m, which defines the payment regime of houses attributed by the territory to public administration workers.
The tenants total 15,476, and 10,797 have a family aggregate composed of one to two people, followed by the family nuclei consisting of three to four elements (4,047). But there is also counting tenants whose families have five to six members (595) and seven or more people (37).
Statistics regarding the period between January 1 of last year and January 24 of this year indicate that 13 proceedings have been instructed because there are suspicions that beneficiaries are not using social housing as permanent residence or by allowing them to live in the contract. There was also a case of voluntary return of social housing in the scope of the administrative sanctioning procedure. On the other hand, there is no one to report any case related to violation of the building's regulation by the lessee.
On the other hand, about the administration of social housing, between January and March this year there was only one case suspected of not doing the work of administration in accordance with the contractual terms, having begun the application of sanctions.</description><pubDate>2025-03-18 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>UTM will reduce duration of tour guides courses</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/utm-vai-reduzir-duracao-dos-cursos-de-guias-turisticos/</link><description>The University of Tourism of Macao has been conducting a plan to optimize the courses for the formation of tour guides and, after the study, will reduce their total duration to about three quarters. The objective, according to the educational institution, is to improve the efficiency of global training

Tour guides training courses, provided by the University of Tourism of Macau (UTM), are being the subject of an optimization plan, involving dialogue with different stakeholders. The information is contained in a response from Tourism Services (STD) to an interpellation of Deputy Ron Lam, noting that, after study and planning, UTM will adjust the method of articulation of the courses, reducing the total duration of the program from about four to about three quarters.
The goal, he points out is "to improve the efficiency of global formation and, at the same time, to allow students to organize their learning according to their own pace."
The two courses, “Certificate in History and Tourism of Macao” and “Certificate of Tour Guide”, are independent and their conception covers several areas, including roles of tour guides, cultural knowledge, tourist care techniques and ability to respond to unforeseen situations, among others.
In response to the market search for less spoken language tour guides last year, UTM states that it tried to organize programs in language such as Korean, Thai, and Japanese. However, due to insufficient registration number, most courses could not be performed.
Macao had at the end of October last year with 1,821 tour guide card holders, including 809 proficient in Cantonese and 1,207 in Mandarin, according to Chan Chak Mo, president of the 2nd Permanent Commission of the Legislative Assembly, citing updated data provided by the government.
Excluding the Chinese, the panorama was not very positive, since only 156 guides were fluent in English, representing 8.6% of the total, 75 in Japanese (4.2% of the total) and 23 in other “minority” languages, not specified (1.3%).
In the future, adds the text now signed by STD director, Helena de Senna Fernandes, UTM will offer “more flexible linguistic training methods such as mixed online and face -to -face teaching modalities to support the learning of tourist guides”. Regarding language evaluation, in addition to annual tests in April, August and December, "an exam system will be implemented with the registration at any time."
With regard to guided tours activities, STD stresses that the Cultural Institute has promoted a variety of cultural and promotion actions, including guided tour services, for certain sites of heritage, as well as the launch of local activities “Cultural Guided Visits”, “Cultural Tour” and “Visits to World Heritage”, all in collaboration with tourist guides Macao tour guide card.</description><pubDate>2025-03-18 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Land in the mud can serve for the waiting space for buses</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/terreno-na-taipa-podera-servir-para-espaco-de-espera-dos-autocarros/</link><description>The government is studying the possibility of taking advantage of the state land to create provisional parking parks or to improve transport infrastructure.

The possibility of taking advantage of the state land for the creation of provisional parking parks, or to improve transport infrastructure, is being studied between the Directorate of Services for Traffic Affairs (DSAT) and the Directorate of Soil Services and Urban Construction (DSSCU).
For example, the hypothesis of feasibility of harnessing the land adjacent to the Almirante Marques Esparteiro road, in the mud, is in an equation to expand the waiting space for buses. This information is contained in the response of DSSCU to an interpellation of Deputy Nick Lei.
This batch in the mud, which is part of the land reserve, is 58,884 square meters, according to the information on the DSSCU Electronic page. It should be noted that since 2009 and by the end of last year, the government has already recovered a hundred land that were illegally occupied.
In the text signed by its director, Lai Weng Leong, DSSCU says that, in relation to the lots integrated in the land reserve whose definitive purpose has not yet been attributed, will proceed to its proper planning and use, in accordance with the Urban Planning Law and the Director Plan of the MSAR (2020-2040), and in articulation with the respective detail plan.
He adds that if the competent services or entities submit requests for provisional land use, the Government will make “a comprehensive appreciation and study, and if it is considered that there are reasons of public interest that justify it, a provisional purpose will be attributed to the part of the land”.
Regarding the land of the state not granted or recovered, the response of the DSSCU points out that it has proceeded to follow up the complaints presented by residents regarding environmental health.
"Regarding weed growth on some of the state land, DSSCU and the Institute for Municipal Affairs (AMI) have recently proceeded to paving with asphalt cluster to slow growth, and is currently evaluating the effectiveness of the measure," says the response to Nick Law interpellation.
According to the DSSCU note, AMI stressed that it has maintained a close communication with health services (SSM). "If there is a risk of public health after the evaluation of the SSM, AMI will cooperate, providing support in the removal of stagnant water and waste containers on the ground, in order to prevent vector proliferation and reduce the risk of disease propagation," the text points out.
The same indicates that AMI said that it has already removed the waste, weeds and objects from the empty terrain in front of No. 26 of Rua dos Navegantes, in Coloane, having completed the leveling of the ground and the placement of tiles.</description><pubDate>2025-03-18 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>There are also 15 cats for capturing at the Jockey Club facilities</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/ha-ainda-15-gatos-por-capturar-nas-instalacoes-jockey-club/</link><description>The animal protective society warns that there are still 15 cats that have not been captured on the land of the Jockey Club. All the rest, excluding the 22 that were adopted, will be sterilized this week and later sent to Macao animal protection organizations.

Zoe Tang told the Jornal Tribuna de Macao that "the news is encouraging, thus avoiding that felines can be transferred to Zhuhai"

The approximately one hundred goats that lived in the Jockey Club land are expected to remain in Macau in their entirety, although about dozen and a half of felines have not yet been captured in the actions developed by the Institute for Municipal Affairs (AMI).
The measures taken by animal protection organizations, with particular emphasis on the intervention of the Macau Animal Protective Society (Anima), had effect since the news, that there was such a high number of cats in the Jockey Club, was released to the public.
The deadline, until March 25, given by AMI to animal protective groups to welcome felines and thus avoid transfer to a Zhuhai shelter, should be sufficient to be all welcomed in shelters, or adopted. This is the hope maintained by the chairman of the animal executive committee, who believes it can be resolved the issue of the departure of Macao cats.
"With the 22 adoptions secured last Sunday and with the welcome of the remaining animals in shelters of various organizations, it is almost guaranteed that there will be no fortunate transfer to the continent," Zoe Tang told the Jornal Tribuna de Macao.
Making the point of the situation, the animal's person in charge that the six dozen cats who have not yet found a family to live will now have the opportunity to enjoy better conditions in shelters of animal protection organizations, which have already expressed the intention of maintaining them. They are the Cats and Dogs Guardian Angel Association, "Bobo's Shelter", Macao's abandoned animal protection association, "Catfee" and Anima.
Among the 61 remaining felines without adoption, three were referred to a veterinary clinic because they present positivity to panleukopnia, which is a disease caused by a parvovirus that can lead to the death of the animal. “These three cats will be treated at Jockey Club expense and, once recovered, we will find a place for them,” says Zoe Tang.
The remaining 58 will be the target of a test to the aforementioned virus, which will take place this week. "After the exam is over, the cats will be taken to the shelters of the organizations that have been available to welcome them," said number one from the animal direction.
However, the leader warns of the need to capture 15 cats that are still on the land of the Jockey Club. "AMI will continue the work of collecting the animals and will belong to the Jockey Club the responsibility of later sterilizing them, before being placed by us in shelters," says Zoe Tang, to whom "after that will be completed and then we can finally guarantee that all about 100 cats that were in Jockey Club remains in Macau and none will be transferred to Zhuhai."
The president of the anima thanks the people who were the day before yesterday in the adoption campaign and the nine volunteers who made themselves available to help throughout the day. "We also manifest our gratitude to animal protection organizations that readily accessed cats and whose efforts have had a significant impact on an attempt to solve the problem."
Zoe Tang also references a resident, named Mary Jean Hotung, who was made available to receive cats in the event that organizations are unable to find welcoming spaces at their facilities.</description><pubDate>2025-03-18 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Hospital das Islands widens specialized consultations to non -residents</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/hospital-das-ilhas-alarga-consultas-especializadas-nao-residentes/</link><description>Not resident people may, since yesterday, resort to external consultation services at Hospital das Ilhas. The Hospital Complex also assured that it will continue to optimize service procedures and gradually launch more external consultations specialized
 
Since 10 am yesterday, the external consultation services specialized to non -resident people, including non -resident workers, abroad students, bearers of the special permanence title, among others authorized to be permanently in Macao. According to a statement from the Islands Hospital, such adjustment aims to “benefit more services users and provide convenient medical services”.
To use hospital services, residents enjoy a 30%discount, while the charge is full for non -local patients. Like residents, non -local citizens can now also make online markings for external specialty consultation services, covering gastrointestinal surgery, gynecology, orthopedics and other specialized services.
According to the hospital, markings can be made, through the official website of the hospital, the online marking system or the digitization of the QR code, for external consultations of the following week. The markings will end as soon as all are filled.
In addition, the hospital adds that rates of rates and rates, such as consultation rates, nursing care, laboratory and imaging exams, can be known in the “service rates” section of the Official Portal of the Hospital Complex. Generally speaking, the Islands Hospital has assured, in the statement, that it will continue to optimize service procedures and gradually launch more external external consultations.

José Pereira Coutinho was worried yesterday with the works in old buildings, asking the government to interfere with issues related to renewal and reparation. The deputy argued that there are regulatory ambiguities that need to be resolved.
In a written interpretation, Coutinho said from the outset that the definition of “renewal works” is not fully aligned between the two existing legal frameworks and that “the regulatory authority is not clearly defined” between the Housing Institute (IH) and the Directorate of Public Works Services (DSOP). Citing the legal regime of the administration of the common parts of the condominium, Coutinho indicates that the “renewal works” require the consent of two thirds of the owners, while “repair works” only require 15%.
“In practice, IH has left the definition of these works for DSOP, and the scope of 'renewal works' is not clearly defined in the legal framework of DSOP. This regulatory ambiguity has left the minority owners without knowing how to proceed. Thus around the consent requirement of two -thirds of the owners, ”he said.
Coutinho adds that when owners ask for IH intervention, they are advised to resolve the dispute hiring a lawyer and resorting to the court, "which not only increases financial charges but also allows the management entity to abuse its" leonine position "in the absence of light regulations, further exacerbating the injustice of the situation."
It argues, therefore, that "it is the responsibility of the government clearly to define the criteria" that distinguish the different types of works, as well as "clarify the supervision authority of the services involved." "This is essential to prevent minority owners from being forced to bear high costs due to lack of clear guidance while preventing management authorities from acting arbitrarily in the classification of works," he added.
He says, citing the latest statistics, there are about 5,000 buildings over 30 in Macao, and about 14% of the total is over 40 years.
The deputy questioned the government about how to guarantee equity in the sharing of fees and transparency in the decision mechanism and considering that the consent of only 15% of owners is sufficient. In addition, he asked if he will review the definitions of “reparation” and “renewal”, standardizing the control standards between IH and DSOP. Also asks if the authorities intend to “quickly” start the process of alteration to the legal regime of the administration of the common parts of the condominium.

In addition, it argued that the public tender to manage these commercial spaces should be launched every quarter or semester
 
For more than 30 years, the same decree-law is implemented on the lease and attribution of commercial spaces in public housing buildings, warned Leong Sun Iok, warning that some details of the diploma "may be unable to adapt to the current needs for socioeconomic development."
In a written interpellation, the deputy asked the government if the current social environment, the market, among other factors, to introduce “innovative criteria” in the assessment of proposals for commercial establishments located in public housing buildings. According to specified, with the aim of “more effectively supporting the adhesion of companies with their own characteristics and social company, and downloading entrepreneurship requirements”, it would be helpful for evaluation criteria to include “operational strategy, experience and qualifications, and product diversity”, through the revision of decree-law.
As an example, he recalled that, to assign stalls at the Mitra Horta Municipal Market and the Patane Market Food Center, the government also considered the operational strategy, experience, qualification and diversity of products of candidates, failing to resort to the form of draw.
In addition, Leong Sun IOK has defended the creation of a mechanism that advocates the launch of a public tender for the management of these stores every quarter or semester, in order to avoid “resources for abandonment” and allow interested residents to prepare in advance entrepreneurship plans. At the same time, it expects to be “even more simplified” the application procedures.
The deputy also recalled that the last public tender of the genre was launched in late 2023. However, he asserted that society is “generally aware” of how to better enjoy stores in public housing. At this point, he added that, according to the most up -to -date data from the Housing Institute, until April 2024, there were still 12 stores in public housing waiting for tenants or users, and some have been unoccupied since March 2018. In this sense, he warned that the “lack of regularity” of public tenders “disadvantages the revitalization and effective use of resources”.
On the other hand, given that the first group of public houses in zone A of new landfills could be built later this year, which would mean the opening of a group of stores in this area, Leong Sun Iok suggested that, taking as reference the experience of Seac Pai Van public housing, the authorities implement a new public tender model. The idea is that the functions of these stores can be more flexible so that they can satisfy the search for residents at different stages of the evolution of the area.</description><pubDate>2025-03-18 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Women's Association wants “good use” of Portuguese to promote cooperation</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/associacao-das-mulheres-quer-bom-uso-portugues-para-promover-cooperacao/</link><description>At a syno-illly-ill-sidelic cultural exchange activity carried out at the official residence of the Portuguese consul, the president of the Women's Association appealed to women at the industrial and commercial sector to make “good use” of the advantages of Macao related to Portuguese and Portuguese culture, so as to “demonstrate the strength of women” in the promotion of economic and commercial cooperation and humanistic exchange between China and Lusophone countries

In addition to some inction of this issue overall, the inquiry reveals that the “level of savings sufficiency for reform” is lower, with only 3.92 points on a scale from zero to 10
 
An inquiry carried out by the Coordinating Office of Social Services Sheng Kung Hui Macau reveals some inaction from residents in the preparation of post-reform life. The interviewees registered an average of 5.45 points, on a scale from zero to 10, in the “Reform Preparation Index”. The score in this parameter was slightly lower than 5.53 points obtained from a group of residents from the interior of China.
According to the association, the results reflect that the respondents “had already thought, but have not yet put into practice” the organization of that period of life. Note that valid responses of 786 residents aged 45 years were collected.
Although residents on their way to retirement “be aware of the importance and responsibility of finances to that time in life, they have not taken enough practical actions to prepare retirement,” says the investigation. Specifically, from a scale from zero to 10, respondents obtained 7.62 points regarding the “degree of knowledge of financial planning” and 7.05 points regarding “consciousness for responsibilities in reform”.
However, as regards the “degree of completion of the retirement plan” and the “level of savings sufficiency for reform”, respondents were evaluated with only 4.28 and 3.92 points, respectively.
On the other hand, about 32% of listened residents do not exercise sufficient exercise, while 66% predicted that they would not be able to fulfill housework after reform. In addition, for about 31% of respondents, it is possible that their reform lives will be “even more boring” than now.
In the health scope, the study reveals that 70% of respondents consider that “medicine/insurance” will constitute one of the main sources of expenses after retirement. On the other hand, about 19% need to be accompanied at the mental health level.
Another conclusion of the study “Preparation of Macao residents for reform and happiness index in reform life 2024” is that 25.7% of respondents said they will consider Zhuhai as a place to live after reform, while 21.7% will consider other cities in the interior of China in this regard.
The association expects more companies, financial institutions and social groups to be encouraged by the government to provide consultations and advice on retirement planning, so that the most residents, especially young people who are working, can gain greater awareness to the importance of preparing for reform life.
 
30% have already felt a high degree of loneliness
On the other hand, the Coordinating Office of Social Services Sheng Kung Hui Macau also released the results of the “Balance Sheet Study and Perspectives for the 'Friendly City of the Elderly'”, performed annually since 2020, and for which 1,500 elderly people were heard. According to this inquiry, 30% of the elderly listened to “had already felt a high degree of loneliness”; Regarding the use rate of "smartphones" among local elderly, it increased from 50% to 91.2%, between 2020 and 2023.
According to the association, in general, respondents have "positive opinions" regarding the "degree of the city friendly of the elderly" in relation to Macau in the aspects of transport and travel, housing and space and outdoor buildings. In conclusion, the Coordinating Office of Social Services Sheng Kung Hui suggested that it is constantly reinforced the sensitization of the public for the concept of the “friendly city of the elderly”, and at the same time forming more professional cadres in services for the elderly.</description><pubDate>2025-03-17 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>“Universal Health Coverage” praised by WHO</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/cobertura-universal-de-saude-elogiada-pela-oms/</link><description>The work done by MSAR for “Universal Health Coverage” was praised by WHO, along with the issue of vaccination and promotion in the area of ​​health
 
The director of the region for the Pacific-West World Health Organization (WHO), Ma'u Piukala Skirt, and the Executive Director of the Planning and Management Department, Liu Yue, met the Secretary for Social Affairs and Culture, LAM, and the Director of Health Services (SSM), Alvis Lo, among other elements. In the Colloquium, and according to a statement, Saia Ma'u Piukala “praised the results obtained in the development of the health sector” of the territory.
In concrete, he considered that "Macau has been doing a good job of carrying out the goal of" Universal Health Coverage ", with a relatively high health protection level for residents." On the other hand, he also stressed that vaccination work "has obtained remarkable results." In this context, he stated that a “comprehensive vaccination program was established that includes several common diseases,“ which significantly reduced the incidence of communicable diseases, thus protecting the health of residents ”.
It is not known if MA'U Piukala came out addressed the issue of non -resident workers, who do not have the same health benefits as residents. At least in the SSM statement, nothing is said about it.
Regarding health promotion work, through various plans and programs, “it has been promoted comprehensively, together with all parties involved, a healthy lifestyle, raising the general health level of the population, which provides valuable experiences for regional health,” said the same WHO. Alongside this, the creation of the WHO traditional medical cooperation center in the MSAR “constitutes a broad platform for the development and exchange of traditional medicine, promoting international cooperation”.
The Secretary for Social Affairs and Culture, in turn, said that the Government of MSAR and WHO has been maintaining a relationship of narrow cooperation over the years. For example, Lam noted that, in articulation with the “General Planning of the Planning of“ Healthy China ”, Macau elaborated the“ Healthy Macao Action Plan ”, integrating health elements in all public policies.
This year, the “Healthy Community” program will be launched, together with the “Healthy Company”, “Healthy Building” and “Healthy School” programs, among others, to strengthen the government's interdepartal cooperation, develop synergies in collaboration with associations and institutions, and promote a healthy lifestyle.
Lam also recalled that Macau became in a region of the Pacific-West polio without polio, eliminating measles and rubella, controlling hepatitis B infection in children, "fully demonstrating the effectiveness of the government of masters in the elevation of the global level of public health."
In the Colloquium, the representatives of the SSM presented the Macao Health System and the situation of cooperation with WHO. Remembered, for example, that in 2024 Macau attended 16 online and face-to-face meetings of the WHO Pacific-West Region, covering topics such as universal health coverage, primary health care, smoking control, antibiotic resistance and vaccination. In turn, the Kiang Wu Hospital representative shared the results of the work in promoting the development of traditional Chinese medicine.
During the Colloquium, participants discussed with Ma'u Piukala skirt and their delegation on the reinforcement of cooperation, including the sharing of experiences and the exchange of opinions in the areas of traditional medicine, primary health care, public health, among others. “Everyone agreed to work together to further contribute to the improvement of public health level in the region,” he can read.
Present were also the director of the Department of General Affairs of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Popular Republic of China in the MSAR, Guo Xiaofeng, as well as the department of the General Division of the Department of Propaganda and Culture of the Central Government Conduct Cabinet on the Central Government, Liu Rui.</description><pubDate>2025-03-17 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>“Stable” economy but wrapped in uncertainties</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/economia-estavel-mas-envolta-em-incertezas/</link><description>Although Macao's economy remains “stable” in the first quarter, the economic association believes performance “could be slightly weaker than expected”. It also foresees that, between March and May, a series of uncertainties - external and internal - may affect Macau

Macao's global economic perspectives “remain stable,” however, the performance of several indicators “remains inconsistent,” the Macao Economic Association pointed out in the last report on trends in the territory. In concrete, it provides that, between March and May, the index of the perspectives of the local economy remains between 6.4 and 6.6 points.
The association believes that "economic performance in the first quarter may be slightly weaker than expected" and warns that "carefully analyzing future trends".
First of all, Macao's current external conjuncture "is quite complicated and severe, still facing many uncertainties"-in addition to the US-applied commercial tariffs, there is the softening of China's economic growth and the weakening of Renminbi, factors in which Macau, "as a small economy, can hardly remain isolated." In addition, the opening of casinos in neighboring regions “also brought some competition” to the MSAR, he notes.
According to preliminary estimates, gross game revenues in the first nine days of March were approximately 5.75 billion patacas, with a daily average of 639 million. Citing recent casinic revenue forecasts this month, which may be between 19 billion and 20 million patacas, the Association emphasizes that, to happen, the results of the game in the first quarter “will not be able to achieve the goal of budgetary revenues” announced by the government late last year, a monthly average of 20 billion.
On the other hand, "consumer habits and the standards of the continent's tourists have also changed, and their purchasing power decreased, especially the demand for luxury goods and top marks." In this sense, the association states that "the local retailer sector faces unprecedented challenges and many traders have lamented the difficulty in doing business." For this reason, "they may have to be prudent in their assessment of future economic perspectives."
In an analysis in the early months of the year, the Economic Association indicates that the trust of investors and consumers "remains low due to economic uncertainty." Although the number of visitors and the hotel occupancy rate are at a good level, "per capita purchase power has decreased." To illustrate the scenario, it recalls that retail annual sales last year fell 14.9% over the previous year.
Alongside this, "due to a number of complex internal and external factors, internal loan demand was weak," with the association that the ratio between loans and deposits from local banks continued to fall to 78.5% and the Malparado credit ratio increased to 5.68%, "reflecting the challenges faced by the bank sector."
It is recalled that debt loans not paid by small and medium-sized companies ciphed at 4.87 billion patacas at the end of 2024, noting an increase of 67% or 1.95 billion within one year. They thus completed a cycle of two years of consecutive climbs. As this newspaper has already reported, official data show that liquidation debts grew 29.4 times, or 4.70 billion patacas, compared to the end of 2019.
The latest official data indicate that MSAR Gross Domestic Product (GDP) increased by 8.8% in 2024, in annual and real terms, falling short of government projections and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Calculated at current prices, the value of GDP was 403.3 billion patacas last year, corresponding to 86.4% of the volume of 2019, ie, before the pandemic, according to the direction of statistics and census services.
In the last three months of last year, homologous growth has reached only 3.4%, reflecting the fifth consecutive quarterly deceleration.
In October, the IMF estimated that the economy of Macao could grow 7.3% by 2025, thus reviewing the previous projection, which pointed to an increase of 9.6%. On the other hand, the forecast on the rise in 2029 remained in 3.0%.</description><pubDate>2025-03-17 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Scientists analyze the “Seabed”, more unknown than the moon</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/lazer/cientistas-analisam-seabed-mais-desconhecido-lua/</link><description>The bottom of the sea covers three bedrooms on the planet, but it is less cartographed than the moon. However, a few years ago, an international initiative has been working to obtain a clear image of this unknown part of the world.
Understanding the depths of the oceans is crucial for the installation of submarine cables, calculating tsunamis trajectories, or projecting how sea level can rise with global warming.
When the Seabed 2030 initiative (Marine Bed 2030) was launched in 2017, only 6% of oceanic soil was properly cartographed. Since then, using historical data, sonars of industrial vessels and research and the growing power of computers, the project has managed to raise this percentage to 25%.
“As we gather more data, we get this beautiful marine bed photography, it is like leaving it in focus,” says Vicki Ferrini, responsible for the project in the center of the Indian and Atlantic oceans.
“The details and the patterns begin to see, we begin to understand the ocean processes in another way,” adds the researcher of the Lamont-Doherty Observatory of Columbia University.
Although there are some instruments that can reach the most superficial parts of the sea bed, most of the ocean are only available acoustic methods: the sonar that emits directed waves and recovers depth data.
Earlier, most ships used single beam sonars, which sent a single sound impulse and thus could only offer data from one place at a time. Now, the multipheix sonars are common, explains Martin Jakobsson, a dean of terrestrial and environmental science at the University of Stockholm and co-director of the North Referee and Pacific Center of Seabed 2030 initiative.
"Now we get a track, almost like a direct 3D vision, and that's exactly what we want to cartograph the ocean."
To filter, correct and integrate the data, the Seabed 2030 initiative comes into action.
The project has established relatively broad resolution objectives for cartography, with 400 square meters cells for most oceans, but it is still a complicated process.
“It's a cost issue” because “people don't know why it's necessary,” explains Jakobsson. "And now it's more geopolitical than ever," especially in the disputed arctic ocean, he points out.
The project has benefited from some technological advances, such as the Multifeixe sonars themselves and the largest computing power of the machines.
Automatic software learning also helps with data processing and pattern recognition, and can even help improve images and try to fill in some voids.
“As we started gathering each fragment and complete the image (…), we begin to see these amazing channels in the sea bed that seem exactly with what we see on Earth,” explains Ferrini. It's “just beautiful,” he adds.
Part of the project, funded by the Japanese non -profit organization Nippon Foundation, has been finding the main voids in ocean soil knowledge, usually in open sea and distant areas of the most common commercial routes.
The work coincides with the debate in the international community about whether or not to open the sea bed for the exploitation of minerals used in the energy transition.
“We need to have data to make informed decisions, and we don't have them yet,” says Ferrini.
