The “integration of communities was always the purpose of the birth of Tribuna”, highlighted José Rocha Diniz, co-founder, former administrator and former director of the TRIBUNA DE MACAU newspaper, considering that the distance between Macau and Portugal made it “important to have a Portuguese presence here”.
Today, with the internet, “everything is simpler and we now have the possibility of doing that, as well as broadening our horizons”, observed José Rocha Diniz, at the session commemorating the 43rd anniversary of the TRIBUNA DE MACAU newspaper, which brought together around fifty people at the Military Club of Macau, including the Consul-General of Portugal for Macau and Hong Kong, Alexandre Leitão, the director of the Department of Information and Public Diplomacy of the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China in the Macao SAR, Gao Yuan, the deputy director of the Social Communication Office, Louie Wong Lok I, and directors of several Macanese institutions, among other personalities.
“One of the chromosomes of our DNA has always been to reveal new talents”, he also highlighted, praising the contribution of “a group of faithful collaborators of the Tribuna” who “enriched our pages over the decades”, helping to make a difference, “from the late Neco Barros, who disseminated the customs and way of being of the Macanese community” to the researcher António Aresta, “who was a permanent presence in the pages of the Tribuna, since he taught here”, without forgetting Agnes Lam, Daniel Carlier, João Figueira, Nelson Kot, Mickey Hung and Júlia Serra, among many others.
Other aspects of the DNA, he emphasized, are based on the fact that Tribuna “never brandished the party-political sentiment that was the beginning and quick end of previous Portuguese-language newspapers” and on efforts to promote the Portuguese language in Asia, naturally with a focus on China.
In turn, the current director of the newspaper TRIBUNA DE MACAU, Sérgio Terra, highlighted that “it was not a mere coincidence, nor an innocent fact, that we associated this presentation of books with our anniversary, as it is an initiative that ultimately falls within the strategic lines of the newspaper, which has always sought to privilege and give special importance to the defense and dissemination of the Portuguese language, the role of Portuguese-speaking communities in the territory and the general development of Macau, where naturally inserts the cultural sphere”.
Sérgio Terra left a guarantee: “We are determined, as always, to do what we have been doing for more than four decades, which is journalism that excels in rigor, seriousness and impartiality”.
From the perspective of the JTM director, the current challenges for the traditional press “are upstream, they are global”, and have to do with the “dangerous advance of misinformation, often associated with the lack of regulation of social platforms where ‘fake news’ prevails and where it seems like a journalist is born under every rock”. “All of this makes cybernauts, the people who live most on social media, function almost like a bubble and become isolated from reality”, he warned.
To mark 43 years of uninterrupted publication, the TRIBUNA DE MACAU newspaper promoted the presentation of three books, including “Palavras Precárias – 100 Chronicles para Jornal e Violoncelo”, published in digital version, therefore available in electronic format. The author, João Figueira, discusses his time in Macau, as a journalist at JTM and TDM, recounting various episodes of political life and beyond, during the period in which he was linked to these media outlets.
In the preface to the e-book, which brings together chronicles published in this newspaper, José Rocha Diniz emphasizes that “no matter how much it costs some, the contemporary history of Portuguese journalism in Macau will forever be linked to the founding of the TRIBUNA DE MACAU”.
 
“One territory, two jurisdictions”
A new book by Professor Manuel Basílio was also launched, which summarizes some topics already published by the researcher, to which others that have not yet been covered were added, relating to more significant events that marked the presence of the Portuguese in Macau.
Although its starting point is the period of settlement of the Portuguese and ends with the transfer of administration, the work entitled, “One Territory, Two Jurisdictions: Intramuros and Extramuros”, does not aim to fill this gap, nor to prepare a summary of the history of Macau, given that “it is so comprehensive and complex that it is not easy to condense almost five centuries into a brief book”, as can be read in the introduction.
Also included are some personal and collective memories that Manuel Basílio considered pertinent to be remembered and passed on to future generations, as well as themes related to Macau's toponymy.
As the title suggests, one of the most highlighted aspects is the issue of territorial limits, both land and sea, which remained undefined throughout the period of Portuguese administration in Macau, with their resolution successively postponed until “future negotiations”.
“This book addresses some themes that I have been investigating for a long time, namely, the period of Portuguese settlement in a location they named Porto do Nome de Deus in China, and subsequently the way in which the Portuguese managed to face and overcome so many vicissitudes and adversities to remain in this small territory over the centuries”, said Manuel Basílio in the session.
 
History of a Portuguese man in South Korea
The other book released during the event, “Korean Gems”, written by Manuel Maia Gonçalves, follows the lives of a Portuguese man and a Korean woman in South Korea, as they grow old together.
"In Amethyst Turtle, they are young and at the beginning of love. In Emerald Dinosaur, in middle age, they raise a daughter with a knack for adventure. In Ruby Haetae, they are old and their adult daughter struggles to find purpose in a world where the blind profiteering of conglomerates and the complacent indifference of the common person have ushered in an era of antibiotic-resistant bacteria," notes the synopsis.
The author, 30 years old, a literature professor in South Korea, who suspended his activity to write the book, purposely traveled to Macau to be present at the ceremony.
And he explained why he wrote under the pseudonym Mint Water Bear. "Mint, mint green, alludes to color, since my prose is highly descriptive. Peppermint, a tonic of life, is the desire to live."
About Water Bear, he recalled that it is a microscopic animal that has “extreme adaptability, it lives in parks, in the oceans, in volcanoes, in the Arctic, but without being seen, which makes it such an interesting creature”. Basically, he stressed, “it redefines what is possible”, adding that he himself also aspires to be like the water bear, “in this resilience”.
The writer's grandfather, Maia Gonçalves, was in the territory between 1974 and 1979, at the time as lieutenant colonel (later promoted to colonel), performing the duties of Military Commander of Macau. “There was always a different emotional charge when he talked about Macau, and that in a way motivated my fantasy of Asia and also normalized in my child's mind being at home on another continent, which had a great influence on my going to Korea”, he expressed.
On the one hand, Manuel Maia Gonçalves wanted to follow in his grandfather's footsteps, but, on the other, to chart his own path.
The author thanked the Association of Retirees, Retirees and Pensioners of Macau for helping to translate it into Chinese, to be distributed to the Chinese community.</description><pubDate>2025-11-04 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Checks, employment and transport worry the population</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/cheques-emprego-transportes-inquietam-populacao/</link><description>The allocation of cash checks, the employment situation and transport are what most concerns the population of Macau. In the field of social well-being, and in accordance with the opinions collected for the preparation of the LAG, it was requested that the financial contribution be maintained, as well as the increase in the pension for the elderly and disability. In the field of employment, the population wants the TNR number to be adjusted

“Welfare and services to the population”, “employment and labor rights” and “transport” are the three areas that most concern the population of Macau, having obtained 28.10%, 15.10% and 8.10% of the 7,942 opinions submitted to the Government as part of the preparation of the Governing Action Lines (LAG) for the financial year 2026. The collection of opinions lasted one month and, according to the Social Communication Office (GCS), responses were received from “various sectors and areas of society and the population from different social strata”. The Executive is now “analyzing” the suggestions, and “those that are viable and constructive will be integrated” into the LAG, says the same note.
In relation to the specific topics that most interest the population, they are “cash contribution” (7.10%), “employment” (6.94%) and “transport issues other than public transport (5.46%). The main demands in the field of population well-being were support for the maintenance of cash contribution and improvement of the allocation application process, as well as an increase in the amount of the pension for the elderly and disability pension, among other security benefits. social.
In the field of employment, “the adjustment of the number of non-local workers, the guarantee of employment for local residents and the increase in the minimum wage” were requested. Regarding transport, the population asked for the promotion of electric vehicles, an increase in the number of park units and the reinforcement of traffic supervision.
“Public administration” and “culture, education and sport” came in fourth and fifth place, with 6.69% and 6.41%, respectively. Many opinions focused on the reform of public administration and the adequate diversification of the economy, including increasing the efficiency of public administration, as well as improving the organization and organic structure of public services and entities. It was also suggested to promote the development of emerging industries and the implementation of industrial development plans, among other topics.
According to the GCS, 96.6% of opinions were presented through the Single Account and the website created for this purpose. The rest arrived by recorded telephone messages, email and postal mail.
For the Executive, this collection of opinions “represents an interaction between the Government and the population, an important practice when working together to increase the efficiency of governance”. The Government promises, according to the statement, “to effectively respond to the demands of the population and promote the continuous and healthy development of the Macao SAR in all aspects”.
It is not yet known when the Chief Executive, Sam Hou Fai, will present the LAG for next year. Usually, the presentation begins in mid-November, first with the Chief and then with the Secretaries of the five guardianships.</description><pubDate>2025-11-04 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Torch of the National Games “moved” the city</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/tocha-dos-jogos-nacionais-mexeu-cidade/</link><description>Thousands of people witnessed the passing of the National Games torch through various arteries of the city.

The transportation of the National Games torch gave a different atmosphere to the city on Saturday morning, with thousands of people witnessing the flame passing through some arteries in the city center. The route, approximately 2.6 kilometers long, began at the Government headquarters, after the Chief Executive inaugurated the ceremony by receiving the flame from the hands of the protection guards.
Sam Hou Fai handed over the torch to the first of 50 relays, Li Yi, wushu athlete, gold medalist at the Hangzhou Asian Games in 2023, in a ceremony also attended by the director of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the MSAR, Zheng Xincong, the commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the MSAR, Liu Xianfa and the deputy commander of the Macau Garrison of the People's Liberation Army Chinese, Dai Jinsong.
According to the Games Preparatory Office, the route was made up of several historical and cultural landmarks representative of the territory, “which vividly show the unique charm of Macau as a meeting point of Eastern and Western cultures”.
In a group of relays that included the participation of the provider of the Santa Casa da Misericórdia de Macau, António José de Freitas, the last one was Kuok Kin Hang, a karateka who won two second places in the Asian Games two years ago and the first historic medal for Macau in editions of the National Games, in 2021. The athlete lit the pyre in the Ruins of St. Paul, and then the torch protection guard escorted him back to the lantern in the closing ceremony, preparing for the flame union event, which took place in Guangzhou at the Guangdong Olympic Sports Center.
At the time, the flames of the four cities, which, like Macau, will organize the competition, joined together into a single flame, which will be used to transport the torch and ignite the main cauldron inside the venue during the opening ceremony of the 15th edition of the National Games.
In the speech that concluded the initiative in Macau, the Chief Executive highlighted the success of the ceremony. “Under the brightness of the flame of the National Games, we witness, together, the successful transportation of the torch”, highlighted Sam Hou Fai, further indicating that “the sacred flame symbolizes light and hope”, and when transported “it transmits the spirit, and most importantly, it is the union of forces”.
The Chief Executive, who was wearing a blue and white tracksuit commemorating the competition, also said that “as the flame takes its place, a new match begins”, ensuring that Macao SAR will fulfill its philosophy of holding the event “simple, safe and wonderful”, so that “the unique charisma of ‘dynamic Macau’ shines on a wider stage”.
Após a conclusão do transporte da tocha, a chama foi escoltada na lanterna de segurança seguindo para Cantão no mesmo dia, onde se realiza a cerimónia simbólica de fusão das chamas.</description><pubDate>2025-11-04 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Good turnout confirmed the “quality” of the Lusofonia Festival</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/boa-afluencia-confirmou-qualidade-festival-da-lusofonia/</link><description>The 28th Lusofonia Festival ended this weekend, with a positive outcome, according to the unanimous opinion of some responsible for the organization.

Another Lusofonia Festival came to an end, last Sunday, with those responsible for the organization and directors of participating associations telling TRIBUNA DE MACAU that the outcome of the 28th edition of the event was positive, with a similar turnout to last year. On the other hand, associations continued to face challenges, such as a lack of human resources.
For Amélia António, president of Casa de Portugal, “both weekends had a very lively attendance”. "Lots of people and a very relaxed, very happy atmosphere, as is typical of Lusofonia. Therefore, I can only say that the result is extremely positive." "Initially, we were, well, a little afraid, because we weren't seeing much turnout, but then it started to come together well. Saturdays were very good, any of them", continued Amélia António. However, “Friday, especially the first, was a little weaker”, he highlighted.
In turn, Miguel de Senna Fernandes, president of the Macanese Association, stated that “this edition excelled in quality”, highlighting that “the good weather helped a lot”. “The artists who were on stage were excellent”, he noted.
"Considering the standard we are used to, it went quite well. There was a good turnout of the public, many tourists from the continent", reiterated the association leader. "From the conversation I had with several people, the [impression] was always good, within expectations and, at certain points, even exceeded them. Therefore, it is a party to keep", he stressed.
Regarding holding the festival over two weekends, Miguel de Senna Fernandes noted that the opinion is not consensual among members. "For some it is very tiring. I think that in general, this works. Many people want to be associated with the Lusofonia Festival, like artisans, for example. The authorities invest so much in a festival of this nature and they look for artists... Everything for a weekend, I think it's not enough", he noted.
António Machado, coordinator of the festival, was also optimistic that the next edition could be held over two weekends, having shared the opinion that the final balance of this festival was positive. “I think we have all the necessary ingredients to maintain the two weekends”, he argued, adding that future editions should not deviate too much from the current format.
“In the past, I even criticized this possibility”, acknowledged Miguel de Senna Fernandes, lamenting the lack of human resources in the associations. “When we don’t have staff, things become much more complicated.” Similarly, Amélia António also pointed out the lack of collaborators as one of the biggest challenges: "Smaller associations have a lot of difficulties in terms of staff. Because they had a lot of help from students, and they have fewer students, therefore they have fewer volunteers."
Furthermore, Amélia António also pointed out that another less positive point was that “people bought less than usual, particularly in terms of handicrafts”. “They took a lot of photographs, but bought little”, pointed out the number one at Casa de Portugal. “I think that’s a little bit of what we feel all over the city,” he explained.</description><pubDate>2025-11-04 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Macao SAR economy accelerated in the third quarter</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/ultimas/economia-da-raem-acelerou-terceiro-trimestre/</link><description>The value of the Macao SAR's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) reached 301.33 billion patacas in the first three quarters of 2025, reflecting a real increase of 4.2%, in annual terms, and corresponding to 88.4% of the economic volume of the same period in 2019, according to preliminary data released by the Statistics and Census Services Directorate (DSEC). Macau's economy had advanced just 1.8% in the first half of this year, with a contraction of 1.3% between January and March, the first year-on-year decline since the end of 2022, to be offset by an increase of 5.1% in the second quarter.
The new official data show that GDP accelerated in the third quarter of this year, with its value estimated at 103.86 billion patacas, marking a real growth of 8.0% compared to the same period in 2024 and equivalent to 92.6% of the level recorded between July and September 2019. Between July and September, the Macao SAR economy maintained “a stable growth trend”, due to the “continuous increase in service exports”, driven by the “notable” increase in the number of visitors, which “benefited from both the high tourism season (summer holidays)” and the “sustainable development” of the tourism sector, highlights DSEC, also highlighting the “stability of private consumption expenditure in the local market”.
In a first analysis of the main components of GDP, the organization says that global exports of services rose 10.5% year-on-year, thanks to the 13.6% increase in visitor arrivals. In terms of domestic demand, government final consumption expenditure and private consumption expenditure also increased by 2.7% and 0.8%, respectively, year on year.
On the other hand, gross fixed capital formation fell 26.1%, due to the decrease in private and public construction works.
After growing 75.1% in 2023, Macau's GDP rose 8.8% in 2024, in annual and real terms, reaching 84.6% of the 2019 volume. Last month, the International Monetary Fund anticipated growth of 2.6% for 2025 and 2.8% for next year, signaling cuts compared to forecasts made in April, which included increases of 3.6% and 3.5, respectively.

The oath-taking ceremony took place on Saturday, at the Services Platform Complex for Commercial Cooperation between China and Portuguese-Speaking Countries, and was presided over by the Chief Executive.
After the national anthem of the People's Republic of China was played, the heads of the Legislative Assembly Support Services, the Office of the President of the Court of Final Appeal, the Office of the Prosecutor, the Office of the Commissioner against Corruption and the Office of the Commissioner of Audit were sworn in respectively before the Chief Executive, Sam Hou Fai, the President of the Legislative Assembly, André Cheong, the President of the Court of Final Appeal, Song Man Lei, the different Secretaries and the Commissioners Against Corruption and Audit.
The ceremony took place on the day that the changes introduced in the Fundamental Provisions of the Statute of Management and Management Personnel and in the Statute of Public Administration Workers came into force, and taking into account the Law on the defense of State security. From now on, civil service department and cabinet heads, as well as other civil servants, must swear to uphold the Basic Law and be loyal to the Macao SAR.
In his speech, the Chief Executive underlined that public service personnel must “faithfully perform the duties in which they are assigned, comply with the laws, be honest and dedicated to the public and serve the Macao SAR with all their commitment”, which is “undoubtedly an expectation that the country” and that “the residents of Macau place on the public services workers of the Macao SAR”. In this sense, it is “a political responsibility”, but also “a legal requirement”, he stressed.
“This act reveals that the directors of public services, as the governance team of the MSAR, are solemnly committed to assuming their responsibilities, as well as demonstrating the fulfillment and full implementation of the principle of ‘Macau governed by patriots’ in the MSAR, being a moment of profound significance”, said Sam Hou Fai. Furthermore, he urged public service workers “to firmly defend the country’s sovereignty, security and development interests”, take the initiative to look for alternatives and innovation, “fully leveraging Macau’s unique advantages arising from the ‘one country, two systems’ principle, and commit to integrating the national development situation”.

The Government promises more measures to guarantee the employment of residents
 
Between July and September, the general unemployment rate and the resident unemployment rate were estimated at 1.8% and 2.4%, respectively, reflecting decreases of 0.2 percentage points compared to the previous period (June to August 2025), reported the Statistics and Census Services Directorate (DSEC).
Official data show that, in the same comparative interval, the number of unemployed residents (6,900) fell by 9.6%, with the majority of those looking for a new job previously working in the construction and retail trade sectors. Individuals looking for their first job accounted for 18.3% of the unemployed, an increase of 3.8 points compared to the period between June and August, which, according to DSEC, is due to the “graduation season”.
On the other hand, the overall underemployment rate (1.5%), which includes situations involving unpaid leave, remained identical to that of the previous period, despite the underemployment of residents (2.0%) having increased by 0.1 points. Underemployed residents grew by 2.9% to 5,800, most of them linked to the real estate, construction and business services sectors.
The employed population (375,300) increased by 1% (3,700 more people), including 284,200 residents (3,400 more or 1.2%). This improvement was based on sequential increases of 8.3% in construction (to around 25,000) and 2.5% in restaurants (21,000), offsetting declines of 0.2% in the gaming sector (68,900), 0.3% in wholesale and retail trade (44,400) and 2.3% in hotels (29,000)
In the third quarter, the median monthly income of the employed population in general and residents in particular stood at 17,000 and 20,000 patacas, respectively.
 
Promoted employment on three fronts
Meanwhile, the Working Group for the Coordination of Employment Promotion continues to strengthen the employment guarantee for residents on “three fronts”: the experimental application of reference indicators for the proportion of resident workers contracting security and cleaning services for the public sector; monitoring internship plans in Macau and Mainland China; and the organization of pairing sessions in the banking sector.
According to the Office of the Secretary for Economy and Finance, Tai Kin Ip, after several interdepartmental meetings and analysis of data on the supply and demand of labor in the security and cleaning sectors, “the Group recommended that public services adopt, when awarding these services, an experimental regime of a minimum proportion of resident workers, setting concrete targets and deadlines for implementation, in accordance with reference indicators”. Furthermore, the evaluation of proposals must take into account “scoring criteria relating to the hiring of local workers”.
Tai Kin Ip, who is the coordinator of the Group, emphasized that implementation data will be collected in the first quarter of 2026, with the aim of optimizing the regime and ensuring the effectiveness of the measure.
At the last meeting, the Bureau of Labor Affairs (DSAL) presented the employment situation of local young people who participated in the local and Mainland China internship plans promoted since 2020. According to DSAL, more than 80% of participants are employed in Macau, while the rest chose to continue their studies, work in Mainland China or start businesses, which demonstrates the “positive effectiveness of the internship plans”.
The Group also collected more than 200 vacancies in administrative and related functions in the banking sector, and has already scheduled work combination sessions in this area for the 10th and 11th of November.

The Conde de São Januário Hospital Center (CHCSJ) and the Hengqin Branch of the No. 1 Affiliated Hospital of the Guangzhou Medical University inaugurated the “External Consultations of Associated Specialties between Hengqin and Macau” project. The event marks a new phase in the health integration process between the two sides.
Present at the launching ceremony, the Director of Health Services (SSM) said that the initiative aims to promote the exchange of medical techniques, the training of talents and the innovation of scientific research, “raising the quality of medical services in Macau and providing citizens with better quality healthcare”.
According to Alvis Lo, the CHCSJ, in partnership with the Hengqin Hospital, established the associated external specialty consultations, “with the purpose of promoting the articulation of standards and the convergence of mechanisms in the two locations, as well as materializing the integrated development between Macau and Hengqin, and the national strategy of the Greater Bay Area”.
The person in charge highlighted that this project has as its starting point the Pulmonology and Infectious Diseases Services, “establishing a joint assessment mechanism and associated external specialty consultations, to diagnose and treat patients who can be transferred by the CHCSJ after assessment”.
The initiative aims to maximize Hengqin Hospital's professional advantages in specific specialties, integrating the high-quality healthcare resources and techniques of the two hospital establishments. This improvement will reduce waiting times for specialist appointments and create “a platform for regular exchange between the two hospitals, thus providing valuable learning opportunities for young doctors”, he expressed.
For her part, the director of the Subsistence Affairs Services of the Deep Cooperation Zone stressed that the implementation of the Consultations represents a concrete measure to “facilitate the lives and employment of Macau residents”, marking a new phase of institutionalized and substantial integration of medical services between Hengqin and Macau.
Fong Fong Tan considers that this partnership represents “an innovative practice of harmonizing medical standards, complementing resources and sharing services between the two locations”.
It adds that the Cooperation Zone will continue to “improve the level of health services”, providing, with the support of the country’s regional medical center, “the advantages of excellent medical resources and hospital talent techniques”, with the aim of providing Macau residents with “higher quality, more efficient, convenient and affordable medical services”.
In a statement released jointly with the Directorate of Subsistence Affairs Services of the Deep Cooperation Zone, the SSM emphasize that, in the near future, based on the acquired experience, they will progressively expand cooperation to other medical specialties, “continuously deepening and enriching their content in the area of ​​health between the two locations”.
This development will also allow “full appreciation” of the institutional advantages of the “one country, two systems” principle, as well as the role of “platform for internal and external connections”, in the sense of “further strengthening regional connections and medical cooperation”.</description><pubDate>2025-11-04 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Game surpasses 24 billion for the first time in six years</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/jogo-supera-24-mil-milhoes-pela-primeira-vez-em-seis-anos/</link><description>The gaming sector reached another post-pandemic record in Macau, closing the October accounts with revenues exceeding 24 billion patacas, corresponding to 91% of the level reached in the same month of 2019
 
SERGIO TERRA
 
Macau's casinos recorded gross revenues of around 24.09 billion patacas in October, an amount that sets a new maximum for the gaming sector since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, surpassing by 8.7% the previous record, obtained in August this year (22.16 billion), according to data from the Gaming Inspection and Coordination Department (DICJ) published on its website.
Driven by the Golden Week commemorating China's National Day and the Mooncake Festival, October's result represents an increase of 15.9% compared to the 20.79 billion recorded in the same period of 2024 and an increase of 31.7% compared to the previous month (18.29 billion). Furthermore, it reached 91.1% of the level reached in October 2019 (26.44 billion), despite the negative impact of the passage of typhoon “Matmo”, which forced the Meteorological and Geophysical Services to raise tropical storm signal 8 for the fourth time in 2025.
In the first 10 months of this year as a whole, gross revenues amounted to approximately 205.43 billion patacas, representing an increase of 8% compared to the same period in 2024 (190.14 billion) and corresponding to 83.3% of the value recorded between January and October 2019 (246.74 billion).
By the end of October, gaming revenue was already equivalent to 90.1% of the 228 billion patacas forecast by the Government in the Budget review for the whole of 2025. To achieve this target, casinos only need to earn an additional 22.57 billion patacas by the end of the year, at a monthly average of 11.28 billion, that is, just over half of the performance shown until October.
 
Waldo and Emperor behind closed doors
In the last two months of this year, revenue accounting will no longer include Emperor Palace and Waldo.

The counselor states that she “always” collaborated with the Portuguese authorities “in discovering the truth”
 
The dismissal of the criminal case brought by the Public Ministry of Portugal against Rita Santos by members of the Socialist Party (PS), mostly resident in Macau, received a reaction from the target, who, in a press release, said that it was “a case that never was a case, based only on speculation, defamation and character attack”.
The counselor for the Portuguese communities highlights that it was a “typical situation of instrumentalization of justice with political-partisan objectives, but which were not achieved”. He also guarantees that throughout the process he “always, actively” collaborated with the Portuguese authorities “in discovering the material truth and, with that, in protecting my good name, honor and immaculate character, supported by the trust that the Macanese community places in me, which I will never defraud”.
“As expected, with the Public Prosecutor's Office carrying out a thorough investigation, finding that no illegality had been committed and concluded by the absence of criminal evidence, archiving is the logical corollary and would always be the only and fair solution to this 'non-prosecution'”, he adds.
At the conclusion of her reaction, Rita Santos attests that “values ​​such as respect for the Law and the individual freedom of each citizen are non-negotiable for me and I will never give up on them, which is why I will never stop, as I have always done, being an active voice in the defense of democratic and humanist principles, and having an active civic participation in defending the interests of the Portuguese community in Macau”.

The Macau Forum promised to continue helping to “empower” Portuguese-speaking SMEs
 
The Permanent Secretariat of the Forum for Economic and Trade Cooperation between China and Portuguese-speaking Countries (Macau) organized a colloquium on Capacity Building for Small and Medium Enterprises between China and Portuguese-speaking Countries, which lasted two weeks. According to the Forum, the initiative included the participation of 14 trainees, including staff, technicians and directors from institutions in Angola, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, Portugal and China.
At the closing ceremony and presentation of certificates, the secretary-general, Ji Xianzheng, highlighted in his speech that the colloquium represented “another step forward in the implementation of cooperation between Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs), as stipulated in the Action Plan for Economic and Commercial Cooperation (2024-2027) of the 6th Ministerial Conference”.

“Men have always had their own calendar, and we thought, why not us too?” professional firefighter and organizer Nicole Koch told news website Stuff.
“We work hard and take our work seriously, so this was an opportunity to do something fun while raising money for an important cause.”
Its co-organizer, Zoe Feau, told New Zealand news channel 1 News: "I honestly don't know what happened... We had this idea and suddenly we were doing the calendar. It was incredible."
The team hoped to sell 5,000 copies of the 2026 calendar, with all proceeds going to breast cancer research. The copies sold out in 26 hours, with around 100,000 New Zealand dollars being raised. A second pre-sale is open until November 10th.
To generate anticipation, the group created an Instagram account with previews of what could be on the calendar, as well as behind-the-scenes videos showing the women having fun during photo shoots.
"We've been getting messages from all over the world. People are really excited and want to buy the calendar. It's been really overwhelming," said Nicole Koch.
Firefighter Feau said the women involved wanted the campaign to have a “tangible impact” while also “celebrating visibility and pride within the profession”.
For firefighter Samara Pepperell, the campaign is also deeply personal, as she watched her mother battle breast cancer more than a decade ago. “My mother’s journey taught me how powerful hope and community can be,” she said. “This calendar is our way of giving back to that.”
Finding the right tone for the calendar was one of the first challenges, said professional Koch. “For a long time, the question was how to celebrate strength and femininity without being hypersexualized,” he said.
“Now seems like the right time to show that we can honor both our profession and our femininity, while supporting an important cause,” she added.
Sonja de Mari, executive director of Breast Cancer Cure, said the organization was excited to participate in the collaboration. “Campaigns like this bring us closer to more accurate prevention, early diagnosis and better outcomes for women in New Zealand”, he argued.
The team behind the calendar aimed to sell 5,000 copies, but initial interest suggests sales could be much higher.
Fire departments around the world have been producing calendars featuring their best-looking firefighters since the 1990s. But it wasn't until 1993 that the calendars became popular. A striking pop culture example was when Australian firefighters – with their bulging muscles and defined abs – posed half-naked to raise funds for a children's hospital in Brisbane.
An exclusively female firefighter calendar only emerged in 2017, when the New York Fire Department launched separate editions, one just for men and the other just for women.
