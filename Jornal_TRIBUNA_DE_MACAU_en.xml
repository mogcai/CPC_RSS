Air Macau's 2024 financial year ended with net losses of 595 million Renminbis (about 656.6 million patacas to the current exchange rate), according to data registered in the annual report of Air China, a majority shareholder of the MSAR carrier. In the fifth consecutive year with negative results, the value of losses increased by 240%, ie 3.4 times, compared to 175 million Renminbis (193.1 million) reported a year earlier, according to Air China information, although Air Macao has eventually declared losses of 236 million patacas in 2023, a discrepancy that arrests with accounting and currency factors.
According to the annual reports analyzed by the Jornal Tribuna de Macao, Air Macau accumulated more than 3.7 billion in net losses between 2020 and 2024, more than double the profits generated in the previous 10 years (about 1.7 billion). The year 2020 was the most negative, with the losses to reach approximately 1.04 billion.
In the first half of last year, the airline had already registered a negative balance of 378 million Renminbis (about 417.1 million patacas), 118.5% more than between January and June 2023, due to the aggravation of operating costs.
The Air China report reveals, on the other hand, that the MSAR Flag Company's operating revenues increased by 15.85% to 3.11 billion Renminbis (3.43 billion of patacas) in the 2024 general calculation compared to the previous annual year. In the first half, revenues had advanced 20.6% to 1.47 billion Renminbis (1.62 billion patacas) in annual terms.
Over the past year, Air Macau transported 3.21 million passengers, a number that represents an annual increase of 56.41% and corresponds to 87.7% of the 3.66 million record reached in 2019. Flight occupation rate reached 74.59%, plus 2.93 percentage points than 2023.
In the air transport chapter, the recovery has been higher on the demand side than the offer. The RPK (average passenger/kilometer revenue), an indicator that reflects the real demand for transport, rose 59.5% between 2023 and 2024, while ASK (places available per kilometer) grew 53.23%.
At the end of 2024, the Air Macau fleet consisted of 23 aircraft (plus three), all manufactured by Airbus, with an average age of 8.54 years.
According to Air China, Macao's total assets were valued at almost 5.56 billion Renminbis (6.13 billion patacas) in late 2024.
In December, the Government of MSAR indicated that it will inject 344 million more at Air Macau in 2025, as the company "has faced a difficult exploration situation that led to relevant losses" resulting from "the suffering of accumulation of various unfavorable factors." According to an opinion from the 2nd Permanent Committee of the Legislative Assembly on the Budget Proposal for 2025, which cites a representative of the Executive, Air Macau is “in a situation of capital mobility” and to feel “the pressure of the reimbursement of the loan and payment of their interest”, so that the mainstream partner proposed that the rame will provide financial support through a capital increase.
This is the fourth time Air Macau has been in accordance with the main shareholders since 2009. The “China National Aviation Corporation” - integrated into Air China's “Holding” - is the largest shareholder of Air Macau, with 66.9%of the capital, followed by 21.5%, and the Macao Tourism and Diverse Society (STDM), with 11.57%. The shareholder group also includes “Evergreen Airways Service”, IPE (Macau) - investments and business participation, the Macao World Trade Center and the Macao Insurance Company, with residual appearances.
 
Largest Chinese carriers remain in the “red”
In 2024, China's three main state airlines completed five successive years in the “red”, although they were able to reduce joint losses by 53.4% ​​to about 6.2 billion Renminbis compared to 2023. Competition in the domestic market, the weak search for international and business travel, supply chain problems, and the devaluation of currency appear as the main challenges pointed out by Air China, China Eastern Airlines and China Southern Airlines. Air China has announced a net loss of 230 million Renminbis (-99%in annual terms), China Eastern lost 4.2 billion (-48.6%) and China Southern suffered losses of 1.8 billion (-57.2%).</description><pubDate>2025-03-31 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Lisbon replenishes EPM financing after 11 years of cuts</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/lisboa-repoe-financiamento-da-epm-apos-11-anos-de-cortes/</link><description>Fulfilling the usual rulers of the Portuguese Republic when moving to Macau, the Minister of State and Foreign Affairs of Portugal, Paulo Rangel, was at the Portuguese school.

The visit to the territory was short, but, as usual, the Portuguese School of Macau (EPM) was a mandatory point of passage to the Minister of State and Foreign Affairs of Portugal. Paulo Rangel was received with flowers, heard “The Portuguese” -and was sensitized -visited the facilities and met with the leaders of the educational establishment. In the end, it was known that the Portuguese government replaced financial support to the EPM.
The cut in the support of the government of Portugal to the EPM had been set up, with the contribution of only 10% in the expenses of the school. Holding 51% of the EPM Foundation's capital since the Troika time in 2014 that successive governments have reduced the amount, a situation that has caused some dissatisfaction in school leaders over these long years.
Speaking to journalists already during the reception to the Portuguese community, the Portuguese Minister of Foreign Affairs said the financing is again “at legal levels”, which is the first time “after 11 years”.
Paulo Rangel considered that there was no longer "reason" to have this cut, so the government of Luís Montenegro, currently in management, increased the value assigned. Jorge Neto Valente, president of the EPM Foundation, told the Jornal Tribuna de Macao that the amount granted became 1.2 million euros, an increase of just over 40% compared to what was being paid in recent years, 776 thousand euros.
"The increase is something that is highly significant of the commitment we have," said Paulo Rangel, adding that "there are governments that really give importance to Macau and China and there are others that do not," in a clear accusation to the government of the socialist party that has been in power in the last eight years. The help that will now be granted by Lisbon to EPM is “important” in a school that “has a role to play in Macao,” said the head of Portuguese diplomacy.
Rangel also recorded “pleasing” that “there have never been so many Portuguese students - and now I speak of students from the Chinese community - as there are today in multiple schools”. "It means that masters have also encouraged Portuguese teaching and knowledge of Portuguese, and this is something that can only bring good relationships between both sides," he said.
After visiting the school, the president of the EPM Foundation was pleased with the meeting. "We talked at the meeting that this year, exceptionally, there was a greater commitment to the Portuguese state by increasing the subsidy for the school as established, which had not been happening for many years," said Neto Valente.
“It is always positive to exchange from a living of a living of the perception of reality and the visit of the minister allowed us to show unanimity of points of view regarding the operation of the school and the needs we have,” said the manager. The EPM Foundation number one revealed that the minister was "sensitized to the situation of the school, which is the only Portuguese school in China, which has its characteristics and its own needs."
Neto Valente considers that the meeting was positive: "He was also pleased, because, as well as knowledge, you never know everything." "It was an opportunity for those here to express what they think and the concerns they have, and his, as minister, to ask questions to be aware of the situation," he added.
On the issue of teachers, so spoken in the first months of the academic year, Paulo Rangel learned of the difficulties felt by the EPM. “These are the only difficulties regarding Portugal”, which is the coming of teachers to Macau, “for which we need a license from the Ministry of Education, so we have sensitized the Minister of Foreign Affairs and asked him to intercede in this regard,” said Jorge Neto Valente.
 
Minister sensitized when hearing the anthem
Fulfilling the usual rulers of the Portuguese Republic when they move to Macau, Paulo Rangel was at EPM on Friday morning, in the one that was the first visit point in the territory. It was just at 10:15 am when the Minister of State and Foreign Affairs of Portugal entered the facilities of the educational establishment, accompanied by the consul General of Portugal in Macau and Hong Kong, Alexandre Leitão, after being received abroad by the director of EPM, Acácio de Brito, by the president and vice president of the EPM Foundation, Jorge Neto Valente and Miguel de Senna Fernandes.
In compliance with the chief of Portuguese diplomacy, Edite Silva, president of the EPM curators, Filipe Figueiredo, president of the EPM Parents and Parents Association, Diana Antunes, president of the EPM Student Association, and Patrícia Ribeiro, director of the Portuguese Institute of Oriente (IPOR) were also.
Inside the school, Paulo Rangel received a branch of flowers and headed to the outdoor space, where the outdoor recreation operates. The minister was waiting for a few dozen students from the first and second cycles, all with yellow and blue uniforms, and the EPM choir, wearing in shades of blue, which played the Portugal anthem.
Paulo Rangel and all his companions, including elements of his office, listened closely to the stanzas of the anthem, from “heroes of the sea ..” to “against marching, marching cannons”, applauding the performance of young students. "I liked it a lot, it was impeccable, you were very well," said the minister.
"One of the great rewards of being in foreign affairs is to reach the four corners of the world and to see, on the one hand, the knowledge of Portugal, which is sometimes deeper than in Europe, and then we have the Portuguese anthem sung by children, students, clearly from the Portuguese community, but also other Chinese. It is evident that it cuts the heart of anyone and we feel completely at home."
After listening to “The Portuguese”, the ruler toured the first floor of the building, attentive to Acácio de Brito's explanations, passing in the corridor through several classrooms, until entering the meeting site in a space adjacent to the school's director, for a conversation with representatives of the EPM.
After the meeting, Paulo Rangel moved to the headquarters of the government to meet the chief executive, during which the relations between Portugal and China, with Macao as a platform, were addressed.
In the afternoon, he was at the Portuguese Consulate General in Macau and Hong Kong, including IPOR and AICEP, and had a meeting with the three counselors of the Portuguese communities elected by the Circle of China. He then headed in the middle of the afternoon to Hong Kong, where he visited the exhibition “Lush Stories” at the Raehk History Museum, and the Lusitano club. That same night, he returned to Lisbon.</description><pubDate>2025-03-31 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Sam Hou Fai should visit Portugal this year</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/sam-hou-fai-devera-visitar-portugal-este-ano/</link><description>Portugal Minister of State and Foreign Affairs, Paulo Rangel (E), during the meeting with the Chief Executive of the Special Administrative Region of Macau, Sam Hou Fai (D) in Macau, China, March 28, 2025.

The chief executive is expected to visit Portugal a few days, all pointing out that this happens this year, said the Minister of State and Foreign Affairs of the Portuguese Government, Paulo Rangel, stating that the dates depend on the availability of Sam Hou Fai. As said, the visit of the MSAR leader is expected to take place "immediately before August or in September." Sam Hou Fai, quoted in an official note, said hope to visit Portugal “in the near future”.
Underlining that he is the first head of diplomacy to visit Macau since the inauguration of Sam Hou Fai, Rangel noted that the trip to Portugal will also be the first to the foreigner of the chief executive. "There is clearly here also an alignment of the priorities that is highly symbolic," said the diplomat, in statements to journalists, on the sidelines of the reception to the Portuguese community, which took place at the Military Club.
Asked whether restrictions on residence assignment to Portuguese was a subject that was on the table at the meeting with Sam Hou Fai, Rangel did not detail the topics covered, but said that he said “on all the issues that are relevant to the relationship between Portugal and the masters”.
"But, as it is a dialogue that is underway, I have a duty to give the opportunity we can - with the questions that have been raised from one part and the other - now to have space and time to build solutions," he added. The minister indicated that the "follow -up of dialogue" staged with Sam Hou Fai will take place at a meeting of the Portugal -Raem Joint Commission, "which will be organized, in principle, in the second semester here in Macao."
For Paulo Rangel, the conversation with Sam Hou Fai was "very productive, very instructive and very capable of being continued." "The relationships are very, very good, this was also proven with our visit to China," he said. About the meetings he had now, he said he was “very satisfied” with the dialogue locked.
 
Community keeps alive Portuguese language and culture
Expectation, as always, among the Portuguese community for another official visit to Macao from a Portuguese ruler. In Paulo Rangel's tight program, there was room for a reception to the Portuguese community at the Military Club. The event began around 1 pm, shortly after a visit by the minister to the club's facilities, where he signed the honor book and received a sign offered by the president of the institution, Ambrose So, and another element of the board, Manuel Geraldes.
Paulo Rangel was then received with an ovation by the community, speaking a few minutes later. In the 17 -minute speech, he began to use the word “strategic” to define the Portuguese community of Macau, adding that “it is worth, first, for its human value, that is, where there is Portuguese and Portuguese must be the Portuguese state to make its connection, its bond to the homeland”. Ahead, he stated that the community "can count on the government of Portugal and the country as a whole, for all that is necessary."
“I want to thank you individually and to your families, for all the dedication, which is very visible in Macao, and for keeping Portuguese language and culture alive,” he continued. Even those who do not speak the language, "maintaining this affection and connection requires a recognition for us, because we know that many have done so with sacrifice, often distant, abdicating some amenities," he said.
This message of "recognition" was accompanied by the expression "impressive" to classify "The Activo, a kind of immaterial heritage, which we still have much to enjoy, which Portugal has left in Macao" and other places in the world where there are Lush communities.
He also superficially addressed the issue of elections to the Assembly of the Republic: “I appeal to fulfill your civic duties and I hope that the Portuguese State does not fail with the post office, or things, as happened earlier, that I recognize that they are sometimes annoying, in the exercise of a fundamental right of all Portuguese citizens”.
Whatever the result of the elections, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Portugal has ensured that “in the transition folder will be given priority to relations with China and particularly to our community in Macao and also Hong Kong, without forgetting the Portuguese living in China, as there is this moment expressive, relevant communities, with an equally very dynamic role”.
The ruler acknowledges that Portugal “would fail his vocation and his true bet in the future,” if he did not give Asia's priority with China included. "This would be a geopolitical, geostrategic, huge error, besides being a betrayal to that which is our vocation." “We have to honor this effort from the 16th century Portuguese and translate it into a modern version, not now having to walk with ships or caravels, but browse the internet, artificial intelligence, high technology science,” he continued.
Rangel reinforced his speech by saying that "there is a convergent understanding between Portugal and China about the role that Macau can play in the relations between all Lusophony and China." "This is something that gives us a truly promising perspective of the future, therefore, of much optimism to the future." Thus understand the Portuguese ruler who today exists an “historical opportunity to create an even greater exchange between China and Portugal”, stating that the platform to do so, the one that is “the natural cradle for that”, is Macau ”.
 
Praised words
The statements of the government's Foreign Government Folder in Portugal's management fell well in the Portuguese community. Miguel de Senna Fernandes told the Jornal Tribuna de Macao that it was "a very good, very sober, hopeful speech, who always preaches the well-being of Macau and his relations with China."
Even considering that the Portuguese community “knows that it cannot expect much from Portugal”, the president of the Macanese Association said that “being Portuguese in Macau is a challenge, in the good sense of the word, it is an exercise”, given that Macau has a historical context and always had a greater Chinese population.
The speech, said Senna Fernandes, comes to draw attention to the fact that China “wanting Portugal here, especially because Macau has this platform role”. Although it is not known how to “materialize these intentions and promises of the Portuguese government, it is always important that a minister of this stature comes to Macau and say all this, which makes us happy,” he said.
"What the minister said corresponds entirely to my expectations and what I wish to be the relations between Portugal and China," said José Luís de Sales Marques. The economist hopes that he will continue for this course, because "it is fundamental for those like me, Macaense, lives in Macau, with a family." "I think this was a future speech that we all always like to hear," he concluded.
 
Marcelo comes to Macau but not at the time of June 10
The President of the Portuguese Republic will visit Macau this year, but not in early June, as expected, on the occasion of Portugal, Camões and Portuguese communities, said Paulo Rangel in an interview with TDM. The Minister of Foreign Affairs said that in June it will be time to form the new government, so the head of state has to be in Portugal. June 10 will be celebrated with Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa later.</description><pubDate>2025-03-31 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Unemployment rises for the first time in 30 months</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/desemprego-sobe-pela-primeira-vez-em-30-meses/</link><description>Macau registered an unemployment rate of 1.8% between December and February, a percentage that marks the first increase in two and a half years, according to official data, reflecting a 9.7% increase in the number of unemployed compared to the previous three months.

The profits “fired” although revenues have grown 4.3% to 771.5 million, including 393.1 million of game -related operations in the Legend Palace casino and 378.3 million business without game.
In a report sent to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, MLD estimates a loss of 45.9 million HKD after the Cape Verdean government on November 18, formalizing the reversal of the company's Hotel and other unfinished works of the company, at Santa Maria Island and Gamboa's waterfront, in Praia. The company owner of the fishermen's dock in Macau reiterated that it is "taking the necessary measures to safeguard the interests of the group", including "explore all available options to contest the decision."
On the other hand, he admitted to “significant doubts about the group's ability to continue in activity” due to total $ 2.51 billion debts from Hong Kong.
In 2015, then MLD leader David Chow signed an agreement for an investment of 250 million euros in Cape Verde.

The Malay Market has been, throughout the year, the target of initiatives by travel agencies and airlines, with the organization of visits to social communication, influencers and travel agents.
The head of the STD market division stated that the choice of Macao as "international favorite destination" at the Matta event follows the "joint work done with the association for the resumption of postpandeia Malaysian visitors."

To the Jornal Tribuna de Macao, António Trindade says he expects the new governing team to “promote policies and execute programs”, considering that “without a great quality of life, there is no great economy”.

The holding in Macao of another Forum and International Exhibition of Environmental Cooperation (MIECF) returns to gather experts linked to environmental protection and ecological transformation. Contact bags, exchanges, debates, presentation of ideas, mark the event, in which companies also take the opportunity to publicize their concepts and know new policies.
Cesl Asia is one of those companies that, assiduously, since the creation of the event in 2008, and especially from its professional certification, three years later, has been present to show the innovations introduced in the scenario of environmental protection.
Regarding the policies that have been followed by the governments of Macao in this matter and in the way of suggestion for the lines of government action (LAG), the president and CEO of the Portuguese matrix company, who operates in the area of ​​consultancy and in the sectors of energy and environment, told the Jornal Tribuna de Macao that “the most important policy is to adapt Macau to what is today, and what will have to be in the future” "Need changes".
António Trindade hopes that the current secretary for transport and public works, Raymond Tam, who has the protection of environmental protection services, "have this vision and make the changes that have to be made." Mostly, it reinforces, "that promotes policies and execute programs so that Macau can achieve not only the objectives of double carbon stabilization, which are national policies, but also increase people's quality of life."
The civil engineer advocates “a cleaner city for residents and tourists”, and it is necessary for Macau to “improve the environment of the waters around him”. It states that "situations have been getting worse" and that, therefore, "it would be good to take advantage of this government's term" to "end the problems that are known and have been degraded in the last 20 years."
"These things cannot be done overnight," but "in four or five years I hope significant changes in the environment," said António Trindade, stressing that "when there is leadership and will, in a very short time is 80% of what is needed to perform, performing the rest gradually."
The entrepreneur says he has no knowledge of the ideas of the new secretary, but, "for what the chief executive says, it is believed that there is at least harmony for greater attention to the environment, because without quality of life of people, there is no other way to look at the subject." “Without a great quality of life there is no great economy,” he emphasizes.
 
Environmental protection “has been neglected”
Making a retrospective of recent years regarding environmental protection policies in Macao, the president of Cesl Asia observes the existence of "constant degradation for 20 years, so there is no way to look at this otherwise, as I have said publicly." Trinity warns that "this is a question that has been neglected in Macao," but expects "to change to the right way, which corresponds to national politics."
It is not possible to recognize, according to the words of the Luso businessman, "that the government speaks, in its speeches, of improvements and in adhering to national objectives, but also what are the expectations of people, who smell the stench, who can not walk by the sea because it smells bad and this is also a public health problem, with the endemic gastroenteritis that exist in Macao."
Name other problems: "the floods, wastewater, sea waters, where one cannot bathe, the contamination that exists, the emissions of polluting gases and the billion that has been spent."
For Cesl Asia's official, "Macao has announced several times that he was going to do" Wolders "and solid waste treatment stations of the best in the world, and for that, many millions have been spent, but everything is still getting worse." Antonio Trindade considers that there is no reason for this to happen. "We have to change these circumstances and ensure that new partners are."
It also notes that the coming of your company to Macau "had as mission to help and contribute to the improvement of environmental quality and, suddenly, we were replaced and nothing has improved."
This year, Cesl Asia will make known in MIECF the “change of corporate identity” that has been verified along the company's operations course. The company's president said the event serves, beyond the benefits as a whole, to present the changes that have been implemented. "We are changing some things, such as logo, management itself, which is, by the way, something we have been doing over 37 years."
The CEO considers that this change and evolution aims to “accompany the evolution of Macau”, a territory that, a few years ago, “basically the cycle of construction of the mega resorts and casinos ended, and therefore there is a new way to economic development”.
In the engineer's opinion, “the company's perspective or philosophy, its principles and values ​​remain, but there has been a better adaptation with the development of partnerships with companies in the continent, with global technological companies, in order to add new technologies to our services”.
António Trindade points out that the firm he leads has been changing and monitoring the development of Macao "with the new growth cycles in the economy itself, not growth based on construction and increasing tourists, for example, but the economic value of what is done in the territory, through new infrastructures."</description><pubDate>2025-03-28 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Finland follows in the lead of the ranking of the happiest countries in the world</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/lazer/finlandia-segue-na-lideranca-ranking-dos-paises-mais-felizes-mundo/</link><description>Finland is the happiest country in the world for the eighth consecutive year, according to the annual report on the happiness elaborated with the support of the UN. All Nordic countries remain among the 10 happiest, with Denmark, Iceland and Sweden behind Finland, which slightly expanded its distance to the runner -up.
In turn, the US fell to 24th place, the worst result of the country since the publication of the first edition of the report in 2012, when they ranked 11th, its best classification.
Sharing meals “is strongly linked to well-being,” write the authors of the study. The "number of people who have dinner alone in the US has increased 53% in the last two decades."
By 2023, almost 25% of Americans stated that they had a meal alone the day before, according to the report. "The growing number of people who make meals alone is one of the reasons for the fall of welfare in the US," the study says.
The US is also one of the few countries that record an increase in “deaths from despair” (suicide or as a consequence of excessive alcohol consumption, drugs, etc.), at a time when this type of death is falling in most countries.
The report analyzes the behavior of populations around the world in 2022-2024, which means it is not linked to the changes triggered by Donald Trump's return to the White House.
Latin American countries with the best positions were Costa Rica and Mexico, in sixth and tenth, respectively.
Afghanistan, the scenario of a humanitarian catastrophe since the Talibans resumed power in 2020, will appear again as the most unhappy country in the world.
The classification of happiness is based on an average of three years of personal assessment of life satisfaction, as well as GDP per capita, social support, life expectancy with good health, freedom, generosity and corruption rates.
"It seems that Finns are relatively pleased with their lives," said AFP Frank Martela, a deputy professor specializing in well-being research and happiness at the Helsinki university of Esporte.
The result can be largely explained by the fact that Finns live in a “society that works quite well,” he added. "Democracy works well, we have free elections, freedom of expression, low levels of corruption, and all this demonstrates that it is possible to predict higher levels of national well-being," he added.
All Nordic countries have relatively strong social protection systems, with maternity and paternity licenses, majority universal unemployment and health care subsidies, which also contribute to higher average welfare levels.
Eveliina Ylitolonen, a 23 -year -old student in Helsinquia, believes that the Finnish appreciation for the beauty of nature explains the country's level of happiness, known for their deep forests and more than 160,000 lakes. "Nature is an important element of happiness," he said.
In this year's report, the authors claim to have new evidence that acts of generosity and belief in the goodness of others are "significant predators of happiness, even more than receiving a higher salary." "People are very pessimistic about the kindness of their community; the rate of return of lost wallets is much higher than people expect," they add.
The Nordic countries are also “among the best places in terms of expected and real rates of return of lost wallets,” says the report.
