The association expects, after retaining, the government accelerates the appreciation and approval of requirements for this type of license and prolong the operational hours of these spaces.
 
The resumption of the issuance of Esplanade licenses was discussed at a meeting between the Union of Associations of Restoration and Beverage Owners and the Institute for Municipal Affairs, said Association President Chak Mo, at a press conference held yesterday.
According to Chan Chak Mo, the government revealed its intention to boost this work. For the Association, as the number of visitors Macau has been rising and tourists are increasingly valuing the tourist experience, it will be positive if the authorities re -accept requirements for the Esplanade license. At the same time, he called for the restoration sector to “exercise self -discipline”, collaborating with the authorities regarding the hygiene and design of the terraces, as well as in the integration of terraces with the street.
In this regard, according to the Chinese language press, Chan Chak MO has called for the government to accelerate the pace of appreciation and approval of requests for the Esplanade license to receive in the future and determine clear instructions. Specifically, the associative leader has proposed to prioritize, with priority, the requirements for opening terraces in front of the establishments where the spaces are vast, for example, in the Cotai, in the sense of helping the development of the sector, but also reduce the discomfort in the lives of residents.
Remembering that these types of licenses are no longer awarded since 2009, Chan Chak MO found that there are currently only about 20 macao licensed terraces.
In turn, Fong Kin Fu, the association's subdirector, pointed out that many local customers want to enrich meal experiences and are “anxious” by European -style outdoors. For this associative leader, the existence of terraces is “adequate” for Macau, the city of coexistence of cultures. Under the premise of not causing uncomfortable residents, Fong Kin Fu expects the operating time of the terraces to be extended to allow the sector to exceed this “difficult operational phase”.
On the other hand, regarding the issue of pets on the terraces, Yeong Keng Hoi, vice president of the association, pointed out that there are currently no restrictions on the entry of pets in restaurants, and the establishments themselves decide whether or not to authorize this behavior.
Chan Chak Mo added that today many residents have a habit of having pets. In addition, he argued that if there are more terraces in Macao, the sector can count on more local customers.</description><pubDate>2025-08-14 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Three land in Nam van will be provisional public spaces</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/tres-terrenos-em-nam-van-serao-espacos-publicos-provisorios/</link><description>Three land in the "heart" of the city - two of which have been enjoying more than two decades - will be used as provisional public spaces. The idea is to create a “city view” to use citizens. The government considers that the use of lots will allow to “raise the urban landscape in the city center”

The Government of MSar plans to enjoy, in the short term, three lots of land near Lake Nam Van for "creation of provisional public spaces." Two of them are between the Grand Emperor Hotel and the “Finance and It Center of Macau” building, and has been enjoying more than two decades in the city's “heart”, where they created two “craters” that have motivated alerts due to risks to public and sanitary safety. These two lots were recovered in 2022 by the authorities.
In concrete, we talked about the A3 and A4 lots of Praia Grande Bay, between Doctor Mário Soares Avenue and Macau Commercial Avenue, which cover areas of 4,169 and 4,563 square meters, respectively.
The third land, A9, is located next to the “Lake View” building, from which the authorities intend to create a zone overlooking the lake, according to the explanatory images of the project published by the Directorate of Public Works Services (DSOP).
In a statement issued yesterday, it is explained that the objective is the planning of building a “city view” for the use of citizens, with the body saying that preliminary work has already been started.
“In addition to meeting residents' reasonable expectations for the best land use,” the project “also allows you to raise the urban landscape in the city center, thus enriching Macau's experience as a tourist city.”
DSOP indicated that it recently began preliminary work, in order to collect information about the current state of the three land, namely the concrete state of the already partially constructed underground structures, for the purpose of preparing the project elaboration work and the consultation work.
"At this moment, the work of extraction and drainage of stagnant and cleaning water in the A3 and A4 lots was underway, and the topographic record," explained the body. As for lot A9, “as the situation of the structure of buildings is relatively complex”, the work of extraction and drainage of stagnant waters are still ongoing. However, weeds and various materials have already been removed and stagnant waters extracted in the pavement “to prevent mosquito proliferation”.
Regarding the structures of the cellars already built on the three land, “the government will be responsible for an entity responsible for the quality control of inspecting the structure of the original constructions, in order to obtain information to promote conception work”.
To provide the public with the “most quickly as possible” provisional spaces, DSOP said that it will start the works in a phase, which include the construction of a provisional tour along the lake in lot A9, which will connect with the arcades of the surrounding buildings; As well as landfill to soil level in the A4 lot, "to interconnect with the A3 lot, adjacent to the construction of the provisional space." In addition, "it is planned again that the basement is intended for the public parking park."
DSOP considers that the measures “can effectively improve the hygienic situation of the environment on the three land, in order to meet the requirements related to the beautification of the physiognomy of the zones”.
Located on the bank of Lake Nam Van, next to the commercial zone, not far from Avenida de Almeida Ribeiro and Senate Largo, among other sights, the three land that will now be reused can “raise the image of the tourist city of Macau, realizing the rational use of soil resources”, says DSOP. The body states that in this area of the city, during the holidays, traffic “is very intense” and that in the end hours of the multitudes control measures are implemented. In this sense, the use of land may also “relieve pressure from the flow of people” in the surrounding areas.
These are some of the work of the protection of transport and public works that are part of the goals defined in the government lines for this year, specifically regarding rationality in the use of land.</description><pubDate>2025-08-14 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>BNU remains “strong” although profits fall 24%</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/bnu-mantem-se-forte-apesar-de-lucros-cairem-24/</link><description>The National Overseas Bank made net profits of 228.2 million patacas in the first half of the year. This amount corresponds to less 72.4 million (-24.1%) than registered in the same period of 2024. Nevertheless, the banking institution ensures that its position of capital and liquidity remains “strong, supported by disciplined financial management and a solid risk control framework”.

Nacional Overseas Bank (BNU) net profits fell 72.4 million patacas (-24.1%) to 228.2 million in the first half of this year, compared to the same interval of 2024 (300.6 million). According to a statement from the banking institution, between January and June, the BNU had a net financial margin of 430.07 million patacas, and in the same period of last year this amount was 505.37 million, translated a decrease of 75.3 million (-14.9%).
According to the bank, these breaks were due to “changes in the composition of deposits and the evolution of the interest rates context as well as the decrease in demand for credit and the decrease in the margin of non-credit investments”. On the other hand, greater economic activity on the part of customers, which corresponded to an increase of 2.4 million patacas in liquid commissions, allowed it to slightly compensate for the reduction of the financial margin.
Credit exhibitions and financial investments of the first six months of the year resulted in losses of around 14.7 million Patacas. In the same year's same year, BNU registered losses of 16.3 million, which reflects greater caution of the bank regarding risk exhibitions. "The quality of BNU assets remains solid, supported by conservative credit practices and a strong level of provisions to face the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties," can be read.
In the first half of the year, BNU registered a slight increase with its operations (+0.6%), compared to the first half of 2024, with emphasis on the effectiveness of “cost optimization initiatives”. “Efficiency gains resulting from process simplification and strategic review of service supply have helped compensate for increased investments in digital transformation, talent development and brand reinforcement,” says the note.
Bank's strategic priorities are “improving customer experience, reinforcing operational agility and responding to rapid changes in the digital panorama”. The bank ensures that its position of capital and liquidity remains "strong, supported by disciplined financial management and a solid risk control frame. These pillars allow BNU to browse complex market conditions, continuing to support its customers, communities and stakeholders."
In turn, the BNU branch in Hengqin continues to play “a strategic role” for investors from Macau and Hong Kong as the great bay and the deepened cooperation zone are increasingly integrated. “Acting as a transionic financial hub, the branch supports the economic collaboration between mainland China, Macao and the Portuguese-speaking countries through the provision of adapted financial solutions and the promotion of a diversified business ecosystem in the area of the large bay,” he can read in the statement.</description><pubDate>2025-08-14 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Bets bet on improving treatment of toxicodependence</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/ias-apostado-em-melhorar-tratamento-da-toxicodependencia/</link><description>With the aim of increasing the quality and level of toxicodependency prevention and treatment services in Macao, the Institute of Social Action plans to optimize urine testing service, expand cooperation between medical and detoxification services, continue to boost young people in anti-drug work and deepen the cooperation with the interior of China in the context of prevention and treatment of toxicodependence
 
The Institute of Social Action (IAS) plans the optimization of the urine testing service and the widening of cooperation between medical services and detoxification, in order to continuously increase the quality and level of the prevention and treatment services of toxicodependence provided in Macao, Tong Chan U, head of the Division of Toxicodependence, and Wang Tim, head of the treatment division, said.

The Ministers of Foreign Affairs of Germany, the United Kingdom and France emphasize in a letter to the United Nations that, "if they will not want to reach a diplomatic solution [regarding their nuclear program] until the end of August 2025, or do not take the opportunity for an extension", they are ready to activate the mechanism "that allows us to restore international sanctions against Iran. France Presse (AFP), confirming information from the Financial Times.
German diplomacy chief Johann Wadephul and French counterparts Jean-Noël Barrot, and British, David Lammy, claim to be "fully committed to a diplomatic resolution of the crisis caused by the Iranian nuclear program and the conversations will continue to reach a negotiated solution."
The letter, addressed to UN Secretary-General António Guterres and the Security Council, appears two months after Israeli and American attacks on nuclear facilities in Iran, which ended the negotiations started between Teerão and Washington, on the one hand, and the discussions with E3-the group of the three European countries-on the other. After the 12 -day war, Iran suspended cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (AIEA).
Iranian Minister of Foreign Affairs, ABBAS ARAGHCHI, announced last Sunday that AEEA Deputy Director-General was expected in Tehran to discuss a new framework of cooperation. Also Araghchi sent a letter to the UN last month, in which he claimed that E3 had no legitimacy to reactivate the sanction mechanism.
In response, the three ministers now wrote this letter, sent to the UN on Tuesday, considering “unfounded” the statements of the Iranian counterpart. The three countries, as participants in the 2015 Treaty known by the acronym JCPOA, "would clearly and without ambiguity, the legal justification for using the relevant provisions of United Nations Security Council to Action the mechanism," they argue.
France, the United Kingdom and Germany are, along with the United States, China and Russia, members of a nuclear agreement celebrated with Iran in 2015, which provided for important restrictions on the Iranian nuclear program, in exchange for a gradual UN sanctions. The US withdrew from this text unilaterally in 2018 and reimposed their sanctions, but E3 countries have committed the agreement to the agreement.
The sanctions of the UN and the European Union were not, consequently, restored. In the letter sent to the UN, the ministers include a “non -exhaustive” list of nuclear commitments assumed under the agreement signed in 2015 that “Iran did not respect”, in particular, accumulating a total stock of enriched uranium “more than 40 times” higher than the limit set by the treaty.

Investment Bank JP Morgan has reviewed the forecasts for the growth of Macao's game revenues for the third time in three months. The projections of American bank analysts now point to annual growth of 13% to the second half, above the 4% registered in the first half of the year. 12% and 16% growth are also expected in the third and fourth quarters, respectively, according to the portal of the magazine “Inside Asian Gaming”.
The game's revenues, during the first seven months of the year, correspond to a total of 140.9 billion patacas, representing an increase of 6.5%, in homologous terms. In June and July, the game's revenues increased 19%, compared to the same months last year. "We believe that the momentum of Macao has legs until the first quarter of 2026," said the bank quoted by "Inside Asian Gaming."
Analysts consider that corrections are due to the fact that "consumers see recent climbs in China, Hong Kong and the US." The increase in exports of luxury articles from Raehk and the continent's shopping centers, as well as a more easier access to the dollars of Hong Kong will be other factors behind this optimism.
High-perfil events and concerts also provide game enthusiasts convincing excuses for more frequent trips, “increasing Macao's appeal” and capturing more players and families.
The bank has devalued that the increase is unsustainable, explaining that "Macau's ascending cycles usually cover at least three to four quarters." Players' losses encourage “revenge” returns, while victories convince them to try their luck again.

Sign 1 was issued yesterday at noon. Although its trajectory is uncertain, "Podul" should bring "unstable time."
The tropical storm "Podul" was yesterday afternoon moving to the west-nooeste, towards the southern coast of Fujian and the eastern coast of Guangdong province. "According to current forecasts, it is expected that the" Podul "will reach Earth, around midnight on Thursday, and gradually weaken. However, its further intensity and trajectory are still uncertain and there is a possibility of following a south trajectory," explained the SMG. Therefore, the probability of emitting the tropical storm 3 signal is relatively low to moderate.
However, under the influence of the external circulation of this system, it is expected that time, between tomorrow and Friday to be "unstable with occasional, sometimes strong, and accompanied by thunderstorms."
With regard to “Storm Surge”, since the next two days are not from Maré Alta Astronomic, the likelihood of flooding caused by “Storm Surge” is low. "However, flooding in low areas may occur due to intense short rain," said the SMG, who recommended the population to pay attention to the latest weather information.
Following the tropical storm signal, the Directorate of Maritime and Water Affairs Services (DSAMA) appealed to the maritime sector, fishing vessels, inner port and general public to take the necessary precautions. "The itineraries of maritime passenger transport will be suspended, taking into account the deterioration of conditions at sea, citizens and tourists should make the proper preparations," said the body.
Noting that time could “get worse gradually”, especially if Signal 3 is lifted, Dsama recalled that works vessels should abandon the operating site and fishing vessels should return to Macao as soon as possible to house the typhoon.
On the other hand, the body also requested caution from the bathers, who should avoid aquatic activities during the Typhoon's passage. "It is also recommended that they do not move to the coast to see the agitated sea," he said.
The Cultural Institute, on the other hand, appealed to those responsible for all heritage buildings, especially from the low -zone sites, to “trigger the necessary and opportune protection measures in relation to heritage and take the wind prevention and flooding measures”.</description><pubDate>2025-08-14 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>One discovers a new combination of drugs to treat cancers</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/um-descobre-nova-combinacao-de-farmacos-para-tratar-cancros/</link><description>A group of scientists at the University of Macau Faculty of Health Sciences has identified a new combination of medicines, which enables better therapies to treat cancers
 
A research team led by Chuxia Deng, professor at the University of Macau School of Health Sciences (one), identified a new strategy, which increases the effectiveness of solid tumor treatments. The approach uses a combination of the drugs “ammonium tetratiomolibdate”, “Picrixafor” and “Bortezomib”, according to a statement.
Study results show that this combination of drugs can help improve breast cancer treatments. Proteassoma inhibitors, such as "Bortezomib", are widely used in therapies because they are effective in treating liquid tumors such as blood cancers. However, proteassoma inhibitors are not so effective against solid tumors.
The group of researchers found that the “ammonium tetratiomolibdate” and the “Picrixafor” can sensitize breast cancer cells to Bortezomib, effectively reversing tumors resistance. The statement states that this study has “significant clinical potential” and provides a new strategy of combining drugs for proteassoma inhibitors against solid tumors.
The investigation attracted close attention in the area of biomedicine and was published in the international magazine “Cell Reports Medicine”. The research team included doctoral students Tang Dongyang, Lin Shiqi, Chu Xiangpeng, Li Ling, He Lin and Qiao Yunfeng, the postdoctoral people, Josh Lei Haipeng and Zhou Jingbo, and teachers Shao Fangyuan, Sun Heng and Xu Xiaoling.</description><pubDate>2025-08-14 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Tickets for the National Games put on sale from the 28th</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/bilhetes-para-os-jogos-nacionais-postos-a-venda-partir-dia-28/</link><description>The first group of tickets for national games competitions, involving 17 modalities, will be put on sale from 28 this month.

Passed from generation to generation on Jiangyong's remote and idyllic County, the nushu is now gaining popularity across the country among Chinese women, who see it as a symbol of strength.
Student Pan Shengwen said Nushu offers a safe way for women to communicate. “Creates essentially a sanctuary for us,” the 21 -year -old told AFP. "We can express our thoughts, trust our sisters and talk about anything."
Compared to the Chinese characters, the nushu words are less square, thinner and have the shape of willow leaves. “When writing… your breath should be calm, and only then can your brush be firm,” said Mrs. Pan.
In the XiaohongShu video sharing application, the “Nushu” hashtag was viewed over 73.5 million times - most of them with young women to share tattoos and other modern works that incorporate ancient writing.
Student He Jingying told AFP that her mother enrolled her in a nushu class and writing her brought her "a deep sense of calm." "It seems that when the brush touches the paper, a kind of force flows into me."
The nushu is more than just a writing system - represents the experiences experienced by rural women in the county, Professor Zhao Limng of the University of Tsinghua told AFP.
"It was a male -dominated society," said Professor Zhao, who has been studying Nushu four decades ago. "His works cried against this injustice."
The words are read in the local dialect, making it difficult to learn the native Chinese speakers who are not from the region.
Professor He Yuejuan said that writing is attracting more and more attention due to its elegance and rarity.
"It seems to be quite respected, especially among many art students," Mrs. He to AFP in front of his gallery, which sells colorful products, including earrings and shawls with nushu standards.
A native of Jiangyong, Mrs. He said that during her childhood the nushu did "part of the daily life."
Having passed in strict examinations, he became one of the 12 nushu "heirs" designated by the government and is now able to teach him.
At one hour by car, about one hundred nushu apprentices pissed into a hotel room to participate in a one week workshop organized by local authorities to promote writing.
Mrs. Zou Kexin, one of the many participants, told AFP that she had read about Nushu online and wanted to "try it personally."
"It is a unique writing system, proper to women, which makes it really special," said Mrs. Zou, 22, who attends a university in Sichuan province, southwest of the country.
Animation student Tao Yuxi, 23, one of the few men present in the workshop, told AFP that he was learning Nushu to be inspired by his creative work.
He said his aunt was initially confused about why he was learning Nushu, since the tongue is not typically associated with men.
As part of China's cultural heritage, the nushu needs to be transmitted, he said. "It's something everyone should strive to preserve-regardless of whether they are women or men."
