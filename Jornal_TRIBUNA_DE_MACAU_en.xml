The mortality rate in cancer patients shows a decreasing trend in the Macao SAR, having fallen by almost 18% in the space of 10 years. At the same time, five-year survival rates for cancer patients have risen compared to the previous decade, becoming “one of the highest in the world”, according to the director of Health Services, Alvis Lo. On the other hand, the incidence rate increased gradually, in line with the global situation

Although statistics from the last decade, now released by the Health Services (SSM), point to a gradual increase in the cancer incidence rate in Macau, corresponding to the trend that has been observed throughout the world and in neighboring regions, the reality is that mortality and survival parameters have shown positive signs.
According to the SSM, in 2023 the territory recorded 2,445 new cases of cancer, with more than half involving women. Furthermore, they highlighted that the three types of cancer with the highest incidence were lung, breast and colorectal. In the year under review, 874 deaths were recorded due to cancerous diseases, of which 61% were men, and the causes of deaths were mainly associated with lung, colorectal and liver cancer in general.
In the last 10 years, the mortality rate has reflected a downward trend, having fallen by almost 18% compared to the previous decade, according to the Health Services.
When releasing the data at a press conference, the director of the organization clarified that work has been promoted in three areas, namely, early prevention, early detection and early diagnosis and treatment, “which achieved some results”.
Alvis Lo highlighted that the relative survival rate of cancer patients, within five years in Macau, rose from 59% to 62%, between 2013 and 2023, “standing among the highest levels in the world”.
Disease statistics in the territory indicate that more than 90% of girls completed two doses of the cervical cancer vaccine before the age of 15. “In the last decade, both the incidence rate and the mortality rate of cervical cancer have decreased significantly, by around 30%”, mentioned the same person in charge.
Compared with data from the past two decades, by 2023 the standardized incidence rate of cervical cancer in Macau has fallen by 28.2%, while the standardized mortality rate has fallen by 4%. Furthermore, that type of disease rose from the fifth most common cancer among women in 2005, to eighth place in 2023, “demonstrating the notorious effectiveness of the screening program for this type of cancer”, stressed the director of the SSM.
In March this year, “the authorities collaborated with several non-profit medical institutions to launch an alert plan, so that people can participate in the cervical cancer screening program”, recalled Alvis Lo.
Currently, about two-thirds of the female population in Macau have completed cervical cancer screening before the age of 35. On the other hand, in July this year, the authorities lowered the age of people eligible to participate in the colorectal cancer screening program. Records indicate that the number of interested parties increased almost five times compared to the volume seen at the beginning of 2025.
In this sense, highlighted the director of the SSM, “health authorities will prepare for the increase in the cancer incidence rate resulting from population aging and changes in residents' lifestyles”.
Alvis Lo informed, however, that the SSM will launch today on Conta Única, an integrated cancer screening platform. The system integrates existing cancer booking and screening services to “facilitate the public in assessing and booking screenings for breast, cervical, colorectal or lung cancer.
So far, more than 7,000 additional people have been involved in screening after receiving messages or notices sent through the Single Account.” On the other hand, as of August this year, more than 35,000 have participated in the colorectal screening program.
Among them, 330 had malignant polyps and 175 were diagnosed with malignant tumors, but the majority were in the early stages. “This demonstrates that screening makes it possible to take advantage of the ideal period for treatment,” he concluded.</description><pubDate>2025-10-09 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>“Less satisfactory” restaurant and retail businesses in Golden Week</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/negocios-na-restauracao-retalho-menos-satisfatorios-na-semana-dourada/</link><description>Although the number of visitors to Macau registered an annual increase of 7.4% to 1.05 million in the first seven days of Golden Week, local restaurants, especially those located in residential areas, view business results during this festive period as “less satisfactory”. According to some representatives of the sector, business in the retail sector was also “not very good” on those days, with the festival not having a noticeable effect on encouraging consumption. On the other hand, for the tourism sector, the National Day holidays “correspond to expectations”, while the hotel sector achieved a “satisfactory” occupancy rate.



















With Macau receiving 136,826 visitors on Tuesday, the penultimate day of Last Week, the number of arrivals exceeded 1.05 million in the first seven days of Golden Week, which translates into annual growth of 7.4% and a daily average of 150 thousand, according to data from the Tourism Services Directorate (DST).
According to the organization, the peak in the flow of visitors occurred on Saturday, October 4, with more than 191 thousand visitors entering the territory. DST recorded a daily average of 125 thousand visitors from Mainland China and 15 thousand from Hong Kong in the period between 1 and 7 October.
Visitors entered the Macao SAR mainly through Portas do Cerco, which absorbed more than 471 thousand border crossings in these seven days. In turn, the Hengqin Border Post and the Macau border at Delta Bridge recorded 195 thousand and 176 thousand entries and exits, respectively.
Despite the increase in the number of visitors in recent days, Golden Week was “less satisfactory” for the local catering sector, lamented Fong Kin Fu, deputy director of the Union of Restaurant and Beverage Establishment Owners' Associations. Speaking to the TRIBUNA DE MACAU newspaper, the association leader estimated that, in general, restaurants should see a slight increase of 3% to 5% in turnover compared to the same period last year.
However, he predicted that only restaurants located in tourist areas will see slight growth in business. As for restaurants in residential areas, he estimated that they will suffer up to a 10% annual drop in business volume during Golden Week.
"This time, establishments in residential areas had even slightly weaker results than normally, because many residents traveled to Guangdong or traveled during long holidays. Therefore, restaurants lost many local customers during this period, although they were able to serve some tourists", he described.
According to Fong Kin Fu, despite the slight increase in visitors, visitors “were not very active” in terms of consumption, not only in restaurants, but also in retail. "Retail business was also not very good during Golden Week, because tourists focused on playing in casinos or visiting check-in points. Consumption in gastronomic souvenir shops was also lower than last year", he lamented.
According to his observation, currently, the local restaurant sector is experiencing “two extremes”, with restaurants in the vicinity of Ruínas de São Paulo or Rua do Cunha benefiting from more business than last year, in a scenario contrary to that of establishments operating in residential areas. "Tourists currently show a weak level of consumption, resulting from the general environment that is less good. Currently, young people who travel to Macau spend little", he concluded.
In the same sense, the president of the Industrial and Commercial Association of the North Zone of Macau found that traders in the North Zone had a “mediocre performance” during Golden Week, especially because they served a “limited number” of tourists during this period. In general, he considered that the festival did not have a noticeable effect on encouraging business.
In his opinion, the lack of tourist resources, commercial facilities and convenient transport links to the area continues to challenge the popularity of this part of the city among tourists.
 
Impact of hot weather
On the other hand, Andy Wu, president of the Macau Tourism Industry Association, understands that the results of the tourism sector at the National Day fairs “correspond to the expectations” of operators, although two days had been affected by the typhoon.
"This Golden Week, there was a high number of visitors to Macau and the numbers are basically satisfactory and higher compared to the previous year. However, the non-tourist areas must have received few visitors. The situation may be due to the weather, as, even without the typhoon, temperatures were quite high on those days. Therefore, many tourists concentrated on the Cotai Strip where there is air conditioning, while the outdoor spaces are they were relatively uncrowded,” he noted.
Speaking to this newspaper, Andy Wu indicated that, during this festive period, tourists spent an average stay of “just over a day” in the territory. Furthermore, it predicted an average hotel occupancy rate of 80% to 90%, which “corresponds to expectations” and is equivalent to the percentage recorded in the same period of 2024 and “generally satisfactory” for the sector. Specifically, he mentioned that the rate was higher than the average mentioned above in hotels located in COTAI.
For his part, the director of the Union of Tourist Guides of Macau revealed that, in general, the guides were able to attend tours on just one or two days during Golden Week, a situation similar to that in September and related to the change in the general trend in the tourism sector. According to Nelson Hoi, the guides who managed to work during Golden Week mainly served low-cost tours that integrate shopping activities into the itinerary.
Yesterday, the last day of Golden Week, in addition to tourists from Mainland China, there was also a South Korean tour and several individual foreign tourists in the center of the Peninsula. However, until 5pm yesterday, Macau received another 69,000 visitors, according to data from the Public Security Police Corps.</description><pubDate>2025-10-09 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Local consumers “cautious” about the economic context</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/consumidores-locais-cautelosos-contexto-economico/</link><description>Consumer confidence in Macau went from “optimistic” to “cautious”, according to a survey by the Macau University of Science and Technology for the third quarter. The general consumer confidence index stood at 99.33 points, with the “standard of living” and “price level” categories recording the biggest losses
 
PEDRO MILHEIRÃO
Between the 1st and 15th of September, the Macau University of Science and Technology (UCTM) carried out a survey within the scope of the MSAR consumer confidence index, relating to the third quarter of this year. On a scale of 0 to 200 points, the 829 adults interviewed attributed 99.33 points to the general index, reflecting a quarterly drop of 2.34%. According to UCTM, the general index is no longer at a level considered “optimistic”, having entered a phase considered “cautious”.
Compared to the second quarter of this year, there were two increases and four drops in the six categories of the confidence index. “Housing acquisition” rose 2.72% to 101.99 points, returning to an “optimistic” scenario. In the same sense, the “local economy” obtained 94.14 points, which means a slight increase of 0.57%.
Conversely, “investment in shares” fell 3.26% to 112.42 points, while “employment situation” recorded a drop of 3.78% to 92.69 points. In turn, the “standard of living” also decreased by 4.06% to 102.73 points, while the assessment of the “price level” by consumers decreased by 5.87%, to 92 points.
According to UCTM, in the third quarter of this year, the external environment became “even more complex and severe” with global economic growth weakening, as a result of “greater trade obstacles”. Despite this context, Mainland China's economy continued to progress “stablely”, while society's confidence recorded a continuous increase, with high-quality development achieving new results.
Still, Mainland China's economy continues to face several challenges, such as insufficient demand in some areas and relatively low prices. For UCTM, the downward trend in Macau's consumer confidence index is related “to pressure from the external environment and the transformation of the internal economic structure”.
Although some macroeconomic indicators have demonstrated improvements, recently, at the microeconomic level, consumer sentiment has differed from economic data. For the institution, this means that, currently, “the stability of Macau's economic recovery and its internal engine of economic growth still need to be further consolidated”.
Looking to the future, the university predicts that the consumption incentive measures implemented in the short term will be able to “have positive effects” and in this context it will be possible for the general consumer confidence index to return to the “optimistic” level.
However, the institution also considers that consumer confidence will deeply depend on the process of adequate diversification of Macau's economy, the resilience of the bases created to prevent risks and support for long-term growth.</description><pubDate>2025-10-09 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Several doctors involved in certificate fraud</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/varios-medicos-envolvidos-em-fraude-atestados/</link><description>Between 2018 and 2024, several doctors, from the private sector as well as from the public sector, helped a doctor from the Correctional Services Directorate obtain forged certificates, allowing him to frequently absent himself from his duties, the CCAC revealed. The DSC promised a “comprehensive review of the absence management mechanism” and “absolute intolerance” for other similar acts
 
A doctor from the Correctional Services Directorate (DSC) is suspected of having obtained several false medical certificates for himself and his family members over several years, allowing him to earn a salary of around 150 thousand patacas. Between 2018 and 2024, the suspect will have acted in collusion with other doctors, from public and private institutions, “so that they would provide support in issuing medical certificates or proof of absences due to family monitoring”, so that the suspect could deal with his private matters, “without himself or his parents being sick”.
After an investigation, the Commissariat against Corruption (CCAC) found that the alleged accomplices knew that the people in question were not sick, and had, nevertheless, collaborated with the main suspect, so that he could obtain authorization for sick days for the service where he worked. The CCAC also found that the DSC doctor worked part-time “without the knowledge and consent of the service where he worked”, the statement read.
The suspect, his family members and the doctors from the private entities involved “have committed the crimes of fraud and document forgery provided for in the Penal Code”. At the same time, the same DSC health professional and public service doctors are suspected of having “committed the crime of forgery committed by an employee”. The case has already been forwarded to the Public Ministry and communicated to the respective services, said the CCAC.
The Commissioner took advantage of the occasion to appeal to public service workers and health professionals to know and comply with the law, “always keeping professional ethics in mind” and not to abuse the sick leave regime. In recent years, “several cases of abuse of the sick leave regime by public sector workers have been detected”, warns the CCAC.
In a statement, DSC states that it has already initiated disciplinary proceedings against the employee and is actively collaborating with the investigation by the CCAC and judicial bodies. The correctional services guarantee to attach “high importance to the case”, having “immediately carried out a comprehensive review of the mechanism for managing absences from work due to illness” and “reinforced internal supervision”, after being notified by the CCAC.
Together with professionals from the Health Services, the DSC will visit the workers' homes to check the illness status of their employees, “in order to prevent the abuse of sick leave to obtain public funds”. He also asked the heads of subunits under his supervision to reinforce supervision, promising “absolute intolerance with regard to the practice of illegal acts or disciplinary violations by workers”.

The trip to Macau by the Brooklyn Nets and Phoenix Suns, for two pre-season NBA games, scheduled for tomorrow, Friday, and Sunday, involves a series of parallel activities. In a week in which basketball will be the center of attention in sport in Macau, 10 former NBA players traveled to the territory to guide basketball “clinics”, interact with young local athletes and students from some educational establishments and participate in promotional activities.
The contact program with NBA legends, organized by Sands, kicked off yesterday, with the presence of Mitch Richmond, six-time “NBA-All Star” and champion in 2002, at the Lou Hau school, where he led a “clinic” on the sport, aimed not only at students, but also at physical education teachers, “focusing on the fundamentals and essential values ​​of basketball”. In the same session, “NBA Cares” and “Sands Cares” offered balls and equipment to support the school's basketball program.
This type of workshops and gatherings with former and current stars of the North American championship will continue in the coming days. Today, students and teachers from the local community will have the opportunity to watch the Nets and Suns train at the Venetian Arena, as well as take part in a quick basketball course and participate in a health kit packaging project with players from those two teams.
Tomorrow, October 10th, it will be Tim Hardaway Sr.'s turn to visit Fuhong Association's Pou Lei Center, where he will help pack and deliver lunch boxes to the elderly, people with disabilities and families in need.
On Saturday, 100 members of the local community will attend the first NBA House in Macau, an interactive event for fans and an “immersive basketball experience that celebrates the convergence of the game, music, fashion and technology” at the Venetian Macau Hall A, where they will meet Shawn Marion, former four-time NBA All-Star basketball player. The Suns mascot, “GO the Gorilla”, and the Nets and Suns dunk teams will also be present at the session.
The promotional activities for the pre-season meetings conclude on Sunday, with North American athlete Myisha Hines-Allen, currently playing for the Dallas Wings, leading a basketball workshop and taking part in an exhibition game as part of the sport's development campaign among young females, “Her Time to Play”, at “NBA House”, for 30 local teenagers.
Other figures from the NBA's past will also be present at all events, on a list that includes Vince Carter, Kevin Garnett, Jeremy Lin, Stephon Marbury, Yao Ming, Shaquille O'Neal and Deron Williams.
During the activities, to be held in a real venue, there is also an interactive half court, consisting of “a unique LED basketball fountain”, which, through a themed tunnel, “combines NBA elements with sculptural patterns inspired by classical Chinese marble art and the urban landscape of Macau”, according to the organization.
Furthermore, included in the “NBA House”, a Nets-themed photo booth will be installed, consisting of “three infinite rooms”, where fans can take photos and buy team products. A Suns sneaker vault will also offer the opportunity to win sneakers.
On the other hand, an experience will be available at the “NBA Replay Center”, allowing fans to “step into the shoes” of an NBA referee, as well as an inflatable castle for children.
Before the games, an NBA store will open at the Londoner, offering Macau fans and visitors from around the world a wide range of authentic and customizable NBA merchandise from top brands such as Nike, Mitchell &amp; Ness, New Era, Wilson and NBA Kids.
The Brooklyn Nets-Phoenix Suns meetings are scheduled for 7:30 pm (tomorrow) and 6:30 pm (Sunday) at the Venetian Arena. Ticket prices for the general public vary between MOP488 and MOP2,488.
When it comes to team rosters, the Nets currently have German Dennis Schröder, gold medalist at the 2023 FIBA ​​World Championship, North American Cam Johnson, a member of his country's national team, and Australian Ben Simmons, three-time NBA All-Star. The Suns include Kevin Durant, a four-time Olympic gold medalist and two-time NBA champion, Devin Booker, also a two-time Olympic gold medalist and four-time NBA All-Star, and Bradley Beal.
The last time the public in the territory watched an NBA pre-season match was in 2007, with the Orlando Magic and the Cleveland Cavaliers playing here, also at that gaming operator's venue, which has a capacity for 14,000 spectators.
This is the beginning of an agreement established last December between Sands officials and the tournament director, Mark Tatum, which will allow NBA pre-season games to be held in the Macao SAR over the next five years.</description><pubDate>2025-10-09 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Electronic commerce in the Paris “showcase”</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/comercio-electronico-na-montra-de-paris/</link><description>Coordinated by the Economic and Technological Development Services, small and medium-sized companies in Macau involved in cross-border electronic commerce were present at commercial events in Paris
 
With the support of the Economic and Technological Development Services Department (DSEDT) and together with representatives of the Douyin group, the Macau cross-border e-commerce sector participated in Paris in the “Bonjour Brand Sino-French Week” at the 11th “Bonjour Brand Forum” with the aim of encouraging small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the territory to explore the international market, as well as promoting the unique cultural basis of the “Macau Brand”.
According to DSEDT, this edition of the Forum brought together more than 100 representatives, including Chinese and French political and business leaders, world-renowned designers, brand experts and media professionals. The organization invited the Douyin group to, taking advantage of its professional vision and vast experience, present new opportunities for exploring the Mainland China market through cross-border e-commerce and rebranding.
At the opening ceremony of the Forum, the head of the Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Department of DSEDT, Lam Hoi Kin, highlighted that the successful implementation of “One Country, Two Systems” has laid “a solid foundation for Macau’s economic and commercial development”, allowing Macau to fully realize the advantage of having strong support from China and being closely linked to the world to establish trade relations close ties with diverse economies.
As DSEDT recalls, in July, the Macau Live Broadcast Association signed a cooperation agreement in Paris with the organizer of the Forum, “Bonjour Brand”, for the creation in the Macao SAR of the “Selection Center for imported and exported products from China-France-Portuguese Speaking Countries”. This Center aims to help the internationalization of quality brands from Mainland China and Macau, support the entry of European brands into the Chinese mainland through the Macao SAR and encourage the development of cross-border electronic commerce.
The “Bonjour Brand Sino-French Week 2025” included a “product selection session for precursors from Europe” and a “training seminar for quality companies abroad to build the integrated service system abroad”.
Furthermore, at the Eiffel Tower in Paris, a “pop-up” luxury products store had an area dedicated to Macau, to display pastries, essential oils, white wines and “big health” products from four “Macau Brand” companies or agencies, both on site and through “live-streaming”.
DSEDT considers that this initiative had a “fruitful” result, contributing to the integration of small and medium-sized companies in the context of national development and expansion of the international cooperation network.</description><pubDate>2025-10-09 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Non-performing credit drops for the second month in a row</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/credito-malparado-desce-pelo-segundo-mes-seguido/</link><description>Despite the non-performing credit ratio having risen to 5.4%, the total value of non-performing loans in local banks recorded the second consecutive monthly decrease in August, standing at around MOP54.8 billion
 
The amount of loan installments more than 90 days past due in banks in the Macao SAR amounted to around 56.76 billion patacas at the end of August, reflecting a monthly decrease of 0.5% or 269.9 million, according to data published by the Monetary Authority (AMCM) on its website. Despite still maintaining a very high value, non-performing loans registered the second consecutive decline, after falling by 4.9% or 2.80 billion between June and July.
On the other hand, “non-productive” or overdue credit (NPL) grew by 1.2% or 639.1 million in relation to August 2024. The comparison with the 2.77 billion recorded at the end of 2019, the pre-pandemic year, translates into an increase of 19.7 times. Since AMCM began compiling these statistics in 1990, non-performing loans peaked in February this year, at 57.62 billion.
At the end of August this year, overdue credit was equivalent to 5.4% of loans granted by banks, plus 0.3 percentage points in monthly and annual terms. The global NPL value includes 32.24 billion non-resident customers (around 58.9% of the total) and 22.51 billion residents, equivalent to ratios of 6.3% and 4.5%, respectively.
In general terms, domestic loans to the private sector reached 501.87 billion in August, showing drops of 1.1% and 4.4% in monthly and annual terms, respectively. In turn, credit abroad decreased by 9.1% and 4.5% to 511.81 billion on the same comparative basis.
Therefore, the total volume of banking loans decreased by 5.3% between July and August, to 1,013.7 billion patacas, still showing an annual decline of 4.4%. Loans denominated in Hong Kong dollars maintain a dominant weight (44.2% of the total), followed by pataca (21.9%), US dollar (20.2%) and renminbi (10.4%).
AMCM data also indicates that public sector deposits in Macau banks stood at 220.89 billion, corresponding to a monthly increase of 5.2% and an annual increase of 11.5%. Deposits from residents (813.84 billion) fell 0.4%, but rose 8.8% in the space of a year, while those from non-residents (338.09 billion) fell 7.1% compared to July 2025 and grew 6.4% compared to August 2024.
As a result, banking activity deposits decreased by 1.3%, to 1,372.8 billion, compared to the previous month.
The loan/deposit ratio for residents fell from 49.4% at the end of July to 48.5% in the following month, and in the case of non-residents it fell from 76.9% to 73.8%. According to AMCM, current assets to be calculated based on periods of one month and three months against liabilities stood at 61.2% and 55.9%, respectively.

A recurring annual event since 2017, the current edition celebrates two decades of partnership between Portugal and China
 
Registration for the 9th edition of the “World Chinese-Portuguese Translation Competition” officially opened yesterday afternoon. Co-organized by the Directorate of Education and Youth Development Services and the Macau Polytechnic University (UPM), this edition marks 20 years of the “Global Strategic Partnership” between China and Portugal, consolidating Macau’s role as a “precision interlocutor” between China and the Portuguese Speaking Countries (PLP).
The competition serves to “deepen mutual learning and appreciation between China and the PLP” in the areas of language and culture, as well as helping Macau become an “international exchange platform with language services as a link”. Furthermore, it aims to “widely promote the pioneering results of Chinese-Portuguese translation teaching and research in the countries covered by the ‘One Belt, One Route’ initiative”, can be read in the UPM press release.
The initiative pursues the mission of “promoting the training of high-level Chinese-Portuguese bilingual qualified staff and humanistic exchanges”, with a focus on strengthening the professional skills of higher education students from around the world in the context of Chinese-Portuguese linguistic translation and intercultural communication.
The last eight consecutive editions have been held “successfully”, attracting the participation of thousands of excellent teams from more than a hundred higher education institutions from all over the world. The competition “gradually became a Chinese and Portuguese language and culture event with broad international influence”, highlights the UPM, with “significant contributions to the promotion of academic exchange in the humanities and civilizational dialogue between China and the PLP”.
UPM invites “teachers and students from higher education institutions around the world, as well as Chinese and Portuguese language and culture enthusiasts, to actively participate in this great event”. Registration can be done online, on the university website.
In addition to guidance from the Secretary for Social Affairs and Culture and the China Translators Association, this year's edition also has the support of the Asia-Pacific Station of the “China Media Group”, the “Language Big Data Alliance” and the Coordinating Council of Higher Polytechnic Institutes.</description><pubDate>2025-10-09 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Pair project promotes plurilingualism in Germany</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/projecto-de-dupla-promove-plurilinguismo-na-alemanha/</link><description>With the sponsorship of the Berlin Senate and the Fundação Oriente (Lisbon), last Sunday was a day of public art actions and a temporary exhibition on plurilingualism, designed by Cheong Kin Man and Marta Stanisława Sala, under the title “Neukölln Trans-lingual”, in the German capital. Initiated by the duo, active between Berlin, Lisbon, southern Poland and the Macao SAR, the project addresses “the urgency of rethinking translingualism as a cultural asset common to the entire population of Berlin”, adopting “a collective performative practice with a Portuguese-Asian touch”, as highlighted by the Embassy of Portugal in Germany on social media.
Inspired by the plurilingual landscape of Neukölln, a neighborhood that was once part of West Berlin and marked by its migratory identity since the 1960s, the project reflects on the linguistic and cultural coexistence that defines that area. “Neukölln Trans-lingual” brought together speakers of various languages ​​such as Portuguese, Cantonese, German, Arabic, Kurdish, French, Hebrew, English, Polish, Russian and Ukrainian.
According to the promoters of the initiative, the artistic approach of the “lusophile and lusophone” duo has roots in the learning of several dozen languages ​​by Cheong Kin Man, a doctoral student in anthropology at Universidade Nova de Lisboa (UNL), and in the multilingual project “Criative Anarchism” by the Cracovian artist. UNL supports the “Neukölln Trans-lingual” initiative through the Nova Cultura program.
Hoping to “promote intercultural dialogue and value linguistic diversity”, as highlighted by the Berlin Senate, “Neukölln Trans-lingual” brought together several participatory actions, including “Campo de Jogo Translíngue” and “Poetry Workshop”, originating from projects previously presented by the duo at the Casa de Culturas do Mundo, in Berlin, and at the Baltic Gallery of Contemporary Art, in Poland.
Among the participants, Helen Ko, an actress from Macau and language learner from Camões, stood out, who wrote and presented a poem entirely in Portuguese.
A “pop-up” exhibition was also held at the Mayer Pavilion, a space founded by the Italian artist Andrea Mineo as part of the Berlin authorities' artistic studio program. 11 flags were displayed which, according to the Berlin Senate, “symbolize non-verbal forms of expression and deconstructed writing”.
After having performed in Portugal in June, the local and Polish duo once again collaborated with the Experimental Theater Group “Pequena Cidade” (internationally known as “Macau Experimental Theatre”). Director Tam Chi Chün, artistic director of the company and member of the Macao SAR Cultural Development Advisory Council, also participated in the events.
At the invitation of Cheong and Sala, Marcos García Pérez, a Spanish artist, Katarzyna Sala, a Polish and German creator, and Abdulkadir Musa, a German poet of Kurdish ethnicity, contributed to the artistic actions.
The “Neukölln Trans-lingual” project also received communication support from the Camões Institute – Cultural Center in Berlin, the “Institut Français Berlin” and the German platform “Prática Urbana” (Urbane Praxis). To reach the Polish public, the Foundation for the Development of the Creative Society and the Miguel Boym Institute for Asian and Global Studies, both based in Warsaw, also participated.</description><pubDate>2025-10-09 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Tour of Ilha Verde motivates documentary</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/passeio-pela-ilha-verde-motiva-documentario/</link><description>Ilha Verde is at the center of the seventh edition of “On The Move”, a cycle of bicycle tours promoted by CURB that combines the creation of video art and a documentary.

On September 27th, more than 40 participants joined curator Nuno Soares, president of CURB, on four guided bicycle tours through lesser-known neighborhoods of Ilha Verde, Toi San and Fai Chi Kei, to appreciate hidden urban and cultural landscapes in the north of Macau. Along the route, sounds and images were captured, which form the basis of a documentary and a video art work by Wilson Kam, which will be presented next Saturday, at 6:30 pm, at Terraço da Ponte 9 – Plataforma Criativa.
Through the film, the public will once again walk through the hidden streets of Macau – this time on screen – “rediscovering Ilha Verde from a new perspective”, in an event open to the public.
On the other hand, streets and squares in Macau will serve as the stage for the “Placemaking In Situ” festival, the first edition of which will be held between December 11th and 14th, as part of the Macau International Art Biennial, according to a note from CURB. Public places will thus be transformed into “spaces for design, dialogue and collective imagination”.
Six temporary installations will be distributed along an urban route. Workshops, performances, exhibitions and gastronomic stalls will also be organized, among other complementary cultural activities.
The six installations, built by three international teams and three local groups, will serve as “meeting and reflection” points and will guide visitors through Macau's neighborhoods, “revealing both the contemporary design and the hidden layers of heritage”, says the note. During the guided tours, in English and Chinese, “information about the projects and stories of the places they inhabit” will be shared.
Architects, designers and artists interested in participating will be able to register from October 31st, on the event website. The organization will choose six projects, three local and three international, “that explore new frontiers in environmental design and transform public space”.
Going beyond a simple exhibition of architecture and design, the concept of 'placemaking' focuses on the function of public spaces and how they can “strengthen social ties, cultural identity and resilience in a rapidly changing city”.
Curb is “an exchange platform between academia and civil society, professionals and government institutions”, serving community interests, nationally and internationally, particularly in Asia and Portuguese-speaking countries. It frequently carries out research, workshops, conferences, exhibitions and competitions, among others.

Sam Ka Lok, Loi Nga Hei and Cai Pei Jun presented the “BidTrust” project, a “prototype public procurement analysis platform using artificial intelligence to prevent corruption”. According to the Commission against Corruption (CCAC), the project, which has already won several awards, consists of improving the “verification of tender documents during the public procurement process” and “detecting possible irregularities”. The same group also won the “Friend of Hong Kong” award. Young people from Macau stated that “participating in this event was a rare experience” and “a high-quality exchange”. Sam Ka Lok said it was an opportunity to “better understand the work on combating corruption”. Cai Pei Jun, in turn, considered the experience “very rewarding” and that it opened “his horizons in the international field”. Finally, Loi Nga Hei said he hopes that the exchange can continue, to be able to show the world “the strengths of Macau’s young people”. The event organizers will invite the winners to present the prototype in Doha, later this year, during the Conference of States Parties to the United Nations Convention against Corruption. The CCAC guarantees that it will “continue to actively collaborate with the country and the Macao SAR in order to give importance to the training of young people” for the “construction of an integral society”.</description><pubDate>2025-10-09 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Hospital das Ilhas brings cataract specialist</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/hospital-das-ilhas-traz-especialista-em-cataratas/</link><description>_cuva



An ophthalmologist from Continente, a specialist in cataract operations, performed interventions on 14 patients with complex symptoms of this disease at Hospital das Ilhas. The medical unit considered that all surgeries were completed “successfully” and that, after a thorough assessment of each case, the doctor from “Peking Union Medical College” “created a personalized plan for each patient”, with each intervention taking an average of less than half an hour. According to the hospital, "on the first day after surgery, all patients had a 100% level of satisfaction. Zhang Shunhua, the cataract specialist, highlighted that the objective is to "bring cutting-edge technologies to Macau, allowing residents to have access to national-level services, without leaving the territory", stressing that both parties "have established a long-term mechanism that combines remote consultations in real time, with regular guidance on site." Currently, the hospital located in COTAI performs around 200 cataract operations per month. In addition, it plans to invite specialists from the "Peking Union" every three months to provide guidance on complex cataract surgeries and provide priority services to Macao SAR residents. In the next phase, it plans to open more services to increase the capacity to perform cataract operations, as well as further reduce waiting times for this type of surgical interventions.</description><pubDate>2025-10-09 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>“Lotus Flower” cycle path reopens in Coloane</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/reaberta-ciclovia-flor-de-lotus-em-coloane/</link><description>The “Flor de Lótus” cycle path, in Coloane, reopened to the public after the Institute for Municipal Affairs (IAM) completed optimization work, extending the lane and improving complementary services, to provide “a more comfortable space for cycling and a more convenient bicycle rental experience”. The cycle path route now includes the bus terminals at Vale das Borboletas and Rotunda da Concórdia in Seac Pai Van, increasing its length from more than 2,000 meters to almost 4,000. Previously, there was only one rental establishment close to the University of Macau tunnel access, however, two more locations have now been added, close to the aforementioned bus terminals. The new rental locations are located in transport modal hubs and adjacent car parks, covering key track locations. Citizens can now rent bicycles and return them to any of the three locations. The cycle path is open on Saturdays, Sundays, holidays and compensatory rest days for Public Administration workers, from 9:00 am to 7:00 pm. Bicycle rental costs 10 patacas per hour for children and 20 patacas for adults, however, holders of a disability assessment registration card or Special Benefits for the Elderly card issued by the Social Action Institute can enjoy a 50% discount.</description><pubDate>2025-10-09 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Residents of Indonesian island sue company in Switzerland over climate crisis</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/lazer/moradores-de-ilha-indonesia-processam-empresa-na-suica-por-crise-climatica/</link><description>Residents of the Indonesian island of Pulau Pari have sued Swiss multinational Holcim, accusing the cement giant of contributing to the climate crisis that threatens to submerge their territory. A case that could set an international precedent on corporate responsibility for CO2 emissions.
“It’s beautiful here, it reminds me of home,” says Arif Pujianto. The man is on the shore of Lake Geneva, Switzerland, watching the sun's reflection on the water's surface. Not far away, some local fishermen empty their nets in a wooden hut.
Arif, 54, also lives near the water. He has a beach house on the island of Pulau Pari, Indonesia. The son is a fisherman, and he repairs motorcycles and boat engines. However, the sea, on which the family's livelihood depends, is becoming a threat.
The water level rises, and floods periodically submerge roads and homes. Salt from seawater contaminates freshwater wells. Fishing and tourism, the island's main activities, are at risk.
“We are losing our island to climate change,” Arif said during a meeting organized in late August in western Switzerland by the Federation of Evangelical Churches Relief Foundation.
For Arif, one of those responsible for this situation has a specific name: Holcim. The Swiss multinational, headquartered in the canton of Zug, is one of the main cement producers in the world. According to the Climate Responsibility Institute, it is among the 180 companies with the highest CO2 emissions since pre-industrial times.
Arif and other island residents have filed a civil lawsuit against Holcim for its role in the climate crisis. "The inhabitants of Pulau Pari did not contribute to global warming, but they suffer its effects. It is quite unfair", he laments.
If there is, in fact, an injustice that must be repaired by Holcim, it will be up to a Swiss court to decide. On 3 September, the Zug Cantonal Court held a preliminary hearing to assess the admissibility of the case. It was the first climate-related case brought against a major cement manufacturer and is also the first complaint by Indonesians against a foreign company for climate damage.
The Holcim case could set a precedent for similar lawsuits in Switzerland and around the world. "We are victims of the climate. We want to fight for our rights," says Ibu Asmania, also a resident of Pulau Pari.
 
Island underwater in 2050
Pulau Pari is located about 30 kilometers northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia. Its 1,500 inhabitants live in an area of ​​around 0.5 km² and the maximum height of the island is just one and a half meters.
Tidal flooding has long been a part of life on Pulau Pari. However, with the climate crisis, they have become more frequent and are moving further and further into the interior of the island. "Once the water came at night. We had to save electronic devices and get to safety, at the speed of light", recalls Arif, referring to the 2021 flood.
The island has already lost 11% of its area due to rising sea levels, according to environmental organizations. By 2050, most of Pulau Pari could be underwater.
Residents would like to reinforce the foundations of their houses or rebuild them further away from the beach. They planted mangroves to protect the coast from erosion, but they would also need protective dikes. "It's expensive. We don't have the money for it," says Arif.
In 2021, the World Bank predicted that around 48.4 million people in East Asia and the Pacific, a region that includes Indonesia, may have to leave their homes by 2050 due to climate disasters. Arif doesn't want to leave Pulau Pari. However, it asks for compensation for part of the damage and help to protect the island.
So, in January 2023, he and three other Pulau Pari residents filed a civil complaint against Holcim in Switzerland. In addition to the Church, they have the support of the European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights and WALHI, the largest and oldest environmental non-governmental organization in Indonesia.
The plaintiffs allege violations of personal rights under the Swiss Civil Code as a result of Holcim's CO2 emissions. According to a study by the Global Climate Forum, the damage on Pulau Pari is caused by global warming resulting from greenhouse gas emissions.
Arif and Asmania are confident. Their arguments, they say, are based on solid science and the real impacts of climate change. With the compensation money, they want to reinforce their houses, plant more mangroves and build protective dams. “We want to save our island and be an inspiration to everyone fighting for climate justice. Not just in Indonesia, but around the world,” says Asmania.
