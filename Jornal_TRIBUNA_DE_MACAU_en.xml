Under the new “legal regime for the exercise of activity of private health care institutions” -which aims to “promote the Big Health industry and the development of 'health + tourism'” -the government intends to allow hospitals to be created in game operators. This is what it states in the final report of the public consultation, consulted by the Jornal Tribuna de Macao.
There were several aspects addressed during the 30 days of consultation, including the location of the private health care institutions. According to the document, "most opinions suggested that hotel establishments were included in the legal scope of choice of location, indicating that hotels, in conjunction with medical services, can create" health + tourism "synergies."
According to participants, the “innovative model” can be applied, for example, to physical exams, medical beauty and postoperative rehabilitation, “which not only increases the convenience of visitors, but also allows the development of high value added business to the hotel sector”.
“To fully develop the advantages of software and hardware of integrated leisure companies and to drive Macao from more tourists because of health care, after the integration of opinions and under the premise of ensuring the public health and safety of sick, in principle, commercial establishments, namely commercial zones, resorts, hotels, among others, who gather the technical conditions, may be authorized to function as hospital of Day, ”said the government in the answer.
In addition, he adds that, through the "Preliminary Technical Meeting" mechanism, authorities may "provide suggestions on technical and administrative formalities in choosing the site to investors wishing to establish private medical institutions."
The executive also dismissed the hypothesis that health valleys, currently in a value of 700 patacas, can be used in hospitals. During the consultation, there were those who suggested that the amount be increased and that the government would consider widening the scope of its use until hospitals.
In the response on the subject, health services (SSM) remind you that the objective of the health care reimbursement program is to “promote the family medicine system”, “reinforce cooperation between the public and private sector”, as well as “support the development of private doctors”. And they refuse this idea: "Since day hospitals mainly provide specialized medical services in some hospitals, being different from the promotion of family medicine (…) health valleys will not be applicable at this stage."
During the consultation period, the SSM received 892 opinions or suggestions from health professionals, associations and medical institutions, civic associations, commercial sector, game operators, residents and academic institutions.
According to the SSM, "the generality of opinions supports the present legislative work, considering that it actively contributes to the promotion of the development of the Macao Health sector." Of the opinions presented for the various sub-themes, those who expressed opposition always remained below 5.7%, with the rest showing “agreement” or “partial agreement”.
 
Hospitals are not required to have obstetrics and neonatology
After the analysis, the SSM “welcomed some opinions”, in particular on licensing requests, the adjustment of the hospitals of day hospitals, the widening of the location of establishments for the installation of medical institutions, the adjustment of the requirements of the basic functional areas of hospitals, the widening of the content of medical advertising and the recipients of proximity services, as well as the optimization of transitory provisions of hospitals, hospitals, It can be read in the conclusions.
Regarding hospitals, the idea of the government was that the existence of an obstetrics and gynecology service, and a neonatalogy service was mandatory. However, heard the opinions, and given the birth rate, among other factors, the creation of these services becomes “flexible”.
Regarding the transition of hospitals, after hearing the opinions of the sector, "since some hospitals have been working for many years and are an integral part of the health system, in order to ensure the stability and continuity of medical services rendered to the public, the emergency service will be replaced by the creation of an external 24 -hour consultation."
The security, in turn, is intended to allow hospitals and hospitals of the day, in case they do not comply with the responsibilities, they can use as compensation. As for the value -and despite the opinions in favor of a lower or lower value -the government intends to keep it at 5 million patacas to the hospital and 1.25 million to the day hospital, and "the value will be increased according to the services to be developed."
There were also those who showed fears about the risks of “advanced therapies”. At this point, the SSM consider that "the hospital and the day hospital have facilities, monitoring equipment and specialized medical teams, which can effectively respond to any adverse complications or reactions during the treatment process."
In the report it is also said that the SSM will define, more flexibly, through guidance, the scope of telemedicine. On the other hand, and in view of the aging problem, anticipating greater demand for proximity medical services, the authorities indicate that “the scope of these services will be clearly defined. In particular, “chronic diseases management, wound treatment, among other low -risk items”.
Authorities consider that the legislation "provides complete legal protection for advanced therapies, telemedicine and proximity medical services, in articulation with existing industrial support policies of the Government of MSAR, further promoting the mutual complementarity of the advantages between public and private medical institutions."
Regarding the license period, that of hospitals will be one year, contributing to “the timely review of its operation”, while the day's hospital will be valid for two years. As for clinics, whose nature of services is relatively simple and with lower risk level, the expiration date will be three years.</description><pubDate>2025-07-17 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>70% of complaints mitigate light pollution</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/70-das-denuncias-atenuam-poluicao-luminosa/</link><description>Environmental protection services revealed to the Jornal Tribuna de Macao that, after treatment, there was an improvement in more than 70% of complaints concerning light pollution. Still, for Joe Chan, the government must be "more proactive, including the matters of light pollution on the legislation agenda." The environmentalist warns that the body's data illustrate a “little optimistic” situation. According to the statistics, in the first five months of this year, 31 complaints of light pollution were received. Already last year, there were 96 complaints, reflecting an increase of 60% compared to 2016 and an increase of 2.1% compared to 2023

In the first five months of this year, the Directorate of Environmental Protection Services (DSPA) received 31 complaints related to light pollution - more than half (17) for advertising panels and LED monitors outside the buildings. In addition, nine are related to decorative illuminations of buildings, including spotlight, while five involved other situations, such as lamps on the streets and illuminations of buildings outside Macao. According to data from the body, between January and May, this type of complaints represented 2.74% of the total complaints received.
According to clarified, after receiving the complaints, DSPA begins the follow -up procedure according to the “instructions for controlling light pollution from advertising panels, decorative illuminations and LED monitors outside the buildings” and the treatment mechanism. If the situation extracted the requirements of the “instructions”, DSPA will notify the services responsible for approving licenses on complaints and treatment results, to help resolve the case.
In response to the Jornal Tribuna de Macao, DSPA revealed that after treatment, there was an improvement in more than 70% of cases subject to luminous pollution. Regarding the remaining cases, the body has ensured that it will continue to highlight staff to monitor the degree of improvements, maintaining communication and collaboration with licensing services, in order to require, from the source, that establishments take measurements as soon as possible.
DSPA data indicate that last year, 96 complaints related to light pollution were received, 42 on advertising panels and LED monitors abroad, 44 relating to decorative illuminations, including spotlight, and 10 lamp related on the streets or illuminations outside the territory. Compared to the 60 complaints made in 2016, the number of complaints linked to light pollution registered an increase of 60%. Once 2023, there was a slight increase of 2.1%. On the other hand, in the last decade, 2021 was the year with more complaints due to this type of pollution (112), while 2019 signaled the lowest number (51).
Between 2016 and 2024, complaints of light pollution related to decorative illuminations increased 238%from 13 to 44, and from 2020, the annual number of cases of this genre began to exceed 30, except 2022 (noted 28 complaints). And before 2023, this type of complaints decreased 17% last year.
Also complaints related to lamps on the streets and illuminations of buildings outside Macao lowered 16.7% to 10 by 2024, within one year. Since 2020, the annual number of these complaints went from less than 10 to a dozen and between 2016 and 2024, it grew 150%.
In addition, last year, the number of complaints linked to light pollution of advertising panels and LED monitors (42 complaints) remained almost equal to 2016, but reflected an increase of 44.8% compared to 2023.
According to DSPA, in recent years, the annual average of complaints about light pollution represents 3% of the total complaints received, with the tendency to remain stable.
Generally speaking, DSPA noted that “light pollution is increasingly present in society”, but there is a “certain effectiveness” in controlling this type of pollution in Macao. According to it, given that hotel entertainment establishments are one of the main sources of society's luminous pollution and focus of concern, DSPA is constantly communicating with hotels to reinforce the implementation of control instructions to further reduce pollution from the source.
Also on this matter, in response to a written interpellation of Deputy Ron Lam, DSPA indicated that it will continue to pay attention to the control of light pollution in neighboring regions and listening to the opinions of society, continually reviewing the technical rules and criteria of “instructions” and to timely improve inspection work according to the real situation of the MSAR. It is recalled that the “instructions” prepared in 2008 were updated in 2011, 2014 and 2023.
With these revisions, the criteria and mediation methods regarding the types of luminous installations and the connection time, as well as the lighting installation control requirements, namely in front of the ecological zones, were extended.
 
Environmentalist defends Luminous Pollution Law
In the opinion of environmentalist Joe Chan, the fact that the rate of improvement of complaints concerning light pollution exceeds 70% shows that "DSPA has worked and widespread efforts to improve this problem." However, he warned that the data reflect a "uninocied" situation.
Listened to by the Tribuna de Macao newspaper, Joe Chan lamented the rise in complaints about light pollution in the last decade, especially the “high speed climb” of complaints involving spotlight and other decorative illuminations. "We should be happy when there are fewer complaints, but not because of the rate of improvement of complaints," he said.
From his perspective, the rate of improvement in complaints "is another matter", but it is worrying the "aggravation of the problem that the data illustrates." "Being a responsible government, you should try to avoid complaints from the source, instead of waiting for complaints to help with problem solving. The increase in complaints shows that there are problems in inspection. It is passive to deal with the problem after receiving complaints from citizens," said Joe Chan.
The president of the Green Students Union association pointed out that, although they were updated several times, the "instructions" "are not very binding." "Why has DSPA created and has been implemented for over 10 years the law of noise, but there is no legislation yet regarding light pollution?" He asked, regretting.
"We hope the government will be more proactive, including the matters of light pollution on the legislation agenda, for the sector involved and the hotels to follow, because for Macao to be considered a suitable city to travel, it is necessary to safeguard the night sky of Macau. The night sky is a public resource, but not a background panel to commercial entities," Joe Chan said.
In this respect, the environmentalist warned that if the matter is not regulated from now on, in the context of the “below economy”, “casinos can resort to various strategies in order to attract tourists, making the sky nightly in a great stage” to achieve this objective, which “not only impairs heaven and animals, but would also affect a public resource of citizens”.
Joe Chan recalled that he organized and submitted a petition and petition to DSPA for several years. "At that time, DSPA replied that it had agreed with the hotels that could only turn on the spotlight on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, in order to attract tourists. The situation has improved one to two years later, but now the problem has resurfaced, and no one applying a fine."</description><pubDate>2025-07-17 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Disqualifications show that deputies “have to be more politically correct”</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/desqualificacoes-mostram-deputados-tem-de-ser-mais-politicamente-correctos/</link><description>Changes to the rules and regulations of deputies seem to point out that AL should have “many more loyal than opponents,” said political commentator Sonny Lo
 
The disqualification of 12 deputies, announced by the Electoral Affairs Commission (Caeal), "means deputies have to be more politically correct and there are many more loyal than opponents," said political commentator Sonny Lo Shiu-Hing, in statements to Lusa. "Changes to deputies' rules and regulations seem to point out in this direction," he added.
Sonny Lo refers to the approval, a week ago, in the Legislative Assembly (al) of amendments to the laws of the Deputies Statute and the normative of the parliamentary regiment, which, in fundamental, reinforce the powers of the President of the Assembly and plasmam in the two articulated the fundamental principle of the “Macau ruled by patriots” and the State Security Defense Law.
Caeal said the State Security Defense Commission (CDSE) has excluded, for lack of patriotism, two lists candidates for the elections for AL. The president of Caeal explained that 12 candidates from both lists "do not defend the basic law or are not faithful to the Special Administrative Region of Macau of the Popular Republic of China."
Exclusion covers six candidates from the list “Popular Liveliod Force in Macao”, led by social worker Alberto Wong, who first competed in AL. The other list is the “power of synergy”, led by the current deputy Ron Lam U Tou, who, in the last elections, in 2021, had been the seventh most voted, with 8,764 votes.
Seng Ioi Man has ensured that the binding opinions of the CDSE, of which it is not possible to appeal, "have a clear and sufficient legal foundation" and have been elaborated "taking into account the facts."
However, the judge refused to reveal the facts that led to exclusion, arguing that "the works and documents of the State Security Defense Commission are confidential." Its dissemination "may represent certain risks to national security, and should not even be published its content," he added.
"We don't really know the reasons, because the electoral law and the national security law include a number of possible reasons," said Sonny Lo.
In a reaction to Lusa, former deputy NG Kuok Cheong said the disqualification "is a national secret" and that "according to CDSE, commenting on a national secret is to publicize a national secret." "A new system was created in Macau, that is, CDSE has made the decision and its statute is to be respected at all ... They want to disclose information so that everyone knows that the decision does not depend on anyone else, just the subjective decision of the CDSE," said NG, one of the disqualified candidates in 2021.
For Au Kam San, another former deputy, also disqualified in 2021, “the fact that the authorities have still appealed to severe disqualification tactics shows that, under the pretext of the Macao principle governed by Patriots', (…), the Legislative Assembly must be 'perfected' to the point that only the pro-System/Pro-Pequim field can enter the game, to participate in the elections”.
Regarding the acceptance of the candidacy of José Pereira Coutinho's list, usually critical voice in Parliament, he indicated that he earned his identity. "Coutinho is Portuguese, which is bad in terms of political implications, so they did not dare to push him away. According to the current rules, Coutinho would also be disqualified, but he represents the Portuguese community and the political impact would not be good, so they did not move away," he said.
Shortly after the announcement of the Electoral Commission, CDSE stressed in a statement that when a candidate is excluded for lack of patriotism, all other candidates from the same line are also removed. Exactly at the same time, the government demonstrated, in another statement, "strong support" to the decision of the CDSE, which described as "a correct measure for the full implementation of the fundamental principle" Macao governed by patriots ".
Ron Lam, one of the few critical voices of the executive at AL, said on his Facebook page that he had not yet received any official notification, but admitted that the exclusion "was very sudden." “I'm in a quiet conscience. My initial intention to Macau will not change. I believe the sun always comes after the wind and the rain!” Added the former journalist.
In 2021, it was the Electoral Commission to exclude five lists and 21 candidates-15 of which pro-democracy. The highest abstention rate has been recorded since the MSAR was created-57.6%-and more than 5,200 people voted blank or null.
With the decision released on Tuesday, they will run for elections, scheduled for September 14, six lists by direct suffrage, eight less than four years ago.
The new electoral law states that "those who publicly incite voters not to vote, vote blank or null, are punished with prison up to three years."
Thirty -three deputies are part of AL, 14 of which are elected by direct suffrage, 12 for indirect suffrage through associations, and seven are later appointed by the head of the local government.

The city of Jecheon, in South Korea, will host another Asia Championship in Roller Hockey, where Macau will feature three teams, two seniors, men and women, and a junior formation, with players under 19. The race starts on July 23 and will take place for a week, during which the teams, from all echelons, will face the system of all-Contra-all, in just one return.
In the queen competition, the Asian of male seniors, seven countries or regions are registered, with the masters ahead Taiwan, India, Japan, New Zealand, Popular Republic of China and Hong Kong. The presence of Raehk is the main novelty and, in the opposite direction, is noted the absence of Australia, second classified, behind Taiwan, in the last edition of the race, held in 2023 on the Chinese continent in Hebei.
"The non-participation of the Australian formation, which ended in front of us in the previous Asian, gives us a certain encouragement so that we can gain a better classification," the coach's Tribuna de Macao newspaper.
Nuno Antunes pointed out that India is the main favorite, now having as coach Italian Giuseppe Marzella, former International. "They are very strong, have been evolving, so I think they are the big favorites to the title," he said. Moreover, "Taiwan will not be easy either, but it all depends on the team they will present," he said.
As for the current level of the Macao selection, the former player, with several Asian championships won, considers it to be "identical to the championship two years ago, but with the inclusion of some juniors who will allow to refresh the team when necessary."
The MSar team is part of some elements with experience in these wanderings, especially Helder Ricardo, who now lives in Portugal, but is still summoned to represent the selection. Beside will be the brothers Ramos, Augusto and John, and Eduardo Nunes and Lo Wai Wa.
According to the calendar already elaborated, Macau's debut will be against Hong Kong on the 23rd, followed by New Zealand, China, India, Japan and Taiwan.
"As for the female sector, Macao, oriented by José Sousa, will not have so many ambitions, since" the female sector is a project that is still at an early stage, "according to António Aguiar. The president of the skating association considers that" winning two or three games will be a good installment and thus being in the middle of the table. "
The women's team opens the championship, facing Japan. In the following days play with Australia, New Zealand, India and finally against Hong Kong on the 28th.
The under-19, trained by Nuno Antunes, already have some elements with some experience, acquired in previous competitions, having in this Asian an “authentic fire test”, as the technician points out.
Also António Aguiar is optimistic for the championship that young people will be able to do, having a "secret hope" of fighting for the title of champion. "" We do not promise this, obviously, but fits within the objectives we are out of, because we have a team for it, "he said.
This level, which gives up four Hozers to the senior team, therefore with the possibility of acting simultaneously in the same tournament, with different times, will have as first opponent on July 24, New Zealand, followed India, Taiwan, China and Australia.
In a preview, the associative guardian, who is also a member of the “World Skate” and which will go earlier than the Macao delegation to evaluate the conditions of the room, believes that “teams in the territory will fight for the best possible classification, trying to reach the podium and can even go a little further than third place”.

The director also asserted that the government has been "committed to promoting diversified development of hotel accommodation." He stressed that the “Law of Activity of Hotel Industry” already covers "low cost" accommodation, such as youth inns and capsule hotels.

The event is one of the most important of its kind, having brought together more than 1,500 footballers of various levels of training

Three young people from Macao, under-15, have made a first dream of one day ambition could become professional footballers by participating in the world games, an international tournament for lower age, organized by Paris Saint-Germain (PSG).
In the French capital were gyms and clubs from countries or regions of all continents, especially France, England, Italy, Greece, USA, Canada, Brazil, Mexico, Algeria and Ethiopia, totaling almost 1,700 players, distributed by various categories, aged 11 to 18.

Among them is the current deputy Ron Lam, who was elected in 2021. The president of Caeal, Judge Seng Ioi Man, announced yesterday the decision, who said he was taken "considering the facts." However, it did not reveal the concrete reasons for the exclusion of these candidates, invoking "confidentiality." The decision does not fit a complaint or litigation appeal. Now only six lists in direct suffrage

Twelve candidates for legislative elections - including the current deputy Ron Lam - were disqualified following the issuance of the Opinion of the State Security Defense Commission (CDSE). According to the appreciation made by that body, the candidates "do not defend the basic law or are not faithful to the Mashed people of the People's Republic of China." In this sense, the Commission on Electoral Affairs (Caeal) "has made the decision that the individuals concerned do not have the ability to be candidates."
The president of Caeal, Judge Seng Ioi Man, stressed that "the opinion issued by the State Security Defense Commission is binding, and the decision of Caeal that a candidate does not have the ability to be a candidate, based on the respective opinion, there is no complaint or litigation."
At stake are two lists: "Power of Synergy" and "Popular Liveliod Force in Macao." All candidates on the list headed by Ron Lam, that is, Ian Heng Ut, Che I Kei, Sio Iek Weng, Chan Chon Meng and Cheong Iek Chong were excluded from participation in the elections for the Legislative Assembly (AL), scheduled for September 14. It is recalled that Ron Lam was first elected in 2021.
The other list, which ran for the first time, also saw all his candidates - Alberto Wong, Leong Sio Iok, Che Meng Lam, Chow Chi Fai, Ngai Ka Fong and Fong Kai Hou - to be away from the Race to the Hemicicle. The seventh candidate of the list, Hong Wai I, had already presented the withdrawal of the race, according to Seng Ioi Man.
The president of Caeal said that the decision was taken "taking into account the facts" and argued that "it should not be doubted of the authority and specialization" of the committee, pointing out that the opinions issued "have a clear and sufficient legal foundation." "Data and information regarding their work have to remain highly confidential, otherwise there may be risks to national security," he said.
Asked how the population may know how to not violate the law, given that the concrete reasons were not explained, and urged to clarify which criteria - of a total of seven that were included in the new electoral law - motivated the decision, Seng Ioi Man mentioned again the question of “confidentiality” of CDS -related works. "Caeal has no more information to provide," he added.
After the announcement, the State Security Defense Commission indicated, in a statement, that, when a candidate is excluded for not being patriot, the other members of the list are also considered “not defenders of the basic law” or “not faithful to MSAR”.
The seven criteria that candidates have to comply with include: defense of the constitutional order established in the constitution of the RPC and the basic law, not organizing or participating in activities with the intention of overthrowing or harming the fundamental system of the state; Defense of the unity and territorial integrity of the State, not practicing acts that endanger them; There is no collusion with “anti-china” organizations, associations or individuals; Respect for the political system enshrined in the constitution of the RPC and the Basic Law, “not attacking in bad faith, denigrating, slanderizing or outraging the RPC or the masters”; Respect for the competences and decisions of the National Popular Assembly; Do not practice acts against national sovereignty and security, nor against state security; and do not provide assistance or facilitate the practice of these acts.
 
Six lists for 14 seats
On the other hand, Seng Ioi Man indicated that the remaining six lists of direct suffrage "have no ineligibility situation of candidates or other irregularities." Therefore, “these applications and their candidates were admitted” by Caeal.
Thus, they remain in the race to elections the “Association of United Citizens of Macao”, linked to the community of Fujian; the “Union for Development”, of the Federation of Workers' Associations; and the “Promoting Union for Progress”, linked to the General Union of Residents' Associations. They also compete for the seats of the “Good Home Alliance” of the Women's Association; The “New Hope”, linked to the Macao Public Function Workers Association, and the “Union of Macau-Guangdong”, linked to the province of Jiangmen.
Since the establishment of the MSAR, this will be the time when there are fewer lists to compete for 14 seats for direct suffrage. With disqualification, it means that lists linked to traditional associations will get more space in AL.
In 2021, it is recalled, Caeal disqualified, for the first time, candidates for legislative elections-five lists and 21 candidates, 15 of which pro-democracy. This year, Macau then registered the highest abstention rate of 57.6%.
Asked yesterday, what impact expects on electoral participation, taking into account the decision and the fact that no details were disclosed about the reasons that led to disqualification, the president of Caeal stressed that “vote is a right, but also a duty” and promised to be aware of any acts of incitement to blank or null. These acts began to be punished with prison sentence, with the entry into force of the new law.
In the indirect suffrage, CDSE accepted all six lists of candidates.
 
Ron Lam of “Quiet Awareness” says he was not notified
The Jornal Tribuna de Macau tried to contact Ron Lam yesterday to get a comment on disqualification, but it was not possible. In a publication on his Facebook page, the deputy thanked the "concern" and said he had not received any notification: "I only learned of the information when I saw the broadcast of the news." Ron Lam said he was "calm" and "clean consciousness." "My original intention about Macau will not change. I believe the sun always comes after the wind and rain," he added, apologizing for not being able to continue to serve the population. The deputy also thanked the partners who have accompanied him and the supporters. This newspaper also tried to reach the speech with Alberto Wong, but it was equally impossible. The candidate also said on Facebook that he was not notified of the decision. "It will not change my position of loving the homeland and loving Macau. I will be faithful to masters as at the beginning," he said, apologizing to the supporters.
 
Government and connection office demonstrate “strong support”
Shortly after the announcement of the disqualification of 12 candidates, the Government of the MSAR issued a statement demonstrating “strong support” to the decision of the Assembly Electoral Affairs Committee, based on the opinion of the State Security Defense Commission. For the executive, "it is a correct measure for the full implementation of the fundamental principle" Macau governed by patriots ", can be read in the staff of the media. It is also said that "the defense of the basic law and the fidelity to the Mand of the People's Republic of China are the legal duties and the most fundamental political ethics than the deputies to the Legislative Assembly must observe." "Under the constitutional order established in the constitution of the RPC and the Basic Law, the people who are part of the masters' governance structure must be those who firmly love the homeland and Macao," the government. Also the central government connection office on the MSAR commented on the decision, supporting it "firmly." The spokesman argued that the deputies “must be convinced patriots” and stressed that, according to the laws in force, these decisions “have absolute authority and are unquestionable and unquestionable”</description><pubDate>2025-07-16 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Macao's historic center “materializes” “unique paradigm” between civilizations</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/centro-historico-de-macau-materializa-paradigma-impar-entre-civilizacoes/</link><description>Leong Wai Man highlighted the fundamental role of the Historic Center of Macau, which allowed to establish a dialogue between eastern and western cultures, during the commemorative ceremony of the 20th anniversary of the registration on the World Heritage list. The president of the Cultural Institute also underlined the efforts that have been developed within the scope of the safeguard of cultural heritage

"The" Historic Center of Macao ", as a strategic and crucial nucleus of the Seda Maritime Route, opened the doors to the East-Cultural Cultural Dialogue," said Leong Wai Man, during the inaugural ceremony of the 20th anniversary of the registration of that historic set on the World Heritage List, which took place at the Dom Pedro V. Theater.
For precisely two decades, “this cultural jewel born of a unique history” has been recognized by UNESCO and “became the first 'visiting card' at the global level, allowing the world to recognize the unique position and exceptional contribution of the territory as the confluence of eastern and western cultures,” said the president of the Cultural Institute (IC).
Leong Wai Man highlighted the fact that, for more than four hundred years, “Chinese and Western cultures have shone with mutual enhancement and harmonious coexistence, where Lingnan temples rise side by side with baroque churches, and Portuguese sidewalks serpen among Chinese courtyards. Like a tridimensional epic, this heritage, this heritage, this heritage Materializes a unique paradigm of peaceful coexistence and mutual enrichment between civilizations, ”he continued.
Since 2005 the government has been following the “concept of development and protection” of heritage. Collaborating with all sectors of society, it has sought to ensure “preservation and inheritance” and “innovative use” of the historic center. For this purpose, several initiatives were implemented, such as the construction of the legal system, the monitoring, repair and protection of science and technology, among others, accentuated the president of the CI.
These measures intend to establish an “effective barrier” to safeguard the Macao Historic Center, focusing on the revitalization and appreciation of heritage, the education of youth, social promotion and the creation of a cultural protection system that involves the entire population. “The safeguard of cultural heritage is a continuous civilizational legacy of perpetual transmission,” said Leong Wai Man.
"Today, in a new stage, we reaffirm our commitment to history and culture, guided by respect for the past and the valorization of heritage, reverence for history and love for culture. Based on the preservation of the historical and cultural roots of our world heritage, we will expand and streamline resources so that we can benefit society in general."
“We will strive to develop the singular role of the 'Historic Center of Macau' in promoting exchange and mutual knowledge at the international level, reinforcement and dissemination of Chinese culture abroad, building communication channels and sharing between different contemporary ethnic groups, to continue writing a new chapter of reciprocal permutations and learning between the Chinese and Western civilizations of Macau,” said the same responsible.
 
A “treasure” of humanity to continue to shine
The president of the IC also recalled the words of President XI Jinping, who praised Macau as "a bright pearl stuck on the banks of the Southern Sea of China" and a "precious part of the great homeland." He also appealed to the population to make efforts to protect a "cultural treasure that belongs to all humanity."
"We will guarantee that the essence of the dialogue between East and West, which is part of the Macao World Heritage, continues to shine and illuminate a future of peace and integration for all humanity," he concluded.
The celebrations at the Dom Pedro V Theater continued with a performance of the Chinese orchestra of Macao, which presented three songs, including an interpretation of the theme “Lisbon, Girl and Girl”. The occasion also served to launch the program “WORLD HERITAGE TOURS”. The event was also attended by the Secretary for Social Affairs and Culture, LAM.
In a response sent by the body to the Jornal Tribuna de Macao, the IC had already stressed that the inscription of the Historic Center allowed Macao to demonstrate to the world "its exceptional position and contribution to cultural exchange between China and the West, increasing their trust and cultural pride." He also stressed that over the two decades, "Macao cultural enterprises have recorded great progress." "World heritage has become an important resource for promoting cultural creation and innovation in all sectors and boosting diverse social development."
The feat also established "a solid base for the construction of Macao as" a base of exchange and cooperation for the promotion of multicultural coexistence, with a predominance of Chinese culture and a "World Center for Tourism and Leisure". The IC also acknowledged the “great support of the central government and the joint public efforts of the general public”, as well as the creation of the World Heritage safeguard law in 2013, and the Historic Center safeguard and management plan last year.
"The Government of MSAR always maintains an open attitude in the height of different opinions of all sectors of society, at the same time alarming the opinions and suggestions of the National Cultural Heritage Administration, the World Heritage Committee and professional protection institutions of World Heritage Protection, in order to do protection work well."
The body chaired by Leong Wai Man considers that "the revitalization of world heritage also fueled the spiritual and cultural life of residents, increasing the feeling of happiness in society and forming a consensus and public awareness of the protection of historical and cultural heritage."
The set of buildings that is now registered on the UNESCO list includes the Fortress of the Monte, the A-Má Temple, the Senate Largo and the Holy House of Mercy, the Dom Pedro V, the Ruins of São Paulo, the Temple of Na Tcha, the Sam Kai Vui Kun Temple, the House of Mandarin, the Sir Robert Ho Tang, the Library of Lilau, the Church of St. Lourenço, Casa Garden, the Fortress of the Guide, the Protestant Cemetery, the Church and Seminary of St. Joseph, the Church and the Largo de São Domingos, the House of Kou Kau and the Sé Church.</description><pubDate>2025-07-16 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>South Korea population may fall 85% in the next 100 years</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/lazer/populacao-da-coreia-sul-pode-cair-85-nos-proximos-100-anos/</link><description>South Korea's population could fall to only 15% of their current level by 2125 if the country's demographic decline remains unshakable, according to a private Think Tank in Seoul.
In its latest long -term forecasting, the Korean Peninsula of Population Institute for the future has used a method of cutting components to project South Korea demographic tendencies over the next century. This internationally recognized technique estimates future populations through the incorporation of factors such as birth rates, mortality rates and immigration standards.
In the institute's worst scenario, the population of South Korea could fall to 7.53 million to 2125 - a sharp drop from current 51.68 million. This would be lower than the current population of the city of Seoul, which is over 9.3 million.
Even in the most optimistic projection, the population would decrease to 15.73 million, or less than a third of its current size. The median projection places the population at 2125 at 11.15 million.
The report also highlights the accelerated pace of population decline. In the median scenario, the population would fall 30% by 2075 and then more than half in the subsequent 50 years.
This decline is not only due to the fall in birth rates, but also to a cumulative effect: with fewer people in each successive generation, the number of potential parents decreases, further accelerating the fall.
The South Korea demographic pyramid, which was once the shape of a “stingray” with a large young base base, should turn into a “snake” to 2125, with narrowing bands into all age groups and a strongly tilted population for older groups.
The aging crisis should also get worse. In 75 years, the worst forecast is that for every 100 people of active age - defined as aged 15 to 64 - there will be 140 elderly people with 65 or older.
Currently, 100 people of active age support about 30 elderly people, indicating that South Korea is on its way to becoming a “inverted pyramid” society, where the number of dependents widely exceeds the number of people who support.
The report also incorporates an analysis of social sentiment based on about 60,000 publications of the application of the Blind business community, focusing on people's opinions aged 20 to 40 about marriage and motherhood.
The conclusions revealed that younger generations now prioritize "money" and "housing" instead of "love" when they discuss the marriage. Financial charges have emerged consistently as the dominant concern in the conversations.
The report concluded that decisions about marriage and parenting are increasingly influenced by economic conditions rather than personal preferences.
The institute has proposed a series of urgent political orientations to face the crisis, such as the widening of support to reduce the weight of children's motherhood and education and the establishment of a practical culture of balance between professional and personal life. He also stressed the importance of increasing the age of reform and promoting continuity of employment, while reforming immigration policy.
Above all, the institute emphasized the need to restructure the economy around productivity, moving away from a system dependent on demographic growth.
The severe projections underline the urgent demographic challenge that South Korea faces, while debating with one of the lower birth rates in the world and the fastest population aging.
By 2024, South Korea's total fertility rate - the average number of children that a woman is expected to have throughout life - rose slightly to 0.75, but remains far below the replacement level of 2.1.
