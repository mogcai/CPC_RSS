The Portuguese School of Macao (EPM) will go into improvement works of some interior spaces, namely resorts, canteen and some classrooms. The works will be done mainly on the weekends, also taking advantage of the Easter vacation period, so that "there is no great disturbance for the normal functioning of the school," according to the Jornal Tribuna de Macao, the chairman of the EPM Foundation Board of Directors.
Jorge Neto Valente considers that the works, previously outlined, but there are days approved by deliberation at the EPM Foundation Board of Directors meeting, are urgent and “missing a lot”, adding that, for example, “the currently existing showers, which are nine, are expected to be double”. Benefits in the level of facilities in that interior space of the school will allow more students to bathe faster, after sports activities at the gym or in the game room.
Some of the improvement work will also take place during the week, with students in classes and the possibility of also having access to the canteen, “because they will not cause great noise,” says the leader.
Regarding the widening of some classrooms, Jorge Neto Valente acknowledges that there are very small rooms, since they were divided in half. "This is what we inherited, there was a bad management of the space, so we want to do these works," he says.
The leader of the FEPM Board of Directors clarified that the works have prior approval from education services, "which means they will be subsidized by them when there is survey and everything is able to start, and contacts have been made with their contractor." The EPM will thus enter a period of works in the interior, followed, later, more complicated and longer works outside the building.
"This phase of improvement is a delay of a year, but will finally be done," he told JTM Acácio de Brito, for whom the large work, already thought of the outside, is later, "being equally necessary", in a school that is already 26 years of existence, "so that we can make more efficient and effective."
Asked if there is already an estimate about the number of students for the school year 2025/2026, Acácio de Brito stressed that the school has no capacity to receive more students, and therefore the number should be maintained. This school year, EPM has 780 students.
 
Open Day dedicated to the community
For tomorrow's “open day”, between 9 am and 1 pm, the EPM director speaks of the targets that are intended to achieve. “We want to open our school to the community and make our mission, our program and our training, demonstrating that EPM has its own curriculum, a Portugal curriculum with adaptations to Macau, which gives students access to higher education, not only in the territory, but also from China, Portuguese universities and Portuguese -speaking universities, beyond European institutions,” he said.
All of this is the fruit, in the words of Acácio de Brito, the “location and recognition, based, not only in the Treaty of Bologna, but what has to do with the level of demand of the Portuguese curriculum itself”.
The EPM will show what it does throughout the academic year in the various departments, chemistry, physics, biology laboratories, as well as psychology and guidance services. "With this, we demonstrate that we have a student association, which we have a set of departments, whether of the first cycle, language, mathematics and sciences, expressions, social and human sciences," explains the director.
From the event's activities of tomorrow's event, highlighting a “most admittedly cultural session, which has to do with the program we have”, mentions Acácio de Brito. In the period between 10h00 and 10:30 am, an performance of the EPM Experimental Choir Group is scheduled.
 
Modern and quality school message
The Association of Parents and In charge of Education of EPM (APEP) will be represented on this open day and its president, Filipe Figueiredo, says that for several years that, with this initiative, the EPM "opens to the community". With regard to parents, the aim is that "those who have their children to study there, as well as those who intend to enroll them for the next school year, can know the work developed by the various departments."
For the APEP leader, the message that the school should pass is that “minister a modern quality education, adapted to the demands of the current world and who prepares the students who are enrolled there, study there, for their future life and the continuation of studies in universities”.
One of the initiatives carried out every year by APEP is to make known the program of exchange and supply of uniforms and school manuals used. "We have been doing this, always at the beginning of the school year and at this time of open day of the school, making known mainly to parents who do not know of their existence, providing the collection of uniforms and books for reuse, since many of them are still in good condition to be used by students to whom they are missing, thus avoiding their purchase," says Filipe Figueiredo.
As for the next school year, the APEP official stressed that "the pre-registration has not yet been done," but considered that the number of students "should not be much different from the current year."
Filipe Figueiredo recalls that there has been a vacancy in recent years of the high school students who decided not to finish the secondary in the EPM and have completed it in Portugal-because of the curriculum changes and adaptation of the school's curriculum with Portugal and the direction of education and development services. “I think this vacancy is over,” so the number of students stabilized and should remain to 2025/2026, he reiterated.
 
20% of parents are against the prohibition of the mobile phone
In the school's day-to-day issues, the APEP president told the Jornal Tribuna de Macao that just over 70% of parents responded to the investigation into the possibility of preventing students from using their mobile phones at the facilities of the school. "The response of parents and in charge of education was smaller than expected," said Filipe Figueiredo, adding that about 20% spoke out against the measure. "This will be analyzed and then the school will make its decision," he said.
Regarding the situation of the lack of teachers, which affected some subjects in the first months of the school year that runs, the leader confirms that “everything is quiet, with all disciplines operating in normality”.
Filipe Figueiredo, who occupies the place of leading responsible for the Association's board for over six years, after having been in the General Assembly, says the elections for the new term of APEP managers, will take place next October, and there is no moving on lists. "I would like there to be a renewal and that I could continue in the association without being president, as is my intention, already manifested several times, but we will see if this is possible," he concluded.</description><pubDate>2025-02-28 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Computer crime rose 71.6%</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/criminalidade-informatica-subiu-716/</link><description>Increased computer crimes and burlans boosted crime growth in Macau throughout 2024, Secretary for Security, Wong Sio Chak, said yesterday. It should be noted that violent crimes also recorded an increase, like the crimes committed by minors

Crime grew 6%in Macao last year to 14,298 cases, most of which against heritage (61.4%), followed by crimes against the person (16.1%) and crimes not classified elsewhere (15.3%). This increase was driven by the climb of computer crimes and the burlas, according to data revealed yesterday by the Secretary for Security, Wong Sio Chak.
Computer crimes were 992, an increase of 71.6% in annual terms (+414 cases). Within this type of crime, the computer scam represented 78% of the total cases (777), most of which were related to “online purchases with credit cards” (689 cases). In this context, there were also cases of “illegitimate access to the computer system” (113 cases) and “computing falsification” (80), among others.
Burla crimes, in turn, grew 12.2% to 2,800 cases. In concrete, there were 932 crimes of “computing donkey or through the internet” (33% of the total), including “ticket selling” (243 cases), “online purchases” (98), “throws involving investments” (83), “money exchange” (41), “pornographic services” (32) and “online dating” (25).
Among the nearly three thousand cases of slopping included 448 of “change of money outside the casino”, 355 of “telephone scam”, 333 of “burla in casinos”, 110 of “Burla under the pretext of support for employment/documentation request”, among others.
Also in the field of crimes against heritage, it is worth mentioning the rise of 110.3% in the crimes of “usury” to a total of 265. The cases of "theft" (29.7% to 48 cases), "illegitimate" (2% to 2,023), "theft" (0.9% to 2,001) and "a portioner" (0.9% to 412 cases) were highlighted.
Violent crime also gave signs of growth-290 cases were reported by 2024, the equivalent of a 7.4% increase compared to the previous year. “Kidnappings” there were 61, an increase of 48.8%, while “thefts” and “violations” were 48 in both cases, with increases of 29.7%and 17.1%, respectively. There were also five cases of “severe offense to physical integrity”, four of “severe coercion”, three “other crimes against life” and a case of “other especially dangerous conduct”. In reverse, the crime of “child sexual abuse” decreased, but still 22 cases were reported.
Increased crime in the territory, Wong Sio Chak indicated, was also influenced by the entry into force in October of the illicit play crimes, with the typification of the crime 'exploitation of illicit exchange exchange rate', "for which the police reported a total of 89 cases." This new legislation, as well as the gradual increase of tourists and the recovery of tourism and game sectors, after the pandemic, “led to an inevitable climb of the number of crimes linked to the game,” reads the report yesterday released.
Still in the game-related crimes, there were 137 “illicit game”, an increase of 389.3%. The previous year, only 28 cases related to this type of crime had been verified.
In this sense, the authorities indicated the opening of 1,456 inquiries for game -related crimes, an increase in annual terms of 349 cases, ie 31.5%. They noted, however, that, compared to 2019, the number was “remarkably inferior” -701, ie a drop of 32.5% -“which demonstrates that the work of preventing and combating specific crime” has been resulting and “exercising deterrent effects on criminal potential”.
 
More cases of youth delinquency
The crimes starred by minors with 15 or less years in the territory have also increased throughout the year. According to data released yesterday by the Security Folder, this type of cases totaled 131, an increase of 21.3% compared to the 108 registered in 2023.
Of the total, only 10 were sent to the Public Prosecution Service (MP), an annual descent, as the previous year had been sent to that body 15 cases. It means that in 2024, a total of 121 cases related to crimes of minors were not referred to the MP, an increase in 2023, the year in which 93 had not been dispatched.
In these cases, 181 young offenders (+19.9% ​​in annual terms) of which 141 were boys were involved. In addition, according to data released by Wong Sio Chak's tutelage, there were 73 minors offended in these cases (+18 compared to 2023), of which 31 were boys.
Among the crimes committed by minors in 2024, seven of “sexual abuse of children”, 66 of “offense to simple physical integrity”, 13 of “theft”, seven of “damage”, one of “falsification of document”, one of “set fire”.
 
Discarded homicide in the case of the man found dead in the settled fraction
The Judicial Police (PJ) ruled out the hypothesis of murder in the case of a man who was found dead in a flame apartment in the Lok Kuan building in Seac Pai Van. When he was found, the man, a 61 -year -old resident, was already "totally burned." According to PJ, the man was in a chair, his feet tied up, and the house's door was prevented with a closet. For this reason, the firefighters had to open the door using tools and only then managed to extinguish the fire. Authorities indicated that the victim "suffered from mental problems" and had a "self-mutilation." He lived in that fraction where he died with family members, who in recent days were not at home. It was accompanied by staff of social services and the day he died was visited by these assistants, who asked the police for help for considering that the resident was in an “abnormal” state. Sublishes of physical confrontation and theft were discarded and no suspicious injuries were detected. Faced with the case, the Secretary for Security stressed that the authorities take “very strict” procedures in relation to all cases and ensured that they have maintained communication with PJ “on the details and evidence of the entire investigation process”. In addition, Wong Sio Chak stated that the analysis of the evidence is supervised by the judicial body. Pointing out that the case involves “personal privacy, including diseases and family situation”, most details cannot be revealed. Following the case, the Institute of Social Action expressed “enormous grief for the incident”, saying that it will “provide the necessary assistance to the deceased's family. Health services appeal to those who are distressed to call the open line “Life of Caritas” (28525222) for counseling.

Thailand Market will be studied ‘In Loco’
Galaxy Entertainment will send a team to Thailand to study the country's potential in the game sector, including the “best places” for the operation of a casino resort, the group president, who has already opened a Bangkok representation office, revealed yesterday. “We are conducting studies at this time” about Thailand, Francis Liu said, quoted by the Ggraia portal, assuming that Galaxy is “very optimistic” about the perspectives of this market. Considering that this is an attractive destination, due to “sympathy, beautiful waters, great kitchen and great service”, Liu anticipated that Thailand could “be very effective” in the resort industry with casinos. "We hope the law will be passed later this year and then we can start working," he added. It is recalled that the State Council of Thailand has recently proposed strict entry requirements for local casinos gamblers, which can undermine investors' interest. Under the proposal, Thai must have at least 50 million bahts (nearly 12 million patacas) in fixed deposits for at least six months to access the casinos, as well as paying an entry rate of 5,000 bahts (1,200 patacas). The proposal, which is being the target of new public auscultation, will have to receive new government “green light” before being sent to Parliament.</description><pubDate>2025-02-28 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>DIQUE IN COLAANE generates fears on future protected animals</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/dique-em-coloane-gera-receios-sobre-futuro-de-animais-protegidos/</link><description>The construction of a flood prevention dike on the west side of Coloane is arousing doubts between environmentalists, around the evaluation of the environmental impact and the consequences of the project in the animals that inhabit that maritime area. In concrete, they talk about Chinese white dolphins, black-charges and otters
 
It will soon start the construction of a flood prevention dike, about 1,200 meters long, in the marginal zone on the west of Coloane. The work motivated Vienna Mak, vice president of the Hong Kong Dolphin Conservation Society, specifically regarding the impact that the project may have on Chinese white dolphins.
According to said, these mammals have the maritime area where this work will be held as "one of the important habitats." The environmentalist even indicated that sometimes Chinese white dolphins can be seen to enter the Shizimen channel to look for food.
In addition, quoted by the newspaper “Cheng Pou”, Viena Mak warned that the south side of the contract area is “very close” to the border of the specially delimited special zone by the Government of MSAR. In this sense, it considers that it is necessary for the authorities to perform the evaluation of the environmental impact (AIA) and disclose the respective report.
The Jornal Tribuna de Macau tried to know, with the Directorate of Environmental Protection Services (DSPA) and public works services if an AIA had already been done in relation to the work in question, and if so, what were the results, however, did not get answers until the closing of this edition.
From the perspective of Vienna Mak, this work must also be subject to AIA because the “list of types of projects subject to AIA”, prepared by DSPA, requires that all construction projects that imply the use of the maritime area are the target of AIA, a requirement that is also provided for in the AIA Management list approved by the Ministry of Ecology and Environment of China.
The associative leader suggested that the MSAR authorities refer to Hong Kong's approach to requiring AIA for breaking construction works with more than one kilometer long or extending to the tidal washing pipe, exceeding 30%tube width.
For its part, Kwan Hok In, Manager of the “Chief of Macau Ecology” page, warned that the area of ​​this work on the west side of Coloane overlaps, in varying degrees, the scope of "many types" of animals protected at national levels, black-and-black dollers and Chinese white dolphins.
Based on an ecological investigation by an environmental protection entity from Zhuhai, which points to the stable existence of a group of euro-Asian otters between the south and southeastern Hengqin Island, Kwan estimated that before entering the Shizimen channel looking for food, otters should swim through the maritime area where the work in question will be done or practice activities directly in the work area.
As for the dolphins and harvesters, the environmentalist noted that these animals also live in the maritime area and tide plains related to the work against floods.
In addition, the manager of the “Chief of Macau Ecology” page predicted that, as the proposal of the work involves the construction of dike and landscape lake, would modify the direction of water flow on the coast, which would cause this area to be influenced by tides and that the "rich beings and ecosystems" on the coast suffer a "complete destruction".
The environmentalist questioned whether, in AIA, they had been specifically investigated the impacts of the work on biotic factors, abiotics and various wildlife protected at national level.</description><pubDate>2025-02-28 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>National Games know enclosures and mascot represents a dolphin</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/jogos-nacionais-conhecem-recintos-mascote-representa-um-golfinho/</link><description>The Macao Zone Organizing Committee of the National Games and the Special Olympic Games for Disabled has already determined the places where the modalities will be held, scattered throughout the Macao Peninsula and the Cotai Zone.

The two mascots, with the names of Xiyangyang and Lerongrong, who symbolize joy, harmony and union, are based on Chinese white dolphin, a nationwide protected wildlife, also known as the “National Sea Treasury”.
The emblem is an image that portrays the moment of the explosion of fire-to-art through a spiral formed by the overlap of three rods of petals from the flowers of Kapok, Bauínia and Lotus.
The logo was conceived as a symbol meaning the interconnection and infinite vitality of the great Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Bay, “always supported by the homeland and projecting to the world,” as the competition organizing committee says.
As for the slogans, or games of the games, were chosen the phrases “thrilling national games”, “great vibrant bay” and “dreams in the great bay, ways for a splendid life”.
The Secretary for Social Affairs and Culture, LAM, spoke during the press conference, and said that the organization of the event in Macao shows "the support that the country gives to masters." From the ruler's perspective, national games have a "very deep" meaning for the development of the cause of sport and the socio-economic development of MSAR.
LAM said, on the other hand, that the success of the Macau competition will also be “an excellent promotion of local sport”.
Canton was the city chosen for the opening ceremony of the National Games of the Popular Republic of China, while Shenzhen will receive the closing show. This is the first time in the history of the competition that regions and cities of the Great Bay, specifically Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau co-organize the event.
The National Games of the Popular Republic of China have been held since 1959, so 66 years ago, with many of the main athletes in the country, some of which are Olympic sportsmen who contributed medals. Earlier, between 1910, launched during the Qing Dynasty, and 1948 the competition had the designation of Chinese national games. The current race is played every four years and the last edition was in the city of Shaanxi in 2021 after Tianjin in 2017.

For a few years and at the intervals of these national games, China organized the all-china games between 2000 and 2010, but in this case intended for modalities that do not usually part of the Olympic Games program.</description><pubDate>2025-02-28 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Psychological support requests decreased in the game sector</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/pedidos-de-apoio-psicologico-diminuiram-sector-jogo/</link><description>The Game Industry Workers House dealt with 229 requests for help last year, including 143 new cases. More than 66% of requests are related to “work and job search”. On the other hand, they registered breaks on requests motivated by “psychological emotions” and “game disorder”, the association said
 
Last year, the Game Industry Workers House dealt with 229 help requests, of which 143 were new cases dealt with by the association. According to data released, more than 66% of requests were included in the category of “work and job search”, 15% were motivated by “psychological emotions” and about 6.3% were related to the “game disorder”.
Quoted by the Chinese language press, Pak Kin Pong, director of the Game Workers House Integrated Services Center, stressed that the number of new cases linked to the disorder of the sector workers' game has been falling, and the association received only four requests for help in this context. At the same time, requests for support were also reduced due to emotional or psychological problems, with the association accounting for only 20 by 2024.
In total, the center provided 1,284 advice services to such 229 cases, including in -person retaining, through telephone call or via Wechat. Regarding the new cases, workers asked for help mainly due to “work and job search”. Moreover, the cases implied “psychological emotions”, “request for public resources for social benefits”, “game disorder”, “family and parental relations” and “crisis management”.
According to Pak Kin Pong, most workers in the game are optimistic about the industry. However, the center has received many complaints from sector workers on the accentuated physical and mental burden due to the replacement of electronic equipment, increasing client volume and tightening disciplinary management. For the director of the Center, although these phenomena have not yet caused serious psychological problems in the game workers, the situation should be carefully followed.
On the other hand, the House of Game Industry Workers stressed that in the future will extend the support in the scope of the game responsible for residents who do not work in the sector and tourists. One of the planned actions is the launch, in the middle of this year, a reference manual for the public reading to know how to support people affected by the game, with the aim of increasing the motivation of affected individuals to request help, thus reducing the negative impact of the game disorder on residents and tourists.</description><pubDate>2025-02-28 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>IC wants to “raise” level of “intelligence” of libraries</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/ic-quer-elevar-nivel-de-inteligencia-das-bibliotecas/</link><description>Using Internet of Things, Big Data and Artificial Intelligence to improve the services of public libraries is one of the objectives of the Cultural Institute for the next time.

The Cultural Institute (IC) is betting on "continuing to optimize facilities and library services, striving to raise the level of intelligence of libraries." The goal, says Leong Wai Man in response to a written Ho Ion Sang interplies, is to provide readers "more convenient and efficient services, as well as a personalized and intelligent use experience" and thus "attract much more people to use library services."
In concrete, "IC public libraries will use the Internet of Things, Big Data and Artificial Intelligence, among other emerging technologies, to promote the development and implementation of intelligent libraries, continually enrich collections resources and further optimize the distribution of libraries in neighborhoods." Through these technologies, the body also aims to verify the opening hours of these spaces “in the sense of satisfying the needs of the different groups of readers”.
In 2023, and according to the statistical yearbook, the territory had 71 libraries and reading rooms also less than those existing in 2022 (72) and 2021 (76). They were able to welcome 8,897 people. The staff at the service of these spaces totaled 306, also less than in the previous two years, 310 and 316, respectively. The 2024 data is not yet available.
Leong Wai Man underlines, in response to the deputy, that the IC has been promoting the generalization of reading in community neighborhoods, periodically organizing cultural and creative activities, book fairs and reading sessions, among others. "To continue to extend the scope of community participation in reading, public libraries will continue to organize diverse reading promotion activities, together with schools, bookstores, associations and companies, with a view to strengthening the effect of dissemination, generalization of reading and stimulating more in -depth reading culture," he says.
On the other hand, the president of the IC continues, public libraries have constantly proceeding to digitize the “precious old books of their collection”, as well as the continued launch of the “collection of precious electronic books of ancient books”. These two bets allow the public to have “faster access to important cultural heritage” and that “precious Chinese old books and documents” can be provided to Chinese and foreign scholars for research purposes, reinforcing the transmission of traditional Chinese culture.
It is also said that public libraries give “great importance” to the exploitation of existing resources and conceive of diverse activities with the aim of promoting Chinese culture, intended for different social groups, such as exhibitions, interactive activities, workshops, guided visits.
“In the future, the Government of Mand will strive to provide services from the most convenient and humanized libraries, the creation of a more abundant reading experience, the elevation of the social reading environment for the entire population and in construction, together with the various social sectors, of a 'reading city' full of books,” says Leong Wai Man.
It is recalled that, according to the “Macao Public Libraries Inquiry-2024”, the general satisfaction of respondents obtained an average ranking of about 4 points (the maximum score is 5 points), and about 80% were satisfied or very satisfied, “having this result demonstrated that the services provided by public libraries are widely recognized”. The study also revealed that, when it comes to reading habits, about 80% said they had book reading experience last year, "which reflects that the Macao audience has a relatively high participation in reading."</description><pubDate>2025-02-28 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>UPM students win Asian festival music contest</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/alunos-da-upm-vencem-concurso-de-musica-de-festival-asiatico/</link><description>Zong Xiaohuan and You Xirui, students of the Music Degree Course (Specialization Area: Music Interpretation) of the Faculty of Arts and Design of the Macao Polytechnic University (UPM), won the 1st and 2nd places, respectively, in the “Open Category of Classical Vocal” of the Asia Student Art Festival 2025.

Sam Hou Fai said to some that "the time has not yet come for this to happen" and others that "you have to wait." Both the ATFPM and the Federation of Public Service Associations will have come out with some “bitter of mouth” from yesterday's meetings, although they maintain expectations about what may result from the lines of government action. The president of ATFPM, José Pereira Coutinho, also addressed the revitalization of the economy, considering that “it is in trace” and therefore understands that concrete measures are necessary to re -law, asking for the return of the consumer card of 10,000 patacas and the increase in cash reimbursement to 15,000. The Federation of Associations suggested increasing the antiquity award and the creation of a mechanism that allows intercharges promotion

Two associations linked to civil servants were yesterday afternoon at the Government headquarters to present suggestions and opinions to the Chief Executive, as part of the preparation of the Governing Action Lines (LAG). The leaders of the Macao Public Function Association (ATFPM) and the Federation of Macao Public Function Associations led to Sam Hou Fai several questions that would like to see, according to the priorities of their associates.
The salary increase and career revision were topics that aroused greater expectation. At the end of the respective meetings, the leaders of the two associative groups were unattified, even with some "bitter of mouth", because they have given them that this year civil servants will not see their remuneration improved.
Speaking to journalists at the end of the meeting, the president of ATFPM said that the chief executive used the phrase "we have to wait." Despite insisting on the story, José Pereira Coutinho said he did not get a concrete response, so he will wait to see what will happen in LAG, "because the government is also auscultation other associations, which are perhaps against wage update and we do not know what others think."
In turn, in a more direct way, the Federation of Macao Public Function Associations heard from Sam Hou Fai that “the time has not yet come to increase the salaries of civil servants”, and the concrete situation will be announced in LAG, that is, probably the announcement that there will be no adjustments to remuneration.
Pang Kung Ham said that the Chief Executive took into account the costs in various aspects and strict needs expenses, and has come to the conclusion that it has not yet reached the salaries of civil servants. And when this moment comes, it will consider this question scrupulously, the associative leader added.
The same leader said that the association he directs suggested an increase in the salary index of civil servants of three Patacas. Pereira Coutinho also defends an adjustment in the value per point of the remuneration index from 94 to 97 patacas in 2025.
 
Measures measures to improve the economy
In other aspects that involve the life of the general population and the improvement of the economy of Macau, which Pereira Coutinho considered to be “tracks”, the ATFPM proposed increases in birth allowance to 20,000 patacas, the subsidy for the elderly to 10,000 and the pension for the same people over 65 years to 4,500 patacas, as well as the value of pecuniary to 15,000 Patacas.
José Pereira Coutinho and Rita Santos also spoke to journalists, who waited abroad from the government's headquarters at the end of the meeting, about the need to be “respected the Portuguese language”, claiming to be “inadmissible that, if there is a decree-law that allows the citizens of Macau when addressing a certain service, he is not obliged to respond in the language in which the user went”.
Regarding other suggestions made by the Federation of Public Office Associations, the president of the Board said that Sam Hou Fai expressed the intention to study the possibility of increasing the seniority award, being in accordance with the proposal to create a mechanism that allows the promotion of employees, promising that it will actively implement this idea.
The association has given the government a total of 15 suggestions involving the remuneration and benefits of civil servants. Pang Kung has pointed out that the association is also aware of the issue of imbalances in employees of employees in public services and the situation of career rise.
The Federation also proposed the creation of a career promotion mechanism exclusively for macao civil servants working in the in -depth cooperation zone, considering that this regime must be connected to that of Macao.
 
Suggested “optimization”
pecuniary reimbursement
The Federation of Macao Workers Associations (Faom), in turn, suggested to the Chief Executive to increase “properly” pecuniary reimbursement, and that it is also “optimized”, says an official note, without referring details on the subject. In recent times, it should be noted, several deputies and associative leaders have argued that the government must review the rules associated with the distribution of the pecuniary check, considering that residents who are abroad should not receive this support.
On the other hand, the president of Faom Board Lee Chong Cheng said Sam Hou Fai had a “positive reaction” compared to the 18 suggestions given by the association. He even stated that he will study the increase in the pension for the elderly, the education allowance, caregivers' allowance and childhood subsidy, as well as to launch measures to encourage birth.
At the LAG meeting, Faom also requested that the legal regime of labor rights and the normative system on national security will be continuously improved. It also argued that it is necessary to continue to support Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), to improve the system and employment service mechanism and employment policies for young people.
The General Association of Women, in turn, insisted on launching birth incentive measures and improving families favorable measures. In concrete, he asked to increase financial support to encourage birth.
The president of the Board of the Friendship Association of members of the Chinese people's Political Conference in the instance of Macao province, Loi Lun Mio, recommended that the executive “continue to improve inclusive preferential measures to consumers and monetary reimbursement policies to encourage and attract residents consumption in Macau and boost sustainable development of the local economy”. In the replica, the leader of MSAR said that it will continue to insist on diversification of the economy and argued that Macao "must create more cultural and characteristic districts, [as well as] boosting the construction of more cultural and tourist spaces integrated with local characteristics."
Sam Hou Fai reiterated, on the other hand, in a meeting with the Macao Fukien General Association of Fukien countrymen and the Macao's institution alliance, that "Macau is inevitable to suffer the influence of the world's economic changes, and while many sectors are looking for innovation, they also face competitive pressure and challenges." In this sense, he pointed out that the government has been maintained “attentive to risks, adopting a macro perspective to make detailed improvements in the process of policy and measures, with the purpose of responding pragmatically to the demands of all sectors of society”.</description><pubDate>2025-02-27 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Exports under the strain "fired" in recent months</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/exportacoes-ao-abrigo-cepa-dispararam-nos-ultimos-meses/</link><description>Olympus Digital Camera



Once they went down almost 40% by 2023, exports of freight of the customs exempt from customs rates in mainland China grew 12.8% to about 80 million patacas last year, due to a strong recovery in the second semester, according to official data. On the other hand, in the last two years 15 new Macao service provider certificates have been issued at the scope, raising the total to 884

The value of Macao goods exports that benefited from exemption from customs rates in the interior of China ascended to about 79.82 million patacas in 2024, translating an increase of 12.8% over 70.78 million the previous year, according to data from the Directorate of Economics and Technological Development Services (DSEDT). Although they remained distant from the record of 115.3 million reached in 2022, the year in which they rose 10.2%, exports under the scope of economic and commercial relations between the interior of China and Macao (strain) contradicted the annual break of 38.5% recorded in 2023.
The final result of 2024 was essentially driven by the business completed in the second half. According to DSEDT data, exports with the “seal” of the strain fell 13.4% to 28.04 million patacas between January and June, in homologous terms, however, increased 34.9% to 51.78 million in the second half of last year.
After having suffered homologous breaks between 5% and 85.6% in the first four months of 2024, the volumes of these exports grew 173.6% in May (to 6.62 million), 61.7% in June (6.75 million), 71.1% in July (7.45 million) and 27.8% in August, which was the busiest month with 13.80 million. In September there was a homologous descent from 27.4%to 4.81 million, however, the numbers returned to “shoot” in the remaining months of the year: 7.46 million in October (plus 32%), 8.03 million in November (plus 50.2%) and 10.23 million in December (plus 82.3%).
The beginning of 2025 was again promising, with January marking a 58.3% homologous increase to almost 6.70 million.
In addition to the 2022 record, strain -related exports advanced 32.6% to 104.65 million in 2021, interrupting two years of decline, specifically 6.9% in 2019 (89.1 million) and 11.5% in 2020 (78.9 million).
Since January 1, 2004, the date of the implementation of the commerce of goods in the strain staff, the accumulated amount of exports with customs rights has exceeded 1.5 billion patacas.
Despite the increase in business value, only 15 more macao service provider certificates were issued within the last two years, including eight in 2024. According to DSEDT, at the end of December there were 884 Macao service provider certificates, especially the medical and dental services (340) and the transportation sector (including charging, logistics, conservation and storage) 309, which represented about 38.5% and 35% of the total, respectively.
The list of certificates also includes the conventions and exhibitions (41), real estate (33), travel agencies and tourist operators (26), bank activity and other financial services, excluding insurers (24), construction and engineering (13), retail trade (nine), research and development in natural sciences (two) and “other” unspecified services (71).
It is recalled that the Macao Service Sector will benefit from another CEPA expansion from March 1st. With the new agreement, made official in October 2024, the requirement of at least three years of the exercise of substantial commercial activity for MSC service providers in most sectors will be deleted. The two parties also announced their intention to implement pilot measures to support MSAR Capital companies registered in the Great Bay to choose Hong Kong or Macau as a place of refereeing, and reinforced liberalization in the “state, financial, and cultural technology services sectors”, in order to support Macau's “1+4” economic diversification strategy.
Among the changes to Cepa II there is also the revocation of the requirement of five years of exercise of substantial commercial activity for Macao banks, as well as the restriction on total assets at the end of the year of foreign financial institutions for their social participation in insurers. In addition, the limit of the percentage of the capital of Macao companies will be abolished in providing internet data centers services in pilot zones.
In audiovisual and cultural branches, MSar companies can invest in film production. Already soap operas co-produced with entities in the interior of China can be considered as national productions for emission and distribution purposes.</description><pubDate>2025-02-27 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>IC suspends team filming license involved in accident</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/ic-suspende-licenca-de-filmagem-de-equipa-envolvida-em-acidente/</link><description>The team license of the team involved in an accident on Seminar Street was suspended, the Cultural Institute announced, pointing out that the project is suspected of "causing obvious disorders to public order, security or tranquility."

The Cultural Institute (IC) issued a notice of suspension of the team's filming license that was involved in a road accident that caused 12 minor injuries on Rua do Seminar, considering that the group “did not meet the requirements” during the shooting. "At this time, the entity cannot carry out the project filming activities in Macao and, later, the IC will require the filming entity to deliver a report to explain [the succeeding], not excluding the revocation of the filming authorization warning," says the body led by Leong Wai Man.
After the accident, the IC organized a meeting with CPSP, the Directorate of Services for Traffic Affairs, the Institute for Municipal Affairs and the Directing of Services for Labor Affairs, after which the body decided to suspend the filming license. This is because, the IC explains, "this project was suspected of causing obvious disorders to public order, safety or tranquility."
For this reason, the entity cannot, at this moment, “perform the filming activities of the project in Macao”, reiterated. As for damages caused to public facilities, “the competent services will follow the case,” said the IC.
The day before yesterday, the CPSP had already said that the safe driving requirements were “not followed” by the filming team, recalling that at the interdepartal meeting prior to filming the police manifested “clearly against the filming mode proposed by the team”, since the place in question is a very narrow street and there is a sharp curve.
This has also recalled the IC, the body to which it is responsible for enjoying and authorizing the filming license requests regarding the production and making of film films, documentaries or advertisers in Macao. In concrete, he explained that the content of the script is analyzed, and when the projects imply “relatively high techniques” or involve “the functional authority of other services”, interdepartal meetings are held for follow -up.
The content of the filming, which caused an accident, was “complex”, admits the IC, noting that at the meeting with the other services, they “expressly expressed” that the place could not afford to the intended type of shoot, and representatives of the filming entity “learned of opinions”.
Moreover, the IC states that, in relation to filming projects in the territory, it has maintained narrow communication with various public services, appreciating and approving requests according to their own functions. He also assured that "it will continue to collect the opinions and suggestions of public services in the approval of filming projects and to provide appreciation guidelines so that the requesting entities can know and ensure that filming projects in Macau are successfully carried out."
Remember that the 12 minor injuries, including four children, were all extras in the movie and were resting on the sidewalk of Francisco António, when the car lost control and entered the alley.</description><pubDate>2025-02-27 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Asian cuisine “conquers” the great Portuguese chefs</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/lazer/cozinha-asiatica-conquista-os-grandes-chefs-portugueses/</link><description>Asian cuisine has been gaining adherents among the great chefs of Portugal, at a time when high Portuguese kitchen is breaking the barriers of traditional food, crossing a phase of diversification. The expansion is particularly notorious in the cities of Lisbon and Porto and is part of a context of increasing the number of haute cuisine restaurants in these regions.
These were the main gastronomic trends of Portugal highlighted to the EFE agency by a source from Michelin, which annually publishes prominent restaurants in the world. The source described the variety of styles in the Portuguese scenario as “impressive”, including vegetarian, Japanese, contemporary French, and modern Portuguese options.
The phenomenon occurs at a time when several renowned chefs are expanding the offer with the opening of second restaurants, "reflecting a clear diversification in the country's cooking supply," the same source added.
In southern Portugal, international influences predominate, while in the north there is a greater trend for traditional cuisine. This ecosystem is composed of international renowned figures and a new generation of national chefs, which are jointly raising the gastronomic level in Portugal, stressed the source.
Despite the different styles, the defense of local products remains a common factor, “a fundamental pillar” of Portuguese cuisine, and a means used by chefs to be as sustainable as possible, besides betting on local wines.
In most restaurants, Portuguese chefs also continue to opt for “à la carte” menus, unlike the trend of other countries to offer a single tasting menu in their establishments.
In 2024, Portuguese cuisine finally won its own Michelin guide, when the French company presented the country as a “unmissable destination” and in a separate edition of Spanish for the first time in its more than 100 years of history.
Portugal welcomed the second edition of the guide on Tuesday, adding eight new restaurants to the list of Michelin stars. In total, they are now 38, spread throughout the entire Portuguese territory.
The eight restaurants with two stars to date kept their distinctions. The French company has not yet attributed three stars to any Portuguese establishment.
In addition to the Michelin guide, 13 Portuguese chefs were recognized with Cuchillos in the 2024 The Best Chef Awards.
In turn, the “Taste Atlas” platform, which brings together gastronomic evaluations from around the world, indicates in its ranking that Portuguese cuisine is the fifth best in the world. In another list of the 100 best dishes in the world, includes four Portuguese options.
Portuguese chef João Pedro Coelho won the “Golden Chef” prize of Switzerland in 2025, while the Lisbon restaurant “Forno d'Oro” was included in the “50 Top Pizza Europe 2024” list. His boss, Nepalese Tanka Sapkota, also made headlines that same year when he announced that Portugal had his own summer truffle.
