However, he warned that operational pressure from SMEs in residential areas could “remain significant” and the business environment in community neighborhoods could potentially face “profound and complex changes.”
 
After “comprehensive analysis and calculations”, the Macau Economic Association projected that the Macao SAR’s economic outlook index will reach between 6.1 and 6.3 points, on a scale of zero to 10, in the first quarter of this year. This means that the performance of the local economy may show a trend of “continued stability” in general. Last quarter, the index was between 6.2 and 6.4 points.
Over the current year, the association believes that the supporting conditions and the basic trend of “stability with improvement” will not change, with the Macao SAR economy continuing to be mainly driven by the integrated tourism and leisure industry.
However, he warned that, with economic and social changes and general unbalanced development, the business environment in Macau's community neighborhoods will face “profound and complex changes”. Therefore, the economy in general will present a scenario of “coexistence of cold and heat”, with “the operational pressure of small and medium-sized companies (SMEs) in residential areas remaining significant”.
On the positive side, the Economic Association predicted that as the authorities implement the Governing Action Lines for 2026, the volume of promotional activities for Macau's leisure tourism market will increase, leisure tourism products will become increasingly abundant and visitors to the territory will tend to diversify.
For the association, with the boost from the aforementioned factors, the integrated tourism and leisure industry “will maintain its relatively strong resilience”, registering growth in general terms. However, he also predicted that the growth rate of this sector could slow down in the 1st quarter.
On the other hand, he predicted that the peak in tourist flow during the Lunar New Year and other holidays will provide direct support for the number of visitors, the hotel occupancy rate and gross gaming revenue, thus contributing to consolidating the foundations of the local economic outlook.
Regarding the last two months of last year, the association concluded that the Macao SAR economy “functioned in a generally stable manner”, with the number of visitors, the volume of hotel guests and the hotel occupancy rate remaining at a “relatively strong” or “very strong” level. With regard to the human resources market, he pointed to a “solid performance”, highlighting that the unemployment rate in general stood at 1.7%, “a low level”, “which reflects that the demand for labor was still quite strong”.
On the other hand, he described, in the context of “operational pressure on SMEs and the slow growth of resident income”, companies and families have become “more conservative” in making decisions in relation to consumption and investment. Furthermore, the association noted that the consumer confidence index in Mainland China remained at a “low” level and investors expressed a “prudent attitude” regarding Macau’s economic outlook in the medium term.</description><pubDate>2026-01-16 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Promised “assistance” to ‘shuttles’ from housing complexes</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/prometida-assistencia-shuttles-de-complexos-habitacionais/</link><description>The Government understands that the travel agency activity law “should not deviate from the sphere of tourism”, meaning that agencies are “prohibited” from operating transport services. However, with regard to shuttles in housing complexes, such as “One Oasis” or “Ocean Gardens”, the Executive promises to encourage the two public bus companies to mobilize staff and vehicles from their “non-operational fleet”.

Housing complexes may be left without shuttle services from February 1st if solutions are not found to transport their residents. This is because the legislation explicitly stipulates that reception and transit services provided by travel agencies must have a “tourist nature”.
During the process of reviewing the new legislation, it was decided, “after in-depth deliberation”, to maintain this fundamental principle: the main activity of travel agencies should not deviate from the sphere of tourism.
Consequently, either under current legislation or under the new diploma, the provision of daily bus transport services to residents of residential neighborhoods does not constitute an “activity of a tourist nature” nor does it constitute specific circumstances permitted by law. Therefore, “travel agencies are prohibited from operating such services”, as can be seen in a joint statement from the Directorates of Tourism Services (DST) and Traffic Affairs (DSAT).
The two bodies clarify that “to accommodate the development needs of travel agencies, the new law appropriately expands the scope of permitted services, explicitly authorizing agencies to provide services for specific purposes, including religious, charitable, cultural, academic activities and the performance of functions by public sector entities”.
With regard to issues related to transport buses in residential complexes, DST reveals that the Government “proactively intervened through interdepartmental collaboration to provide assistance”. This includes pushing the two public bus companies to mobilize staff and vehicles from their “non-operational fleet” to rent vehicles for transport services. The objective, he emphasizes, “is to satisfy the diverse transport needs of the community”.
On the other hand, it intends to require “bus companies to intensify inspections and monitoring of bus route operations, with timely increases in service frequency to divert passenger flows, as well as promoting engagement with the condominium management sector to monitor the evolution of bus services in relevant neighborhoods and collect feedback and suggestions from the sector”.
Furthermore, neighborhoods and companies “can purchase vehicles suitable for transport purposes, as long as they meet legal requirements”.
As a regulatory authority, DST emphasizes that it has “consistently” supervised the operations of travel agencies in accordance with the law, adding that, “when non-compliant services are identified, the necessary procedures are initiated”.
As revealed, between 2015 and 2025, more than 140 cases were filed against travel agencies for violating the provisions on the use of vehicles, including the unauthorized provision of tourist buses as vehicles for employees or transport services to residential neighborhoods.
DST says it maintains close communication with the travel agency sector, having carried out legal awareness campaigns on the new legislation, including the scope of travel agency operations. The objective is to “improve understanding and compliance with the law, jointly safeguarding the order of the tourism market”, concludes the note.</description><pubDate>2026-01-16 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Bishop presides over public session on the beatification of Father Nicosia</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/bispo-preside-sessao-publica-sobre-beatificacao-padre-nicosia/</link><description>The Church of Our Lady of Sorrows, in Ká-Hó, will host tomorrow the first public session of the beatification process of Father Gaetano Nicosia. A thanksgiving, followed by a mass presided over by Bishop D. Stephen Lee, will mark a new stage for the future canonization of the Salesian missionary who lived and worked in Macau for around 48 years. A small book, written by two local Catholics, which provides information about the priest, the leper colony and the church, began to be distributed to the faithful and tourists who visit that place of worship in Coloane

The Bishop of Macau, D. Stephen Lee, will preside tomorrow afternoon, at 3pm, at the Church of Our Lady of Sorrows, in Ká-Hó, at the first public event integrated in the process of beatification and canonization of Father Gaetano Nicosia. The session program consists of a thanksgiving mass celebrated by the prelate who is in charge of the spiritual direction of the Diocese of Macau.
The location chosen for the Eucharistic ceremony has to do with the fact that it was on the initiative of the priest now honored that the church was built. This, however, was abandoned since 2011 (when Father Nicosia returned to Hong Kong), until 2023, having been revitalized in recent years, currently hosting some masses.
Before the public event, the Diocese carries out a spiritual formation activity, including praying the rosary and adoration of the Blessed Sacrament, guided by Father Daniel Ribeiro.
The beatification of the Salesian missionary, who dedicated 48 years to Asia and passed away in 2017, officially began in 2025, with the aim of recognizing his holiness and life of virtues, a fundamental step towards future canonization. The formal request was made about a year earlier, marking the beginning of the Catholic Church's collection of evidence and testimony to assess the cause.
In accordance with canonical provisions, it is necessary to gather all the writings attributed to him, such as diaries, letters or others. The Diocese, through an edict signed by the bishop and Reverend Cyril Jerome Law, Jr., states that “those who wish to preserve the originals may present a copy, which will be duly authenticated”.
Furthermore, it asks the faithful to communicate “all information from which one can in some way deduce elements favorable or contrary to the reputation of holiness of the aforementioned Servant of God”.
 
Next step is the Roman Phase
Although tomorrow's event at the church of Ká-Hó, in Coloane, constitutes the first public session for Father Nicosia to be beatified by the Pope, the process has already seen some developments, with the formal beginning, that is, the request to open the cause, being made by the general postulator, Father Pierluigi Cameroni, on January 24, 2024, according to the Salesian Province of São Paulo.
Regarding the next steps (Beatification Process), there is the Diocesan phase, which has already begun, with the Diocese of Macau tasked with investigating the life, virtues and reputation for holiness of Father Nicosia, gathering documents and testimonies. This is followed by the Roman Phase (Dicastery for the Causes of Saints) which, if successful, will take the road to Rome for further analysis.
The remaining stages are the Decree of Heroicity of Virtues: after approval, the missionary can be declared “Venerable”; Beatification: the Church recognizes a miracle attributed to his intercession for beatification, making him “Blessed” and allowing local worship; Canonization: another miracle after beatification leads to canonization, making him a “Saint” for the Universal Church.
As “his reputation for holiness and signs grew over the years”, the General Postulator of the Salesians of Don Bosco, Father Pierluigi Cameroni, asked in January last year for the Cause of Beatification and Canonization to begin. In May 2025, the “Nihil Obstat” was obtained, that is, a declaration that there is nothing contrary to the opening of this process, which is long.
 
Book about missionary and Church distributed to the faithful
Father Nicosia was born on April 3, 1915, in San Giovanni la Punta (Catania-Sicily), in Italy. When he was 20 years old, he headed to the East, having settled in Hong Kong, where he began his religious mission on November 11, 1935. He served at the “Saint Louis School”, in Hong Kong, for 11 years and, in 1946, he was ordained as a priest in the church of the Seminary of Saint Joseph, in Macau, joining the Society of Saint Francis de Sales (Salesians).
“He started preaching in China, but he wanted his mission to be among the poorest, including lepers, as he had promised Jesus Christ when he was young”, can be read in a small book, recently published, written by two local Catholics, which began to be distributed to all the faithful and visitors who go to the Ká-Hó Church.
“Every day there are lots of visitors to the place, they enter the church and find out nothing”, those responsible for the copy, who preferred not to be identified, told the newspaper TRIBUNA DE MACAU. “Often, when we go to place flowers there, they ask a lot of questions, which is why we decided to publish this small book”, they highlighted.
The publication, under the auspices of the Diocese of Macau, states that the Salesian's superior intended to send him to a leprosarium in Colombia, when the Bishop of Macau asked for help for the leper colony on the island of Coloane.
In 1958, he permanently moved to Macau, having lived in the town of Ká-Hó between 1963 and 2011, that is, for 48 years. Under his proposal, the location of the leper colony was renamed “Vila de Nossa Senhora”.
When he arrived at the leper colony in Ká-Hó, “Father Nicosia was faced with a catastrophic situation”, says the book. Due to the serious illness they suffered from and the almost total abandonment they suffered, the suicide rate among lepers was high, there was no drinking water or electricity, hygiene was practically non-existent and, only from time to time, they received a visit from a doctor, with little food available.
“So, the Italian priest made every effort to improve the living conditions of the lepers of Ká-Hó and, thanks to his long and continuous work, he managed to ensure that many of them recovered and were reintegrated into society, despite the social stigma associated with this disease, having become known as ‘The Angel of Lepers’”, highlights the small book.
Leprosy community lived autonomously
The manual also describes the history of the leprosarium, stating that, “in Macau, lepers were housed in a hospice in the São Lázaro neighborhood, on the Peninsula, built by Bishop D. Belchior Carneiro, in the mid-16th century and financed by the Santa Casa da Misericórdia de Macau”.
At the end of the 19th century, in view of the expansion of the city of Macau, the patients were separated, with the men being taken to a “leper deposit”, in Pac Sá Lan, on the island of São João (today, Ilha da Montanha), staying, initially, in very fragile houses that were destroyed by a typhoon in 1883, with more solid houses then being built to accommodate them. In 1885, women with leprosy were placed in the five houses that made up the Ká-Hó hospice.
In 1929, the Government began expanding the leprosarium, which now had capacity for 90 patients. The leprosy community cultivated vegetables, thus being autonomous.
He also received food from Macau that was left on a small beach located in the area. “Apart from these sporadic trips, they were not visited by anyone else, with lepers being treated like animals and chained for fear of contagion”, describes the copy.
The situation only changed with the arrival in Macau of Father Nicosia in 1958. He, with “boundless dedication”, never refused to treat these sick people, despite the high risk of contagion. From then on, lepers began to receive more frequent medical assistance and the village slowly became free of leprosy.
The small book, distributed to those who visit that space in Ká-Hó, also covers the history of the Church of Nossa Senhora das Dores, being written in Portuguese, English, Chinese and Tagalog. Later, it will also contain texts in Spanish, Japanese, Vietnamese and Indonesian. In the future, a “QR Code” will be placed in different languages.</description><pubDate>2026-01-16 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Smoking law will be revised “as soon as possible”</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/lei-tabagismo-sera-revista-com-maior-brevidade-possivel/</link><description>Alvis Lo indicated that the Health Services intend to move forward with the review of the “Tobacco Control Law” “as soon as possible”, ensuring that a “reasonable date” will be defined for entry into force and that “sufficient time” will be given for the population to adapt.

The work to review the “Tobacco Control Law” is being promoted “dynamically”, stressed the director of Health Services (SSM), Alvis Lo, highlighting that the organization maintains “proactive communication” with all competent services and will continue to listen to social opinions, “striving to start the law review procedure as soon as possible”. In recent times, the Government has insisted on the need to reinforce restrictions related to tobacco in the territory.
The directions of the revision of the law, remember, include the expansion of the area where smoking is prohibited outside the premises, the prohibition of new types of tobacco, non-smoking products (herbal tobacco) and tobaccos that are once again popular, as well as the introduction of standardized packaging of tobacco products and the prohibition of possession of electronic cigarettes, among other aspects.
In response to a question from Lam Lon Wai, Alvis Lo guarantees that, when developing various tobacco control measures, the SSM “will define a reasonable entry into force date, according to the nature of the respective measure, and will maintain close communication with the public”. The objective is for the public to understand the actual implementation situation and to ensure that the sector and residents “have sufficient time to adapt and prepare, in order to ensure that the respective measures are implemented successfully”.
Since the end of November 2025, the SSM have installed “no-smoking zones” at the entrances and exits of three schools and a daycare center, in what is a pilot project. “In the future, this smoking ban measure will be gradually extended to other schools and daycare centers in Macau, after evaluating its implementation effectiveness in the four pilot points”, highlighted the leader of the government body.
Alvis Lo also says that, with a view to implementing and achieving the objective of reducing the rate of tobacco consumption set out in the “Action Plan for Healthy Macau”, the Government “has been implementing several policies and measures to control smoking, adopting a multifaceted strategy that includes legislative production, law enforcement, educational dissemination and encouraging smoking cessation, among other measures”.
To resolve the issue of “smoking while walking” in densely populated areas, the SSM will study the feasibility of adopting a new model, that is, the creation of a “no-smoking area”, in which “smoking will only be allowed at a specific point”, can be read in the response to Lam Lon Wai. Regarding the way in which smoking points are created, the authorities assure that they will “broadly” listen to comments from all parts of society, in addition to implementing “different plans during the experimental period, in order to assess their viability”.
More than 10 years have passed since the entry into force of the “Smoking Prevention and Control Regime” in 2012, the Macao SAR Government has already carried out two legislative revisions, “actively monitoring the evolution of society and in accordance with tobacco control strategies, having produced the desired effect in tobacco control work”, adds Alvis Lo.</description><pubDate>2026-01-16 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Rivals Must Ipo and Shao Jiang in the opening “duel” of the League</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/rivais-ipo-shao-jiang-duelo-de-abertura-da-liga/</link><description>The Macau Football Elite League starts tomorrow for another season, comprising 10 teams. The draw meant that the two main candidates, Must Ipo, current champion, and Shao Jiang, second placed in 2025, would face each other in the opening round. The coaches, Jordi Alonso and Jesus Piñero, confirmed to Jornal TRIBUNA DE MACAU their ambition to fight for the title. Must Ipo's main reinforcement is striker Jackson Sousa. Shao Jiang introduces a new batch of foreign players from South America

Another season of the I Division of Macao football is coming, which is scheduled to start this Saturday, at the Taipa Stadium, at 7pm. Right to open, a “strong dish”, pitting the two main candidates for the title, Must Ipo and Shao Jiang, against each other. The two teams fought for the title until the final round of the 2025 championship, with Must Ipo becoming champions.
For this year, both teams have some new additions to their squad, with the main change at Must Ipo being the coach. Jordi Alonso guided the team in the Bolinha competition and deserved the trust of the directors to remain during the eleven-a-side football season.
Addressing his first opponent, the Spanish coach told TRIBUNA DE MACAU newspaper that Shao Jiang is “an excellent team, with good players, both local and foreign, having retained the same coach as last year, after a very positive season”. Regarding his team, he is confident for the season that is now beginning, remembering last year's good campaign. “For some reason we were champions, which was a great feat”, he emphasizes.
Jordi Alonso recognizes that the pre-season “was short”, but still believes that “it will be an excellent game”.
On Shao Jiang's side, Jesus Piñero has the advantage of knowing his athletes. “We kept most of the players, although we changed some of the foreigners, but the base of the team remains and is reinforced with some local elements”, highlights the Spaniard who also has Venezuelan nationality.
Regarding the “duel” with Must Ipo, the coach states that the opponent “strengthened some lines and is a team that fights hard to be at the top of Macau football”. Therefore, “for us, the League starts in play-off mode”.
Speaking of the objectives for this year, Piñero assumes that they are “very clear”, as he intends to reach the penultimate round of the competition with a four-point advantage over the second placed team, which would immediately give him the title. “I believe we will do it, starting now with a victory”, he adds, concluding that Shao Jiang “is stronger this year, because it has reinforced itself with good players”.
 
Heavy reinforcements in both squads
As far as the squads are concerned, last season's runner-up keeps two of the foreigners, the Colombian Jeim Botero Gómez and the Venezuelan Alejandro Sanchez Sixto, and went to get three more: Luís Gonzalez and Edward Morillo, both from Venezuela, and Michael Saldaña, from the USA. Furthermore, he signed Ho Chi Fong, a local player who played for Must Ipo in 2025.
The current champion of the Elite League has a strong reinforcement for the attack, the Brazilian Jackson Sousa, who has been in Hong Kong football for the last two seasons, playing for Southern. The South American, who turned 35 last December, returns to Macau football, after having represented Suncity and Monte Carlo, having become notable for his goalscoring talent.
Also between the posts there is a new member, Spanish-Irish Luke Winn-Lintern, who played in Spain's third division. The goalkeeper was hired to replace Ho Man Fai, who now plays in Hong Kong.
Meanwhile, Must Ipo will continue to count on the main references from last year, such as Bruno Araújo, Vítor Almeida, Ronaldo Cabrera, William Maronesi and Pang Chi Hang. Bruno Figueiredo returns to the team this year and everything points to him taking off his boots at the end of 2026, at least at top-flight clubs. “In addition to playing, I will be the coach’s assistant,” the midfielder, who has been in Macau for several years, told JTM.
In terms of local players, Must Ipo was reinforced with Alexandre Noronha, although they no longer have Leung Shi Seng and Ho Chi Fong.
 
Benfica maintains its focus on locals
Benfica should be one of the main 'outsiders' in the title issue, trying to interfere in the fight between Must Ipo and Shao Jiang. The “reds” will now be guided by the Portuguese André Calado, until now responsible for the club's youth teams.
Duarte Alves, president of the territory's “eagles”, revealed that the squad will once again be made up essentially of local players. “We want to maintain the team's identity, focusing mainly on Macau athletes, thus continuing the investment we have been making in recent years, leaving foreign players in the background”, expressed the director.
Benfica should hire two or three African or Brazilian footballers, “to support the locals”, according to Duarte Alves. Players such as Niki Torrão, Amâncio Goitia, Iuri Capelo, Joaquim Figueira, Alison Brito, Danael Estadieu and Leong Hou In remain in the squad.
As for the remaining clubs, it is expected that Ching Fung, Chiba, Gala and University of Macau, mainly, will be able to offer greater competitiveness to the League.
Ching Fung, coached by João Rosa, made some changes to the squad, having already signed up four foreigners: Alhassane Bah (Mali), Artur João Machado (Brazil), Derrick Biney (USA) and Choi Tayeong (South Korea).
According to the assistant coach, Lam Ka Koi, the team will present itself in the championship with several young locals, “who will be given opportunities to absorb experience”. For the assistant coach, continuing to invest in the youngest “is also thinking about the future of football in Macau”.
Regarding his ambitions, he emphasizes that the priority is “to be in the top four at the end of the season”.
 
Gala presents six foreigners
Meanwhile, Gala has a new coach, Spaniard Alex Espana, and six foreign players: Pedro Ramos, Daniel Matos and Juan de Castro (Brazil), Hong Joo Yong and Noh Byunghyo (South Korea) and African Abdoulaye Diba. One of the main reinforcements with local athlete status is the Portuguese-French Sebastien Mariojouls, transferred from Chiba.
Kenneth Wong, also a member of the squad, revealed that the team will seek to stay in the top three places. “We want to do better than the previous two years.” But, “more important than that, is helping young players reach the Macau main and under-23 teams, introducing professional training methods”, he observes.
Chiba keeps four of last year's foreigners (Abubakar, Appiah, Mafus and Djani), with Ibrahim Ntambi leaving.
Paulo Cheang, who is part of Chiba's group of coaches, told this newspaper that “finishing among the top five would already correspond to the objectives set for this year's Elite League”, as well as giving local athletes the opportunity to “develop, in order to reach the Macao SAR selections”.
In the schedule of the opening day, and in addition to Shao Jiang/Must Ipo, Benfica will also face tomorrow, at 9 pm, one of the new first division players, G. Universe, champion of the II Division. On Sunday, Hang Sai/Gala (6pm) and Artilheiros/Ching Fung (8pm) will play, also at Taipa Stadium.
The remaining two teams, University of Macau and Chiba, only enter action later. The first plays against Gala, on Saturday, January 24th, and the second plays against Shao Jiang, the following day.
As in previous editions, the Elite League will consist of an all-against-all phase, one round, followed by division into two groups, that of the champion qualifying, with the top five classified in the first phase, and that of relegation or permanence, with those positioned between sixth and 10th.</description><pubDate>2026-01-16 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Mortgage credit continues to rise</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/credito-a-habitacao-segue-em-alta/</link><description>The amount of new mortgage loans for housing approved by local banks amounted to 1.25 billion patacas in November, reflecting increases of 6.3% and 1.8% in monthly and annual terms, respectively, with residents absorbing 98.7% of the total, reported the Monetary Authority (AMCM).

According to the Public Works Services Directorate, more than half of the total available area of ​​the 39 lots will be used for car parks
 
The Directorate of Public Works Services (DSOP) has already announced the purpose of each of the lots for temporary use, with 56,118 square meters being allocated to temporary outdoor parking lots, corresponding to more than half of the total area available (102,774 m2).
The 15 lots for parking include, among others, the lot in front of the field of the Macau Security Forces School on Estrada do Campo (10,321 m2), and Rua da Cordoaria (5,300 m2), in Coloane, as well as the land next to the Marginal da Taipa Leisure Zone (7,440 m2).
It is recalled that, on Wednesday, Ella Lei, as president of the Monitoring Committee for Land Affairs and Public Concessions of the Legislative Assembly, indicated that if all lots for temporary use were used for car parks, the population would benefit from more than a thousand additional parking spaces for light cars.
Of the 39 plots, 13 with a combined area of ​​17,041 square meters will be designated as temporary leisure areas. This set includes lots A4 (4,563 m2), A3 (4,169 m2) and A9 (3,449 m2) at Lake Nam Van and Estrada Marginal da Ilha Verde (2,442 m2), among others.
The four locations that will host temporary sports facilities are lots B13 in Zone A of New Landfills (15,785 m2), C8 in Lake Nam Van (4,422 m2), BT7 in Taipa (3,745 m2) and Rua do Laboratório (1,279 m2).
For the “Alegria Environmental Centers”, areas of Estrada da Areia Preta (173 m2), Estrada do Repouso (76 m2) and Rua do Volong (57 m2) will be used.
The land on Rua Marginal do Lam Mau (1,258 m2), Rua do Patane (925 m2), Rampa dos Cavaleiros (695 m2) and the lot next to the COTAI substation on Rua da Patinagem (1,200 m2) will be used for other purposes.
As some lots still require land eviction, the Executive stated that it will carry out the works according to the planned order, in order to make them available as quickly as possible for public use. Furthermore, Ella Lei noted that the Government promised that it “will not forget old areas when developing new areas”.
The deputy also recalled that the Transport and Public Works team actively adopted the “Exploitation + provisional use” model, to transform land that benefits the population and fulfill the promises of the Government Action Lines.

CATARINA PEREIRA
 
The Institute for Municipal Affairs (IAM) aims to complete the design work on the Praça Ponte e Horta project for the second quarter of this year, after which it will hold a public competition. At the moment, the organization is carrying out work on preparing the project for the improvement of the Leisure Zone and the peripheral area.
“Given that the above-mentioned area covers a classified property and the respective protection zone, it is necessary to consult the competent services to draw up an appropriate plan”, highlights the deputy chairman of the Board of Directors for Municipal Affairs, Mak Kim Meng.
Responding to the aging trend of the territory's population and in conjunction with the analysis and planning of leisure facilities for the elderly, as well as the design of the environment and space, the IAM says it is “constantly” dedicated to the introduction of leisure, recreational and sports facilities suitable for the elderly in community neighborhoods.
Regarding the design of the project to optimize the Leisure Zone at Praça de Ponte e Horta, “IAM will comprehensively analyze the demographic characteristics of that area, and provide appropriate leisure and entertainment facilities for residents of different age groups, including the elderly”. At the same time, it is planned to reserve space in the square for future community activities, “in order to promote interaction between neighbors and cultural transmission, increasing the dynamism of the neighborhood”, can be read in response to a question from Ella Lei.
The IAM also states that it has paid continuous attention to the work to optimize parks, gardens and leisure facilities in all areas and, in accordance with the Master Plan (2020-2040), “constantly reviews the conditions of spaces in the different areas and the real situation of existing leisure areas”.
"When the conditions are met, the Institute will gradually optimize the facilities and size of the leisure areas, increase their functions and complementary facilities, with a view to providing citizens with comfortable spaces. Due to the lack of space in the Inner Harbor area, the IAM adopted the guidance of optimizing and reorganizing the facilities of the existing leisure areas, in order to meet the leisure needs of residents of different age groups", added Mak Kim Meng.
The organization also indicates that Porto Interior currently has several municipal facilities for the use of residents, including the S. Lourenço Activity Center, the Leisure Area at Praça de Ponte e Horta and the Leisure Area at Largo do Aquino.

The Chief Executive praised the progress of the Macao SAR's healthcare system and pointed to the "new phase of development of the sector" during a meeting with Lei Haichao, director and secretary of the Party Leadership Group of the National Health Commission. The two officials met at the Government Headquarters, in connection with the 20th Joint Meeting of the Summits of the Health Administration of Mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau, according to a statement.
Both exchanged views on “the continuous deepening of cooperation in the field of health, the promotion of the development of the ‘big health’ industry, and the integrated training of qualified personnel”. According to the Social Communication Office (GCS), the Chief Executive took the opportunity to highlight the Government's desire to “deepen comprehensive cooperation with the National Health Commission”.
According to the GCS, this cooperation will involve “continuously optimizing the health care system and jointly strengthening the prevention and control of communicable diseases”, “promoting adequate diversification of the economy and taking full advantage of Macau's regional and political advantages to fully promote 'big health' as ​​one of the territory's nuclear industries”, stressed the Macao SAR leader.
In this sense, Sam Hou Fai called for “strong support” to the Commission, in order to “cultivate qualified interdisciplinary cadres in the health sector”, in the hope that this cooperation will offer “solid contributions to further develop the health care and ‘big health’ industry, both in Mainland China and in Macau”.
The Head of the Macao SAR also said he hopes that the city “takes full advantage of its role as a Sino-Lusophone platform, constantly raising the level of professionalism of its medical and nursing team, and actively training more highly qualified staff in the area, capable of serving international organizations”.
For Sam Hou Fai, “the health care system in the Macao SAR has been continuously improved since its establishment, and the health of residents is protected”. He also highlighted that the completion and entry into operation of the Islands Health Care Complex represents “a landmark cooperation project between the Macao SAR and Mainland China in the field of health, under the principle of ‘one country, two systems’”.
Also present on the occasion were O Lam, Secretary for Social Affairs and Culture, Alvis Lo, director of Health Services, and Liu Zhengyin, director of the Islands Health Care Complex, among others.</description><pubDate>2026-01-16 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>MGM announces salary increases of up to 4.5%</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/mgm-anuncia-aumentos-salariais-ate-45/</link><description>MGM yesterday announced a pay increase for all eligible team members, effective March 23, “in recognition of their hard work and contribution to the company.” According to the gaming operator, a 2% increase will be granted to all eligible team members, meaning that 99% will benefit.

Residents can now check the balance of their subaccount through the Single Account, the FSS website, the information platform on the Non-Mandatory Central Pension Scheme and self-service kiosks. The interest income from this mechanism results from term deposits in banks, calculated daily between January and December of each year and settled on December 31st. As the FSS explains, “the amount of interest to be allocated to the account holder is calculated based on the daily balance of their Government management subaccount, the number of days subject to interest calculation and the rate of return”.

PEDRO MILHEIRÃO
At the end of last year, the Macao SAR had a total of 336,512 voters, according to the Directorate of Administration and Public Service Services (SAFP), 3,121 more (+0.94%) in annual terms. This variation includes 7,764 new voters (-20.44%) and 4,643 registrations eliminated (+140.69%) due to death, court ruling or psychological illness, in a year in which elections were held for the VIII Legislative Assembly.
Under current law, permanent residents of Macau over the age of 18 who wish to exercise their right to propose, stand as a candidate and vote in elections for the Legislative Assembly must register in the electoral register by December 31st of the year preceding the election.
The age group from 35 to 39 years old was the one with the most registrations, with 1,134, followed by the groups from 30 to 34 and from 40 to 44, with 951 each. There were also 57 people aged 17 to register in advance, in addition to 278 new voters aged 18 and 19, 556 between 20 and 24 and 859 between 25 and 29.

Women were responsible for the majority of new registrations, considering that 4,080 (52.55%) of new voters are female, compared to 3,684 men.
Among the new voters registered in 2025, more than half are from Mainland China. Official data indicate that 4,339 (55.89%) are from the Mainland, while 2,890 (37.22%) are local, 320 (4.12%) are from Hong Kong and 215 (2.77%) are from another place of origin.

But what about the stick?
The matter has generated a lot of debate since Selangor police chief Shazeli Kahar suggested, in November 2025, the gradual reintroduction of the use of the cane as punishment in schools.
But it seems that the issue of the rod also worries teachers. In general, teachers do not want to use this type of punishment because they fear reprisals from parents, who may seek legal action, said the general secretary of the National Union of Teachers (NUTP), Fouzi Singon.
“Right now, there is a constant concern among teachers that if they punish their students with a stick, they could be prosecuted or the parents could go to the police,” he said.
Fouzi said authorities, such as school principals and disciplinary teachers, are allowed to apply physical punishment to students, but this must be done in accordance with Ministry of Education regulations. According to the ministry, the use of rods is permitted in schools, but there is a standard procedure to follow.
Thus, Fouzi said that there have never been any problems with revoking the use of the stick as a form of punishment, but rather that teachers do not want to apply it. "For me, physical punishment no longer has the same effect as it used to. Now, most students simply accept it and move on," he said.
"This is different from the past, when you were beaten for not doing your homework. A single spank was enough to serve as a reminder (to do your homework)," he said.
Datuk Shazeli made the suggestion, amid growing concerns about bullying and misconduct among students.
There have been cases of students in Selangor being detained for crimes including extortion and gang fights. Asked about how to deal with students involved in crimes, Fouzi said that the best thing to do is for teachers to document all criminal activities committed by students, forward the cases to the right people and present the matter to parents so that they can take appropriate action.
Nawiza Ariff, vice-president of the Malaysian Child Protection Society (Kuala Lumpur branch), said physical punishment only generates short-term compliance. "Experience shows that it is not effective for long-term behavioral changes. On the contrary, it can aggravate deeper problems. Physical punishment does not solve the cause of the behavior. The behavior often returns in a different form. Physical punishment leads to a more rebellious attitude and can increase mental health problems", he said.
Nawiza suggested implementing early intervention and a support system. He also described measures such as school community service and counseling for students, in order to hold them accountable for their mistakes.
“The most important thing is a strong partnership between the school and parents, the mandatory involvement of parents in serious cases and the clear communication of expectations and consequences”, stated the same responsible.
Clinical child psychologist Noor Aishah Rosli suggested adopting the US SNAP (Stop Now And Plan) program for children aged six to 11 with behavioral problems. These children, according to her, are taken to the police station, participate in lectures and learn about crimes and the law.
He also mentioned that the use of the stick can have a short-term effect, causing the child to feel fear or pain. "But, according to research, they don't understand the consequences. Instead, they become more aggressive, seek revenge and develop antisocial behavior or even anxiety", he pointed out.
Before physically punishing a troubled child, she said, it's important to find the root cause of the misbehavior.
"Children do not have cognitive maturity, even if they are aggressors or commit crimes. Sometimes, these children come from abusive families, where they only recognize violence and abuse, and that is how they behave too", said the psychologist.
“We assume that children know what is right and wrong, but in reality they don't have that level of understanding,” he added.
