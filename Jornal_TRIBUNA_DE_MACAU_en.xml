According to Kieran Wong, prolonged illnesses and gambling problems among people who also lack family support led to the increase in cases. In general, he pointed out that the hidden whereabouts of homeless people on the street and the lack of motivation to move among some elderly people constitute the main challenges for the center. Furthermore, he warned about the “problem of loneliness” of this group of people

In 2025, Casa Corcel da Caritas de Macau provided support to 127 homeless people, a number that represents a “gradual increase” of 16.5% compared to the 109 help seekers welcomed in the previous year, revealed the director of Casa Corcel. Regarding new users of the center, the number also rose from 37 to 48 in the space of a year.
Speaking to the newspaper TRIBUNA DE MACAU, Kieran Wong indicated that, currently, Casa Corcel provides shelter to an average of 35 people per day.
In 2025, the center provided services primarily to residents, many of whom were elderly. "One of the most common problems of people who asked us for help is that they suffer from long-term illnesses, including mental illnesses, or, for example, they have to receive kidney dialysis. In addition to not having support from their family members, they are also unable to work or live on relatively low income, which is why they are unable to support their household income and have become homeless", said the person in charge.
"For example, a person over 60 years of age lives depending on the pension for the elderly, which is around 3,000 patacas per month. Therefore, they cannot sustain their income, as they have to give priority to food", he continued.
In addition to this type of health problem, challenged simultaneously by the lack of family support, another “evident problem” contributed to the increase in cases received by Casa Corcel: the “gambling problem”.
"We have also dealt with some people who, due to problems linked to gambling, do not have very good relationships with their families. The family will not help them. Because of gambling, these people's lives have become unbalanced, thus losing the financial means to rent a house", he highlighted, adding that many applicants for help are elderly or middle-aged individuals who have chosen to play in casinos for entertainment. There are also some addicted to alcohol, among other bad habits, whose number has also grown in relation to 2024.
In addition to trying to help users of the space to give up gambling and deposit money, the center referred highly addicted people to other services, so that they could be supported more precisely in their attempt to give up gambling.
On the other hand, the official revealed that, among the homeless people welcomed at Casa Corcel throughout the year, seven non-residents, including former inmates, from the Philippines, Africa and Malaysia, were housed at the center for a dozen days, before receiving their documents. “This is because there are currently no residences in Macau designed exclusively to house ex-prisoners”, he clarified.
Regarding the situation of homeless people on the streets, the director of Casa Corcel stated that the number of such cases “remained stable” in the territory. Last year, the institution accompanied 17 residents who became accustomed to sleeping on the street, 11 of which have already left this situation.
"According to our observation, they are probably mentally ill. We have tried to give them affection, but they are quite vigilant. They do not want to receive our services or share their situations", he lamented. Still, after many attempts to “build relationships with them”, some homeless people on the street even accepted clothes and hot food offered by the Casa Corcel external work team.
Normally, this group of people only appears on the Peninsula, but prefers to “walk everywhere”, which represents a characteristic of the homeless in Macau, he analyzed.
"For example, in Hong Kong, many homeless people usually occupy an entire pedestrian tunnel to sleep. However, the homeless in Macau are relatively hidden, and can be found in a park today and appear tomorrow in another park or area open for 24 hours. This poses a challenge for our work. Normally, we can only find three or four homeless people on the street per night," he explained.
Sometimes, the center's social workers also encounter homeless people on the street, who are gamblers or backpackers who adopt a low-cost style of travel. This phenomenon, in the opinion of the director of Casa Corcel, “does not represent, for now, a very significant impact” for the city.
 
Lack of motivation and loneliness
According to Kieran Wong, another “challenge” for the center is a lack of motivation to move among some elderly and middle-aged homeless people.
"Many users of the center are elderly and suffer from long-term illnesses. We discussed with them their planning after leaving the center, whether they would rent houses or apply for social housing. However, currently, the application time is relatively long, varying between two and three years. We don't want them to spend time at the center without planning and end up getting used to the current state. We need to remind them of the motivation to change, which is also a challenge", he highlighted.
In general, from his perspective, local society “currently presents a satisfactory collaborative state” on the phenomenon of homelessness in Macau. “Many citizens called us on their own initiative after seeing homeless people on the street”, he revealed.
However, the official defends the implementation of more “preventive measures” in society, since many homeless people not only lack housing, but also face “multiple problems”, including family problems.
The director of Casa Corcel also warned of “the loneliness that resides in many people in society”. "Our users also face the problem of loneliness, to a certain extent. They have no family to help them and decided to ask for our services after being abandoned", he described.
In this sense, Kieran Wong highlighted that one of Casa Corcel's main tasks next year is related to the “problem of loneliness”. "Users will later leave our center and start living in rented houses, where there is no one to care about them anymore. We need to find measures to help them live independently in the community and not feel so alone. For example, we will encourage them to participate in community interactions, by carrying out some activities and taking them to community centers. This is what we are doing step by step", he concluded.</description><pubDate>2026-01-29 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Violations of tobacco and alcohol control laws rose 28%</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/subiram-28-infraccoes-as-leis-controlo-tabaco-alcool/</link><description>Last year, there were 5,474 violations of laws controlling smoking and consumption of alcoholic beverages by minors, representing an increase of 27.9% in relation to the comparative base of 2024. The Health Services pointed to a greater frequency of inspections, an increase in the number of visitors and the “failure of some establishments” as the main causes for the scenario
 
The Health Services (SSM) detected 5,474 violations of the “Regime for the Prevention and Control of Smoking” and the “Regime for the Prevention and Control of Alcohol Consumption by Minors” in 2025, which corresponds to an increase of 1,194 infractions (+27.9%) compared to 2024. More specifically, inspection agents carried out 240,700 inspections, and the number of cases of illegal smoking among tourists rose 48% to 3,050 last year.
The authorities attributed the increase in the number of cases to the “continuous optimization of inspection methods, with an increase in their frequency”, the greater number of visitors and the “failure of some establishments” to comply with the law.
Interdepartmental tobacco control operations detected 5,008 cases of illegal smoking last year, 1,064 more (+27%) than in 2024, according to a statement from the SSM. Furthermore, in 2025, there were 316 cases of “transporting electronic cigarettes into and out of Macau”, more than double the previous year, when 156 were recorded.
In relation to the types of establishments with cases of people smoking in prohibited places, casinos registered a total of 1,111 (22%), in the general calculation of 2025. This was followed by restaurants, with 780 (15.6%), and gardens and leisure areas with 414 (8.3%).
There were also 134 suspected cases of violation of other provisions of the “Smoking Prevention and Control Regime”, such as “failure to display signs prohibiting smoking” and “failure to display a notice prohibiting the sale of tobacco products to minors under 18 years of age in places of sale”, five more incidents of this nature than a year before.
With regard to the control of alcohol consumption, last year, 16 episodes of suspected violations of the “Regime for the Prevention and Control of Alcohol Consumption by Minors” were recorded, including six that involved the sale of alcoholic beverages to minors.
The other infractions were related to the failure to display signs, the failure to define areas for displaying alcoholic beverages by establishments with self-service services, or cases of advertising alcoholic beverages without appropriate warnings in Chinese, Portuguese and English. The authorities stated that “the respective cases have already been instructed for appropriate follow-up”.
At the same time, the SSM reported that, during inspections, cases were detected in which “several minors were consuming alcohol in a food establishment”, having already initiated proceedings against the workers.
The organization recalled that “the supply of alcoholic beverages to minors for non-commercial purposes also constitutes a legal infraction, which may result in a fine of 1,500 to 20 thousand patacas”. In case of non-compliance with the display of signs, fines can reach 200 thousand patacas.
The stickers can be downloaded from the SSM website or collected in person at the Office for the Prevention and Control of Smoking and Alcoholism, at the Health Centers and at the Macao SAR Service Center.

These were, most of the time, payment of salaries, compensation for overtime work and severance pay.
 
CATARINA PEREIRA
 
The Directorate of Labor Affairs Services (DSAL) opened 1,223 cases due to labor disputes between January and November last year. According to the organization, 1,936 workers were involved – of which 832 were local and 1,104 were non-resident workers. The information was provided yesterday, after several questions sent by the TRIBUNA DE MACAU newspaper to DSAL.
Over the past year, the matters complained of mainly concerned salary payment, compensation for overtime work and severance pay, indicated the government body. “Compared to the same period in 2024, the number of cases opened decreased by 18% and the number of workers involved decreased by 32%”, can be read in the press release released yesterday.
According to data previously provided by DSAL to this newspaper, between January and September 2025, an average of 109 cases were initiated per month due to labor disputes, in a total of 981 cases, involving 1,537 workers and 723 employers.
With the aim of “preventing labor conflicts and optimizing labor relations” in the territory, DSAL states that it continues to “commit itself to promoting laws and diplomas in the area of ​​labor among sectors of society through diverse forms and in several languages, continually reinforcing the awareness of labor and employer parties regarding compliance with the law”.
Regarding disclosure and education, DSAL held, in the same period last year, more than 50 clarification sessions on legal disclosure, the content of which covered labor rights and interests. These sessions were attended by 3,351 people.
Regarding prevention and inspection, it carried out 148 inspection work visits to 114 large construction sites and promoted, with 664 commercial establishments, the dissemination of legislation, “in order to identify and actively support the resolution of potential controversies”.
In the future, DSAL assures that it will continue to “firmly fulfill” its legal duties, “ensuring the legitimate rights and interests of workers”. It also states that it will reinforce legal dissemination through clarification sessions, production of infographics and videos, “committing to raising the knowledge and awareness of all sectors of society about labor legislation and compliance with the law”.</description><pubDate>2026-01-29 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>BIR and departure of professionals worry parliamentary committee</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/bir-saida-de-profissionais-inquietam-comissao-parlamentar/</link><description>A delegation from the Commission for Foreign Affairs and Portuguese Communities was in Macau, where it identified some challenges, such as changes to the attribution of the BIR, the return of professionals to Portugal and resistance to the use of the Portuguese language
 
Difficulties in recruiting Portuguese people, attributing nationality, issuing passports and obstacles to the use of the Portuguese language are included in the report released on the visit of a parliamentary delegation to Macau, Hong Kong and East Timor.
The delegation of the Commission for Foreign Affairs and Portuguese Communities, which was in Macau between 3 and 7 December, points out as difficulties the changes – since 2023 – to the Resident Identity Card (BIR) attribution regime, creating increased obstacles to the recruitment of Portuguese workers.
The report also highlights significant delays in the processes for granting Portuguese nationality in Macau and in issuing passports by the Instituto dos Registos e do Notariado (IRN), with cases that can take between one and five years.
The replacement of magistrates, teachers and doctors returning to Portugal is also identified as a problem with a direct impact on the community, with it being said that seven doctors will leave Macau in 2025.
The commission also highlights the resistance of public servants and some local magistrates to the use of the Portuguese language in the exercise of their functions, as well as the need to respond to the increase in demand for Portuguese courses, in a context in which there is a risk of direct hiring of teachers by China.
Regarding Hong Kong, where the mission was between the 7th and 8th of December, it was highlighted that around 30,000 Portuguese reside and the importance of the Club Lusitano.
In Timor-Leste, where the delegation was from the 9th to the 12th of December, the main constraint was identified as the difficulties faced by Portuguese citizens in participating in electoral events, due to the lack of reliability of postal services. Therefore, emigrants in Timor-Leste reinforced the request for the application of electronic voting.
Delays in nationality processes pending at the IRN and difficulties in the use of Portuguese in the Timorese National Parliament were also highlighted, where many deputies and officials favor Tetum or English, despite Portuguese being the official language.
The construction of a new Portuguese School in Timor-Leste is identified as an urgent priority, taking into account that the current school, designed for 400 students, accommodates around 1,400 and has a waiting list of around 400 students.
The mission also referred to the need to reinforce the Portuguese cultural presence in Timor-Leste, support students and young Timorese workers in Portugal, preserve historical buildings linked to the Portuguese presence and develop economic opportunities, particularly in the areas of canning, shipbuilding and Asian regional logistics.

Mainland Portugal is being affected by the effects of the passage of depression Kristin, with rain, wind, snow and sea disturbances, with several warnings having been issued by the Portuguese Institute of the Sea and Atmosphere (IPMA). CARLOS BARROSO/LUSA



Depression Kristin caused at least 3,300 incidents in mainland Portugal, mainly falling trees and structures and flooding, mainly affecting the districts of Leiria, Coimbra, Lisbon and Santarém, according to Civil Protection. The passage of the storm caused two deaths, one of which was due to the fall of a tree on a vehicle in Vila Franca de Xira, district of Lisbon, and the second in Monte Real, in Leiria, due to the collapse of a structure.

Due to the passage of depression Kristin, the ferris wheel fell in Parque das Gaivotas, in Figueira da Foz, January 28, 2026. Mainland Portugal is being affected by the effects of the passage of depression Kristin, with rain, wind, snow and sea disturbances, with several warnings having been issued by the Portuguese Institute of the Sea and Atmosphere (IPMA). PAULO NOVAIS/LUSA

In a statement issued by the Prime Minister's office, the Government "deeply" regretted the loss of two lives and assured that "it has been constantly monitoring the impact of storm 'Kristin' on national territory", where dozens of schools had to be closed.
According to Daniela Fraga, deputy to the national operations command of the National Emergency and Civil Protection Authority, it was an extreme phenomenon, with many occurrences simultaneously, with around 3,300 records between 00:00 and 12:30 (08:00-20:30 in Macau), especially in the districts of Leiria and Coimbra.
"At the moment, we are assessing all the damage. Due to the scale of the phenomenon, it takes some time to determine the final damage", he said, adding that, if other phenomena persist, such as intense precipitation, more intense wind and snowfall, it will be necessary to disperse resources on the ground.
The official added that the operatives had been on the ground since early evening, but admitted that “it will be difficult to restore normality”. "At the moment there are many constraints, particularly with regard to communications, traffic routes, the distribution of the electrical network. There are many fallen trees preventing road circulation. There is a lot of fallen structures and also, in this case, potentially obstructing road circulation and the different accesses", he stated.
At 11:00 (19:00 in Macau), around 613 thousand E-Redes customers were without electricity in mainland Portugal, with Leiria, with around half of the customers affected, Coimbra, Castelo Branco, Portalegre and Santarém, being the most affected districts, said the company, explaining that Depression Kristin caused several damages to the physical electricity distribution infrastructure.
Leiria, Coimbra, Lisbon, Península de Setúbal, Oeste, Lezíria do Tejo, Médio Tejo and Aveiro were the sub-regions most affected by the bad weather. The district plan of Coimbra and the municipal plans of Coimbra, Mira, Tomar, Ourém, Ferreira do Zêzere, Lourinhã, Alcobaça, Nazaré, Óbidos, Proença-a-Nova, Castelo Branco and Sertã were activated.
The authorities advised that travel should be reduced as much as possible to minimize possible damage and make the most of all resources on the ground.
Civil Protection indicated that it would remain in a state of special readiness level 4, the maximum, until 23:59 (Portuguese time), which could be extended depending on the assessment of conditions. The level 4 special state of readiness was determined for the entire coastline between Viana do Castelo and Setúbal.

According to monitoring data, in mid-January, the influenza virus positivity rate in Macau remained close to 9%, “with a moderate prevalence level”.
“As the Lunar New Year holidays approach, residents will travel abroad and have more meetings with friends/family, therefore, the risk of respiratory infections, such as flu and pneumococcus, will increase”, can be read in the press release.
Stressing that flu vaccination is the most effective measure for prevention, the SSM add that “it can effectively reduce the risk of serious illness and death after infection”.
Given that the vaccine produces sufficient antibodies at least two weeks after administration, the organization calls on residents to get vaccinated “as soon as possible before the Lunar New Year, particularly high-risk people, such as pregnant women, children, the elderly and chronically ill people”.
To facilitate vaccination at night and on Sundays, the SSM extended the vaccination schedule until January 31 and added a vaccination period to Sunday morning. High-risk people do not need to make an appointment, while other residents can schedule a flu vaccination through the Single Account.
In addition to the flu vaccine, “to prevent invasive, potentially fatal pneumococcal disease, the elderly and people with chronic illnesses should receive a dose of the 13-valent or 15-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (VPC13 or VPC15), followed by a dose of the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (VPP23) one year later”, adds the organization led by Alvis Lo. Pneumococcal and flu vaccines can be administered at the same time.</description><pubDate>2026-01-29 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Lam Lon Wai calls for more places to start young people's careers</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/lam-lon-wai-pede-mais-vagas-para-inicio-da-carreira-dos-jovens/</link><description>It is common for young locals to have the academic degree required by companies, but to lack the necessary experience to work in administrative or technical positions, noted Lam Lon Wai, president of the Federation of Workers' Associations of Macau (FAOM). He therefore asked the Government to urge large companies and institutions to “proactively and systematically release entry-level job vacancies”, suitable for young people to begin their careers, and to simultaneously provide specific training.
As he noted, society is paying attention to the sufficiency of measures to support youth employment. In his opinion, the existing measures “still have room for further development”, especially in terms of precision. “Many young people pointed out that some job matching or training plans fail to fully connect with their professional areas or lack a clear development trajectory, which affected their confidence in dedicating themselves to the respective sectors in the long term”, he lamented.
In this sense, the deputy also highlighted that, in addition to the banking sector, in higher education institutions, public utility companies, airlines and transport companies and large public service institutions there are also suitable jobs for young people and recent graduates, which cover vacancies in administration, project management, information technology, technical support and professional assistance.
However, Lam Lon Wai believes that these vacancies must be further improved in terms of transparency of recruitment information, pre-employment training and clarification on the path to professional advancement.
On the other hand, the president of FAOM suggested that specific plans be launched for local staff in even more sectors, to promote a more precise and targeted link between training and employment. At this point, he added that it is necessary for companies to clearly present their demand for human resources, while the Government must design training content in line with demand, in order to avoid a scenario of “separate training and employment”.
In another aspect, the deputy urged the Executive to review, in a timely manner, the current law on illegal work, the punishments provided for in the law, as well as the means of executing the law, in order to reinforce the deterrent power. Furthermore, given the hidden nature of illegal work, Lam Lon Wai hopes that authorities will develop more combat models, such as random vehicle inspection. At the same time, he called for the intensification of awareness among high-risk sectors.</description><pubDate>2026-01-29 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Filipa Simões wants to rescue the neon signs of a sadder Macau</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/filipa-simoes-quer-resgatar-os-letreiros-de-neon-de-uma-macau-mais-triste/</link><description>Portuguese designer Filipa Simões today launches a guide to neon signs in Macau, a first step towards rescuing the light and vibrancy of this urban icon at risk.

The city lights did not go out, but old nighttime accomplices were lost. Neon signs, an inseparable part of local visual and material culture, seem to have their days numbered. Macau, says Filipa Simões, is now a “sadder” city without the light, vibration and even the sound of neons. So he set out to rescue her.
This is how the “Guide to Neon Signs in Macau” was born, a guide published by CURB – Centro de Arquitectura e Urbanismo, with photographs by Wilson Kam, who wants to bring this heritage at risk to light.
"The Government has paid attention to intangible heritage, but there has been a lot left out. This is not an in-depth study, but a tool to draw attention and raise awareness among people about the preservation of this craftsmanship", the designer begins by telling Lusa.
Neon signage, which originated in France at the beginning of the 20th century, was introduced in China in the 1920s. These chromatic tubes still feed the image that the world has of Asian cities – Hong Kong, Shanghai, Tokyo –, also immortalized in the cinema of Wong Kar-wai (‘In the mood for love’) or Ridley Scott (‘Blade Runner’). In Macau, luminous structures prospered especially with the expansion of casinos.
But understanding the legacy of these neon signs – this new guide now tells us – forces us to go beyond nostalgia. The specimens found on “neon hunting” nights, as the designer calls them, are “clues about graphic practices, manufacturing techniques and urban transformations” in the territory.
And the clues are scarce. When Filipa Simões and the team began to carry out the survey, at the beginning of 2025, they found 57 surviving specimens in Macau – 16 already obliterated. By the end of that year, three had disappeared. “We were in disbelief”, he recalls, noting that the itinerary includes 45 signals, seven of which are permanently turned off. However, two were removed after the guide was printed.
"There are a series of objects, artefacts of urban culture that are disappearing, because of globalization. We are trying to make records and start to study them", he continues.
But unlike Hong Kong, working to remember this declining heritage has its obstacles. In the former British colony, it is still possible to knock on the door of a master craftsman. In 2015, in Macau, recalls Filipa Simões, CURB coordinated a project for the Biennale of Urbanism and Architecture in Shenzhen that involved the production of neons and, of the approximately two dozen businesses that appeared in the yellow pages, only one was still working in the craft. Today, it also closed its doors.
The tightening of regulations for the display of signs in Hong Kong, more than ten years ago, for safety reasons, led to the removal of thousands of signs in the city – including neon signs. “It's a fragile technique in a place where there are typhoons”, says Filipa Simões, who believes that, in Macau, the economic issue – with the emergence of cheaper options such as LED lights – weighed in on the decision.
“Neons require maintenance, they use a lot more electricity, they get damaged and people would have to call someone from [mainland] China”, he explains.
For those who are more attentive, the difference between the two techniques is noticeable: the vibration, the noise, the bending of the glass are characteristics of neon signs, whose technique involves molding glass tubes with a blowtorch, filling them with noble gases – for example, neon, argon or helium, which are responsible for obtaining different colors – at low pressure and sealing with electrodes. The high electrical voltage ionizes the gas and generates vibrant light.
"Preservation work must be done. The minimum is to create an archive. If possible, save physical objects", says the designer, noting that promoting the use of neon can include new approaches, but also the maintenance of traditional advertising facades, with security guarantees.
From a total of 45 neon signs, the guide includes the iconic signs of the Federal restaurant, the Alegria cinema, the Lisboa casino and the first casino in North American capital in Macau, Sands. With the lights off, you can still find the inscription of the Pakapiu lottery store, the canidrome, now inactive, and the Tai Peng household appliances business, which recently closed.
The sign of the old Capitol cinema is also there, partially illuminated – if it weren't for this electrical failure, it would be one of the city's hallmarks.

The Consulate General of Mozambique in Macau has appealed for donations, both monetary and in kind, for the victims of the floods that have affected the Portuguese-speaking African country in recent weeks, causing at least 14 deaths. In a statement, Consul General Rodrigues Muêbe asked for “humanitarian and solidarity support from public-private institutions, associations and people of good will in Macau and the Greater Bay Area”. Support can be monetary or in the form of “clothes, hygiene materials, medicines, non-perishable food, teaching material, household utensils [and] agricultural production material”. The objective is to “help victims of floods and floods to lift their lives”, faced with a “situation that arises from the effects of climate change”, he lamented. Monetary donations will be accepted in the consulate's accounts at Banco Nacional Ultramarino, while donations in kind will be sent to a collection point in Guangzhou. On Tuesday, Mozambique valued the infrastructure destroyed and affected by the floods at US$644 million, with the Government putting forward a reconstruction plan. The death toll from the floods in recent weeks in Mozambique rose to 14, with almost 692,000 people affected, according to provisional data from the National Institute for Disaster Risk Management and Reduction. The floods left almost 155,000 homes flooded, 3,447 partially damaged and 771 completely destroyed. The data also shows 45 injured and four missing. The European Union, the United States, Portugal, Norway and Japan, in addition to neighboring countries in southern Africa, have already announced and sent emergency humanitarian aid.</description><pubDate>2026-01-29 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>BRIEF</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/breves-2538/</link><description>Derby Lau leaves Correios after 16 years

Habits that are difficult to break, but are slowly decreasing. The scenario of infractions due to “lack of civility” in the territory is clearly better than it was around 10 years ago. Representative Nick Lei and environmentalist Joe Chan praise the steps taken, but consider that Macau can do more.
Over the past year, 16,102 infractions were recorded within the scope of the General Regulation of Public Spaces, which reflects a decrease of 43% in relation to the 28,362 cases recorded in 2016. In the year 2025, in fact, this type of infractions registered a minimum since at least that year, according to data analyzed by the TRIBUNA DE MACAU newspaper.
In the annual comparison, there was a decrease of 9.18% in relation to the 17,730 infractions recorded by the Institute for Municipal Affairs (IAM) in 2024. In 2023, 17,046 infractions had been recorded in this context.
Environmentalist Joe Chan considers that, “in the last decade, through education and legislation, the Macau Government has managed to increase awareness about public hygiene and cleanliness in the city”. From the outset, he points out that the IAM has “many programs” related to cleaning the city aimed at students and citizens, in addition to that the Environmental Protection Services Directorate “has also launched many new policies that help the public to recycle waste and deal with waste in a much more appropriate way”.
“Therefore, I definitely appreciate all the efforts that the Government has made to make this city a cleaner and healthier place to live,” he said, speaking to this newspaper. Joe Chan, however, argues that common infractions, whose fine varies between 300 and 600 patacas, should be sanctioned with 1,500 patacas, as is the case with the fine for smoking in prohibited places, under the Smoking Prevention and Control Law.
Over the past year, the fines paid due to the application of the General Regulations on Public Spaces yielded 7.1 million patacas to the IAM. Even though 16,102 infractions and fines were recorded in 2025, only 11,586 or 72% of the total were paid, a discrepancy that could be related to cases that had the fine sanction postponed until the following year, because they were under investigation, defense or challenge, as the organization explained to this newspaper in previous years, or even because the IAM may have decided, ultimately, not to apply the sanction after further investigation. in-depth.
Violators can choose to participate in social service programs in lieu of paying fines – but this form of penalty is only applicable to residents. In 2025, a total of 32 offenders participated in the civic service scheme, 16 fewer than the 48 recorded in 2024.
In the same vein, Nick Lei states that “the decreasing trend in the number of infractions shows that awareness has increased among the public and we have also achieved these results thanks to the awareness-raising actions promoted over the years”. The deputy, who was already part of the IAM Advisory Council, therefore praises the organization's work in this area. Furthermore, he believes that the data reflects “an attitude of respect” on the part of the public towards the regulation.
 
54% of fines include throwing rubbish and spitting on the ground
The more than 16,100 fines carried out last year included 8,646 cases of “abandonment of any solid waste”, which registered an annual increase of 5.3%. The reported cases of people throwing rubbish on the ground represented almost 54% of the total. Situations of “spitting or release of nasal mucus” totaled 2,123 (-21.3 in annual terms). These two behaviors alone accounted for 10,769 fines (67% of the total).
“Other” cases followed – which include, for example, “illegal fishing activity, illegal act of harvesting or damaging plants, wiping objects in public space, choosing waste contained in garbage containers” -, with a total of 2,760 fines (-27.2%). Statistical data also points to 2,289 situations of “placement or abandonment of any materials or objects” (-27.2%), 168 of “falling water from an air conditioning unit” (-68.8%) and 116 of “pet waste” (+43.2%).
Nick Lei highlights, however, that “the changes were not significant in relation to the main types of infractions”. On the other hand, it highlights the “evident decrease”, for example, that occurred in some categories, such as “others”. The “fall of water drops from the air conditioning unit” also marked a significant drop in the space of a year. “I believe that this drop contributed to the general trend of decreasing the number of criminal cases”, added the deputy.
It is recalled that, last year, the then Secretary for Administration and Justice, André Cheong, argued that the amount of fines provided for in the Regulation is “manifestly incompatible with the current socioeconomic level”, indicating that the regime would be subject to review.
In this regard, Nick Lei says that he receives “a lot of opinions” related to the problem of water dripping from the air conditioning. “In some cases, the problem does not occur on the streets, but in common spaces of residential buildings, which implies difficulties in enforcing the law,” he noted. In this sense, he states that these cases deserve “consideration by the authorities”.
"Will the Government consider defining provisions to regulate this problem in the future revision of the regulation? We need to discuss this issue. We must take as a reference the new tobacco control law, within the scope of which authorities can apply the law in the common spaces of residential buildings", he defended.
 
Increase awareness towards a sustainable city
Nick Lei states, on the other hand, that he hopes that “the authorities reinforce the level of education and awareness regarding the regulation of public spaces among citizens”. Stressing that the regulation has been in force for more than 20 years, the deputy emphasizes that “society has already evolved and the conditions for applying the law have already become very different from the conditions observed more than two decades ago”.
Joe Chan, in turn, says that “in the future, our city must evolve into a more sustainable or ecological city, instead of just a clean city”. “Such as increasing the percentage of recycling, using more renewable energy that makes the air cleaner, or even aiming to build a garden city with more plantations... All of this requires continuous education and legislation, regular and updated reviews on the value of fines and the waste management policy”, concluded the environmentalist.
From another perspective, looking at the IAM data it can be seen that 6,891 offenses were committed by Macau residents, while 9,211 were perpetrated by non-residents.
The data also reveals that people continue to prefer to pay fines in person, as 7,029 were paid over the counter, for a total of 4.4 million patacas. Fines paid via the internet totaled just 4,557, for a total of around 2.7 million patacas.
Last year, January was the month in which the most fines were made, with a total of 2,015, followed by March, with 1,822. October and November recorded the lowest numbers with 1,183 and 1,053 fines, respectively.
The regulation, which has been in force since 2004, and the “Catalogue of Infractions” have established the amounts of fines depending on the classification as common infractions (300 or 600 patacas), serious (from 700 to 2,500 patacas or from 700 to 5,000) and very serious (between 2,000 and 5,000 patacas or from 2,000 to 10,000).</description><pubDate>2026-01-28 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Nipah leads authorities to reinforce medical assessment at borders</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/nipah-leva-autoridades-reforcar-avaliacao-medica-nas-fronteiras/</link><description>Due to Nipah virus infections detected in India, Macau authorities decided to reinforce medical surveillance at the borders, despite there being no direct flights from the territory to that country. Stressing that they are monitoring the situation, the Health Services indicated that they will intensify assessment and medical examinations at border posts “for those who have a history of travel and present symptoms”

Macao SAR authorities will reinforce border surveillance due to the Nipah virus, following an epidemiological alert launched by Indian health authorities. The virus, which was identified in the state of West Bengal, has already resulted in at least two confirmed cases and led to the quarantine of 190 people. The Health Services (SSM) said yesterday that it was “closely monitoring the situation” caused by the virus infection in eastern India, appealing to residents to “avoid traveling to that region”.
“Individuals who are there must take appropriate preventive measures and, if flu symptoms appear after returning to Macau, they should consult a doctor as soon as possible and inform them of their travel and contact history”, highlighted the organization.
Although there are no direct flights between Macau and India, “as a matter of precaution, assessment and medical examinations will be reinforced at border posts for those who have a history of travel and present symptoms”, indicated the SSM.
The Hong Kong Government also announced a reinforcement of health controls for travelers arriving at the airport from India. In a statement, cited by Lusa, the director of the Health Protection Service, Edwin Tsui Lok Kin, confirmed the deployment of teams to the airport.
The objective is to “screen the temperature of travelers at relevant boarding gates, carry out medical assessments on symptomatic travelers and refer suspected cases with a potential impact on public health to hospitals for examination”, explained the director.
Despite the measure, Edwin Tsui highlighted that, to date, no case of Nipah virus infection has been recorded in Hong Kong and that there are no direct flights between the territory and Calcutta, capital of the Indian state of West Bengal.
Here, the SSM state that Nipah is a zoonotic virus that can be fatal. “Frugivorous bats are the natural hosts of the Nipah virus, and it can be transmitted to humans through contaminated food (usually fruit or fruit-derived products) or through contact with infected pigs, or directly between people”, he highlights.
Nipah virus infection causes everything from asymptomatic symptoms to acute respiratory illnesses and fatal encephalitis, with an estimated mortality rate of between 40% and 75%. The first symptoms are similar to those of the flu, and in more serious cases there may be breathing difficulties, dizziness, drowsiness, mental confusion, among others. Generally, the incubation period varies between four and 14 days, with a maximum of 45 days.
Outbreaks of the Nipah virus, for which there is still no approved vaccine or cure, occur almost annually in Bangladesh and the neighboring Indian state of West Bengal, and occasionally in other countries in South and Southeast Asia. India recorded the first human outbreaks in West Bengal in 2001 and 2007, when at least 50 deaths were recorded. The most recent outbreak, in July 2015, resulted in two deaths in the southern state of Kerala.
 
WHO believes India will be able to stop the outbreak
The World Health Organization (WHO) considers the risk of expansion in India of the Nipah virus, a highly lethal pathogen for which there is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment, to be “low” after the confirmation of two cases in the state of West Bengal and the declaration of an epidemiological alert by Indian authorities. “India has the capacity to contain these outbreaks, as has been proven in past cases,” said a spokesperson for the UN agency in response to EFE, ensuring that the WHO has been in contact with Indian health authorities to carry out a risk assessment and provide technical support.</description><pubDate>2026-01-28 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>In Indonesia, faith and fun create controversy in the Islamic world</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/lazer/na-indonesia-fe-diversao-criam-polemica-mundo-islamico/</link><description>One song, one stage and one sensual dress were enough to spark a national debate about the limits between faith and fun.
In Banyuwangi, (East Java), a stage was set up to celebrate Isra’ Mi’raj, one of the holiest nights in Islam, which commemorates the Prophet Muhammad’s journey from Mecca to the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem and his ascension to heaven. The place was intended for sermons and prayers.
On January 16, what followed the sermons and prayers was something completely different: a dangdut singer in a tight dress took the stage, her hips swaying to the lively rhythm of modern dance in the Osing dialect, and a man joined in to dance and tip her.
Someone filmed everything. Within hours, the video spread across social media, disturbing many people.
Isra’ Mi’raj is solemn, while dangdut performances thrive on physical proximity and interaction with the audience. For critics, the two worlds collided.
Organizers insisted there was no disrespect. Muhammad Hadiyanto, head of the local committee, said that before the music began, the religious program had ended and the clerics had left. The presentation, according to him, was only intended to entertain the members of the committee during the cleaning.
The apology did little to quell the outrage. Religious leaders considered it a moral failure.
“This incident is deeply regrettable,” said Sunandi Zubaidi, vice president of the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI) of Banyuwangi. “The nobility of dakwah (Islamic preaching) has been tarnished by actions that do not reflect Islamic values.”
He warned that sacred events should not be mixed with acts that lead to immorality, including the exposure of the aurat (intimate parts of the body according to Islam), erotic dancing and ikhtilat (mixing between men and women). He even warned that such actions could constitute blasphemy.
Parliament echoed the concern. MP Singgih Januratmoko said the issue goes to the heart of how society protects the sanctity of religion. “The allegation that the entertainment took place after the main event does not resolve the issue in itself”, he stressed, arguing that, “from a religious point of view, the setting, symbols and context are inseparable”.
The police said that no crime was committed, but it was confirmed that the show was not included in the event license.
Organizers must understand the nature of an event and ensure presentations are aligned with its concept and audience. For religious occasions, this may mean selecting styles of “religious music,” such as percussion ensembles, modestly dressed singers or religious songs, Said noted.
"When a video goes viral, people only see what happens on stage. They don't see the preparation behind the scenes – the coordination, the briefings, the warnings. Yet the public's reaction is often: 'Why is dangdut like this?'" he added.
Dangdut, one of the most popular musical genres in Indonesia, is built on hypnotic rhythms, similar to tabla, and mixes Indian percussion, Malay melodies and Arabic phrases. It emerged in the 1930s and gained prominence in the 1950s during President Sukarno's anti-Western cultural campaign, which restricted Hollywood films but allowed Hindi cinema. In the 1960s, local singers began to appear, although the genre remained closely linked to villages and lower social classes.
In the 1970s, Indonesian Rhoma Irama, the “King of Dangdut”, electrified dangdut with guitars and rock influences, inspired by bands like Deep Purple, taking the genre beyond rural communities. He renamed his group, Soneta, as “The Voice of the Muslim”, fusing dangdut with Islamic themes, introduced the separation of genres on stage and replaced rock elements with religious-themed performances.
The first concerts were met with hostility, with stones and sandals thrown onto the stage. Initially, MUI (Municipal Indonesia University) declared singing verses from the Quran haram – prohibited by Islamic law – but later endorsed the work of the dangdut legend.
Like other Indonesian musical art forms such as jaipongan and campursari, dangdut has increasingly incorporated sexually suggestive lyrics and sensual dances, movements that test limits in the world's largest Muslim-majority nation.
"This art exists because there is an audience for it. The issue is not the taste, but the location. In a religious event, I would say that this type of performance is highly inappropriate, indecent and inappropriate" concluded ethnomusicologist Endo Suanda.
