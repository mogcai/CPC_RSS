For Lam Lon Wai, vice president of Faom, the transition time is sufficient, but the process of transforming workers' associations to unions could be “relatively slow” and “slightly difficult” in the early stages. In turn, José Pereira Coutinho, president of ATFPM, maintains the decision not to join the constitution of a union
 
Under the union law, which came into force on Monday, the associations of workers, constituted and registered under the legal terms before the law entered into force, can register the union during the transition period, which began on January 1 this year and will end on December 31, 2027. According to an answer sent by the Directorate of Services for Laboral Affairs (DSS) to the Jornal de Macau, until 26 March, the body received. Only one request for union registration, which is under consideration. Dsal also said that the request does not imply any association of foreign nation workers.
In turn, Lam Lon Wai, vice president of the Federation of Macao Workers' Associations (Faom), indicated that, until yesterday, three associations of Faom subordinate workers were preparing for union registration. However, he pointed out that "it is difficult to predict" the tendency to transform or not of seven dozen associations of subordinate workers of Faom for unions, which, he said, will also depend on communication with the associations themselves and the government.
The associative leader foresees that the process of transforming union associations could be “relatively slow” and “a little difficult” at this initial phase, during which Faom has been helping some to decide what would be the most appropriate form of passage.
Speaking to this newspaper, Lam Lon Wai predicted that there may be few requests for union registration at the beginning, but stressed the importance of “accumulating little experience”, including Dsal's opinion exchanges on “details related to the statutes provided for by law” so that “more workers' associations can require [union registration] following our experience”.
"We consider that union law is a first responsibility of Faom. Even if in Macau no one gives attention [to the union law], we will actively collaborate [with the law]… For us, the deadline until 2027 allows enough time," he added.
Under the law, associations not registered as unions cannot treat and negotiate matters relating to individual conflicts or labor disputes representing associates. Faced with this reality, Lam Lon Wai stressed that, even without the competence of rights protection, associations can still help workers in other aspects.
"If you really need the protection of rights, you can also resort to other professionals, for example, lawyers. Under unions may be the most direct way, but there are many channels for the protection of rights," added Faom vice president.
He explained, workers' associations may adopt three forms of transformation. First, some of the qualified workers' associations will be selected to constitute unions. For example, the General Association of Manufacturing Industry Workers will request the union registration with the help of Faom, as there are still workers in the production line of gastronomic memories.
On the other hand, he said, some will be subject to a “direct transition” to unions, such as the Association of Employees of CEM and SAAM, whose members are all active workers of these companies. But the respective works have not yet begun.
The third hypothesis is that new associations directly register as unions. In this regard, the deputy of the Legislative Assembly (AL) noted that, last year, it was almost impossible new associations to register, which, in his opinion, must be related to the union law. According to Faom, in late 2024, Faom founded a new organization that joins computer workers, which, however, could not yet be registered as an association. The plan is to request a union registration directly, it continued.
On the other hand, some workers' associations will stop working under this model, but will become common associations responsible for promoting associative activities, without supporting members at the level of rights protection. "For example, the association of clothing articles workers will follow this path, as there are currently few workers who work in clothing factories. It will not become a union," he said.
 
ATFPM maintains a decision not to join the union
José Pereira Coutinho, president of the Macao Public Function Workers Association (ATFPM), told the Jornal Tribuna de Macao that the issue of the association's transformation into a union “is a closed issue”. "Weighted the legislation in question, we realize that it is more convenient to continue as a mere association," said the deputy to AL, who unsuccessfully presented eight projects to create a union law in Macao that contemplated, for example, the right to strike and collective labor bargaining. The law in force does not include these aspects.
He said, transforming the ATFPM into a union "only if there is improvements in the sense that there is actually an added value." "A good example would be to take as a reference to Portuguese legislation, which is better adapted and which in fact allows unions to do work in defending the fundamental rights of workers, in terms of representativeness, and without any intervention of any service that is in their activity," he explained, "something that does not happen at this time."
This is because, Pereira Coutinho noted, "Dsal can at any time apply sanctioning fines for the exercise of union activity." As an association, ATFPM “can make its activity freely and without any pressure,” he said.
 
Four deaths since 2018 related to bamboo scaffolding
Since 2018, four “serious” work accidents have been registered with bamboo scaffolding, indicated the direction of services for labor affairs (DSAL) to the Jornal Tribuna de Macao. According to the body, these accidents "have resulted in four dead and six injured, being the cause of accidents mainly to human fall." The Government of the MSAR says it has a "open attitude" in the face of using metal scaffolding instead of bamboo scaffolding - but for now, and unlike Hong Kong, it does not seem to have measures to end the traditional wooden scaffolding, as this newspaper reported. The association of boats indicated that, in Macao, there are rare accidents related to bamboo scaffolding and that the problems observed in the neighboring region are related to the lack of technique, something that does not happen in the MSAR. In Hong Kong, 23 people died in accident -related accidents since 2018.</description><pubDate>2025-04-02 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Operational gains rose 20% at game dealers</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/ganhos-operacionais-subiram-20-nas-concessionarias-jogo/</link><description>The joint operating results of the game dealers increased one fifth to nearly 62 billion patacas by 2024, in annual terms, with Sands and Galaxy collecting more than half of the total and MGM standing out as the only one to exceed pre-pound levels. In the game segment, Sands returned to dominate the overall revenue ranking in the most competitive year in the sector

Last year, EBITDA (results before interest, taxes, amortization and depreciation) of Macao's game concessionaires reached, as a whole, a positive balance of approximately $ 7.73 billion (61.83 billion to the current exchange rate), which is equivalent to a monthly average of 5.15 billion. According to data from the financial reports of the six companies, compiled in dollars by Deutsche Bank analyst Carlo Santarelli, operating gains rose 19.6% compared to 2023 and corresponded to 82.1% of the amount accounted for in 2019, the pre-pound year.
All operators registered EBITDA profits for the second year in a row, after the 2023 accounts reflected total gains of $ 6.46 billion (51.70 billion patacas). In 2022, the last full year under the impact of COVID-19, the scenario was quite distinct, with collective losses of $ 1.31 billion (10.48 billion patacas).
In line with the results of recent years, Sands China and Galaxy Entertainment are once again the dealers with higher EBITDA volumes, absorbing about 51% of total gains. In this domain, Sands occupied the first position, with its operational profits to grow $ 4.7% to $ 2.31 billion (18.49 billion) compared to 2023, representing 29.9% of the total, while Galaxy wrote $ 1.60 billion (12.83 billion), an annual increase of 19.4% that translated into a quota of 20.7%.
In third place comes Wynn, with gains of $ 1.18 billion (9.41 billion patacas), 15.2% of the total and plus 23.3% in the annual variation. MGM EBITDA ($ 1.16 billion or 9.29 billion patacas) increased by 25.5% in a year and corresponded to 15% of the total, and was the only one to exceed the 2019 mark, and for a large margin (plus 48.9%).
The operating result of Melco Resorts &amp; Entertainment also grew above average, advancing 22.4% to $ 990 million (7.92 billion patacas), or 12.8% of the total. SJM Holdings was more modest in absolute terms, with gains of $ 486 million or 3.89 billion patacas to ensure only a share of 6.3%, however, recorded the most significant annual growth (plus 117.9%).
In the fourth quarter of 2024 alone, EBITDA gains of the six operators of the game totaled $ 1.90 billion (15.22 billion patacas), less 2.1% in the annual homologous comparison. Between October and December, Sands ($ 566 million) and Galaxy (414 million) again dominated this financial aspect, ahead of Wynn (293 million), MGM (274 million), Melco (227 million) and SJM (128 million). MGM was once again the only operator to exceed the pre-covid level, specifically 38.4%.
In early February this year, the consultant Seport Research Partners estimated that the operating gains of game dealers could increase 9% to almost 68 billion patacas by 2025. Combined EBITDA could approach 80 billion patacas by 2027, translating an annual growth rate composed of 9% in the period between 2024 and 2027, according to the report signed by Analyst Umansky, whose projection is based on a scenario of “7% growth of gross game revenues in 2025 and in the coming years”.
On the other hand, convinced that revenues will be higher than the costs and the reinvestment will remain “relatively stable” in relation to the percentage of gross casinos billing, some predicted that the sector's ebitda margins-an important profitability indicator, as they establish a relationship between net revenues and operational gains-could increase 28.5% by 2025 and 29% by 2026, 2026, However, below the 2019 levels remain.
Despite the higher business diversification, EBITDA margin dropped from 29.5% in 2019 to 28.4% by 2023 and 28% in 2024, the analyst said, associating the descent with increased reinvestment and operating costs after postpandeia “reopening” at the beginning of 2023.
 
The most balanced year in the distribution of revenues
The same data also prove that competition in the game market continued to intensify in 2024, with differences in operators' invoicing it, including as the lowest ever. The first and sixth operators' quotas were separated by only 10.8 points, well below the 14.5 points interval recorded in 2023.
Despite the growing balance, Sands China renewed the status of the game's general leader last year, with the traditional weight in the mass market to compensate for land loss in the VIP segment, which had also dominated in 2023. The five casinos explored with the license detained by Venetian Macau won 24% of the total gross recipes on the local market, less percentage points than 2023.
The gross recipes of the Sands game ciphed at about 53.96 billion patacas, illustrating an annual increase of 11.9% and a postpandeia of 77.8%. The final billing included 49.20 billion mass market patacas and 4.75 billion from VIP, amounts that represented quotas of 24.9% and 17.5%, respectively.
Galaxy Entertainment retained the second position of the ranking, with revenues close to 42.49 billion patacas (plus 29.8% in one year and 30.7% compared to 2019), and saw its general quota rise 0.9 points to 18.9%. The group's four casinos generated 36.98 billion patacas in the mass market (18.7% of the total) and 5.51 billion in the VIP game (20.2% of the total).
With only two casinos, MGM consolidated third place in the “cake” of revenues, with almost 35.77 billion patacas (15.9% of the total, or 0.7 points than in 2023), registering growth of 29.3% and 28.8% compared to the previous year and 2019, respectively. MGM has won 16% quotas in the mass market and 15.3% in the VIP variant.
In fourth place in the general table, Melco raised 33.02 billion patacas, marking an annual increase of 24.5% and a 30.7% break compared to 2019. Melco's game share, which has four casinos, was 14.7% (more 0.1 points than in 2023), including 14.2% in the mass market and 18.4% in VIP.
Already the 13 casinos in the SJM universe closed 2024 with gross revenues of 29.76 billion patacas (an annual rise of 35.9% and a break of 27.9% compared to 2019), obtaining a global quota of almost 13.3%, more 1.3 points than in 2023, covering 13.7% in the mass market and 10.2% in VIP.
Finally, Wynn Macau's revenues rose 21.7% to 29.66 billion patacas in homologous terms, however, the global quota retreated 0.2 points to 13.2 points, combining 12.5% ​​and 18.4% slices in mass and VIP markets respectively. The revenues of the two Wynn casinos decreased 30.3% compared to the pre-covid era.
 
Casinos revenues reached almost 20 billion in March
Macao casinos registered gross revenues of 19,659 million Patacas in March, which represents a monthly decrease of 0.4%, an annual increase of 0.8% and equals 76.1% of the level reached in the same period of 2019, according to data released yesterday by the Directorate of Inspection and Coordination of Games (DICJ). In the first quarter of 2025, revenues ciphed at 57,657 million, which translates an annual rise of 0.6% and corresponds to 75.7% of the amount invoiced between January and March 2019.

Benjamin Chan confirmed the departure of the monetary authority of Macau (AMCM), after eight years as president. In January, the Jornal Tribuna de Macao had already reported that Benjamin Chan should be replaced by the presidency of AMCM's Board of Directors by Henrietta Lau, a current administrator for the bank. For now, as for the successor to the position, nothing was announced by the authorities.
It was in an interview with Hong Kong Economic Journal, quoted by the 61 -year -old Macau News Agency, announced that he would leave office without, however, to present reasons for it. It is recalled that last year, the previous Secretary for Economics and Finance, Law Wai Nong, renewed Chan's mandate at the head of AMCM for a year, with effect from August.
In the interview, Chan expressed gratitude to colleagues and mentors over the years and specifically recalled the 1998 financial crisis and the challenges to maintain the stability of the financial market at the time. He also thanked the guidance and support he received from colleagues and leaders from the sector throughout his career, attributing them to the merit of his achievements.
Looking to the future, he said he plans to devote himself to the domain of education, focusing on feeding the next generation of talents. It also expressed the desire to contribute to Hong Kong's future growth.
Last week, it was also known that Benjamin Chan was dismissed, at his request, to the exercise of the chairman of the Board of Directors of the Macao Unipessoal Society Limited Society, from 1 April.
Born in Macao, Chan moved to Hong Kong at age 12, where he continued his studies. He obtained his doctorate in economics and finance from the University of Hong Kong and the master's degree in Economics at the University of Warwick, England.
Upon completion of his doctorate, Chan returned to his homeland in 1998 and began teaching at the University of Macao Faculty of Business Management, having assumed the administrative functions of vice president of the College Management Committee. In February 2001, he was transferred to AMCM as director of the Department of Research and Statistics. He was appointed a member of the AMCM Board of Directors in August 2015 and since August 2017 he was chairman of the Board of Directors.</description><pubDate>2025-04-02 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Advisory group looking for young people “patriots”</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/grupo-consultivo-procura-jovens-patriotas/</link><description>To listen to the voices of young people on issues such as education, employment, home purchase, DSEDJ will create a young man's advisory group, being recruiting participants.

The government will create a young man's advisory group to listen to the voices of this population layer in various areas of life and, for this, are looking for members, who have to be, from the outset, “patriots”, according to a statement from the Directorate of Youth Education and Development Services (DSEDJ). Members may be recommended by youth associations and university student unions, but can also apply at their own initiative.
According to DSEDJ, young people must be between 18 and 30 years old, and they need to recognize “the fundamental values ​​of loving the country and macau”, and should have experience in social services, especially in the field of youth, as well as being “familiar with policies and matters related to the Youth of the Government of MSAR” and have “good skills of communication, understanding and analysis”.
The aim is to create a platform and an opportunity "for young people in Macao to present their opinions and suggestions on education, employment, home creation, acquisition of home, self-development, policies and measures of the government government-related, as well as their participation in the development of the great bay and international affairs."
Pointing out that “the government has been making efforts to do a good work in the area of ​​youth”, DSEDJ states that the idea with the creation of this group is “to hear more the voices of young people, increase the channels of positive interaction between young people and the government”, in line with the political orientation of “reinforcing social participation and integrating into the development of the country” in the “youth policy of Macau (2021-20)”.
The candidacy period runs until April 11, and the youth associations and the university students of Macao who want to appoint young people to participate in the program can obtain the application form with the DSEDJ. Young people who, on their own initiative, want to register can do so via the single account, for example.
The body states that pre-selected young people will then participate in a simulated group meeting to hold at the end of April, so that the first members of the Advisory Group are selected, and the final list will be announced on the DSEDJ website later.
 
170 students trained the flag
A total 170 students, from seven higher education institutions and 35 school units of secondary education, participated in another edition of Flag Handling Training, in the Taipa Barracks. The organization was up to youth education and development services, in conjunction with the Macao garrison of the Chinese popular liberation army. The idea is that students understand the meaning of the national flag, increasing their sense of identity, belonging and pride in relation to China. At this year's ceremony, the students first watched the flag by the troops parked in the territory, then followed the training, which included a movement of training and the flag. In addition, they also had the opportunity to visit the Exhibition Salon, with the military explained to the details about the national flag, the national anthem and the national emblem.</description><pubDate>2025-04-02 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>US business partners await new Trump fares</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/ultimas/parceiros-comerciais-dos-eua-aguardam-novas-tarifas-de-trump/</link><description>EPA12002081 US President Donald Trump Speaks During an Executive Order signing in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, DC, USA, 31 March 2025.

US business partners were preparing yesterday for a new customs of Donald Trump's customs tariffs, which promises to be "very kind." The Republican tycoon is expected to present so -called “reciprocal tariffs”, with which he expects to correct commercial imbalances that he considers unfair.
Other countries “took advantage of us, and we will be very kind to them, compared to what they did to us,” he said on Monday, without revealing many details about the scope of new tariffs. They will be "smaller" and, in some cases, "significantly smaller" than those imposed by other countries, he said.
Critics warn that the new tariffs, which join taxes on steel and aluminum and those already announced on vehicle imports, threaten to trigger a global trade war. China has already imposed additional rates on American products and the European Union asserted yesterday that it has a “solid” plan to retaliate.
On the weekend, China, South Korea and Japan agreed to accelerate negotiations on a tripartite free trade agreement. However, Trump does not seem concerned that his measures push his allies towards Beijing, his main economic rival.
So far, Trump has promised “reciprocal” tariffs, which means each country would pay the same amount for the US products that charges for American products.
White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said they will be announced “specific tariffs for each country”, which can be accompanied by rates determined for each sector. "Any country that has been unfairly behaved with Americans should expect to receive a tariff in return on Wednesday," he said.
According to the Wall Street Journal, the president's advisers advocate 20% general rates on almost all US business partners.
Uncertainty has taken over the markets, with pronounces accentuated in the actions. Still, after Trump's “kindness” promises, Asian actions recorded a slight recovery on Tuesday.
Trump's insistence on imposing customs tariffs increases fears of a US recession. Goldman Analysts Sachs raised from 20 to 35% the likelihood of an economic contraction in the next 12 months.
Already the director of the International Monetary Fund, Kristalina Georgieva, does not predict "drastic consequences" for the world economy, "but a small downward correction."
From tomorrow, the US also plans to impose a 25% tariff on vehicles and components made abroad. The decision particularly affects Canada and Mexico, their partners in the North America Free Trade Agreement (T-MEC) and where US manufacturers have facilities.
Some countries with the largest commercial surplus with the US already work to contain the coup. Japan announced yesterday that it will establish 1,000 “consultation centers” for affected companies and Vietnam, with the third largest commercial surplus with the US, announced the reduction of import rates of various products, such as vehicles and ethanol.
Trump is obsessed with the scenario where the US imports more than export. For him, this proves that countries abuse access to the US market. In addition to customs rates, it is concerned with regulatory barriers, particularly the value added tax that Europeans apply to many products.
Trump's goal is to finance at least the tax cuts he wants to apply to Americans. From his perspective, the increase in prices due to the rates will be offset by the higher purchasing power, thanks to less fiscal pressure and the fall of some prices through a favorable policy to fossil fuels.

The resident of Macao who killed another resident in Gongbei, with scissors, saw the prison sentence reduced to almost 14 years. The case dates back to July 2023, after an alcohol dinner with several friends across the border. "For trivial reasons erupted a dispute between the two, which became increasingly severe," he then resulted in death, recalls the office of the president of the last court (Tui).
The attacker "took a scissors of a fruit store with which he gave several blows to the left side of his chest, arm and forearm and thumb of the left hand", which "fell to the floor and crawled back." Despite his state, the man still struck him "kicks very hard and gave him three blows with the scissors inside and outside the right thigh."
After that, the resident entered Macao at 4:35 am and called an ambulance to undergo medical treatment for the Conde de São Januário hospital lesions. Around 7:03 am, he went to Hong Kong through the Delta Bridge. At night, when he returned to the territory, he was then intercepted by the police.
The Public Prosecution Service deduced prosecution and the case was referred to the Base Judicial Court (TJB), which condemned him, for the practice of material authorship and the consummate form of a crime of murder, to 15 years in effective arrest, as well as the payment of compensation to the deceased's woman, in the amount of 2.2 million patacas, plus interest. Disagreeing, the defendant appealed to the second instance court, which dismissed the appeal.
He then appealed to Tui, considering that the intent or intention to kill "should not be proved, arguing for the conviction as the perpetrator of a crime of serious offense to physical integrity aggravated by the outcome of death." However, the collective court pointed out that, "in the face of the environment, it is evident that [the defendant] could not fail to know that such conduct was able to cause death".
"Even if it claimed that they had consumed alcohol and that, before assaulting, the police had been called, such circumstances are not valid and effective to exclude their guilt as to the conduct and responsibility," it may be read, adding that the warning given to the police "is not a guarantee of survival provided by him" to the deceased or that the man would not die as a result of the aggression.
Still, the TUI did not consider that the defendant's conduct expressed themselves "direct intent", recognized by the TJB, but "eventual deceit". For this reason, and given “the fact that it was primary, a moderate reduction in the penalty was possible”. Instead of the 15 years in actual arrest, he was then sentenced to a 13 -year and nine months prison sentence.

The Cultural Institute also issued “specific protection requirements” of heritage constructions along the coast, but did not detail which

Currently, the construction works of the flood prevention dike in the west of Coloane will allow, at the top of that structure, the creation of a running track or rail. The revelation is from the Institute for Municipal Affairs (AMI), inserted in the response to an interpellation of Deputy Lei Chan U.
Citing information from the Directorate of Public Works Services (DSOP), AMI states that the top of the dam, which is in the first phase of construction, is six meters wide and, in consideration of the preliminary conception, will then be used as a place of sports practitioners for outdoor athletics.
In the response signed by Chao Wai Ieng, chairman of the Board of Directors for Municipal Affairs, it is stressed that "later, it will continue to maintain a deepened communication with the competent services and to hear the opinions of the various sectors of the company, in order to finalize the said conception project."
Following a series of initial phase works, including preliminary conception, several thematic studies and geotechnical prospecting, the first phase of the work involved in water, including the construction of flood prevention dike with about 1,200 meters in full length, four -floodded and watershed in the hengqin side. The works consist of the excavation of dike, the removal of the mud on the lake with about 130 thousand cubic meters, the treatment of foundations and in the construction of the structure of the Dike's 'Box Culvert', among others.
DSOP had already stated that the first phase will be performed only at sea, so it will not impact the coastal environment.
Also the Cultural Institute (IC), in response to the newspaper Cheng Pou, points out that, as this work will be carried out mainly above sea, the location of the contract does not involve the protected scope of cultural heritage. “In order to ensure the safety of property constructions along the coast, the IC has already issued specific protection requirements for competent services,” says the body, without, however, detailing the requirements.
Regarding the flood prevention work in the Lai Chi Vun area, “in the current phase, the IC and DSOP are communicating and coordinating the details of their work and will later alert opinions of relevant institutions, according to the actual situation and needs,” says the response from the Cultural Institute.
The works are being coordinated with China's hydraulic and border entities on the works related to sea operations, navigation and border safety, as well as take references from the practical experiences on the access bridge that connects the University of Macao and the Hengqin Border Post and the Light Metro Hengqin line project.
On other issues raised in the interpellation of Chau U law, AMI says it is doing a deepened conception of the “connecting access work between the Marginal Leisure Zone and Lotus Flower Cycle Lotus in Taipa - Project and Geotechnical Prospecting Services”. Regarding the bike path bridge, due to the adoption of a new model, AMI stresses that "it is necessary to study prudently the different prospects and maintenance expenses, among other factors, as well as maintain communication and coordination with the competent services to ensure their viability."
The AMI underlines that it has already created a provisional bike path, for the use of citizens, to make the connection between the cycle paths of the leisure zone of the marginal of the mud and the lotus flower.</description><pubDate>2025-04-02 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>“Sea” project allows 18 observation angles</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/projecto-mar-permite-18-angulos-de-observacao/</link><description>The monitoring of the maritime areas of Macao had 18 different observation chambers, after added four more angles
 
To reinforce the monitoring of the Maritime areas of Macao and allow the public to know the point of situation better, the direction of maritime and water services (DSAMA) completed the updating of the “Mar” project, launched in June 2022, which offers more real -time views of the sea.
At 14 previously existing cameras, four more were now added. The 18 angles make it possible to “appreciate a magnificent landscape of the maritime areas of Macao at different times, including the Ponte Sai Van to Dusk, the Macau Bridge, the Macao Canal, the Maritime Terminals Basins, among others,” says a note from Dsama.
The distribution of the cameras allows to know the real conditions of the maritime areas, as well as the situation of channels, the foundation of the interior port and other zones where the vessels navigate and dock more often.
In order to ensure rational use of MSAR maritime areas and ensure navigation safety, the body says it has implemented a dynamic observation: through real -time cameras at sea, periodic inspection, monitoring using unmanned aerial vehicle and hydrographic lifting. The objective is to “effectively combat” acts, such as illegal deposition or unauthorized occupation of maritime areas.
In the statement, Dsama points out that the cameras are important surveillance instruments and may play a relevant role in maritime incident response operations. "The system allows the immediate acquisition of information about the point of situation of the scene of the accident, in order to quickly mobilize resources for rescue, minimize damage and control the risks," the body says.
The system is “a strong platform for analysis and operation”, reinforcing the control capacity of maritime traffic, vessels and crew. These measures, concludes Dsama, "not only effectively ensure the safety of navigation in the maritime areas of Macao and surrounding areas, but also offers citizens a more reliable guarantee of maritime security."

This was the career of Diêgo Patriot, offensive midfielder, who returned to Brazil. The player, considered one of the most technicists who have passed through the pitch of the territory in recent times, said goodbye to the game in which Must IPO faced Chiba. The Brazilian made to the Jornal Tribuna de Macao the balance of his passage through the "king sport" of MSA and considers that "formation is bearing fruit and is the only way of local football progresses"

Diêgo Patriota, one of the most talented foreign footballers who has passed Macao in recent years, has retired and returned to Brazil. He said goodbye to a challenge against Chiba, having entered the second half and played for 18 minutes, a period of assistance for one of the team's goals in a 4-0 win.
The offensive midfielder played in the territory for 12 seasons and scored close to 200 goals, 186 of which at the service of the club where he was the most time, Chao Pak Kei (later designated by Must CPK and currently Must IPO).
Known for having “magic on the left foot”, the footballer was distinguished as “best player in the league” on three occasions (2015, 2018 and 2021), and was also consecrated as the best scorer in 2019.
The successful career began at Ka I, where Diêgo Patriota was only one time in 2013. Since then he has only nuvented CPK jersey 20.
“I think it is a positive balance in these 12 years and three months of stay in Macao football, which I will miss, but also from the city that always welcomed me so well,” he began to tell the Jornal Tribuna de Macau.
The decision to “bread the boots” at 38 and do the farewell in Macao, is the need to give more support to the family that is in Brazil. “I've been pondering my departure a few weeks ago and I decided to leave, to be closer to my family members, especially my parents,” he says, adding that the club intended him to continue.
"I take Macau in my heart, because I love this city that welcomed me and rescued in a complicated period of my personal and professional life, since I came here after a very serious knee injury, with months of stopping and uncertainty," he said.
Diêgo Patriota considers that Brazilian players are still very useful for Macao football, but their number has diminished, also because of the pandemic. “From then on it was more difficult to recruit Brazilian footballers, because the clubs themselves started to go into the process of financial recession and are not investing so much,” he says, adding that many Brazilians playing in Macau came before the pandemic, such as William Gomes, Roni, Jonathan Baptista, Bruno Figueiredo, Bruno Araújo, among others.
About the moment of local football, Diêgo Patriota understands that the association of the sport and clubs have to look more at the work that has been done by the gyms. "The issue of training is fundamental to the future and this is where one has to make the main investment," he says.
"At this moment it can be said that Macau has committed kids and that they want to actually be soccer players, as well as quality coaches, so it's time to bet strongly in training and invest in it," says the former player.
Exemplifying the bet that some clubs are making, such as Chiba, Benfica, and even Must IPO, Diêgo Patriota has no doubt that “the fruits of academies have already begun to emerge and the new generations that come will compose the senior squads of the I division teams and other racks”.
The Brazilian considers it to be difficult Macau to embark on professionalism. "Some clubs appear and disappear because of financial problems, so there is no growth, which makes their stability more complicated," he laments.
To conclude, Diêgo Patriota says he will consider one day being a coach. "I have the license and taken in Asia, but I will try to take other courses from the Brazilian Football Confederation," he said.</description><pubDate>2025-04-02 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>French French pianist acts with the Macau Orchestra</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/famoso-pianista-frances-actua-orquestra-de-macau/</link><description>Frenchman Jean-Yves Thibaudet will act in Macao on April 19, reliving the piano concert No. 5 of Camille Saint-Saens, "The Egyptian."

Since their return to power in 2021, the Talibans have imposed an ultra-rigid view of Islamic law, inspired by their previous government from 1996 to 2001. But although women should still have their body and face covered, the restrictions of the dreaded religious police do not specifically mention Burka.
Then young women are following fashions seen in many Gulf countries. Many people prefer a flowing Abaya tunic, used with a hijab head scarf and often also a facial coverage - sometimes a medical mask or a niqab veil of saudite -style fabric that exposes only the eyes.
"The new generation would never accept to use a burka, because of design and color," said Tahmina Adel, 23, in the capital Cabul.
With social networks, “everyone follows the trends,” added Mrs. Adel, who was forced to abandon her economy course because of the Taliban government's ban on women's education. “I prefer to use a Abaya because I feel comfortable with her,” she said.
The young women of Cabul and the city of Mazar-i-Sharif, in the north of the country, said that Abayas and head scarves offer more freedom of expression than burca, with variations of color, material and standard.
"Only the elders use Burka," said Mrs. Razia Khaliq, while embroidering one in a workshop in Mazar-i-Sharif.
Mrs. Khaliq began to use the flowing burka from head to 13, like her mother and grandmother before her. But your 20 -year -old daughter prefers Abaya. "Young people use Abaya because it's more comfortable," said Mrs. Khaliq.
It was strictly applied during the first Taliban government in Afghanistan, when women were whipped for not using it in public.
But the combination of Abaya and Hijab gained popularity during the government supported abroad. When the Talibans resumed Cabul in 2021, they promised to be more flexible than during their first government, when women were deprived of almost all their rights.
They gradually erased the Afghan women from public space, imposing what the United Nations called “Apartheid of Gender”. They prohibited loose head scarves, commonly used by urban women. Outdoors were placed to order women to use Burka - or Abaya, head scarf and face coverage.
A August 2024 law confirmed the restrictions imposed on men and women by the religious police. It stipulates that although women may come out "in case of necessity" should be covered.
"Whether it's a Burka or a hijab, there's no difference," said Saif Ul Islam Khyber, a spokesman for the Morality Police, officially known as the ministry for the spread of virtue and prevention of addiction.
Nasima, in her 40s, insisted that "showing her face is sin," but admitted that she sometimes wore a Abaya and a handkerchief to rid the nose and mouth of the "suffocating" burka.
Niha, 22, said he was reprimanded for not using Burka in public buildings, which are stored by the security forces of the Taliban authority. It is common to be asked to readjust the head scarf or to add a medical mask. “As soon as we enter the offices, we are mistreated,” said Niha, who did not reveal the nickname.
Hayatullah Rafiqi, Pashtun Culture expert, said Burka was "strictly imposed" during the first Taliban government - when some women were "whipped if they didn't use it" - but "today is less used." Burks vary only in color, according to the province, from blue to light brown, and from green to pink.
Gul Mohammad has been selling Burks in Cabul for 40 years and said many of them now come from China - made of nylon instead of cotton, which makes them cheaper and resistant but less breathable. "Chinese burka is very cold in winter and it's like fire in summer," Gul said. "It makes women sweat."
