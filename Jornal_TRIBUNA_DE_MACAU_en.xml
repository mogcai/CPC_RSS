On the other hand, more than 60% of respondents show a better image on social media than they have in real life.
 
In order to understand the Internet usage habits among young people and teenagers in Macau and their models of online and face-to-face interaction with different groups of people, the Chong Wa General Student Association and the Strategic Research Center for Macau Development cooperated in the development of a survey, collecting valid responses from 1,094 students from eight secondary schools in Macau.
One of the survey results shows that almost 60% of students prefer to communicate on the Internet and manage interpersonal relationships through online communication, to the detriment of face-to-face communication. This is because the teenagers surveyed value the “broader” channels available on the Internet to obtain information, share their lives and interact instantly with other people, explains the study.
Furthermore, more than 60% of secondary school students interviewed show, on social media, an “Internet image” that is better than the one they have in real life and more in line with the public’s expectations and their self-expectations. As an example, it is said that they demonstrate a more talkative, cheerful and extroverted personality.
In this regard, around 50% of respondents consider that showing a good image on social media has a positive impact on interpersonal relationships, and 40% confess that the quality of interpersonal relationships clearly influences their emotions.
Still, only less than 10% of students interviewed trust their Internet friends more. In contrast, around 63% believe more in the friends they have in real life and more than 50% choose them as their first option to talk to.
On the other hand, the study reveals that a small number of students surveyed act in a “more radical” and “more pessimistic and negative” way in the world of the Internet, which, for the association, reflects that the online sphere causes complex impacts on the self-cognition and behavior of secondary school students, which can, on the one hand, help them to increase confidence and expand interpersonal relationships and, on the other, to become pessimistic and perform negative acts.
In this sense, the Students' Association suggested that the Government make efforts to cultivate critical thinking and the ability to filter information among secondary students and to continuously guide them regarding the use of the Internet and social networks in a correct, appropriate and healthy way, so that a positive environment can be created together on social networks.</description><pubDate>2025-10-20 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Taxi driver offenses have already surpassed last year’s total</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/infraccoes-de-taxistas-ja-superaram-total-ano-passado/</link><description>The number of irregularities committed by taxi drivers continues to rise. Between January and September there were almost 1,600, a thousand more year-on-year. The volume of cases has already exceeded the total recorded throughout last year.

Irregularities committed by taxi drivers rose significantly in the first nine months of this year, with a total of 1,596 cases recorded by the Public Security Police Corps (CPSP). The volume of infractions not only more than doubled (+166%) compared to the same period last year, when there were 600, but it has already surpassed the total number of cases recorded throughout the entirety of last year (870).
According to statistical data provided by the CPSP, around 29% of cases were handed over to the Directorate of Services for Traffic Affairs (DSAT), in a total of 461, an increase of 82% compared to the same period in 2024. “Not waiting in order of arrival for customers at taxi ranks” was the most irregularity committed by taxi drivers, in particular, 933 cases were recorded, almost 60% of around 1,600 infractions.
This was followed by “refusal of transport” (377), “other irregularities” not specified by the authorities (91), “obvious route deviation” (86), “inadequate speed” (41), “abusive charging” (40), “not activating/deactivating the taximeter” (18) and “negotiating the fare” (10).
Between January and September, there were 11,086 road accidents on the territory's roads, a drop of 5.2% year-on-year, with one fatal accident being recorded. Even so, four people died in road accidents (one driver and three passengers), two more than in the same period last year.
The number of injured, in turn, increased slightly. Specifically, there were 4,102, of which 38 required hospital admission.
In relation to road accidents involving pedestrians, there were 446 incidents, an increase of 20.22%, compared to 371 in the previous year.

In a meeting with the president of the Legislative Assembly (AL) and the deputies, after the oath ceremony, the Chief Executive of the Macao SAR, Sam Hou Fai, spoke of three expectations in relation to the deputies. Furthermore, he reiterated that the composition of the Hemicycle “is more diverse” and its structure “more balanced”, “fully reflecting the broad representation and integrated quality of the Assembly”.
Regarding expectations, Sam Hou Fai said he hopes that “all deputies will perform even better the role of political leadership, legislation and supervision and as a fundamental interlocutor”. It should be remembered that, in these, which were the first elections after the revision of the Electoral Law, which reinforced the principle of “Macau governed by patriots”, 12 candidates were disqualified for allegedly “not defending the Basic Law or not being faithful to the Macao SAR”, including former deputy Ron Lam, one of the most critical voices of the Government in the AL until then.
From the outset, the Chief Executive then spoke of “further enhancing the leadership role of the AL in political terms”, explaining that the idea is to “implement in a comprehensive, precise and unshakable way the principles of ‘one country, two systems’, ‘Macau governed by its people’ and with a ‘high degree of autonomy’, persistently safeguarding the sovereignty, security and development interests of the country”.
Furthermore, the legislative body, taking into consideration the “conjuncture”, must “conscientiously fulfill its duties and functions, demonstrate responsibility and courage to take the initiative, promote patriotism and love for Macau, uphold the traditions of inclusivity and harmony, and jointly maintain favorable conditions for Macau’s long-term prosperity and stability”.
Secondly, Sam Hou Fai argued that the AL should “further enhance” its role in drafting legislation and monitoring. This includes “proactively fulfilling the legislative and supervisory functions conferred by the Constitution and the Basic Law, fully leveraging the professional expertise of the AL and working together with the executive body to, guided by the MSAR's development reform, accelerate 'the establishment, review and repeal' of legal regimes related to relevant areas”, as well as “providing a solid legal basis for the MSAR's development in all areas”.
Finally, the leader of the Macao SAR hopes that the legislative body can also further enhance its role “in terms of fundamental interlocutor”. In this context, considers Sam Hou Fai, it must “take full advantage of the broad representation of the Assembly to reinforce the collection, compilation and expression of public opinion”, as well as “guide society to form an environment for positive, objective and rational discussion”.
Furthermore, “based on pragmatism and taking into account the long-term healthy and sustainable development of the Macao SAR”, it should “propose appropriate measures to improve social benefits” and “promote the broadest possible social consensus to support the Macao SAR Government in carrying out its priority work and, together, establish a solid foundation for the long-term healthy development of society, the economy and the well-being of the population”.
Sam Hou Fai also highlighted at the meeting that, “in this new historical situation, the new AL strongly carries the expectations of both the Central Government and Macau residents”. He also said he believes that the Hemicycle will “join efforts and collaborate with the Macao SAR Government, as well as with all social sectors in Macau, to fulfill the spirit enshrined in President Xi Jinping's important speeches”.
 
Given requests and “concrete” timetables in responses to inquiries
Vong Hou Piu, deputy elected by the professional sector in indirect suffrage, hopes that, in the future, the Government can try to respond to written questions “with concrete data and calendars”, also suggesting the regular holding of talks with the Permanent Committees of the Legislative Assembly (AL) “to reinforce communication between the AL and the Government”. Loi I Weng, directly elected and linked to the Women's Association, urged the Government to create “a systematized and regular communication channel, for example, a prior communication mechanism regarding important laws for the Macao SAR”.

Judge Rui Ribeiro, of the Court of Second Instance, confirmed to Lusa, on the sidelines of a public event, that he will leave Macau at the end of this month, bringing forward the end of the commission, which ended in May 2026.
The magistrate stressed that the Macau judicial authorities “did everything” to make him change his mind, but explained that he preferred to return to Portugal now given the uncertainty regarding a possible renewal of the special license by the Superior Council of Judiciary (CSM).
With the announced departure of Rui Ribeiro, only one Portuguese judge remains in the Macau courts: Jerónimo Alberto Gonçalves Santos, president of a collective court at the Base Judicial Court (TJB).
The leader of the STJ, João Cura Mariano, who inherently also presides over the CSM, told journalists that, during a visit to Macau, he wanted to find out if the territory was interested in having Portuguese magistrates. “We are going to try to see what is really useful that they can still convey and whether they are necessary, because if they are necessary, new judges will come”, he assured.
João Cura Mariano said that this “is certainly a topic to be discussed” in meetings with the president of the Court of Final Instance (TUI), Song Man Lei, and with Sam Hou Fai, leader of the Macau Government and former president of the TUI, which were scheduled for yesterday. “I think it is very useful, because, being a former president of the court [Sam Hou Fai] he will be aware of the needs that exist”, said the Portuguese judge advisor.
But the president of the STJ highlighted that Portuguese justice is having “some difficulty in contributing judges”, due to the lack of qualified and experienced human resources. “Just now we removed a judge who had been here for many years and we needed him”, recalled João Cura Mariano.
In 2024, the CSM rejected the stay of Portuguese TJB judge Carlos Carvalho, who had been in Macau for 16 years and had been invited by the Independent Commission for the Nomination of Judges in the territory to continue for another two years. The council did not authorize the renewal of Carlos Carvalho's special license and promoted him to judge, with placement at the Court of Appeal.
Even so, João Cura Mariano assured that he was willing to help, “despite the difficulties that currently exist in Portugal in recruiting judges”. The president of the STJ highlighted the example of Timor-Leste, where there are currently “many Portuguese judges collaborating in the Timorese judicial system”, because “they are very necessary”.
The judge is in Macau to participate in the XIII Conference of the Forum of Presidents of the Supreme Courts of Justice of Portuguese-speaking Countries and Territories, which will take place today and tomorrow, according to a statement from the TUI president's office. Representatives will discuss and exchange opinions on the topic “Law and Justice as a factor in bringing people together and their economic and social development”.

The event also served to publicize the company's long-term strategy with regard to talent development
 
Sands China held a graduation ceremony at the Londoner for the 154 recent graduates who completed the summer internship program at the company's establishments. The gaming operator also took the opportunity to promote its long-term talent development strategy to government entities, educational institutions and industry partners, according to a press release.
During the event, the diverse needs of local young people were addressed, considering four different stages, namely secondary education, university, the postgraduate period and employment.
For the first phase, Sands China collaborated with the Macau Productivity and Technology Transfer Center and the Luso-Chinese Technical-Vocational School to “launch Macau's first three-year secondary school program focused on stage technology and event production”. Through the “Diverse Development Lab”, the company also hopes to help “high school students gradually develop the skills necessary for the transition from school to the workplace”.
Regarding higher education, the concessionaire established Macau's “first Career Experience Opportunity program”, offering part-time training for students. The “Sands China Resort Integrated Internship Program” allows university students to “apply their knowledge in the classroom from an early age”. In turn, the “Summer Intern Program” aims to create more opportunities for students, while special lectures will be organized on university campuses and guided tours for teachers and students.
Regarding the postgraduate phase, over the years, and in collaboration with the Directorate of Labor Affairs Services, Sands has launched 23 elite development programs, with rapid promotions and a hybrid contract and training model. In addition, the operator has also supported internship initiatives at agencies.
In the employment phase, the eight specialized academies of the “Sands China Academy” offer a diverse range of courses, which allows the company to offer various mobility opportunities to its team members. Sands also fully sponsors the obtaining of international certifications for its members.
The executive director of Sands China, Grant Chum, highlighted that “young people represent the future of Macau and talent is the key to the sustainable development of the industry and the diversification of the economy”.

On the other hand, Caritas Macau is supporting disadvantaged families in Bangladesh and Pakistan
 
By the end of September, Cáritas Macau had received 3,509 requests for support for the Food Bank, said the organization's secretary-general, indicating that the final amount for the year should not deviate from that of 2024.
“We expect it [in 2025] to exceed four thousand, like last year”, Paul Pun noted to Lusa, pointing out that, in 2024, 4,936 requests reached the humanitarian organization, which, in turn, represents a drop of 2.5% compared to 2023 (5,065).
In an annual comparison, the first nine months of 2025 present values ​​similar to those recorded in the same period of 2023 and 2024: 3,589 and 3,596, respectively.
Even so, there has been a slight decline this year, which could be related to the “existence of other support resources” or “greater ease in applying for social housing”, noted Pun, implying that easier access to public housing could ease the bills at the end of the month.
The program, aimed at low-income people and financed by the authorities, foresees that the Bank's support will result in food aid for a period of 10 weeks, with a second request being possible within 12 months.
Macau had, at the end of the first half of the year, 685,900 inhabitants, of which 182,583 were workers without residence status (TNR), according to official data. Among the TNR, Paul Pun highlighted, there is also a group that uses social assistance organizations. On the 11th, he said, close to a thousand received support in the form of food baskets.
The minimum wage in Macau, a city with one of the highest Gross Domestic Products (GDP) per capita in the world, is 7,072 patacas per month or 34 patacas per hour, not covering domestic workers, the majority of whom are TNR.
 
2,100 families supported in Pakistan and Bangladesh
Caritas is also supporting disadvantaged families in Bangladesh and Pakistan, reaching 2,100 people. “Since Macau does not face very, very serious problems of poverty, we also put our energy and work in other regions”, said Paul Pun, on the occasion of the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty, which was celebrated on Friday.
Last week, Pun returned from Sylhet, a city in northeastern Bangladesh that he has visited several times since 2023, the year in which Cáritas Macau became involved in a program to “improve the health and nutrition of disadvantaged children”. With donations of around 15 thousand dollars per year, aid has already reached 400 people, said the person in charge.
“We hope that, through training, in terms of care for newborns, mothers, they can achieve a better life”, pointed out the general secretary of Cáritas Macau, also noting that, on the table is the possibility of providing resources for the professional training of teenagers who dropped out of school.
A month ago, Paul Pun was also in Lahore, the second largest city in Pakistan, with around 14 million inhabitants and which has been affected, in recent years, by several floods.
Cáritas Macau's assistance to the “Informal education and development of young people and women” program, with the transfer of up to 35 thousand dollars per year, has already touched the lives of 1,200 children and 500 teenagers in Lahore, according to the leader of the humanitarian organization.
"The children do not have schools [in these places]. They participate in this informal education program so that they have an opportunity to reach the standards and one day be able to enter school", he said.
In addition to supporting the education of teenagers – “especially boys” – in areas such as IT, the program also includes skills training “by young women”.
To Lusa, Paul Pun said that international assistance from Cáritas Macau arrives “via several channels”, namely through donations and the organization “Good Fortune Charity Shop”, the social enterprise of Cáritas Macau, which collects donated goods for charitable sale.
Cáritas Macau, founded in 1951, has 46 social service units and educational service units spread across the territory, serving more than 10,000 people per year, according to the organization's website.

The Tourism Bureau and its counterparts in Guangdong and the HKSAR organized “Greater Bay Area: Connecting Great Experiences” to publicize “multi-destination” tourism offerings
 
Last week, Greater Bay Area tourism authorities were in the cities of Frankfurt and London, as part of the “Greater Bay Area: Connecting Great Experiences” promotional action. The joint promotion by the Tourism Bureau (DST), the Department of Culture and Tourism of Guangdong Province and the Hong Kong Tourism Board (HKTB) aimed to publicize the latest offers of the three destinations to more than 200 tour operators and expand the international visitor market.
The program included presentations on tourism in the Greater Bay Area and a discussion on cooperation opportunities for the development of tourism products, in order to “lay a foundation for the exploration of the European visitor market”, according to a press release.
Furthermore, digital influencers from Germany and England, who were in Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau in September, shared their travel experience in the Greater Bay Area with tour operators and the media and promoted the region through platforms and social media. The initiative aimed to “combine industry, social media and internet celebrities to promote the advantages of the complementary resources of Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau”, according to DST.
Jennifer Si Tou, deputy director of DST, pointed out that, through the “multi-destination” model, the three regions “integrate their tourist resources and offer European travelers a rich and diverse travel experience”.
For his part, Huang Xizhong, inspector of the Guangdong Department of Culture and Tourism, highlighted the connection between the cities of the Greater Bay Area and that “visitors from Europe and other destinations can leisurely explore the wide range of unique culture and tourism experiences in the region”. Becky Ip, deputy executive director of HKTB, highlighted the “world-class infrastructure”, the “distinct cultural heritage” and the “beautiful cities with distinct physiognomies” of the Greater Bay Area.
MGTO "regularly discusses with counterpart entities in Guangdong and Hong Kong on joint promotion projects to explore different visitor markets. In the future, the three regions will continue to promote joint products internationally through online travel platforms and reinforce the synchronized development of the tourism market in Greater Bay Area cities," the organization assured.

On the other hand, regarding the total of 1.14 million visitors and the daily average of 143 thousand during Golden Week, the director of DST pointed out that, although the daily average was slightly lower than the expected volume of 150 thousand, in general new records were registered. Senna Fernandes also predicted that the number of visitors will reach a “relatively high level” in the current quarter.

As more well-known players, the Setúbal team will bring Portuguese Nuno Rosário and Cameroonian Meyong to the territory. “We always insist on having a club from Portugal, which gives the competition another shine”, Francisco Manhão, who collaborates in organizing the event, told Jornal TRIBUNA DE MACAU. Macau, Hainão and Wan Nam complete the list of participants
 
VÍTOR REBELO
 
Four teams will participate this year in the Football Sovereignty Tournament, aimed at players over 40 years of age. In addition to the host team, the competition features Vitória de Setúbal, from Portugal, and two teams from Continente, Hainão, a newcomer, and Wan Nam.
The competition, which will take place on the lawn of the old Canídromo field, on the 28th and 29th of November, is in its 25th edition, therefore, it takes on a “special” status, as Francisco Manhão told TRIBUNA DE MACAU newspaper.
The former president of the Association of Football Veterans, now a consultant member with an important role in organizing the tournament, considers it “a shame that the competition will not have more than four teams this year, as it is a significant date in the history of the event”.
Regarding the presence of Vitória de Setúbal, the director highlights the desire to have a representative of Portuguese football every year, “otherwise it doesn't make sense, as it is a Sovereignty Tournament”.
The Setubal delegation, led by António Santos, includes some names that stood out in the past with the Sado club's green and white striped shirt, such as forwards Nuno Rosário, 54 years old, who was capped by Portugal, and Cameroonian Albert Mayeong, 44, who played 12 times for his national team.
Vitória comes to the Macao SAR as one of the two main candidates for the title in the Sovereignty Tournament. “It is a strong team, so it will have all the conditions to win the competition, with the Macau team as its main rival”, says Francisco Manhão.
The host team is coached by Eduardo Jesus and is expected to feature players such as Dedé, Mok Chi Wai, Ka Li Man, Domingos and Hugo André Almeida in the squad. The latter, 47 years old, one of the team's stars and still playing in the Elite League, told this newspaper that the team “can repeat a good position, as has been the case for three or four years, as we always come in to win”.
The draw for the tournament will be made on the 27th, with the semi-finals taking place on the 28th, Saturday, and the final on the afternoon of the following day.
Remember that in the 2024 edition the champion was Beijing, who beat Macau on penalty kicks, after 2-2 at the end of regulation time. Sporting Clube de Portugal was ranked third and Fujian fourth.</description><pubDate>2025-10-20 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Table tennis stars come to the National Games</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/vedetas-tenis-de-mesa-vem-aos-jogos-nacionais/</link><description>The table tennis modality of the National Games, which will take place in Macau, will feature the leaders of the world rankings.

The artist Pedro Pascoinho will be at the “Lotus Art Space” gallery, on October 25th, to inaugurate his drawing exhibition “Common Vision”, curated by Vera Paz, according to a statement from the As Entranhas Macau cultural association. The opening ceremony will take place at 6:30 pm and the exhibition will be on view until November 19th. With free entry, the public can visit the exhibition from Tuesday to Sunday, between 1pm and 7pm.
The project presents 20 charcoal works on artistic “fabrianno” paper and drawings of various dimensions, with “intimate, sober and refined” compositions. “The intentional choice of elements in the narrative construction”, with fragments, objects, figures and landscapes, “evoke enigmatic, almost ghostly spaces that take us back to the passage of time”, can be read in the statement.
Inspired by Chinese painting from the 13th century and European reflection from the 18th and 19th centuries, the works “result from pieces designed individually, but born from the desire to create a space of common memory”. The works reflect an “attempt to find new paths and references, at any time or place, and the conviction that this is an essential condition” of the author’s work, through “inner observation” and “critical thinking”.
Born in Figueira da Foz, Pedro Pascoinho has been organizing exhibitions regularly for over 30 years, with highlights being his participation in the 2003 European Capital of Culture and the Ariane de Rothschild Prize in the same year. The Figueirense's work can be found at the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, at the Portuguese Embassy in Washington, in the Norlinda and José Lima Collection and in multiple private collections in Portugal, Spain, France, Holland, Denmark and the USA.
The exhibition was organized in collaboration with the cultural association “Lotus International Arts Exchange” and sponsored by the Cultural Development Fund, with the support of “Macau Fisherman’s Wharf”.
d’As Entranhas Macau is “a structure for artistic creation and dissemination”, which has brought together, since 2017, a group of professionals from different areas and constitutes itself “as a space for interdisciplinary cultural action”, which promotes research and dissemination of contemporary art through the production of artistic objects, namely theatrical shows, visual arts exhibitions and multimedia installations.
This year, the cultural association has already organized the exhibitions “My Body” and “Remains of the City” by photographers Maria João Pereira and Pedro Paz, respectively, at Creative Macau and Livraria Portuguesa.

The exhibition, with eight thematic sections, is “an in-depth exploration of the evolution of visual language” by Maria Helena Vieira da Silva (1908-1992) and “analyzes in depth the essential moments of the artist’s career”, “from the 1930s to the end of 1980, paying special attention to her interest in architectural space”, explained the museum, in the exhibition’s presentation dossier.
The museum highlights that Maria Helena Vieira da Silva, in her paintings, “dissipated the boundaries between real and imaginary urban landscapes and went beyond formal references to Portuguese visual culture and avant-garde movements such as cubism and futurism”.
“Maria Helena and Arpad”, “Anatomy of space”, “Checkmate: dancers, chess players and card players”, “The Second World War seen from Rio de Janeiro”, “Return to Paris”, “Cities: real and imaginary”, “Exteriors and interiors” and “Shades of white” are the themes of the eight sections of the exhibition.
Each section explores a phase of Vieira da Silva's work and life, such as the painter's relationship with her husband, Arpad Szenes, through a series of reciprocal portraits; the artist’s studio-studio; his time in Rio de Janeiro and his return to Paris, the influence of chess on his work, among others.
“The idea of ​​space is a central theme in the work of Maria Helena Vieira da Silva: her compositions, which feature labyrinthine structures, chromatic rhythms and fragmented perspectives, capture the essence of a world in perpetual transformation”, reads the presentation of the exhibition.
Alongside the exhibition, the Guggenheim Museum presented a parallel program of initiatives, which includes the screening of “VIEIRARPAD”, a documentary by João Mário Grilo, on January 30th and 31st, 2026, and several guided tours.
In the statement, the museum recalls Maria Helena Vieira da Silva's connection to the collector and patron Peggy Guggenheim and the businessman and art collector Solomon R. Guggenheim.
The first included Vieira da Silva in the exhibition “31 Mulheres”, in New York, in 1943, and the second (Peggy Guggenheim's uncle and founder of the Guggenheim Foundation) was behind one of the first supports for the Portuguese artist, with the purchase, in 1937, of the work “Composition”, which is currently part of the fund of the Guggenheim Museum in New York.
Maria Helena Vieira da Silva was born in 1908 in Lisbon, established herself as a painter in Paris, where she met her husband, the Hungarian artist Arpad Szenes. After a seven-year exile in Brazil, during World War II, he was granted French citizenship.
The painter's work is exhibited at the Center Georges Pompidou, in Paris, at MoMA and Guggenheim in New York, at the “Tate Collection”, in London, at the “Thyssen-Bornemisza”, in Madrid, at the “Art Institute of Chicago”, at the “Ashmolean Museum”, in Oxford, and at the Pinacoteca do Estado de São Paulo.
In Lisbon, the Arpad Szenes – Maria Helena Vieira Silva Foundation, owner of the museum and an extensive collection of both artists, has the mission of disseminating and studying the work of both artists, as well as artists who were close to them.
Vieira da Silva was elected Member of the “Royal Academy of Arts” in London, in 1988, and ordained Officer of the Legion of Honor in France, with insignia presented by President François Mitterrand, in 1991. She died in Paris in 1992.
