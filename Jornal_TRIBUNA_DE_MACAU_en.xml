On the other hand, the weight of masters in terms of confidentiality worldwide has decreased. Carlos Cid Álvares, chairman of the BNU Executive Committee, told the Jornal Tribuna de Macao that the impact on the reputation of the MSAR will be mitigated by the US and some European countries. Economist António José Félix Pontes also believes that Macao's position will not be decisive to ward off investors

The MSAR rose to the 27th position of the financial secrecy index (FSI, in the English acronym), with 386 points. In 2022, the year of the penultimate report, Macao occupied the 31st position (341 points), among the 141 jurisdictions listed. On the one hand, confidentiality grew slightly in Macao, from 63 points in 2022 to 66 in 2025. On the other, the contribution of masters in the global context decreased from 0.3% to 0.2%. This is partly due to the performance of several European countries, which have become less transparent, indicate data from the Tax Justice Network (TJN).
The FSI evaluates the margin of maneuver that the laws and regulations of a country or region offer to financial secrecy, as well as the weight of the same jurisdiction in the world's 'offshore' financial services. As Carlos Cid Álvares explains to the Jornal Tribuna de Macau, “the higher confidentiality rate jurisdictions assume that they are less transparent in financial activities that welcome, less involved in sharing information, more attractive to facilitate the creation of facade companies, anonymous property ownership or other forms of financial confidentiality”.
In the opinion of the chairman of the Executive Committee of the National Bank Overseas (BNU), this ranking of Macao in the ranking “may have a slightly negative impact” on his international reputation. However, he also believes that this will be "very mitigated that the US and many Western European countries have much worse classifications."
António José Félix Pontes, an economist, also agrees that the position of the MSAR “does not constitute a determining factor for the attraction of investment”. It points to the Paradoxical example of the US, which lead the FSI and are still considered "the best place in the world for investors."
According to the report, the MSAR is still very opaque, particularly with regard to the registration of real estate owners and the dissemination of the final beneficiaries of companies. TJN indicates that in Macao, companies are not required to make reports available to the public or to disclose who are the final beneficiaries.
Nor are they legally required to reveal their “country to country” reports, which stipulate revenues, profits, taxes, employees and tangible assets of their affiliates. This allows companies to “artificially” transfer their profits to tax havens, hide information on group levels and pay less taxes.
However, Felix Pontes notes that “regulatory directives [to combat capital laundering and terrorism financing] (AML/CFT) applicable in Macao, for financial transactions, require the dissemination of final beneficiaries”. At the same time, “financial institutions authorized to operate in the MSAR have internal control mechanisms for these operations and regularly develop maps and reports on the assumption and concentration of risks 'country to country' and entities,” he argues. “The risks are mitigated in a certain way that I consider effective,” he argues.
Carlos Cid Álvares also clarifies that the financial system itself “has effective control measures, which are leveraged through risk analysis, account movement, identification of effective beneficiaries and via reporting processes for competent authorities”. In the particular cases of the financial industry and the game “The requirements of identifying the 'Ultimate Beneficial Owners' are of zero tolerance and are controlled by their compliance and internal audit bodies,” explains the BNU CEO.
"The fact that the game companies are listed in scholarships such as Hong Kong and New York, forces them to a set of regulatory requirements that, if not met, can lead to large disagreements," he adds.
 
ENTERNATION AND INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS
Another aspect highlighted by the TJN is the use of “Legal Entity Identifier” (law) not yet mandatory in the MSAR, with some exceptions, unlike regions such as the European Union, the US and mainland China. The law is an exclusive identification number that allows governments to track the global financial activity of companies. Moreover, there is no “unity of large taxpayers” (LTU, in the English acronym) in Macao. The LTU is intended to reinforce control over the largest taxpayers, whose taxes represent a significant part of the total tax revenue.
Carlos Cid Álvares considers that “the immediate non -adoption of the law and the LTU [for the masters], as in mainland China”, is due to the “need to adapt to their own structures and legislation” and “specific development priorities of the region”.
In turn, Félix Pontes understands that, in the case of mainland China, these tools "pay attention to the enormous dimension of the economy and the complexity of its structure." "Given the costs derived from the establishment of the obligation in Macao do Law, for organizations and regulators and the benefits arising from this, [a] greater transparency, I believe they do not compensate."
The economist also does not believe that the creation of an LTU is justified. "We are facing a small number of entities classified as large taxpayers (…) that may well continue to be monitored by the local fiscal authority."
In terms of “integrity of fiscal and financial regulation”, the MGI obtained the worst possible score in the indicators “tax compliance” and “foreign investment income”. These include the assignment of unilateral tax credits for income that have already taxed in their home countries. The TJN sets the example of income from Portuguese -speaking countries (PLP).
However, for Cid Álvares, "although Macao's preferred fiscal regime for the PLP may be susceptible to hypothetical abuse (…) is not necessarily a gateway to fiscal dropout." “The key is to balance investment attraction with control mechanisms,” says BNU CEO.
Already Felix Pontes considers that a possible fiscal dropout between the MSAR and the PLP has no meaning, since both parties have a “residual” commercial and financial relationship, a situation that the economist regrets.
 
Transparency does not prevent growth
Cid Álvares reiterates that “Macao's financial model has been successful in the recent past”, underlining the rating AA of MSAR and the fact that it has no debt. "Macao, when diversifying its economy, will mitigate the risks associated with increasing scrutiny and ensure its long -term financial stability." The CEO believes that "Macao, by leveraging his unique strengths, promoting good governance practices and capitalizing on his cultural and linguistic ties with the Lusophone world, can create a more diverse, transparent and competitive economy."
"If other jurisdictions have undertaken their financial systems and, at the best, the increasing requirements of greater control of financial transactions (…) does not unveil valid reasons so that in Macao no effective measures are taken to raise their level of adherence to international standards," says Felix Bridges.
The economist recommends an “urgent review of 2006 AML/CFT legislation, with a clear and objective definition of final beneficiaries, the inclusion of fintech/insurtch operators and the worsening of penalties”. It also suggests the “implementation of technological solutions” that allow “real -time participation in suspicious transactions in casinos, financial institutions”, and “the consecration of effective autonomy for the monetary authority of Macao”, as shown in Raehk and Singapore.
Finally, Carlos Cid Álvares believes that reinforcing financial regulation and attraction of talents and holdings of multinationals, with operations in neighboring countries, would help the diversification of tax collection and the economy itself.</description><pubDate>2025-07-24 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Airport registered a decline of 3% in the number of passengers</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/aeroporto-registou-declinio-de-3-numero-de-passageiros/</link><description>In the first six months of the year, Macao airport accounted for 3.6 million passengers, a 3% break from the same period last year.

Macao airport registered a decline in the number of passengers in the first six months of this year. According to the statistical data of the Macau Airport Society (CAM), between January and June, the infrastructure received 3.6 million passengers, a 3% break from the same year's same year period. In addition, the volume represents only 76.5% of the 2019 level, when more than 4.7 million passengers passed through the airport.
Observing in detail the statistics of passenger traffic, it can be seen that January was the only month of 2025 in which the number of passengers was higher than the corresponding month in 2024. It is recalled that this year the holidays of the Chinese New Year began on January 29. This month, 676,235 passengers accounted for about 15%, as in January last year there were 587,296.
The month of February recorded a 5% decrease to a total of 572,761 passengers, while in March 588,949 (less 3%) were accounted for in March. But it was in the second quarter that the breaks were more pronounced.
The month of April was the one that recorded the highest decrease in annual terms. This year, in the month under review, 604,970 passengers passed by about 10% less than April last year (670,280 passengers). In June, in turn, the decrease was from 8% to 578,885 passengers, while in May there was a decline of 7% to a total of 590,412 travelers.
As for the volume of the air load in the first half, it totaled 46,812 tons, a break of 5% over the air load carried in the same period as 2024. In March, April and May alone, increases in homologous terms.
Remember that in April, by revealing data from the first three months of the year, CAM admitted that it could fail the passenger and load goals set to 2025, due to the “geopolitical situation and world economic instability”. The management company then observed that the airport had "not as good as expected" performance, at a time when "the geopolitical situation and world economic instability have imposed challenges to the development of routes."
"Increased operating costs for airlines has further restricted its capacity, leading to noticeable changes in market structure and having a significant impact on passenger and load operations. It is expected that passenger and load volume in 2025 is not aligned with the goal of the year," said the company.
In February, CAM executive committee chairman Simon Chan predicted to 2025 a movement over eight million passengers -which would be an 8% increase -65,000 flight movements and a load volume of 113,000 tons.</description><pubDate>2025-07-24 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Candidates under 25 get jobs in 50 days</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/candidatos-menos-de-25-anos-conseguem-emprego-em-50-dias/</link><description>On average, employment candidates under 25 were able to get a job within 50 days after the registration, according to the head of the DSSA Employment Department. In the first semester, 5,224 job candidates were hired after their support services. More than 50% are young people under 35
 
Employment conjugation data indicates that, on average, candidates under 25 were able to find employment in a space of 50 days after the date of registration towards Labor Affairs (DSAL), the head of the Employment Department, Lai Keng, said yesterday.
In a “or Mun Tin Toi” program about the use of young people, a listener said he was confusing about the future, because since he graduated in 2024, he has not yet been able to find a “satisfactory job” so he is working on a food establishment. Another young man said he wanted to do his master's degree, but he is unaware of jobs available on the market, hoping the government to provide instructions.
In this respect, the head of the Employment Department stressed that, in the last five years, the “Internship Plan to create better work prospects” has had more than 1,700 participants, of which 850 received job offers after the completion of the internship, with 600 accepted the offers. On the other hand, about 10% of these contractors had opportunities for professional ascension.
Regarding the construction of employment in the field of construction, Law Lai Keng revealed that DSAL has already contacted more than 2,000 workers, including 957 attended the employment interviews and 506 were hired.
Generally speaking, according to the official, in the first six months of this year, the various employment support services took 5,224 candidates to be hired, of which more than 50% are young people under 35 years.
In turn, the president of the Human Resources Association pointed to an imbalance in the labor market, in which the sectors of hotel, restoration, retail and construction in the Cotai have a certain demand for human resources, however, in “remains weak” residential areas.
Still, Choi Chin Man anticipated that the high time of tourism in the second half of this year will stimulate the demand for workers, both full and partially. Describing that the labor market is facing opportunities, but also some challenges, has proposed to the government to launch, along with companies, intersectory internship plans for young people. In addition, it has suggested to young people learn tongues to collaborate with the development of the World Tourism and Leisure Center.
For its part, Hoipan Wong, an associate professor at the Department of Economics at the University of Macao Faculty of Social Sciences, predicted that in the next decade, the number of newborns will increase between 20% and 65% in the territory, which will make the question of “providing jobs for a high number of young people” in a “long-term challenge”.
The academic pointed out that traditional industries cannot make many job opportunities available, while emerging sectors are still unable to provide high -value job opportunities. However, even in this context, young people have relatively high expectations about remuneration, which also contributes to the “problem of incompatibility of competences,” he said.</description><pubDate>2025-07-24 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Suggested training programs aimed at “language + technology”</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/sugeridos-programas-de-formacao-voltados-para-lingua-tecnologia/</link><description>IP Kuai Peng, Vice-Rector of UCM and Director of the Institute for Research on Portuguese-Speaking Countries, proposed the creation of “Language + Technology” formations to “overcome linguistic and professional incompatibilities in scientific cooperation”. Macao also urged “multidimensional cooperation networks aimed at the European Union and Spanish -speaking countries”
 
The Vice-Rector of the City of Macao University (UCM) and director of the Institute for Research on Portuguese-Speaking Countries, IP Kuai Peng, highlighted Macau's “potential” to promote international cooperation in high technology, digital economy and standardization of traditional Chinese medicine. In order to fully play its role as a platform, it has left some proposals within the Symposium on “scientific cooperation between China and Portuguese -speaking countries”.
“To overcome the linguistic and professional incompatibilities in scientific cooperation, Macau must promote joint training programs for talents aimed at 'language + technology' in Chinese, Portuguese and Spanish universities,” he said, considering that it is important to bet on a multidisciplinary training system.
As said, cited in a statement, programs should include modules on renewable energy terminology, biomedical patents and digital economy. "In addition, academic exchange mechanisms should be established to simplify education, stages and job opportunities, making Macao in a scientific talent center in south-south cooperation," he added.
It also proposed the reinforcement of economic and commercial connectivity and the expansion of international market networks. "Based on strong ties with Portuguese -speaking countries, Macau must develop multidimensional cooperation networks aimed at the European Union and Spanish -speaking countries," he said.
For UCM Vice-Rector, “Macau can serve as a platform for accurate business correspondence between Chinese and Portuguese-speaking companies”, while supporting the Great Bay companies in exploring Lusophone markets through commercial missions, promoting investments and international exhibitions.
Finally, he suggested that Macau take advantage of the “institutional advantages” and national laboratories of the Great Bay to form interregional reflection groups with renowned universities in Portuguese and Spanish-speaking countries. "These efforts should focus on green energy, biomedicine and digital technology, in order to enable transfringing technology flow, collect the digital gap in developing countries and position the large bay as a global leader in science and technology to the global south," he said.
At the opening of the Symposium, IP Kuai Peng also noted that as China advances in the new development paradigm through greater opening, Macau should align with its positioning as "a center, a platform and a base."
Several academics from other universities have also addressed their perspectives in this field. Professor Marta Filipa Simões, from the University of Science and Technology of Macau, presented joint research projects in mycology and astrobiology between China and Lusophone countries and suggested the expansion of collaboration with scientific institutions in Angola, Brazil, Cape Verde, Mozambique and Portugal.
Already André Antunes, director of the Institute of Science and Environment of the University of São José, addressed the “life role” of Macao as a link in the Lusophone world and identified scientific cooperation as an area of opportunities, particularly in life sciences, green ecology and marine economy. Already José Paulo Esperança, vice-rector of the Faculty of Economics of the University of Macao focused on the contributions of the Foundation for Portuguese Science in facilitating international cooperation, addressing common challenges and promoting sustainable innovation.</description><pubDate>2025-07-24 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Galaxy exhibition enters “Na Mind” of French artist</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/exposicao-da-galaxy-entra-na-mente-de-artista-frances/</link><description>The exhibition “In the Mind of Bruno Moard” was inaugurated yesterday in the Galaxy Art.

The “Galaxy Art” inaugurated yesterday the show “In the Mind of Bruno Moard”, under the Macao International Biennial. The “special exhibition” of Galaxy Entertainment Group (GEG) marks the 30 years of career of interior designer, architect, set designer and painter, as well as the 12 years of his studio “Bruno Moard Éditions”. More than 300 paintings, drafts, designs and furniture pieces are on display, in a space totally idealized by the artist. The exhibition will be patent until December 31st.
The occasion also served to introduce Galaxy Macau's “Capella” hotel, whose interiors were conceptualized by Bruno Moinard and Claire Betaille, a duo known for creating hotels, private homes and luxury boutiques. For this project, the Agency “Moinard Betaille” has committed itself to “creating a new language” based on “culture, community, tradition and heritage”. The "long journey" lasted "about five years", according to Moinard. GEG expects to inaugurate the new venture later this year.
During the inaugural speech, Moinard stated that "it all always starts with a drawing" and that this exhibition "is a modest but sincere attempt" of making visitors enter "in an invisible space." The Francophone artist is known to have a handcrafted approach, in which he mixes traditional French arts and contemporary aesthetics, to create “timeless pieces”, says a note from GEG.
On the sidelines of the inauguration ceremony and the guided tour of the exhibition, Moinard explained that "the inspiration comes from the travels, from nature, from the many coincidences of life." What the public can find “are not ending projects”, but the “first pages” of a draft. The various works spread throughout space are "to show that sometimes small insignificant sketches can be the beginning of a project."
Moinard stated that his works often require "flexible, agile, acrobat, inventive, to have many ideas, and to be at the same time psychoanalyst, doctor." “I have 50 people for architecture and 10 for furniture, so I have a great team that works with me,” he continued. "I would say that I am more like an architect of ideas and I love to give ideas, directions and creations to others. And my team gives life to the project."
Through their pieces, the Frenchman intends to "show that the studio is a bit a nest of ideas." "I always have prestigious customers and budgets, but for the imagination I do not respect the budgets at first [of the projects]. They feel safe because I have 30 or 40 years of experience and always got it. I would not be exhausted the budget every time," he said.
"You have to dream, make the exceptional, thicken the trait sometimes because, to show a project, you need a multitude of ideas." "What I show today are not ending projects, it is the way we work. It's a rare exhibition, because no one reveals its cooking secrets," he said. After presenting some drawings he has taken in the last days he has passed in Macao, including reproductions of the Typhoon “Wipha”, Moinard recalls Francis Liu, president of GEG, and the moment he decided to perform the exhibition on the MSAR.
"Two months ago, we had had designs from the [Hotel] Capella in his office and there were catalogs of my paintings. He asked what it was and someone told him that they were Bruno paintings. He found it fantastic and said it was necessary to make an exhibition," he concluded. At the event were present Cheang Kai Meng, vice president of the Cultural Institute, and Philip Cheng, director of GEG, among others.</description><pubDate>2025-07-24 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Zape will host large scale events</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/zape-vai-acolher-eventos-de-grande-escala/</link><description>Some large -scale events, scheduled for the second half of this year, will be extended to ZAPE, such as “Light Activities,” the STD subdirector said.

In the middle of next month, the Directorate of Tourism Services (STD) and local associations will organize activities at Zape, which include a gastronomic, cultural and creative fair with about 40 stands, said Cheng Wai Tong, subdirector of the government.
In addition, the same responsible revealed that the authorities intend to extend some large -scale events - scheduled for the second semester - for Zape, such as “Light Activities”. According to the Chinese language press, Cheng Wai Tong stressed that the government expects the activities promoted to contribute to widen the Zape campaign and allow a greater knowledge of the business environment of this zone.
On the other hand, in relation to the complaints of some tour guides the sector has been registering a volume of unattended excursions, the STD subdirector pointed out that, with the modification of the tourism sector conjuncture, many information and tourist products can already be obtained or purchased from electronic platforms. Under these circumstances, only a few family tourists choose to travel on excursion.
Given such a phenomenon, the official has assured that the authorities will continue to support the tour guides to adapt to changes in the market, and to launch more guidelines for training.
 
International Gastronomy Party visited by 100 thousand people
The “International Festival of Cities of Gastronomy, Macau 2025”, organized by the Tourism Services Directorate (STD), was visited by about 100,000 people during the nine days of the event. At the same time, total STD account exposure on social networks exceeded 7.8 million. The event gathered in Macao 35 UNESCO creative cities in the area of gastronomy, 62% of the total, a record number compared to previous years. In addition, he welcomed 186 varied animation shows, and provided stage to 29 heads of creative cities to present 52 culinary demonstrations. In total, 2,900 doses of tastings were distributed. On the other hand, representatives of two creative cities of gastronomy, Östersund (Sweden) and Santa Maria da Feira (Portugal), had exchange meetings with the Macao University of Tourism and the Polytechnic University of Macao, to discuss future opportunities for cooperation. According to inquiries, the general level of visitors and residents of the event reached the level of “satisfactory”, “which shows that the results were positive,” concluded STD.</description><pubDate>2025-07-24 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Financial reserve grew 24 billion in five months</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/reserva-financeira-cresceu-24-mil-milhoes-em-cinco-meses/</link><description>The value of the mashed financial reserve capital was led by about 640.55 billion patacas in late May this year, reflecting a monthly increase of 1.3% or eight billion, according to data from the Monetary Authority (AMCM) published yesterday in the official bulletin. Official data show that the financial reserve grew 3.9% or 24.34 billion patacas compared to the 616.21 billion accounted for at the end of 2024.
The MSAR Financial Reserve reached its highest value in February 2021, with 663.56 billion patacas.
According to the synopsis of AMCM's active and passive values, the basic reserve remained about 164.17 billion at the end of May. The extraordinary reserve has reached 476.39 billion patacas, translating a monthly increase of 1.7% or 8.01 billion, and an increase of 2.9% or 13.57 billion compared to the amount noted on December 31, 2024.
The basic reserve is equivalent to 150% of the appropriations of core services expense, while the extraordinary corresponds to the remaining balances of the financial reserve after the satisfaction of the basic, and can be taken to provide financial support to a possible budgetary deficit of MSAR, as well as the necessary financial resources to favor socioeconomic development.
The exercise ended on May 31, 2025 registered a positive balance of 16.73 billion patacas.
Over the past year, the income from the investments of the Form's financial reserve totaled 30.95 billion patacas, which translated into an annual profitability of 5.3%. AMCM has attributed this evolution to “a diverse and balanced allocation of assets”.
The results of 2024 illustrated an increase compared to 2023, when the income was 28.98 billion and the profitability of 5.2%, and marked a return to the annual profitability of 5.3% registered in 2020, the year in which a historical record of investment income was recorded (31.06 billion patacas).
For this year, and considering that Macao is "in a crucial period of economic recovery," the monetary authority considered that the government "must use and allocate public financial resources with prudence." In 2025, “facing geopolitical uncertainty, the respective factors are expected to continue to affect the prices of various types of assets, bringing challenges to investment management of the financial reserve in the current year,” AMCM warned in early March.</description><pubDate>2025-07-24 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Lam hin San leaves Dsat after a decade</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/lam-hin-san-deixa-dsat-ao-fim-de-uma-decada/</link><description>Lam Hin San ceased, at his request, the Service Commission as Director of Services for Traffic Affairs (DSAT), a position he had been holding since July 2015.

CPSP warns that some elderly people choose to tolerate violence for self -care inability and to pamper their children. It also assumes that “traditional social concepts” continue to make it difficult to discover these situations and prevention. Almost two thirds of the 125 processes of domestic violence were filed
 
In 2024, the Institute of Social Action (IAS) received 893 cases of family crisis (excluded repeated cases), which makes a monthly average of 74.4. The number dropped 9.8% compared to 2023, and the decrease was noted in two of the three parameters: “family dispute” (423 cases) and “family conflict” (385). Already in the category “Preliminary suspicion of domestic violence”, there were 85 cases, the equal number of 2023, notes the IAS, in the report to implement the Law for Prevention and Combating Domestic Violence for 2024.
Last year, 55 cases of domestic violence were confirmed to a monthly average of 4.6. Associating the reduction of family crisis cases with “constant work in community awareness and long -term education”, IAS warns, however, for the “large increase” of cases of domestic violence against elderly (from zero to eight between 2023 and 2024) and for the rise of 45.5% in cases against children.
According to the report consulted by the Jornal Tribuna de Macao, the Public Security Police (CPSP) notes that children and the elderly are in a vulnerable situation, and "some seniors may, due to their children and the lack of independent self-care, normally choose to tolerate the acts of violence."
"Therefore, [elderly victims and children] really depend on foreign aid for discovery and denunciation [of cases], and allowing police authorities and social service equipment to intervene as early as possible," says CPSP, who received 127 cases suspected of domestic violence in 2024, all of physical abuse.
On the other hand, CPSP states that there are still suspicious cases whose victims - due to the influence on traditional social concepts or fear of pressure from public opinion - do not intend to reveal the family problem or the violence suffered, rejecting to ask police for help or social services. Sometimes they continue to live with the aggressors. This phenomenon “makes it difficult to discover and prevent cases of domestic violence,” says the corporation.
In addition to continuing to bet on courses and lectures, to raise knowledge, the forms of treatment and the ability to execute the law, CPSP intends to reinforce awareness actions, in order to encourage victims to seek help.
Generally speaking, IAS understands that "it is necessary to reinforce citizens 'knowledge of' zero domestic violence 'and raise the victims' awareness of self-protection and the reasons for helping help, especially to disclose, with people of different age groups, the means of requesting help." It also argues that "it is necessary to increase the sensitivity of the front line staff, in order to find out as soon as possible the risks of suffering from domestic violence and provide intervention and support timely."
In turn, the Judiciary Police (PJ) dealt with 133 cases of offensive behavior between family members, including 108 referred by CPSP. The PJ eventually referred 12 cases to the Public Prosecution Service (MP) for evident evidence of “domestic violence” after investigation, and registered two defendants indicted for the practice of domestic violence (out of flagrant offense). It also adopted 40 measures to protect victims to hospitals, homes or households, and in 55 cases, requested the intervention of social workers.
According to PJ, some attackers had violent acts against family members due to incapacity caused by mental illness and emotional problems, many rejecting medicines or medical consultation. Given these situations, "the family members of the attackers warned the police because they wanted the help of police and competent government services, rather than accusing the attackers," he said.
In this sense, when dealing with these cases, PJ promises to give priority to the urgent needs and needs of the victims, as well as try to convince the aggressors to accept hospital assessment and receive treatment.
 
The penalty of fine to the arrest of four years and six months
Regarding the cases targeted by judicial proceedings, among the 133 treated by the PJ, in addition to the 12 with evidence of domestic violence, 117 were a crime of offenses to physical integrity and one of threat.
Citing MP data, IAS reveals that in 2024, 125 cases of crime of domestic violence (16 more than 2023) were processed, and the MP deducted accusations in 24 cases (31 accused in 2023).
On the other hand, 78 cases were filed by the MP for several reasons. In 42, the victims ceased to investigate the responsibility, while in 31 there were not enough evidence. In addition, two cases were not a crime and three were filed for other reasons.
In 2024, IAS received nine judgments. The lightest penalty was a fine in a case, and the most severe four years and six months in prison (without suspended penalty) and payment of non -property damage to the victim. Moreover, prison sentences ranged from six months to two years and nine months; and the suspended between two years and four years. Except the case with lighter punishment, in all cases judged, the suspects were also sentenced to IAS applied evidence regime.
In addition, health services provided immediate treatment services to 167 suspicious victims last year, and health professionals helped in 57 suspected cases of violence against children.
The counseling services to students of the Directorate of Education and Youth Development Services (DSEDJ) treated 65 cases of preliminary suspicion of domestic violence, 60 being students, two with guardians and three involving both.
According to the DSEDJ, the sensitization of school staff has increased, however, the degree of acceptance of services by parents and students in question affects the monitoring of cases. In this sense, the report advocates a content review related to the subject in the school's operating guide.
For its part, services for labor affairs provided professional counseling in five cases linked to domestic violence and employment support services equally in five cases, two of whom got employment through conjugation and two by themselves.
 
Raised accommodation rate at centers for women
The report also indicates that the two shelter centers for women served 199 people by 2024, registering an average accommodation rate of 73.4%, plus 21.8 percentage points in annual terms. As for temporary residences, the rate rose 4.8 points to 39.6%.
The report associates the rise in the three strands hosting rate: in the number of women who asked for help from their own initiative, in the proportion of cases in which they took minor children to the centers and in the number of cases suspected of violence against spouses. Alongside this, it is also attached to cases of family conflict and single pasting problems.
The Men's Retreat Center registered a 3.5%accommodation rate, a break of 14.9 percentage points.
In statistical terms, the report also states that the Family Support Services at risk, from Caritas, reported 2,375 communication cases, 1,567 of which on family issues (66%) and 808 (34%) related to suicide and community support. Except repeated cases, 893 family crisis were noted.
In concrete, the main reasons of the 423 cases of family dispute were separation of spouses (15.1%), emotional management problems (11.8%), mental illness or suspicion of mental illness (7.8%) and children's education (7.8%). As for the 385 family conflict, the three dominant causes were emotional management (22.9%), adultery or suspicion of adultery (15.3%) and mental illness or mental illness suspicion (8.1%).
The 85 cases of preliminary suspicions of domestic violence included 35 against wives, one against her husband, 34 against children and nine against the elderly. The five main factors of risk of violent behavior were children's education (22.4%), emotional management (15.3%), adultery or suspicion of adultery (12.9%), mental illness or suspicion of mental illness (10.6%) and alcohol abuse (8.2%). However, the largest number of victims were recorded in the age groups from seven to 12 years and 35 to 44 years, with the aggressors being mainly between 35 and 44 years and between 45 and 54.</description><pubDate>2025-07-23 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Industrial Park opens Centro Cultural dedicated to Chinese Medicine</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/parque-industrial-inaugura-centro-cultural-dedicado-a-medicina-chinesa/</link><description>The Center for Cultural Experience of Traditional Chinese Medicine was recently inaugurated in the deepened cooperation zone in Hengqin.

Dozens of Japanese children joined yesterday at Expo2025 in Osaka, an appeal to protect the seas, which the Lisbon Oceanarium wants to take the UN summit on climate change in November, Brazil.

“Do you want to be ocean ambassadors here in Japan?” Asked at the Portugal Pavilion, the Natacha Moreira Marine Biologist of the Blue Ocean Foundation to the students of two classes of an Osaka school.
The positive response came in a 40 -voices unison chorus, the first Japanese young people to sign the mini 30x30, “a wave” launched by the blue ocean and the oceanarium, in support of the world goal to protect 30% from the ocean by 2030.
Oceanaria's director of education, Diogo Geraldes, told Lusa that a first letter was delivered during the third UN Ocean conference, which took place in Nice, France, in June.
A new version of the document will be delivered to the United Nations Conference on Climate Changes (COP30), which will take place in November in Belém, the state capital of Pará, northern Brazil.
The appeal has already gathered the support of 9,500 young people from 27 countries, but in Asia still had contributions from Malaysian and Timor-Leste schools.
The Oceanarium prepared materials on the Mini 30x30 in Japanese especially for Expo, which already existed in Portuguese, Spanish, French and English.
Before they vote unanimously in favor of the appeal, the young Japanese tested the interactive experiences of the Oceanarium in one of the two multi -articles of the Portugal Pavilion, whose theme is “Ocean: Blue Dialogue”.
"The Lisbon Oceanarium is, in Portugal, the institution with more scrolls and experience in Blue Literacy. For over 25 years that has been teaching teachers and students to have a more sustainable relationship with the sea," Blue Ocean Executive Administrator Tiago Pitta and Cunha told Lusa.
An experiment that led the Oceanarium and the Blue Ocean, with the support of the Directorate-General for Education, to develop the Educar Program for a Blue Generation, which promotes ocean literacy among students from 6 to 10 years.
Diogo Geraldes explained that they started in the first cycle because "it is easier to form teachers, who are often the same from the first to fourth year."
For five years, the project has been training to 1,300 teachers in a pilot phase that took place in the municipalities of Albufeira, Cascais, Mafra, Moura, Nazaré, Peniche, Silves, Sintra and the Autonomous Region of the Azores.
After the end of this phase, in May 2024, the Ministry of Education, Science and Innovation decided to extend the program to all primary schools in the country and to include the ocean in the curriculum.
Tiago Pitta and Cunha said the goal is to "educate the most conscious generation of the entire European Union regarding the connection of humans with the ocean." "We could, in the end, be a little, as the Nordicas went to the environment [terrestrial] from the 1970s, the Portuguese citizens would be for blue," explained the expert.
Created in 2017 by the Francisco Manuel dos Santos Society, which includes in its heritage the Lisbon Oceanarium, the Blue Ocean is a non -profit entity, which aims to contribute to the conservation and sustainable use of the oceans.
