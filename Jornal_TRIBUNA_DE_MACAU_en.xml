“Exhibitions release potential” is the motto of World Exhibition Day 2025, focused on the role played by the MICE sector in promoting cooperation, qualified framework, impulse to economic development and expansion of business networks, among other strands. Macau noted the date at a ceremony in which the secretary was attended by the economy and finance.
In speaking at the ceremony, Tai Kin Yip said that "while the exhibition industry develops, we must also recognize the problems and challenges we currently face, including growing regional competition, the transformation accompanied, technological adaptation and ecological transformation, among other challenges."
The ruler stressed that the sector faces "opportunities and challenges", being the "formation of qualified pictures an essential nucleus for their development". In recent years, he added, the government has continually cooperated with international institutions, the MICE sector and higher education institutions to promote the formation of qualified staff in the area of ​​convention and exhibitions. ”
Tai Kin Yip stressed that, in the future, the government will add training content such as multimedia and digital applications, according to the evolution of the market, “to promote staggered training of qualified frames of the Macao Convention and Exhibition Industry, while providing training and internship opportunities for young people interested in joining this industry”.
Staying in a futuristic analysis, the secretary said he hoped Macao Convention and Exhibition operators will continue to keep the spirit of “focusing on the present tasks and planning long-term development,” joining efforts to “improve competitiveness at international level and create a new chapter for industry”.
According to Tai Kin Yip, Macau plans to hold 19 training sessions in the area of ​​Convention and Exhibitions this year, of which 11 will take place in the second semester, including seven professional certification courses in cooperation with international organizations of the sector.
Moreover, the secretary stated that the sector of conventions and exhibitions, as one of the main industries of the proper diversification strategy of the “1+4” economy, plays “an important role in promoting industrial diversification”. He also stressed that, recently, local higher education institutions and the MICE sector successfully ran for the realization of an international renowned international technological conference in 2027.
Meanwhile, he stressed, “the sector is also closely monitoring the international events of conventions and exhibitions scheduled for 2028,” said Tai Kin Yip, in an event that was attended by the Department's subdirector for central government connection economic affairs on the mashed, Li Huaying, the Deputy Representative of Representation Office in Macau for the international trade promotion of international trade From China, Shu Huan, and the president of the Macao, Lam Chong In, among others.
The holder of the economy portfolio in the Sam Hou Fai team highlighted the “continuous development potential,” recalling the ranking of the cities of the Pacific Asia of the Convention and Exhibition Industry in 2024, in which the MSc rose six places compared to 2023. At the world, the classification of Macau ascended 31 positions, reaching 76th place.
In the first quarter of this year, 413 exhibition events were held in the territory, which represents an increase of 23% compared to the previous homologous period.</description><pubDate>2025-06-06 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Garbage produced by each person rose 4% to 2.10 pounds per day</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/lixo-produzido-por-cada-pessoa-subiu-4-para-210-quilos-por-dia/</link><description>With the increase of tourists and the population, the consumption of resources grew and a greater pressure on various environmental indicators ”in 2024. For example, more urban solid waste was generated in the territory, with each person producing, on average, 2.10 pounds of waste daily. On the other hand, the recyclable waste collection rate has been falling since 2021, having set by 21.7% last year. Also the emission of greenhouse gases grew, while maritime pollution remains a problem

Each citizen of Macao produced, on average, 2.10 kilos of solid waste per day last year and the total garbage generated rose to almost 527 thousand tons in the territory. At the same time, the recyclable waste collection rate-that is, the percentage of recyclable waste that are actually collected-has been falling for three consecutive years, shows the state of the state of the 2024. In the last year, “with the ongoing economic recovery, there was greater pressure on several environmental indicators”, noted the director of Environmental Protection Services (DSPA) IP Kuong Lam.
Per capita waste production grew 4% in annual terms, as in 2023 it was, on average, 2.02 pounds, but the value does not yet reach the levels of 2019, when each person in the territory generated 2.22 kilos of trash per day. "During the pandemic, the amount of urban solid waste from Macao and the same amount per capita decreased; however, along with socio-economic recovery, there was a climb in these data in the last two years, returning to the levels prior to the pandemic," says the document released on World Environment Day, which was celebrated yesterday.
The trend remains superior to surrounding cities and regions, such as Hong Kong (1.44kg), Shanghai (1.07kg), Beijing (0.95kg) and Canton (0.89kg), but also in relation to Singapore, for example, where each citizen generated 1.53kg of waste daily.
Over the past year, 526,979 tons of solid waste were produced in the territory, an increase of 5.1% compared to 2023 (501,512 tons). According to the document, 80.6% of the physical composition of urban solid waste consisted mainly of organic matters, which corresponded to 32.3% of the total, paper/card (24.3%) and plastic (24%).
The amount of construction materials residues increased by 13.5% in homologous terms, totaling 1,803 cubic meters. First of all, there was a “significant climb” in the amount of marine lamas, from 47.1% to 856 thousand cubic meters, while the volume of flying ashes grew 2.7% to 21,293 tons. In the opposite direction, the amount of scorers decreased 4.3% to 82,798 tons, while special and dangerous waste decreased 0.9% to 5,355 tons.
Still in this context, there is a 22.2% increase in the total number of slaughtered vehicles (12,196), with increases in all types, except in industrial and semi-trailers. It should be noted that the number of light cars slaughtered, totaling 4,380, was the fastest growing (+27.6%), along with motorcycles, which totaled 5,305 (+21.5%) and mopeds, 1,818 (+19.4%).
Regarding solid waste collection, it is said in the report that "Macau recyclable waste is mainly exported abroad for its transformation into resources, including those coming from the collection plans led by the government and the collection activities exploited by private entities, with a small part locally recycled."
According to estimates, the recyclable waste collection rate was 21.7% in 2024, having had a “slight descent” compared to the previous year (22%). According to the report, this rate has been falling since 2021. In concrete, the data reveal that the recyclable waste collection rate was 24.5% in 2021, having fallen to 22.5% the following year and 22% in 2023. In 2019 and 2020, it was set at 17.5% and 20.3%, respectively.
Nevertheless, the report indicates that the amount of various types of recyclable waste collected by DSPA and the Institute for Municipal Affairs (AMI) "registered a climb." "Among them, the amount of residues for ecopoints (paper, plastic, metal, aluminum/iron cans, etc.) had a considerable increase, while the amount of used batteries, glass, fluorescent lamps and lamps and electric and electronic equipment has been collected."
In terms of weight, recyclable residues with the largest amount of collection were paper, a total of 6,644.1 tons (+23.4%in annual terms), electronic and electrical equipment, 2,310.6 tons (-2.4%), glass, 1,139.4 tons (-3.1%) and food residues, which totaled 813.9 tons (+17.2%).
The types of recyclable materials whose collected most were the metal, which grew 79.7% to 607.5 tons, plastic, which increased by 35.2% to 779.7 tons, and aluminum and iron cans, which rose 25.8%. Already the used clothes collected totaled 679.1 tons (+9.6%). In addition, in 2024, about 317.8 tons of wood from the afforestation were collected by AMI.
The authorities admit that "the growth of the population, urban construction and the development of the tourism industry, among others, aggravated the pressure on the treatment of urban waste in Macao." Noting that the state is promoting the construction of “cities without waste”, it is said in the report that “Macao can also take as reference the success cases in the country”, and boost the reduction of waste, in order to build a “without waste” bay.
 
Non -metallic pollution is that most affects waters
In the water chapter, the document states that “non -metallic pollution was the factor that most affected water quality” in Macau. The non -metallic exhibition evaluation index has registered a rise in most monitoring points, including along the coast and in maritime areas, "which is associated with the overall change in regional water quality." The monitoring points where it was most severe continued to be those of the interior port and Fai Chi Kei.
Regarding the eutrophication index, there was a significant increase compared to 2023, continuing the inner port and fai chi kei to be the places where “the highest levels” were recorded.
"The non-metallic exposure assessment index and the eutrophication index continued to be a very high level, due to severe pollution caused by inorganic nitrogen and active phosphates, among other factors," the document states.
According to the data available, in 2024, about 326 tons of solid waste and water jacinths were collected from the sea - DSPA does not detail the amount of concrete waste that was removed from the sea. The volume represents a 78% increase compared to the 183 tons collected in 2023. On the other hand, it is said that two occurrences of red tide were recorded.
The total daily volume of wastewater treatment rose 4.2% to 239,159 cubic meters, with the range of increased treatment volume in the Coloane WWTP, more specifically, more, 15.3% to 55,343 cubic meters, and representing 23.1% of the total treated water. The Peninsula WWTP was the one that most dealt with waste waters, totaling 152,247 cubic meters (63.7% of the total), having a 6.8% increase in annual terms.
The report also reveals a 10% increase in greenhouse gas emissions, with carbon dioxide representing 90% of the total. The most significant increases in greenhouse gases originated in local electricity production and air transport. According to the secretary for transport and public works, Raymond Tam, "the way to the green transition with low carbon emissions is long and challenging."
 
“Clear increase” of complaints on noise
Noise complaints have been prevailing among the different categories of environmental complaints received by the Directorate of Environmental Protection Services, “there is a clear increase in the total number of complaints about noise in 2024, compared to 2023,” says the report. In total, 10,987 complaints ( +4.3%) were accounted for, continuing to predominate reports on “conversations and shouts” (4,874, +14.5%), “Music and Karaoke” (1,733, +11.2%), construction works (681, +32.7%) and “interior decorations” (630, -23.6%).</description><pubDate>2025-06-06 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Spoonfuls in ecological zones have suffered a strong break in the last 10 years</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/colhereiros-nas-zonas-ecologicas-sofreram-forte-quebra-nos-ultimos-10-anos/</link><description>In mid-January, 16 Black Harvesters were spotted in Cotai ecological zones, which, while reflecting an annual climb of three, equals less than 30% of the existing colony in the same period as the 2015 migratory season, according to international coordinated censuses by the Hong Kong Poultry Observation Society. This year, the total population of this protected species, native to this and Southeast Asia, exceeded the seven thousands for the first time, however, suffered a worrying decrease in Hong Kong and Shenzhen

Despite being a very popular bird in Macao, especially after assuming the Mascot Statute of Tourism in April 2018, in an artistic fusion that also found inspiration in the guide headlight, the Black Householder continues to have a little significant presence in Cotai ecological areas during the migratory season, which extends from October to April. This panorama is mirrored in the results of the last international census, coordinated by the Hong Kong (HKWWS) poultry society, which, although illustrating an annual improvement, denotes a sharp decline of this species protected over the past decade in the territory.
As part of this study, which took place between January 17 and 19 this year, mobilizing more than 200 conservation specialists and volunteers in 11 winter regions, 16 brain harvesters were detected at the MSAR, three more than in the similar period of 2024 and less than in 2023. On the other hand, the number decreased by 71% in the space of 55 in January 2015, which already represented a descent against the 60 unveiled a year earlier.
The analysis of international censuses carried out since 2014 shows that peak in Macao was hit in 2016, with the record of 61 copies of this native species of this and Southeast Asia included in the Red International Union List for Nature Conservation and Natural Resources (IUCN) since 2000. In 2017, the number abruptly dropped to 44 and, after some annual oscillations, suffered expressionables by 2022 and 2023, settling in 22 and 21, respectively.
The Directorate of Macao Environmental Protection Services (DSPA) also pointed out a break in the harvester population in 2024. In the state of the Environment report yesterday, DSPA indicates that, according to observations made during the time of migratory birds passing in 2024, the maximum number dropped to 33, compared to 52 registered one year. In 2022, 34 had been seen.
In January of this year, Macau welcomed only 0.2% of the total black chaurs observed by HKBWS in various countries and regions of Asia. The global population first surpassed the seven thousand bar, the result of a slight annual rise from 1.3% (plus 93) to 7,081. However, in the “Deep Bay” area, which covers Hong Kong and Shenzhen, decreased 12.5% ​​to 328.
"If Hong Kong does not expand its wet zones-or worse, allowing for greater loss and habitat degradation-it may have difficulty attracting more creal harvesters to winter," warned HKBWs, noting, on the other hand, that "the slowdown in the global growth rate suggests that population growth may be approaching a strangulation, demanding goals, demanding goals, demanding targets. more ambitious global conservation. ”
Taiwan again stood out as the main winter area, with 4,169 harvesters (58.9% of the total), a 0.8% or 34 birds. Following is the mainland China (Jiangsu, Shanghai, Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi and Haião), with 1,671, 41 or 2.5% than in 2024. Japan increased by 2% (14 more birds) to 716.
Although the global population reached a maximum historical maximum, the growth rate of about 1% is the second lowest in a decade, warned Yu Yat-Tung, director of HKBWS. "We must set more aggressive global goals - not only to wage the loss of wet zones, but also expand these zones and actively restore reproduction and wintering habitats - to ensure that 30 years of conservation efforts are not wasted," he said.
In addition, those responsible for the international census consider that "offshore wind parks are becoming a lethal threat to migratory birds." Quoting a study published in 2024 in the academic magazine “Ecology”, highlight the cases of two black-tracked GPS harvesters who “were forced to change their migration route during yellow sea crossing due to winter parks in the 2021 and 2022 winter, respectively,” one of which died a month after returning to the Korea.
According to the HKBWS director, wind parks “reduce essential mud seat habitats” to harvesters and “pose fatal risks to birds due to collisions with turbine blades”. "Black harvesters depend on multiple stops during migration, which means that any environmental change in a single place can represent a threat to the entire population," he explained, by appealing to the reinforcement of regional conservation efforts and intergovernmental cooperation.
In February this year, HKBWS, together with conservation experts, held a Symposium to propose the revision of the International Black Householder Plan, published in 2010. The Asian Northeast Sub-Regional Program for Environmental Cooperation, a structure formed by several Asian Northeast governments, will support the new Action Plan, which aims to face new challenges to protection of the protection of HARDERS. The Symposium also decided to designate the third Saturday of March of each year as the “International Day of the Black Household” to sensitize the public for their conservation.
In Hong Kong, the government launched an action plan that advocates 19 types of measures by 2028, including “the analysis of development proposals, infrastructure projects, or land use planning” to safeguard the harvester habitat. However, it regrets the poultry observation society, “important decision bodies, such as the Development Department, the Planning Department and the Civil Engineering and Development Department, were excluded from the implementation of this action, revealing that the considerations on biodiversity continue to be improperly integrated into interdepportional land policies”.</description><pubDate>2025-06-06 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Pianist concert Joana Rolo highlights Portuguese composers</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/concerto-da-pianista-joana-rolo-destaca-compositores-portugueses/</link><description>Joana Rolo

At the invitation of the Portuguese Institute of the East, Joana Rolo will also participate in other events integrated into the “June, Portugal month” program, but now alongside opera singer Elvire de Paiva and Pona. The two artists went to the Portuguese school yesterday and today they will lead workshops in other educational establishments. On Sunday, they will act together at a concert for children at the Rui Cunha Foundation

“Portuguese composers in the world” is the title of the solo concert that pianist Joana Rolo will hold today in the late afternoon, at 7 pm, at the Stanley Ho hall of the Macao Military Club. The classical music interpreter will present a “special program” for this first trip to the territory, which will also be its debut on the Asian continent.
Integrated in the series of events that mark “June, the month of Portugal”, the piano recital has as its theme the inspiration that Portuguese composers have harvested from travel and stays abroad, their meetings with the avant -garde music and the influences that have imported into the country throughout history.
The concert presents characteristics something different from the usual, since it will have commented parts, that is, the music will alternate with spoken interventions of the pianist, guiding the public for the stories of each piece and composer.
To the Jornal Tribuna de Macau, Joana Rolo revealed that “the idea behind the concert is to publicize Portuguese composers and Portuguese music, which is very little played in Portugal and abroad”.
The musical artist will play excerpts from Carlos Seixas, a composer “very influenced by Scarlati, who was perhaps the greatest composer of his time, having both lived a lot,” he said, adding that Viana da Mota, Austrian Franz Liszt and Alexandre Rei Colaço are other highlights.
Speaking of specific by Alexandre Rei Colaço, born in Tanger, Morocco, and later Portuguese naturalized, professor of the princes D. Luís Filipe de Bragança and D. Manuel de Bragança (future King D. Manuel II of Portugal), Joana Rolo points out that he was a “very international composer, who innovated by bringing the fado into the concert room, having been the first to inspire the Portuguese folk music, Popular music, therefore, in fado, and writing fado to piano, in a collection of nine ”, one of which the artist will play today.
Within the same “current of nationalisms”, the idea of ​​the concert is to interpret the composers of all nations “who more or less made the identity songs of each country, popular songs, and put them in sheet music, writing them with the classic Western tradition,” he said.
This is also the case of a Chinese composer. "From him I will play a play called Liuyang River, which is a very dear Chinese traditional melody, from what I read and researched, arranged in a style that will drink to the classic western tradition," he said, adding to being "a very special culture meeting, with wonderful result, because it is a beautiful piece."
 
Panorama of Portuguese musicians “is very good”
Chronologically, the recital will travel the history of Portuguese classical music. "What is interesting is also to think that classical music developed in the center of Europe, Germany, Italy, France, Austria, etc., and in fact Portugal, as it was a more peripheral country, was far from this center and far from the avant -gard. JTM.
Joana Rolo, born in Portugal and living in Amsterdam, in the Netherlands, 15 years ago, considers that although "it seems that we are unclear and uncomfortable of our composers, this does not mean that we have not had some small pearls." In fact, he said, "We have great composers, despite not being a country with a huge tradition in classical music."
With opera singer Elvire de Paiva and Pona, Portuguese music founded “Vocalini”, a project whose aim is to make the lyrical singing accessible to children around the world. Vocalini's first CD was released in the spring of 2023.
The “Vocalini, let's sing Opera” will be another of the events in Macau. This is a participatory concert, scheduled for 4 pm on Sunday, June 8, at the Rui Cunha Foundation, with the organization of the Portuguese Institute of the East (IPOR), which will be attended by the pianist, but in this case together with Elvire. The pair will also participate in workshops, to be held in educational establishments, one of which yesterday was the stage the Portuguese school.
"The expectation for this passage of mine to Macau is very positive, and can say, in a short time of stay, that I am already delighted, people are lovely, having been very well received by IPOR," says the 37 -year -old song.
Addressing the panorama of Portuguese pianists and musicians in general, Joana Rolo considers that “today there are a lot of good musicians”. “There are more and more Portuguese musicians abroad very conceptual, fantastic, playing in great European orchestras and so on,” he says.
In addition, it emphasizes, "Conservatives from all over Europe are full of high -level Portuguese students, so we can say that the scenario has changed a lot compared to what it was 50 years ago, or 30 years ago." Therefore, “I think you can make a career as a musician in Portugal”.
In projects for the immediate future, “publicizing Portuguese music” is the most important for Joana Rolo. The artist has been preparing a program with Elvire Paiva and pona for children, "which is a magic flute for children."
After Macao, this same concert that will present in the territory, “Portuguese composers in the world”, will tour Europe in the fall, with recitals in late September in Bratislava and Nitra, Slovakia, Budapest, Hungary, and other places.
Meanwhile, the pianist will act in July on the fifth edition of the Summer Music Festival in Lisbon, in which she is an artistic director. “This is the life of an artist,” he concludes.
Today's concert tickets at the Macao Military Club cost 120 Patacas, including a cocktail.</description><pubDate>2025-06-06 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Portugal makes history and is in the final on the night of 'Herr' Conceição</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/desporto/portugal-faz-historia-esta-na-final-na-noite-de-herr-conceicao/</link><description>EPA12156082 Francisco Conceicao of Portugal in Action During the Uefa Nations League Semi-Final Soccer Match Between Germany and Portugal, in Munich, Germany, 04 June 2025.

Luís Garoupa*
Portugal made history by hitting Germany (2-1) for the first time in 25 years, and in 40 on Germanic soil, finding himself with 'style' to the final of the soccer league on the night of 'Herr' Conceição. In Munich, on the first half of the race, Francisco Conceição jumped from the bank and told the draw in the match, 63 minutes with a great goal, after Wirtz gave advantage to the Germans at 48 and completely revolutionized the match.
Justice, Cristiano Ronaldo confirmed the turnaround on 68 minutes, in a simply overwhelming part of Portugal, in which he dominated and could and should have increased the advantage.
It was at Allianz Arena that the Portuguese team ended the German spell, ending a series of five straight losses in the last 25 years, always in the final phases. This was also only the second victory of Portugal in Germany, something that had only happened in 1985, in Stutar, 1-0, in the calculation for the European.
At a time when Roberto Martínez's continuity seemed to be at stake, the players spoke on the pitch and clearly demonstrated that they are with the Spanish coach and believe they could lead Portugal to the conquest of the World Cup2026. The intensity shown by the national team after the goal conceded was out of this world, with the players to crush and mark Germany, who has to thank their goalkeeper Stegen not to have suffered one of the heaviest defeats at home.
Portugal is so for the second time in the League of Nations final and can imitate the success of 2019, at the time in Porto. You still have to know if on Sunday, again in Munich, will be Spain or France.
Martínez surprised in the eleven chosen, especially with the entry of Trincão, for the first time starting with the Spaniard and official games, but who had a night to forget and could even have finished the match with wide guilt if Portugal had been defeated. It was a Loss of Children's Ball of Sporting's extreme in defensive zone that resulted in the goal of Germany.
Vitinha stayed in the bank, due to not being 100%, but also the European champions for Paris Saint-Germain Nuno Mendes and João Neves were holders, with the midfielder appearing with surprise adapted to right-back.
Portugal entered the duel of the 'socks' very well, with a first 20 minutes when 'drowned out' Germanic football and was building some bids of danger, always with Pedro Neto as protagonist. Chelsea's extreme made several starts on the left and, in one of them, offered Ronaldo the first night, but the national team captain shot for defense without great difficulty having Stegen.
Neto was in 'fire' around the wing, leaving Kimmich and tah in great difficulties and even tried the goal, with the ball just over the German goal.
It was an excellent phase of Roberto Martínez's team, but Germany eventually woke up and came the goalkeeper Diogo Costa. First, the owner of the Portuguese goal prevented the goal from Woltemade in the absolute debut for 'Mannschaft' and then showed great reflexes against Goretzka.
Costa kept the null, with Portugal realizing that the Germans were growing, thus choosing to pause the match, risk less and maintain the ball possession.
This resulted and Portugal could even have gone to the break, again with Pedro Neto in the image. New extreme adventure on the left and, when he could shot the goal, lost half a second looking for watching Ronaldo and was disarmed.
The second part practically started with Ronaldo to be millimeters of scoring after Nuno Mendes's poisonous center, but turned out to Germany celebrating with the help of Trincão. The Sporting player lost the ball in a forbidden zone, with a completely excusion feint, and it only ended inside Diogo Costa's networks, with Wirtz to head successfully in the area after a good combination of Germans.
Already after Bruno Fernandes was very close to the draw, Martínez changed three players at once, releasing Nelson Semedo, Vitinha and Francisco Conceição, who ended the night of terror of Trincão and began his dream. Practically in the first play, Conceição, discarded on the right, fled the field outside and still far from the large area shot a "great goal", redoing a tight draw on the scorer.
Portugal was 'electric', earning all the duels and all balls, and, shortly later, the turnaround was consummated, with Nuno Mendes and 'firing' on the left and, already inside the area, this time watching Ronaldo this time.
The Portuguese team continued to stifle the Germans and was gathering several opportunities to 'kill' the round, with Conceição to take paint to the post and then Stegen to perform almost impossible defenses to prevent Diogo Jota twice from scoring, who had yielded the stained Pedro Neto.
Adeyemi was still startled by a shot to Diogo Costa's post, but the Portuguese triumph was never at stake.

AMI stresses that the agreement allows products to reach the interior of China “with high quality”
 
More than 50 types of Macao foods have already been covered by the “Cooperation Agreement in Food Products Safety Fabricated in Macao and exported to the interior of China”, signed in 2020. “Cooperative Supervision” allows for “sanitorial -friendly facilities”, provided they meet “food safety and market access”, ensures the institute for municipal matters, guarantees the institute for municipal affairs for municipal affairs for municipal affairs for municipal affairs for municipal affairs for municipal affairs for municipal affairs for matters for matters for matters for matters for matters for matters for matters for matters (AI).
In addition, 10 types of meat products, which include “traditional pastry products, ready -to -eat swallow nests, meat products, among others”, were recommended by AMI to China's General Customs Administration (AGA) to be registered in mainland China.
The agreement and the “memo about health inspection and the veterinary requirements of meat products exported by Macau to the interior of China”, signed in 2023, have also benefited the export of foods manufactured in the interior of China, the statement says.
Macao food manufacturing companies, under the supervision of AMI and if the health requirements of MSAR and Continental China meet, can be recommended by AMA to AGA itself. The institute states that, after being approved, companies "may have access to export qualification to the interior of China and enjoy trade facilitation measures."
As a rule, food products from Macao that pass the border with a proof of AMI hygiene document "can be subject to priority inspection of the interior of China." On the other hand, samples of products registered in the “Cooperation Agreement” do not need to be retained for inspection, explains AMI, allowing products to enter the market “freshly and with high quality”.
Food products manufactured in the MSAR "are attractive to the interior market of China," they can read, with the AI ​​say they continue to "actively support local companies" so that they "take advantage of the policies offered."
Food safety is an “essential value safeguarded by the Macao food industry”, according to the AMI statement, which encourages companies to “strictly comply with the respective legislation and food security criteria of Macao and the interior of China”.

A scientific research team from the Macao Polytechnic University (UPM) won first place in the world artificial intelligence contest for the detection of breast cancer, organized by the Paulista Society of Radiology and Diagnosis by Image, Brazil. The “Big &amp; Ai4onco” team, formed by the assistant professor Tan Tao at the Faculty of Applied Sciences at UPM and the Academics of the Holland Institute of Cancer and the University of Utreque da Holanda School of Medicine, “obtained excellent results in the competition”, having distinguished among several participating teams from around the world, says a note from the higher education institution.
UPM stresses that, in this way, the team provided "scientific support for the development of the Macao Big Health industry." The contest aims to promote the deep application of artificial intelligence in mammography analysis and improve the efficiency and accuracy of breast cancer screening.
“This competition has attracted the active participation of top teams from around the world, aiming to optimize the analysis and interpretation of mammography images through the development of advanced artificial intelligence algorithms, providing more effective technical support for early detection of breast cancer,” can be read.
The university also underlines that, to support the development of the Big Health industry in Macao, the Faculty of Applied Sciences “has been dedicated to promoting cooperation and exchange with the international sector, is committed to interdisciplinary investigation into the intersection between artificial intelligence and medicine, and strives to transform the results of research into practical clinical applications”.

Amelia António told the Jornal Tribuna de Macau that the registrations “are not yet finished”, but that the initiative should have about 200 participants. The place to perform the activities remains the “drama” of the house,

Casa de Portugal will again organize the summer campus in the last two weeks of July, and in the first three weeks of August. Amelia António explained to the Jornal Tribuna de Macao that the registration is not yet finalized, since there were people who expressed “desire to register, but did not have the accounts up to date or missing documents”, there are still pending cases.
Without advanced final numbers, the president of Casa de Portugal said that students enrolled in this year's edition "should approach 200". Children, aged between four and 10 years, will not be mostly Portuguese mother tongue, “a situation that has been coming from several years”.
The campus will provide participants with “quite varied” activities, according to the associative leader, which include “playful activities, outdoors and games, not to be a boring activity”.
"They are on vacation, but although they have to have a didactic character, [the activities] must also have a playful character, to be pleasant," he said. As a rule, students “build and do things that love to show their parents” and “are very proud of the work they do,” said the president of Casa de Portugal. They do “a little bit of everything to pull for the taste and self -confidence of the kids”.
On the other hand, Amelia António admitted that Casa de Portugal faced some difficulties, especially in relation to the site for the activities. “The space is always our annual drama. We have now been working with the Portuguese School of Macau, which has helped us to the fullest, but this year the school is under construction”, which forced Casa de Portugal to coordinate the initiative with the work.
"There were years when we had everything prepared to announce, only the place was missing. It is a systematic problem that Casa de Portugal has to do the place to perform the activities, namely when they are activities involving children," said Amelia António.
"Even during the year, we have a lot of parents' requests to continue to make a certain kind of activities that parents appreciate and that kids like and that they think is very important for their linguistic development," he continued. However, Casa de Portugal no longer performs initiatives “because we have no place to do”, said Amelia António, admitting “huge difficulties” to respond to the requests made to them.
The summer campus has been held for about 15 years and the initiative was growing, until in the pandemic years everything changed. In 2018, according to data indicated by Amelia António previously to this newspaper, there were 400 vacancies and a year later were 800. Usually eight or nine weeks of activities, but because of COVID-19, the house of Portugal was forced in 2020 to make the campus for just four weeks with 300 registrations. In this year's edition, it will be five weeks.
 
Two pedagogical workshops for children
Tomorrow will take place two workshops for children, being the idea to promote a taste for reading. The activities will be held at the headquarters of the House of Portugal and will be conducted by by Barbara Maria and Carmo, childhood educator. Between 10h00 and 12h00, the session is intended for children aged five and six, and the activities are developed from the book “How far does a line be taken?”. Already in the second session, scheduled for the afternoon (15h00 to 17h30), the workshop is directed to children of three and four years. The activity for parents and children has as protagonist the book "is not a box!". The “Happy Children” program also has presentations in the kindergarten D.

The lack of recognition of the qualifications of health professionals, the scarcity of information exchange systems and different regulatory staff are some of the obstacles. The author proposes some measures, for example, a “negotiating platform” to define the qualification requirements of those who exert beyond borders, a solid information sharing system and the recognition of medical records

The “lack of mutual recognition of medical qualifications, limited interconnectivity of sanitary information systems and divergent regulatory staff” are some of the “barriers” that “prevent effective collaboration” between Macau, Hong Kong and Guangdong in the medical field. The conclusions arise in the study entitled “Collaboration of China Health Services in the large area of ​​Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Bay: Barriers and Next Steps”. In this sense, the author, Wu Weidong, from the School of Humanities of the University of Jinan, Guangdong, lists a series of potential solutions, for a higher connection between the three regions in health.
"The Great Bay, which works in the framework of" a country, two systems ", results in various institutional regulations. Due to historical evolution, the economic and social evolution of Hong Kong, Macao and Continental China differ significantly from each other," says the author, adding that the three regions "have considerable institutional differences in terms of access, provision and regulation of health services."
First of all, he says that doctors' licensing systems "are not mutually recognized, reflecting institutional differences between the three regions." "This disparity creates significant challenges, such as the limitations of medical qualifications and the difficulties of mutual recognition of medical professional classifications. Continental China doctors, for example, cannot work in Hong Kong or Macao without first passing local medical qualification exams," he exemplifies.
On the other hand, although the interior of China issues short -term exercise authorizations for Hong Kong and Macau doctors, the scope of action “remains restricted”. For example, Macao's traditional Chinese medicine doctors who exercise at the Macao University School of Medicine and Technology Hospital in the deepened cooperation zone are allowed to prescribe medications, but cannot practice acupuncture. “These restrictions prevent their full use, limiting their ability to provide comprehensive care to patients,” argues Wu.
In addition, the misalignment between the mainstream China and RAE professional titles evaluation system "contributes to an exceptionally low approval rate to doctors of Hong Kong and Macau, despite the opportunity for certification."
On the other hand, differences in hospital management systems, health services standards and drug use “complicate the integration of information and medical services”. Also data protection raises questions. In Hong Kong, unauthorized disclosure of patient data can result in severe sanctions, including fines and prison, while in Macao the law classifies medical information as sensitive data. Although China has taken “a significant step” in this matter in 2021, the new law needs time to be improved and reinforced.
"This discrepancy can lead residents of Hong Kong and Macau to hesitate to share personal information with health institutions on the continent, probably due to concerns about potential data violations. There are still gaps in transmitting transmission of medical data and transionic health services, namely in terms of legal regulation," he says.
There is also the issue of medical records: "Recognition of medical records from different hospitals involves certain risks, as health professionals have to analyze the results of exams and diagnoses of other institutions and use them as a basis for their diagnoses. This process is closely linked to the levels of competence of health professionals from different hospitals."
Another aspect mentioned is the payment. In the RAE, health services are predominantly funded by public revenues, while the cities of the large bay work with a mixed social and universal health insurance system. "The continent's health system does not provide coverage to residents seeking medical treatment in Hong Kong and Macau. (…) [E] Although Hong Kong and Macau offer partial financial support to residents receiving medical care on the continent - for example, through valleys - this support has a limited scope," the study says.
For the author, another "critical question" is the legal jurisdiction associated with the location of the health services and the place of residence of the patient, "especially when medical disputes arise." "Patients often face difficulties in sailing unknown legal systems, which complicates their ability to effectively protect their rights in case of disputes," he notes. "Without comprehensive regulatory cooperation between regions, medical dispute resolution becomes increasingly difficult, which further limits the development of transfronheous health services."
 
Next Steps
To mitigate obstacles, it advocates “the establishment of comprehensive regulatory alignment, which ensures mutual recognition of health professionals' qualifications”, as well as “the development of integrated platforms for the sharing of information and the regulation of services is essential to promote effective cooperation in the provision of health services”.
In the field of medical qualifications, “it is essential to reinforce collaboration and exchanges among health professionals”. "The reinforcement of exchange and the formation of medical talent between mainland China, Hong Kong and Macao in various domains is essential to contribute to the construction of a 'healthy bay'. This can be facilitated by establishing collaboration platforms for service provision, talent training programs and the creation of interregional clinical trial centers," he suggests.
It also proposes the creation of a “negotiating platform” to define the qualification requirements of medical professionals who exercise beyond borders, promoting mutual recognition. "At the same time, potential challenges, such as the influx of foreign doctors, the reduction in the salaries of local doctors and the violation of the rights of local professionals, should be addressed proactively. Special attention should be paid to the concerns of Hong Kong and Macao health care providers in order to ensure fair and equitable practices," he argues.
It is also “essential to advance with collaboration mechanisms for medical referrals and emergency transfers”, and at this stage, “one of the priorities is the development of a solid health services sharing system between regions, facilitating interoperability and mutual recognition of medical records”.
As this collaboration progresses, the protection of the privacy of patients and the prevention of data violations should be the main priorities, continues Wu Weidong, stressing that the rights of professionals should also be safeguarded.
"Establishing a cooperation mechanism for the protection of health care rights in the Great Bay is critical to reducing medical disputes between regions and ensuring effective and effective responses when conflicts arise. The signing of cooperation agreements between Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau would offer a legal basis for the implementation of provisional arbitration measures ordered by courts or arbitration courts." considers.
The academic argues that there is a “critical need” of collaboration in health, “driven by the growing interregional demand due to increased migration, population aging and deeper economic integration”. According to data cited in the study, in 2018, more than 10,000 admitted patients from Hong Kong (8,037) and Macao (2,072) were reported in Guangdong, riding in 2021 to a total of 16,153, with 10,750 of Hong Kong and 5,403 from Macao, a growth of about 33.8% and 160%, respectively.
"After covid-19 pandemic, transfronheous medical consumption increased in the Great Bay. Only Shenzhen medical institutions provided diagnostic and treatment services to 640,000 residents of Hong Kong and Macao in 2023," he adds.</description><pubDate>2025-06-05 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Famous for dragons, Flores Island is a popular tourist destination, with risks</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/lazer/famosa-pelos-dragoes-ilha-das-flores-e-destino-turistico-popular-riscos/</link><description>A small coastal town known as the gateway to Dragon Land has come to life in the last decade, after being first positioned as one of Indonesia's “10 New Balis” in a government tourism initiative in 2016.
Located in Ponta West of Flores Island in East Nusa Tenggara, Labuan Bajo is more famous for being the trampoline for the famous UNESCO Komodo National Park, which is the largest habitat of its homonymous reptile, the Komodo dragon. But in the middle of the bustling of a busy airport track and water-filled boats and modern boats, experts warn that it is necessary to avoid excessive tourism, excessive development and environmental neglect-problems that affect Bali, a popular tourist spot.
The strategy “10 New Balis” targets specific locations, such as Labuan Bajo, to receive funding for infrastructure development. The objectives are to alleviate excessive tourism in Bali, distribute tourist revenues and boost regional economies in the most populous country in Southeast Asia.
Other locations include Lake Toba in North Sumatra, Mandalika in Lombok and Likupang in Northern Sulawesi.
Focus on these new areas has led to significant changes, such as building an international motorcycle racing track in Mandalika, which hosts the end of the world superbike championship since 2021 and motorcycle award motorcycle races since 2022.
However, Labuan Bajo, who is two and a half hours of Jakarta flight and three hours from Singapore, stands out for registering the largest incremental gains in terms of visits from foreign tourists.
Its main attraction, Komodo National Park, received 334,206 visitors in 2024, two thirds of which were foreign tourists. In 2016, he received about 100,000 visitors. Almost all tourists who go to Labuan Bajo visit Komodo National Park.
In the last decade, Labuan Bajo has seen the emergence of new roads and amenities, such as shopping centers, brand hotels and food squares, all built by the national government.
Its main marina and the airport have also been renewed and remodeled in the last four years, with the latter's track has been expanded to 100 meters. Hotel operator Marriott International has built a luxury resort there, and will soon be accompanied by another from Intercontinental Hotels Group.
In 2024, Komodo Airport in Labuan Bajo was declared International Airport, allowing the operation of direct flights from and for foreign cities. Previously, most foreign visitors had to fly by Jakarta to reach Labuan Bajo.
According to surveys to visitors in 2024, a foreign tourist visiting the city spends an average of 8 million rupees (almost 4,000 patacas) a day, remaining an average of four to five days, while a national tourist spends about 2.7 million rupees per day, remaining an average of three days.
It is recalled that Flores Island has been a Portuguese possession from the sixteenth century to the nineteenth century. In 1851, the then governor of Timor, Solor and Flores, José Joaquim Lopes Lima, with a lack of money, agreed to sell the flowers and the islands nearby for 200 thousand Florins (former Dutch currency), without consulting Lisbon, having been fired for it, but the decision remained. Today the island is part of the Indonesian province of Eastern probe…
