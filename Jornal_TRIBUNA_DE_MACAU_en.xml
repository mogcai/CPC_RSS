Since the process of socio-economic diversification to the successful application of the “country, two systems” principle, the Macaense community, as a “member of the large family” of Macau, “plays an indispensable role and makes important contributions”, acknowledged the head of Executive at a dinner offered to Macanese representatives. “The support and participation of the Macaense community are indispensable for the good performance of the role of Macau as a platform for economic and commercial cooperation services between China and Portuguese -speaking countries,” said Sam Hou Fai, according to an official note.
Note that the Government of MSA has “given importance and supported the Macaense community” in the development of initiatives in the areas of education, social services, cultural activities, restoration and law, among others, in addition to the meeting of the macanese communities, whose last edition took place Between December 1st and 6th last year, the Chief Executive has asserted that "as always, it will continue to help the Macaense community advance to a new level in every respect."
When speaking at dinner, held last Monday, Sam Hou Fai recalled that, despite having studied in Portugal when he was young, he works and has lived in Macau a few decades ago, so he has known many of the participants in the event since the 1980s, Since all this allowed him to “better understand” the Macanese community.

Kuok Cheong U, Deputy Director of Macao Health Services (SSM), predicted that the masters should record less than 3,500 births in 2025, a number that would be the lowest since 2004. According to the Chinese channel of TDM, Kuok Cheong U He reported the record of 284 newborns in both hospitals in the territory until Monday, 17 less than in the same period of 2024.
After visiting the first baby born in the lunar year of the serpent, which began on Wednesday, the SSM subdirector said he hoped the birth rate "continues to fall" and added that "it will be good" if the number of births reaches 3.500 .
If Kuok's forecast is accurate, this will be the least fertile year since 2004, when Macau registered 3,308 births.
According to official data, in 2023 there were 3,712 births in Macao, 43.5% less than 10 years ago (6,571) and out of a maximum of 7,913 fixed in 1988, which was a lunar year of the dragon.
Considered a symbol of royalty, fortune and power and the only mythical figure among the 12 signs of the Chinese Zodiac millennial, the dragon sign brings together a set of characteristics that traditionally leads couples to plan to have children during this period.
By the way, the father of the first newborn at Kiang Wu Hospital, nicknamed Yip, told the press that his son was born later than expected and that the couple was telling that it was still "a Dragon Baby."
Although 2024 was considered an auspicious year, Tao Xuemei and Wong Chio Fan, a young couple, told Lusa that the personal and Chinese coffers do not allow this step.
“We are concerned to have children because of national debt, due to economic recession. The option for motherhood really depends on the country's economic capacity and the debt payment capacity, ”says Tao, 28, to work as a school advisor.
“We don't want to have children just to pass them [our] debts,” adds Wong, a 35 -year -old contractor.
The economic growth of mainland China has reached the 5% goal of Beijing by 5%, but some economists claim that the economy is expanding at a slower pace than indicated in official estimates. Nicholas Chen, Creditsights analyst, told Lusa that the company of the Financial Notation Agency Fitch group expects a slowdown to 4.7% this year, in part due to poor private consumption.
During the election campaign, the new head of the Executive of MSAR admitted that one of the biggest long -term challenges is low birth, which in 2023 reached a historical minimum of 0.59 births per woman. Sam Hou Fai said it is necessary to “create conditions in terms of education and employment” to rise birth and promised to study the extension of the maternity leave, currently fixed in 70 days, and the creation of a compulsory central action fund.

"China is strongly dissatisfied and firmly against" the tariffs, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce said in a statement, announcing "corresponding measures to resolutely protect Chinese rights and interests.
“There are no winners in a trade war or tariff,” the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MNE) reiterated in another statement.
Beijing has announced that he will file a complaint against Washington to the World Trade Organization (WTO) so he called “unilateral imposition of customs rates in serious violation of WTO rules”. These taxes “not only are useless to solve US problems, but also undermine normal economic and commercial economic cooperation,” the Ministry of Commerce said.
Trump's decree determines the imposition of 10% rates on China products, 25% of Mexico and 25% of Canada, except in Canadian oil, which will have a 10% rate.
Trump had already threatened to launch tariffs to ensure greater cooperation from countries to prevent illegal immigration and the smuggling of chemicals used to make fentanyl, a powerful opiate that causes thousands of deaths in the US. The document accuses Beijing of passivity in drug trafficking for the US, and goes further by indicating that China “actively supports and expands the drug business“ to poison ”Americans.
According to the White House, the order also includes a mechanism for increasing customs rates in case of retaliation of Mexico, Canada or China - the three main US business partners and in total represent more than 40% of imports in the country.
"China expects the US expects to analyze and deal with problems like Fentanil objectively and rationally rather than constantly threatening other countries with tariffs," said Chinese MNE.
Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum and Canada Prime Minister Justin Trudeau have already announced, in retaliation, the imposition of customs to products from the US.
Sheinbaum said he instructed the secretary of the economy to implement a response that includes retaliation tariffs and other measures in defense of Mexico's interests. “We categorically reject the White House's slander that the Mexican government has alliances with criminal organizations, as well as any intention to interfere with our territory,” wrote the head of state on social network X.
Trump's decree also claims, without presenting evidence, that Mexican drug cartels formed "an alliance with the Mexican government."
“If the US government and its agencies wanted to address severe fentanyl consumption in their country, they could combat the sale of drugs on the streets of their main cities, which they do not, and the bleaching of capital that this illegal activity generates and That so many damage caused to its population, ”added Sheinbaum, accusing US arms manufacturers of selling weapons to“ these criminal groups ”and stressing that his government seized“ 40 tons of drugs, including 20,000 doses of fentanile ”in four months.
In turn, Trudeau has announced that Canada will apply the same 25% rate to US products. According to rates, fees on $ 30 billion of fruits and alcoholic beverages will come into force tomorrow.
Trump also threatened to implement tariffs against the European Union. “Will I impose rates on the European Union? Do you want a sincere response or a political response? Of course. The European Union has treated us terribly, ”Trump told journalists at the Oval Hall.
French Industry Minister Marc Ferracci defended Europe yesterday a "scathing answer" from Europe in the face of the threats of new American tariffs, while Japanese finance minister Kastunobu Kato said he was "deeply concerned" about the repercussions for the world economy.

“It was a success to be able to demonstrate not only the investors that it was possible for Pataca to have a much higher return to what exists in bank deposits, and, in this sense, it was proof that we were right, [that] Pataca can be a coin of Investment and not just a transactional currency, ”said the founder and president of A&amp;P Investment Funds Management Society.
It is an open public fund aimed at investing in high quality monetary market instruments and short-term bank deposits.

"We have to develop this market, as the government says we have to diversify the economy and, in the financial system, this part of funds has not really been touched," he added at the time.

The body cooperated with similar institutions of Shenzhen and Zhongshan in performing tests at dozen and a half of locks with "magic eye"
 
Victor Rebelo
 
The popularity of using intelligent locks, especially in the entrance doors of housing, deserved to perform tests, which resulted in some recommendations. In articulation with the trend of consumer integration in the large bay, and to help consumers make smart choice, the advice of consumers of Macau, Shenzhen and Zhongshan developed a comparative test of intelligent locks with "magic eye".
The tests focused on three aspects, namely safety, performance and subjective evaluation of experimentation, with the 15 samples being purchased on online platforms and in physical stores of these three locations, with prices between 1,220 and 6,780 patacas.
According to the results released by the Macao Consumer Council (CC), safety and performance are in accordance with the criteria established by Chinese national standards. As a first barrier to the home, safety is the most important indicator of a lock. Compared to a traditional device, the safety item of a lock consists of the function of multiple intelligent safety defenses, as well as mechanical safety.
The average fingerprint verification time refers to the time required from digital printing to unlocking, considering more fluent as the short time for unlocking.
The test result showed a compliance with the requirements of the respective standard, and, in relation to all 15 samples, the fingerprint verification takes an average time of less than two seconds, while two of them perform excellent performance because it was time consuming less than a second.

Rooders seen in public spaces, in the middle of daylight, which recently led to the end of three supermarkets and a restaurant, motivated a written interpellation sent to the government by José Pereira Coutinho. By the complaints presented to him by residents who live mainly in the oldest neighborhoods of the city, the deputy is led to consider that there has been an increase in the presence of rats and cockroaches.
Although acknowledging that the level of control implemented by the Institute for Municipal Affairs has had some effect, after the placement, in 2023, of 1,400 traps for mice installed on public roads, the hemiciclo member intends to know that the competent authorities do about those. DECUTIZATION ACTIONS CELLED Since the end of October of that year to date.
On the other hand, he wants to get answers about the effectiveness of rodent and cockroach population control measures, implemented during this period, especially in sanitation networks.
In questioning, Pereira Coutinho asks if the executive has intentions to promote deractization and disbursement campaigns in 2025 “to protect public health and mitigate associated risks”, such as dangerous diseases.
The deputy considers the intervention in this situation urgently, “through continuous inspection and more robust preventive actions, which involve not only the placement of traps, but also awareness campaigns on the correct waste management and the maintenance of hygiene in commercial establishments ”. From its perspective, a “more rigorous and more effective approach to ensuring a safe and healthy environment for consumers” is needed.
In this sense, Pereira Coutinho intends to know what the authorities think of the increase in complaints and what results were obtained in previous evaluations on rodent control, which indicated relatively good levels.
In one of the points of his written interpellation, the deputy urges the government to explain the strategies that are being considered for control, as well as the effectiveness of the effectiveness of the measurements and if there is a schedule for the evaluation of results and the possibility adjustments to the adopted actions.

Net revenues grew by 8.4% to almost 57 billion patacas

Sands China ended the financial year 2024 with net profits of $ 1.05 billion (8.4 billion patacas to the current exchange rate), which represents an increase of 50.9% over 696 million Dollars (almost 5.6 billion) accounted for the previous year, announced the Las Vegas Sands (LVS) group, Macao's majority shareholder. In turn, net revenues grew 8.4% to $ 7.08 billion (about 56.8 billion patacas), in annual terms, and EBITDA (results before interest, taxes, amortizations and depreciation ) rose 4.6% to $ 2.33 billion (18.7 billion patacas), according to the same data, which take US accounting norms.
Despite these annual increases, accounts of the last quarter of 2024 reflect homologous breaks, which LVS attributed to the impact of renewal projects on the Londoner and the Venetian arena. Between October and December, net revenues fell 5% to $ 1.76 billion US (14.1 billion patacas), compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, contributing to 17.7% breaks in net profits (237 million dollars or 1.9 billion patacas) and 12.7% in Ebitda ($ 571 million or 4.6 billion patacas).
In the last three months, net revenues have dropped 12.1% in Londoner (to $ 518 million) and 8.8% in Venetian ($ 682 million) in the annual variation. On the other hand, they rose 2.7% in Parisian (228 million dollars), 16.1% in Plaza and Four Seasons (223 million) and 6.2% at Sands Macau (86 million).
According to the LVS, the low retention of bets on the VIP segment had a negative impact of $ 22 million (176.5 million patacas) in the fourth quarter of 2024. In addition, income generated by rents decreased by about 27 million Dollars, in relation to the same quarter of the previous year, and margins in Londoner were directly affected by reducing the number of available rooms, Patrick Dumont, LVS president and operations director, said in the usual teleconference with analysts to discuss financial results.
However, in the Lunar New Year, Londoner has already made available about a thousand rooms and suites and rooms. In May, they should be ready for another 2,405 rooms and suites, according to Robert Goldstein, president and CEO of LVS.
"In Macao, the ongoing recovery continued during the quarter, although spending by visitor on the market stay below levels before pandemic," acknowledged Robert Goldstein, ensuring, however, that the group remains "enthusiastic" with opportunities growth in Macau and Singapore in the coming years. “Our decades commitment to make investments that increase the Macao Business and Leisure Appeal and support its development as a world center for business and leisure tourism positions us well, as the recovery of travel spending advances as it advances and tourism, ”he said, quoted in a statement.
In Singapore, resort Marina Bay Sands has again had “excellent financial and operational performance” in the last three months of 2024, with net revenues ($ 1.14 billion) to increase 7.2% and 23.7% , in annual and quarterly terms, respectively.

EBITDA (results before interest, taxes, amortization and depreciation) of the six Macao game operators could, in total, ascended about $ 8.4 billion (67.4 billion patacas to the current exchange rate) in 2025, which would represent an increase of 9% compared to the $ 7.7 billion scheduled for 2024, estimated consultant Seport Research Partners.
By 2027, the joint value of EBITDA could reach $ 9.9 billion (almost 79.5 billion patacas), translating an annual growth rate of 9% in the period between 2024 and 2027, according to the report Signed by the Vitaly Umnsky analyst. This projection is based on a scenario of “7% growth of gross game revenues in 2025 and in the coming years”.
In addition, convinced that the increase in revenues will be higher than the costs and the reinvestment will remain “relatively stable” compared to the percentage of gross casinos invoicing, Vitaly Umnsky believes that the sector's ebitda margins could rise 28.5% this Year and 29% in 2026, however, maintaining below 2019 levels.
According to the analyst, Ebitda margin fell from 29.5% in 2019 to 28.4% in 2023 and 28% in 2024, despite the higher business diversification. The decline derived “largely” of increased reinvestment and operating costs, after postpandeia “reopening” in early 2023, the consultant said.
EBITDA margins are seen as an important indicator of profitability by establishing a relationship between net revenues and companies' operational gains.
On the other hand, Seport Research Partners believes that Sands China and Galaxy Entertainment will probably reinforce their quotas in the game market this year. In turn, “the smallest operators” should suffer losses in the quotas, especially “if the recovery of the mass market base is stronger than we currently predict,” says the report.
 
Melco instated coming out of Manila and Cyprus
Vionary Umansky considers that Melco Resorts &amp; Entertainment should try to sell her appearances at the “City of Dreams Manila” Hotel and at the “City of Dreams Mediterranean” resort in Cyprus, in order to raise additional funds to acquire all Studio. City in Macao and invest in the Thai market. In a preview of the financial results of Macao operators in the fourth quarter of 2024, the analyst said that Melco's market share will have diminished slightly due to the widening of marketing offering and optimization by other concessionaires.
According to Seaport expert, investors' feeling about lawrence -led company actions remains negative and requires the implementation of some corporate measures, namely the total acquisition of Studio City, a venture in which he owns a participation of About 55%. Umansky also suggests a union of Melco Resorts &amp; Entertainment, quoted at Nasdaq, with his mother company, Melco International Development, listed in Hong Kong.
“Outside Macao, the City of Dreams Manila (Malila) continue to generate money, but lack real growth dynamics due to growing competition in Manila, while Cyprus has been a disappointment, partly due [conflicts] in Russia and In Israel, ”wrote the analyst, recommending the sale of Melco assets in these two markets.
In addition to the reinforcement of the participation in Studio City, UMNKsy understands that Melco should bet on Thailand, even though its capital limitations can condition a major investment in Bangkok. "Melco's advantage can reside in its ability to make a lower capital investment agreement with local partners [as you did at Sri Lanka], potentially in a secondary market in Thailand," he said.

French President Emmanuel Macron has announced that the famous “Mona Lisa” painting will feature his own room in the Louvre, as part of a series of changes to a “new Renaissance” of the world's most visited museum.
Given its history and estate, “the Louvre occupies a special place (…) to become a single museum in the world, already being the most beautiful and the largest, called to this new era” “New Renaissance” , Macron said, with Leonardo da Vinci's masterpiece to the background.
Concerns about the future of the Museum installed on the banks of the Sena River in Paris rose from Tom on January 13, when its director, Laurence des Cars, sent a letter to the Minister of Culture, Rachida Dati, to alert About the state of the Louvre. Among the problems mentioned are the “multiplication of defects in sometimes very degraded spaces”, “obsolete technical equipment” and “worrying temperature fluctuations” that affect the conservation of the works.
The “New Renaissance for the Louvre” plan provides for the creation of a new entrance by 2031, especially because the pyramid, inaugurated in 1988, which acts as a majestic entrance to the museum, is considered in Laurence Des Cars's letter as “structurally obsolete ”.
Architect Ieoh Ming Pei, who designed the Macao Science Center, conceived the Louvre entry to host four million visitors a year, but by 2024, nearly nine million passed by. Now the goal is to attract 12 million when the works are completed.
According to official data last year, 77% of Louvre visitors were foreigners, including 13% of the US, with several European countries represented: 5% of Italy, UK and Germany, and 4% from Spain. "Chinese visitors [6% against 2.4% in the previous year] begin to record a significant return," the museum stressed.
The new access, whose design will be chosen in a “International Architecture Contest”, will be created at the Perrault Colonata Classicist, located on the East Facade and on the opposite side of the pyramids, Emmanuel Macron said.
Among the great changes announced by the French President is the creation of a new “particular space” for “Mona Lisa”, “accessible in an autonomous form”, regardless of the rest of the museum, and “with its own access ticket”. More than 20,000 people visit “Mona Lisa” daily, many with the mobile phone in hand to record the moment, producing images of crowds in front of the celebrated work of the early 16th century, also known as “Gioconda”.
The transfer of “Mona Lisa” to a room where it will be the only piece on display, will allow the work to be visited “with more tranquility”, just like “as it deserves,” said Emmanuel Macron.
The main question lies in the Louvre remodeling plans financing model, at a time when France tries to reduce high levels of public debt and deficit, after Macron lost government reins, which lacks a majority in parliament. According to the circle close to the president, the cost of the project will rise between 700 million and 800 million euros over a period of 10 years and will have a “very minority” contribution of the state.
"All works of the new entry will be funded with the museum's own resources, the sale of tickets, the patronage and the license of Louvre Abu Dhabi, without taxing the taxpayer," said the French President, who wants the Louvre to welcome new educational initiatives. and remain the “epicenter” of art in France and in the world.
"Talking about culture and art is also one of the messages that France wants to give to the world." "It's a political combat," said Macron, "at a time when immediacy and strength speeches have a hypnotic power."
With regard to tickets, Macron argued that tourists from outside the European Union pay more to visit the museum from 2026, a difference that is already applied in part. Currently, the ticket costs 22 euros, but access is free for all children under 18 and under 26 residents in the European economic space.
France has already resorted to private donors and companies to rebuild Notre-Dame Cathedral after a devastating fire in 2019, raising about 850 million euros. The church reopened doors in December last year.
 
Infiltrations, olds and obsolete material
In the letter sent to the Minister of Culture, the president of Louvre warned that several problems are leading the largest museum in the world to decay, from water infiltration to temperature fluctuations that threaten the integrity of the works.
"It is my duty as a president to raise awareness of these issues, and I've done it on several occasions," Laurence Des Cars told reporters, on the sidelines of the inauguration of a new exhibition at the Parisian museum.
The room that houses “Mona Lisa” was not affected by these damages, however, it cannot be said about other parts of the building in the “Sully” ward, AFP said, citing a source of the situation. This large space, distributed at four levels, houses masterpieces of the French painters Jean Siméon Chardin and Antoine Watteau.
In November 2023, an exhibition dedicated to Claude Gillot's drawings had to be closed and transferred after several days due to a flood.
Contacted by AFP, Elisha Palace said President Emmanuel Macron was warned about the situation and "spoke on several occasions with the minister and the direction of the museum."
In his note, Laurence des Cars also warns of the lack of spaces to rest and eat, in addition to the toilets, which are below international standards.
According to Christian Galani, from the CGT union's Department of Culture, "it doesn't spend a day without the degradation of the building." “The painting that is leaving, rooms, deposits and work spaces that are sometimes flooded, power cuts, delays in payments to service providers for lack of budget…” The list is long, according to this unionist.
"There are rooms that are often closed due to lack of personnel, and the working conditions of the agents have worsened, with temperatures sometimes around 10-12 degrees in winter, and exceeding 30 degrees in summer," added Christian Galani, also ensuring that he also More than 200 jobs were cut in 10 years.
Like many public institutions, Louvre has increasingly depended on its own resources, using the growing privatization of its spaces and sponsorships.
On March 4, the Parisian Museum will hold its annual background dinner, hoping to attract international celebrities and stars of the main sewing houses.
