According to Nelson Hoi, the sector faces several obstacles, including the loss of human resources resulting from young guides changing jobs and the gradual retirement of others, and the difficulties experienced in attracting young people who master foreign languages ​​and guaranteeing obtaining the Tourist Guide Card
 
Over the past year, the tourist guide sector in Macau has suffered staff losses, including a relatively young group who changed jobs to sectors such as insurance and retail sales, in order to have more stable income, according to the director of the Macau Tourist Guides Union. At the same time, some elderly guides decided not to renew their Tourist Guide Card.
The retirement situation has a continuous nature, since “more than 50% of guides are over 60 years old”, Nelson Hoi told TRIBUNA DE MACAU newspaper, adding that some young people still insist on this activity mainly because their spouses have stable jobs.
In parallel to the challenging scenario in human resources, there are also other difficulties linked to the entry of “new blood” into the sector. As he explained, on the one hand, it is difficult to attract young guides who speak foreign languages ​​due to the “unstable nature” of the sector, although the volume of international tours has increased in Macau in recent years.
"Furthermore, it is very difficult to obtain the Tourist Guide Card and the requirements will become increasingly higher. Therefore, it will be possible for there to be a gap of young professionals in the sector in a few years' time. We are very concerned, which is why we have discussed the matter with the Government. The sector continues to be able to absorb new Chinese-speaking guides every year, many of them in the 30 to 40 age group. However, we receive almost no young people who have recently graduated", said Nelson Hoi.
Every year, “one or two groups” of Chinese-speaking guides join the sector, making the adaptation process for new professionals “a little difficult”, something that usually takes one or two years.
According to data from the Statistics and Census Services, in August this year, the number of visitors arriving on tours to the Macao SAR dropped by 18.8% to 162 thousand, in annual terms. Specifically, the number of day-trippers coming from Mainland China (142 thousand) fell by 24%, contrasting with the 30.2% increase in international visitors on excursions (14 thousand).
Among the most notable increases in international markets, the association leader highlights excursionists from Europe, India and South Korea. However, this positive trend highlighted the problem of the shortage of foreign-language guides. "There are few guides who speak 'minority' languages, such as Spanish. In this case, we sometimes had to look for translators", he said.
Official data indicate that, at the end of October last year, the Macao SAR had 1,821 Tourist Guide Card holders, including 809 proficient in Cantonese and 1,207 in Mandarin. Only 156 are fluent in English, representing 8.6% of the total, 75 in Japanese (4.2% of the total) and 23 in other unspecified “minority” languages ​​(1.3%).
With regard to Chinese-language guides, Nelson Hoi revealed that their volume of work fell by around 50%, year-on-year, in August and September this year. According to the same person in charge, in the same period last year, each guide who works with the Chinese language was able to attend more than 20 excursions per month, however, currently only receives 12 or 13 per month.
"Even during the summer holidays this year, the number of tours was small in Macau, and the same situation continued in September and October, which reflects the changing tourism situation. The travel agencies that have relatively more business are those that adopt the strategy of low-cost tours with shopping activities on the itinerary, and some that run tours on the Delta Bridge. This type of tour groups is well received among elderly people in the Mainland China. As for tours that only include visiting activities and therefore charge relatively high fees, there are fewer and fewer of them in Macau”, he concluded.</description><pubDate>2025-10-24 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Geometry and Sports parade on the Venetian catwalk</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/desfile-de-geometria-desporto-na-passerelle-venetian/</link><description>The “Greater Bay Fashion Show” took place yesterday at the Venetian, in which two local designers participated.

PEDRO MILHEIRÃO
Yesterday, the “Great Bay Fashion Show” took place, one of the eight presentations of the Macau Fashion Festival, which ends tomorrow. The TRIBUNA DE MACAU newspaper spoke with Jane Chan and Connie Wang, the two representatives of Macau, about the collections they exhibited at the Venetian. At the end of the presentations, Chan said she was left with “good feelings”, “very proud” and with “the desire to do even better”. Wang, in turn, felt “very honored to represent Macau”, in an event that she considered to be “a very good experience”.
Jane Chan, whose “MC Sports” brand specializes in designing sports equipment, explained that, for this year, the clothes were inspired by events such as the Macau Grand Prix, the Drunken Dragon Festival or Chinese chess. “In all the pieces I want to insert stories, to be able to create a connection with my audience”, he stated.
The “C/W Collective” collection, designed by Connie Wang, was based on the concept of “flowers”. "It's about the process of blossoming and fading. It represents our lives because we are born as babies, we grow up and then we grow old. In some pieces in my collection you can see the blossoming, where the flower grows beautifully." "I used a lot of special materials, hard and soft, and shapes to create a contrast, which you can see when the model wears the piece and moves. The fabrics create many different movements," he said. "And then you can see the fringes of the denim pieces that represent aging. It's the circle of life."
With regard to the creative process, both highlighted the importance of Macau's cultural heritage, despite different approaches. Chan highlights the graphic design and ergonomics of the clothes. “Understanding the human body helps us create [pieces] that are comfortable and practical and look good.” The cuts of the clothes themselves must take into account the movements of the body. “We use functional, conductive, lightweight, less sticky and ecological materials”, notes the artist. Additionally, “many of the pieces are digitally printed, which makes them more vibrant.”
"We follow global trends for performance products, to remain innovative. In the visual design, we incorporate cultural elements from Macau and the Greater Bay Area, to give more history to the products", noted the designer. "We are inspired by Sino-Portuguese culture, like Portuguese tiles and local architecture. We always do it. We use them a lot in basketball and football uniforms. But for this event, no. We just focused on sport", noted Chan.
For her part, and due to her experience in “spatial design”, Connie Wang believes that “construction has to be practical and, at the same time, wearable, very geometric and deconstructed”. “I use a lot of architectural concepts in my designs,” he explained. Wang also creates a lot of mockups during the design process: "I need to think a lot during creation. I do a lot of testing because, as you can see, my designs are somewhat complex."
For Connie Wang, what distinguishes local artists from those from other Chinese regions is the fact that “Macau is a small and very special city”. "We use the city a lot as a design concept. You often see designers using architecture, patterns, Portuguese elements, colors and what happens around us. It's very different from the design of other regions", he concluded.
Regarding the growth of the fashion scene in the Greater Bay Area, Jane Chan highlights designers from Hong Kong and Guangdong, who “are very strong”, and advises Macau artists to “take advantage of tourism and the intellectual property economy”. "Find the right positioning, continue to learn and focus on products to remain competitive. Don't think too much about the market", he stressed.
"Young designers must find their starting point. For us, it was creating uniforms and sports uniforms. And we built from there. I also recommend learning how to collaborate and use short video platforms to promote your designs," concluded Chan.
Taking place in parallel with the 30th “Macao International Trade and Investment Fair”, the Macau Productivity and Technology Transfer Center and the Trade and Investment Promotion Institute hope that the festival will “demonstrate Macau’s growing influence in the fashion industry, improve the visibility of its designers and generate new business opportunities for local brands”.</description><pubDate>2025-10-24 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Deputies vote for the composition of the Committees this week</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/deputados-votam-para-semana-composicao-das-comissoes/</link><description>Deputies will vote next Tuesday on simple deliberation projects on the constitution of the various Committees of the Legislative Assembly, and the Board has already made suggestions for deputies to join each of them.

The difference is that, in the territory, club members will not be able to exercise their right to vote, something that deserves criticism from some heard by the TRIBUNA DE MACAU newspaper. Regarding their preferences, the “red” fans are divided between two names, Rui Costa and Noronha Lopes. Few believe that Luís Filipe Vieira can win














































VÍTOR REBELO
 
Some Benfica fans living in Macau confessed their preferences for tomorrow's elections, which will decide the club's next president. Rui Costa, Luís Filipe Vieira, João Noronha Lopes, João Diogo Manteigas, Martim Mayer and Cristóvão Carvalho are the candidates.
Duarte Alves, president of Casa do Benfica in Macau, says that, in these elections, “narrative strategies shadow the search for the vote in three phases: past that promises returns, present that displays work and future that proposes method”. For this Benfica supporter, “in the first round, the present is most likely to measure strength with the future” and if there is a second round, “Rui vs. Noronha become two separate elections”.
In his opinion, “the emotional advantage of the present is diluted in a head-to-head because the coaching effect is of a short cycle and there is a clause that disarms the fear of rupture, while the votes of the smaller candidates tend to add up in the field of change”.
The director admits as a “probable result, in a balanced second round, a slight advantage for the future of Noronha if participation increases”.
In any case, he highlights, “Benfica already has a business model that works and was somewhat forgotten in the noise: training talent in Seixal and capitalizing on it without losing competitiveness”.
“21st century football is not about glory at any price, it is about winning often by spending well, selling better and keeping the house tidy”, he emphasizes, assuming the desire to see “simple and verifiable goals: more minutes for graduates, controlled commissions, sales only with a prepared substitute and a growth plan for Luz with a clear return”, because “this is how our Benfica is protected, all modalities are fed and a future is guaranteed with a head”.
For partner Pedro Cortés, there is, from now on, a “vehement” protest to be made. “Even more than 10,000 kilometers from Luz, I am a Benfica fan who feels every goal and every disappointment as if I were in the stands”, he confesses, noting that it was the Macau fans, “declared second-class citizens”, excluded from the right to vote, “while ballot boxes are allowed in Luanda, Zurich, California and other ports of glory”.
Therefore, he asks himself: “What mystery is this, in which geography decides who loves Benfica the most and who can decide its future?”
Pedro Cortés speaks of a president of the General Assembly Board who claims that the model is traditional. “A sublime word, which in Portugal serves to justify everything that we do not want to change – from triple electricity plugs to physical voting in 2025”, he says, considering that “it is coal democracy, which smells of the past and refuses the electric light of progress”.
The Benfica fan, who frequently travels from Macau to watch the team's games abroad, is not asking for “privileges”, just “decency”, referring to voting locations. “If there are ballot boxes in Africa, there should also be one in Asia and, particularly, in Macau, and, if there is physical voting, at least postal or digital voting should be allowed”. Because “Benfica is universal – it is not measured in kilometers nor limited by regulation”.
Regarding his preferences, “I would vote, without hesitation”, for João Leite from List A, to the General Assembly, since he is “a man of convictions, of his full word, and of a kindness that cannot be measured in selfies with former glories nor in official statements”. As for the Management's lists, it has no favorites. “I just wish, with all conviction, that Vieirismo disappears once and for all, taking with it the cult of power and returning to Benfica what made it eternal: the soul!”
In his analysis, he emphasizes that “there is nothing more modern than restoring ancient dignity”. May elections come “with light, truth and, if possible, a little less theater” and may the vote “one day” also reach Macau.
 
Rui Costa's seriousness could be an asset
Luís Almeida Pinto has been a supporter “since he was a kid”, never having become a member. “I find it difficult to mix Passion with Reason, and discussing the Club's Budgets and Accounts is something I don't want, preferring to help the club in other ways over the years”.
Regarding the elections, he says he listened to interviews with several candidates and read a lot of news. “I debated, trying to understand the importance of the elections for a large part of the members, supporters and supporters, and, at the end of the period of reflection, I came to a conclusion: none of the candidates who intend to win the position have the category and seriousness of the current president, Rui Costa”.
José Miguel Encarnação also gave his opinion on the election. “I often say that Rui Costa would have made a good football player, which he did!, or a good Lisnave worker, being one of those people to whom God gave a good body for heavy work”, he says. He is grateful for “the dedication, sweat and some blood left on the field in the colors of Glorioso”, but. highlights, being president of Benfica “requires more”.
In fact, he points out, “the numbers are not deceiving”. “When you have the wrong captain commanding the ship, the result is three titles in four complete seasons as president – ​​Championship, League Cup and Super Cup – saving the ‘honor of the convent with the ‘sisters’ of Seixal, by winning almost everything there was to win in the women’s category’.
Having said that, “I believe that Noronha Lopes' candidacy is the one that presents the best conditions to put Benfica back at the top, although any candidate will only be successful if they keep José Mourinho as coach and have the intelligence to understand him”.
Manuel Pinto supports Noronha Lopes, because he understands that Benfica needs a serious manager, “with proven experience in the business world, who implements a demanding culture”.
The “red” fan criticizes the fact that Rui Costa assumed that he was “unprepared”, “which leads us to ask how many years he needs in the position to make this Benfica a winning and dominant club at national and international level”.
And he talks about several failed signings and high turnover of coaches, now with Mourinho, “who is looking to relaunch his career at the highest level at Benfica, but little or nothing has changed compared to the previous coach”. “There are reasons that require a change in terms of presidential profile and management at Benfica, which will happen with João Noronha Lopes”, he concludes.
For Ricardo Pontes, “two paths are at stake: continuity or a break with the past, through a new, more transparent dynamic”, and, “unfortunately, the current management does not present structuring and concrete solutions or plans that resolve the club’s problems”. “The project by Noronha Lopes or even João Diogo Manteigas present valid solutions to strengthen the club, instead of the current management which has been quite harmful and irresponsible, namely with the increase in debt, millionaire and dubious sporting contracts without the desired sporting return, putting Benfica's sustainability into question”.
Pedro Vale de Gato points in the opposite direction, continuing to believe in Rui Costa, “who despite not winning the senior football championship, and therefore being contested”, has managed to “reduce the club's liabilities and increase profits, as well as “winning championships” in other sports. “Whether we like it or not, by firing coach Bruno Lage, and bringing in the super-experienced coach José Mourinho “it was like a top hat for the elections”, he expresses.
It also highlights the work of Luís Filipe Vieira when he was at Benfica, having built a stadium and winning three championships. As for Noronha Lopes, “with the public cases of mismanagement in her companies, she did not give Benfica fans a good image and even in some cases distrusted her candidacy”. Therefore, he concludes, supporters “are undecided”.</description><pubDate>2025-10-24 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>China's New Five-Year Plan Emphasizes Scientific Innovation</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/ultimas/novo-plano-quinquenal-da-china-enfatiza-inovacao-cientifica/</link><description>epa11991893 Visitors look at a humanoid robot during the 2025 Zhongguancun Forum (ZGC Forum) at the Zhongguancun International Innovation Center in Beijing, China, 27 March 2025.

The Communist Party of China (CPC) has designated “technological and scientific self-reliance” as one of the focuses of the next five-year plan, amid an uncertain global environment due to the trade war between Beijing and Washington. In a statement released after the end of the 4th Plenary Session of the 20th Central Committee, held behind closed doors in Beijing since Monday, the PCC defines the priorities for the period 2026-2030 and also calls for the “promotion of new productive forces”.
It also highlights the importance of strengthening the “base of the real economy”, “strengthening the domestic market” and “accelerating the creation of a new pattern of development” in China, whose economy has slowed down in recent years. The statement emphasizes that the country must “promote effective qualitative improvement and reasonable quantitative growth” and “achieve decisive progress towards socialist modernization”, a goal that President Xi Jinping has set for 2049, the centenary of the People's Republic of China.
China “maintains a stable economic base, multiple advantages, great resilience and enormous potential”, guarantees the CCP, reaffirming its commitment to “accelerate the construction of a modern industrial system”, to strengthen advanced manufacturing, digitalization and technological integration.
Scientific innovation plays a central role in the new plan, which proposes “strengthening research in key technologies”, “coordinating the development of a strong nation in education, science and technology” and “improving the overall effectiveness of the national innovation system”. Beijing calls for “accelerating agricultural and rural modernization” and urges “optimizing regional distribution and promoting coordinated development between the country’s various regions”.
Furthermore, it advocates the “expanding of high-level opening” and the creation of “new opportunities for cooperation and mutual benefit”, in a context in which the technological restrictions imposed by Washington on sectors such as semiconductors are at the heart of the trade dispute between the two powers. The document does not refer to the tariff war with the USA, but mentions “a complex international scenario”.
It also refers to the need to “improve the macroeconomic management system to guarantee stable, long-term and high-quality development”.
The new plan will be definitively approved in March 2026 by the National Popular Assembly. In addition to international issues, the main difference compared to the 2021-2025 plan is the national situation, marked by the prolonged real estate crisis, low consumption, increased youth unemployment, aging of the population and the threat of deflation.
Since 1953, the five-year plans have served as a guide to the country's economic policy. Although they originally set specific production and growth targets, in recent decades they have evolved into strategic frameworks that reflect the priorities of Chinese leadership.

Deolinda Silva considerou “muitíssimo interessante” o protocolo de cooperação assinado durante a 2ª Exposição Económica e Comercial China–Países de Língua Portuguesa (C-PLPEX), em Macau.
“O nosso objectivo é começarmos a trabalhar realmente na constituição de – eu não digo uma loja – uma forte presença portuguesa nesta plataforma”, explicou. “Não é fácil, mas eles estão ali prontos para nos ajudar, e nós também já vamos cada vez mais adquirindo mais conhecimento sobre o desafio que nos espera”, admitiu.
The cooperation began yesterday, with a presentation of products from “PortugalFoods” members alongside Chinese companies “from the most varied categories”, he revealed. The association brought products from 12 companies to C-PLPEX, but has more than 200 members including companies, entities in the scientific system and the agri-food sector and other related activities.
The presentation is part of a “Tmall” strategy to promote Portuguese agri-food products “in an aggregated way, to gain some dimension”, said Deolinda Silva. “The work that needs to be done with these Chinese partners is immense, because there is practically no presence of Portuguese products”, he lamented.
The first contact with “Tmall” took place during the 2024 edition of the “FHC Shanghai Global Food Trade Show”. “PortugalFoods” will participate in this fair again, between the 12th and 14th of November, to “better understand the potential that exists to create partnerships” to find future buyers, said the executive director.
China “is a market with brutal potential, but it must be worked on in phases and by regions”, said Silva, pointing out southern China as a priority.
According to “PortugalFoods”, Portuguese agri-food exports reached 10 billion euros in 2024, an annual growth of 8.5%. The association anticipates new growth in 2025, albeit more modest.
 
Fafe's company wants to export puddings to China
In turn, a company in Fafe is investing in robots to be able to produce, per year, one million puddings inspired by the abade de priscos pudding and begin exporting to China. The creator of Pudim da TV, Paulo Fernandes, announced that, by the end of the year, the company's factory in the district of Braga will have four robots operating, thus reaching the capacity to produce one million puddings per year.
The manufacturing unit, created two and a half years ago, already supplies desserts to more than 400 restaurants in Portugal and exports to nine countries in Europe and South America, said Fernandes on the second day of C-PLPEX, which is taking place simultaneously with the 30th Macau International Fair.
Fernandes brought Pudding from TV to the territory “above all to try to understand what the Chinese palate is like here, if the pudding is well accepted or if we have to make some adjustments to the flavor”.
The company, whose turnover reaches “a few hundred thousand euros”, also intends to “find partners” to distribute the pudding and repeat “the exponential growth” of pastel de nata abroad.
Paulo Fernandes said he is analyzing the possibility of joining a Macau Government program, which will come into force in November, to help foreign companies to internationalize from the Macao SAR. The chef revealed that he had meetings scheduled with potential partners. Depending on interest, Macau could be the TV Pudding “gateway” to markets such as Hong Kong and mainland China.

In this sense, they make some suggestions, such as a coordination mechanism and more flexible measures with regard to services linked to Health and Education
 
The Federation of Public Service Workers' Associations of Macau believes that the recently announced administration reform “precisely addresses current practical challenges”, agreeing with the changes proposed by the Government. However, it is concerned about the obstacles that may arise during the change process, under the General Regime for the organization and organic structure of public services and entities, which restricts the creation of new services, as well as defining, for example, maximum limits for the number of management positions and internal subunits of services, taking into account the size of the staff and the functions of the entities.
The association's president, Pang Kung Hou, and director, Tong Wai Kit, foresee three scenarios. “First, challenges in functional integration may arise during departmental mergers or functional transfers, potentially leading to disruptions in workflow and less fluid interdepartmental coordination,” they noted, further warning that “this could temporarily increase the workload of entry-level civil servants.”
On the other hand, they argue that personnel control and the creation of career progression mechanisms “require public servants to quickly transform their philosophies and work methods”. In this field, they specifically refer to senior employees, who “may face pressure to update their skills”.
Pang Kung Hou and Tong Wai Kit also believe that “balance” difficulties may arise in implementing standards, since the characteristics of departments in different areas “vary considerably”. Therefore, they consider that “the uniform definition of standards, without sufficient flexibility for adjustments, can lead to a ‘one size fits all’ approach, potentially compromising the quality of specialized services”.
In this sense, and to “maintain the stability of public servants”, they presented four suggestions. From the outset, establish a coordination mechanism for the reform transition period, led by the Administration and Public Service Services (SAFP), to “create an interdepartmental connection platform”. As they say, “this would allow us to quickly resolve interface issues arising from functional integration and adequately alleviate the additional workload on entry-level staff.”
“These measures would alleviate the anxiety of public servants during the reform process, facilitating their rapid adaptation to the new work environment”, they reiterated.
On the other hand, Pang Kung Hou and Tong Wai Kit proposed developing a training system by levels and categories, for example, designing specialized courses adapted to different job requirements, “with a focus on strengthening civil servants' capabilities in digital office operations and cross-domain collaboration, to help them quickly adapt to the new reform demands”.
Furthermore, they suggested flexible implementation mechanisms. The idea would be to allow specialized services, such as Education and Health, to maintain the “structural flexibility necessary to guarantee the continuity and professionalism of services”.
Finally, they argued that feedback channels should be improved, “through the establishment of a routine mechanism to collect the opinions of public servants”.
The association argues that the core of public administration reform lies in strengthening both human dynamism and institutional structures. In a statement, they highlighted their belief that, through the “scientific” coordination of the Government and the “efforts” of all public servants, the reform will help to “overcome the obstacles that impede administrative efficiency”. Specifically, “it will allow public servants to better fulfill their objective of serving the people in a standardized and highly efficient institutional environment”.

According to the Qualified Staff Development Committee (CDQQ), one of the organizers of the event, at the opening ceremony, the Secretary for Social Affairs and Culture, O Lam, stated that she “firmly believes” that, by leveraging the strengths of Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau, qualified staff development initiatives in the Greater Bay Area “will undoubtedly reach new heights”.
Lam also said that the Macao SAR Government will take advantage of the special advantages of the Deep Cooperation Zone to “promote, in phases, the construction of the Macau and Hengqin International Education (University) City and the State's regional university-industrial technology transfer center, in addition to fully taking advantage of the advantages of the four national reference laboratories existing in Macau, among other advantages”. The objective is to “create an important platform for the training and gathering of qualified local professionals”.
At the same time, Macau will develop its role as a two-way platform, having as a link the Service Platform for Commercial Cooperation between China and Portuguese-speaking Countries, to “attract resources from abroad” and “promote expansion abroad”, emphasized the Secretary.
In his speech, the director of the Human Resources Mobility Management Department of the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security of China, Zhang Wenmiao, assured that the Ministry “will continue, as always, to firmly support the development of the Greater Bay Area, in order to offer better services and a more convenient environment for the development of qualified personnel”.

On the occasion of “Pink October”, breast cancer awareness month, the Health Services (SSM) highlighted that “the prevention and treatment of breast cancer continues to be one of the important works of public health in the Macao SAR”.
In a statement issued yesterday, the organization recalled that, according to the most up-to-date official data, in 2023, breast cancer continued to be the most common cancer among women in Macau, with a total of 291 new cases registered, reflecting a crude incidence rate of 80.4 per 100 thousand women, and 55 deaths from this cancerous disease, a mortality rate of 15.2 per 100 thousand female people.
In this sense, the SSM guaranteed that, to face the challenges arising from breast cancer, the Resource Center for Cancer Patients “continuously provides comprehensive support to patients and their families”, since it was created in 2011. According to them, the center provided services to more than 6,900 people in 2024 alone.
Specifically, “nursing care counseling outpatient services” served more than 1,900 people, providing guidance on home care after radiotherapy or chemotherapy and emotional counseling services. “Counseling services in nursing care during rehabilitation” served more than 2,600 patients last year.
On the other hand, the organization highlighted that the center has launched several courses, such as physical exercise for recovery after breast surgery, beneficial health gymnastics for the elderly and healing yoga. In addition, he pointed out that, in parallel, the center regularly promotes lectures on health, nursing, as well as various leisure activities, “in order to help patients and their families to face the process of combating cancer in a positive way and overcome difficulties”.
Taking advantage of “Pink October”, Centro Hospitalar Conde de São Januário recently held a thematic lecture around the treatment of breast cancer, with the aim of reinforcing the knowledge of patients and other residents about the prevention and treatment of the disease, and encouraging more women of appropriate age to undergo regular screening, thus achieving the objective of “early detection, diagnosis and treatment”. The lecture was attended by around 30 patients and family members of patients, according to the SSM.
In the statement, the organization led by Alvis Lo renewed calls for residents aged 18 and over to participate in breast cancer screening, by making an appointment on the “Cancer screening scheduling platform” in “My Health” of the “Conta Única”, as well as to take correct measures to maintain breast health.</description><pubDate>2025-10-24 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Sands profit in the 3rd quarter rose to 2.2 billion</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/lucro-da-sands-3o-trimestre-subiu-para-22-mil-milhoes/</link><description>Sands China ended the third quarter with net profits equivalent to 2.2 billion patacas, a figure that represents a quarterly growth of 27% and an annual increase of 1.5%. Driven by Londoner results, operating earnings exceeded expectations

Sands China's net profits amounted to 272 million US dollars (around 2.2 billion patacas at current exchange rates) in the third quarter of this year, reflecting an increase of 1.5% compared to the same period in 2024, the Las Vegas Sands (LVS) group announced yesterday. According to the same data, which comply with US accounting standards, profits also showed a growth of 27% in relation to the previous three months.
In the quarterly financial year ended on September 30, the gaming operator's net revenue in Macau amounted to 1.90 billion US dollars (15.2 billion patacas), illustrating an annual increase of 7.5% and an increase of close to 6% in the space of three months.
Earnings before interest, taxes, amortization and depreciation (EBITDA) rose 2.7% to 601 million US dollars (4.8 billion patacas), year-on-year. When compared to the second quarter of this year, operating earnings grew 6.2%.
In an analysis of Sands China's results, the Jefferies banking group highlighted that EBITDA exceeded its own estimates and market projections by 7%, “with a better margin than expected” at Londoner Macau. EBITDA in the third quarter “would have been US$620 million if the typhoon had not occurred”, estimated analysts Anne Ling and Jingjue Pei in a report cited by the GGRAsia portal.
It is recalled that Macau casinos suspended operations for 33 hours at the end of September, due to the passage of super typhoon “Ragasa”.
Jefferies analysts also highlighted that Sands China's share of the gaming market reached around 23.5% between July and September, “after hitting rock bottom in the first quarter of 2025”. The company “is in the midst of its marketing program overhaul, which began in the second quarter of 2025,” they added.
According to data released by LVS, revenue from casinos operated by the group in the Macao SAR totaled US$1.43 billion (11.4 billion patacas) in the third quarter, representing an annual growth of 4.4% and a quarterly increase of around 6%. Even so, the Londoner casino was the only one to register an annual increase in gross revenue, specifically from 55.3% to 525 million dollars (4.2 billion patacas).
During the usual conference call with analysts, Rob Goldstein, president and CEO of LVS, linked the progress in gaming revenues to the focus on innovation, arguing that side bets on live table baccarat in Singapore and Macau helped transform “a boring game” into an experience closer to sports betting. "What changed in baccarat was not the smart table, but rather the point scorer. What changed was the game itself", he stressed, convinced that the new system "offers many more opportunities to bet in different ways".
“We give credit to our gaming innovation team for their willingness to really analyze the customer experience and add the opportunity to improve it through higher volatility bets, which customers are actually using”, reinforced Patrick Dumont, president and director of operations at LVS, who is expected to assume leadership of the group in March 2026.
Goldstein asserted that LVS executives are “excited” about the “growth opportunities in Macau and Singapore”, given the benefits of recently completed investment programs. “In Macau, our decades-long commitment to making investments that increase the appeal of business and leisure tourism in Macau and support its development as a global center for business and leisure tourism positions us well for future growth”, he highlighted, also highlighting that Marina Bay Sands, in Singapore, continues to demonstrate “exceptional financial and operational performance”.
At Marina Bay Sands, net revenue (1.44 billion US dollars) and EBITDA (743 million) grew 56.3% and 83% year-on-year, respectively.
In global terms, LVS closed the quarter with net profits of 491 million dollars, 39.1% more than in the same period of 2024. In the space of a year, net revenues (3.33 billion dollars) rose 24.2% and EBITDA (1.34 billion) increased 35.6%.</description><pubDate>2025-10-24 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Portuguese author presents three collections of illustrated books</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/autora-portuguesa-apresenta-tres-coleccoes-de-livros-ilustrados/</link><description>The “Exhibition of Illustrated Books in Chinese and Portuguese” begins this Friday, as part of the 7th “Meeting in Macau – Festival of Arts and Culture between China and Portuguese-speaking Countries”.

The “Forbidden City Architecture Conservation Exhibition” will close for four days and open again on October 28th, with new pieces. The Cultural Institute explains that the idea is to “continuously enrich the content of the exhibition”
 
The Cultural Heritage Preservation and Transmission Center of the Macau Palace Museum will close to the public between now and October 27 to renew the pieces of the “Forbidden City Architectural Conservation Exhibition”, indicated the Cultural Institute (IC). The exhibition, which is the first to open at the Center, displays precious cultural relics, such as wooden crafts, glass objects and colorful paintings in the Forbidden City, on loan from the Palace Museum.
The aim of the exhibition is “to showcase the aesthetics of artisanal techniques and the principles of preserving traditional Chinese architecture”. Since the space opened, the exhibition has attracted more than 30,000 visitors, according to the organization.
“To continually enrich the content of the exhibition, the Center will renew the pieces on display this year, incorporating more components from representative buildings, in order to allow visitors to have a more comprehensive understanding of the cultural significance and restoration practices of the Forbidden City's architecture,” explained the IC. Therefore, the renewed exhibition will open to the public on October 28th, remaining on display until November 8th, 2026.
The Cultural Heritage Preservation and Transmission Center of the Macau Palace Museum is the first cultural space created through a long-term collaboration between the Macao SAR Government and the Palace Museum. Officially opened in November 2024, it consists of an area for the restoration of cultural relics and exhibition spaces.
The restoration area houses specialized restoration laboratories, responsible for the preservation and restoration of Macau's World Heritage sites, classified real estate and components of cultural heritage buildings.
In the exhibition spaces, exhibitions and promotional activities are regularly held to publicize “the excellence of traditional Chinese culture” to the public. The Center is located at the Art Museum, at NAPE, and is open daily from 10am to 7pm, including holidays, and is closed on Mondays.</description><pubDate>2025-10-24 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>“Ghost banquet” at Albergue SCM</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/banquete-de-fantasmas-albergue-scm/</link><description>The Macau Culture Friends Circle will organize the 11th Halloween at Albergue SCM this weekend, under the theme “Phantom Feast”.

But it wasn't their own soldiers they were looking for. It was the Chinese contingent.
The scene reflects a shift in attitude toward China – amid trade tensions with the US – that has allowed Vietnamese leaders to launch sensitive projects such as high-speed rail links and special economic zones near China that could significantly boost bilateral ties.
Just a few years ago, with many Vietnamese wary of a powerful neighbor with which they had fought several wars, these projects were seen as too controversial and caused violent protests. But opinions are softening, as shown by social media posts, online surveys and data on language learning.
Nearly 75% of Vietnamese respondents prefer the US to China as a partner, but the share favoring China is increasing faster than anywhere else in Southeast Asia, bucking the regional trend, according to a survey conducted in early 2025 by the Singapore-based ISEAS – Yusof Ishak Institute.
Social media appears to be playing a crucial role in changing the mood in Vietnam – and in particular, TikTok, which is popular among young people and, in 2024, had 67 million users in Vietnam, the highest number after Facebook, according to the government. When users of the platform owned by Chinese technology giant ByteDance search for the Vietnamese word for China they get extremely positive results, some from 2023.
Among the popular videos suggested by TikTok are clips of Chinese soldiers performing synchronized dances and videos showing Chinese cities, with many viewers expressing admiration for China's rapid development.
TikTok users searching for the Vietnamese name of the South China Sea, a focus of frequent conflict between the two countries, often find clips about tropical storms or tensions between China and the Philippines, which also have claims to parts of the sea, according to tests carried out without user profiles to avoid algorithmic bias.
In September, crowds gathered in Hanoi to celebrate the 80th anniversary of Vietnam's declaration of independence from colonial rule. Tens of thousands crowded the streets, many to watch the Chinese parade. Troops march alongside Vietnamese soldiers - an unprecedented sight in the capital of a country that was last invaded by China in the late 1970s and where major streets are named after anti-Chinese heroes.
"It was worth the wait. Very cool. I admire their discipline," said Le Huyen My, a 22-year-old who traveled from Ho Chi Minh City in the south and camped overnight to secure a spot to watch the Chinese parade.
A video about the parade reached 3.3 million views on TikTok and attracted around 1,400 comments, many praising the “impeccable” march of Chinese soldiers. Similar videos on other platforms also generated positive reactions, although Facebook users were more skeptical about China and the US.
Young Vietnamese online “appear less strident toward China than before, but this is due more to the state's increasingly tighter grip on nationalism than to declining resentment,” said Nguyen Khac Giang of ISEAS.
Online campaigns against China are still rife in Vietnam and often target companies using maps of the South China Sea aligned with Beijing, but they tend to be short-lived.
This marks a change from 2018, when widespread anti-China protests forced the Vietnamese government to shelve a plan for Special Economic Zones seen as favorable to Chinese companies. Now, Vietnamese state media frequently report new plans for economic zones on the border with China, without generating protests.
“Economic interests are taking precedence over nationalism,” said Nguyen Hung, an academic at RMIT University in Vietnam, noting that Hanoi has promoted a pragmatic approach towards Beijing, especially as trade tensions with Washington escalate.
Vietnamese data shows that Chinese companies are now among Vietnam's top investors; leaders meet frequently; and interest in Chinese culture is growing. Chinese President Xi Jinping has traveled to Vietnam twice in the past two years, and Vietnamese leader To Lam visited Beijing on his first trip abroad, shortly after being named head of the Communist Party in 2024.
Online searches for China in Vietnam have increased, with a focus on Chinese films and the language, according to Google Trends. In the first quarter of 2025, Vietnam led global registrations for the HSK Chinese Proficiency Test, China's official exam for non-native speakers, according to Chinese state media.
But as China often lives in centuries of ambivalent ties, Vietnamese pride runs deep. “Chinese troops look fascinating, but our soldiers are still the best,” said student Nguyen Hue Van, 21, who attended the parade in Hanoi.
