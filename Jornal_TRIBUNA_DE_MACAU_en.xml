In an interview with the Jornal Tribuna de Macao, the list, whose members have an average age of 33 years, also reinforces the goal of “defending social justice and impartiality, breaking the inherent dilemma that is contrary to public interests”. The team wants to be able to “keep the current seats” in the hemiciclo
 
-What reasons led the Macao Citizens Association list to apply for the Legislative Assembly? - Raising further the level of masters' governance level is one of the four expectations of President Xi Jinping to Macao, at the same time being a content mentioned by the Chief Executive, Sam Hou Fai, in his political program for the candidacy for the executive head and on this year's governing lines of action.
We consider that, in addition to following the philosophy of governance dedicated to “working with an entrepreneurial spirit and moving together, persisting on the right track and betting on innovation”, it is necessary for the government of Mashes to continue to be pragmatic and effective, effectively boosting the reform of public administration, in order to implement and realize the expectation of President XI Jinping to raise the effectiveness of governance. In addition, the government has to firmly promote the various beneficial measures for the population and improve citizens' well-being, in order to respond to long-time resident expectations.
In 2025, the provision of services to society by the Association of United Citizens of Macao (ACUM) turned 20. Team members always insist on the concept of candidacy “the heart of the people is my heart”, in order to show the team's initial intention to participate in social services. In addition to continuously auscultation of the people of the people, namely we collect the opinions and suggestions of the public through different channels and methods, in order to hear the real demands linked to the well-being of the population, we also hope to continue to propel, through the AL, the Government of the Mishem to establish an effective communication mechanism. Thus, we hope to use more pragmatic and more effective ways to respond to the most urgent demands of the population, so that policies meet more public needs. We also sought to defend social justice and impartiality, breaking the inherent dilemma that is contrary to the interests of the public, by exhorting, with all the commitment, the government to create channels of just and transparent participation.
 
- How is this candidacy from the rest?
- ACUM's candidacy team is part of a total of 10 people, whose average age is only 33 years, being an active, vigorous team, with dreams and willing to assume responsibilities. Our members include professionals from the Education, Medicine, Tourism and Convention and Exhibitions, Information Technology, Social Services, Finance, as well as students. The candidates' academic degrees range from degree to doctorate. We gathered widely from various sectors, young patriots who also love Macau, pay attention and participate in society.
In addition, our team is rooted in the basic class of society and deeply integrated among the public. In addition to applying their professional knowledge to social services, the team actively participates in the days of care of citizens of different areas of the city, having in person contacted and profoundly perceived the difficulties that the public currently lives. At the same time, our team persists in the initial intention of “thinking about what citizens think and worrying about citizens' concerns”! Both the different types of difficulties that the public encountered in their daily lives and opinions and demands on community construction and various policies and measures always deserve our auscultation carefully. We put ourselves in the place of other people and think of their perspective, hoping to solve each of the subjects, large or small, to which the public pays attention. We dare to speak, act and take responsibility, and fulfill the promise of serving the audience with all our hearts.
 
- What are the priority problems and what solutions do they propose to solve them?
- With strong support from the central government and the interior of China, our homeland, the economy in general of Macau society has continuously recovered. However, the impact of the pandemic on the social and economic development of Macao has not yet been fully attenuated, and the operational situation and wage level of the workers of many sectors have not yet been able to return to the pre-pandemic level. Especially, the development of small and medium -sized companies and the employment situation of residents remain unstable. The situation requires urgent attention.
Acum insists on doing practical things for the public, being committed to boosting the Government of the Mand to realize the various beneficial measures for the population, especially because, currently, the economic recession, the evident employment problem and the existence of other problems related to the guarantee of the well-being of the population have made a profound impact on social development. In this context, it requires even more attention to the elderly and vulnerable groups, and to exhort the government to do a good job to ensure basic security for the well-being of the population, safeguarding justice, rationality and impartiality of society.
Therefore, we present eight key proposals:
First: Resume the Macao Investment and Development Fund, assigning 10% of fund revenues to bonnet to all residents;
Second: Ensure that 85% of workers of integrated tourism and leisure companies are resident and launch a job allowance in the amount of 5,000 patacas;
Third, continue to launch the consumption subsidy plan, fully revitalizing the community economy;
Fourth: Create a health insurance plan for the entire population and shorten the waiting time to relieve the difficult scenario;
Fifth: Review the mechanism of increasing pension to the elderly and trying to increase the subsidy for the elderly to 15,000 patacas;
Sixth: prolong the childhood assistance subsidy for the age of six, establishing a progressive allowance to encourage birth;
Seventh: Review laws to respond to housing needs, helping to improve the quality of life of residents;
Eighth: Raise the effectiveness of public services governance and increase the guarantee for retirement of basic level workers.
 
- What are the expectations in terms of election? How many seats do you expect to win at the Legislative Assembly?
-We will always insist on our initial intention, think about what the people think, convey what the people say and worry about what the people care most. In this edition of the Legislative Assembly, our team has three deputies elected for direct suffrage, who work as representatives of public opinion. The three deputies have firmly fulfilled the responsibilities and reflected to the government social situations and public opinion among all classes of society, in a true and objective way, which allowed the government of Mand to hear and fully absorb society's opinions in relation to various policies. The deputies actively played the role as “People's Bridge”, having fulfilled the promise of daring to speak, act and take responsibility, for the public, the population and Macau, left in the candidacy for the elections.
Therefore, we want to be able to do our best in the future, keep current seats and continue to work together with the public, building together a good quality life community!

To study and work for bamboo for over 20 years, Nuno Soares has seen future for permanent buildings with this material in Macao, where he has tradition and associated economic value, but lack regulation.
For Nuno Soares, the versatility of bamboo is not exhausted in temporary construction. Neither in the usual scaffolding that cope skyscrapers in progression, nor on Pads of Cantonense opera erected at festivities, or giant sculptures, thought by students or artists, or even moments that would be unlikely-and that did not dispense with contestation-such as the end of the Portuguese administration, when a bamboo square was improvised in the center of Macao.
Portuguese architect and academic distinguish “a potential that is not yet fully explored”: the use of this material, rooted in the city's tradition and economic fabric, to give life to bamboo structures with no demolition date. There is regulation only for temporary projects.
“We cannot be fundamentalists and defend only what we know and are used to,” the architect says in an interview with Lusa. There is a disciplinary obligation of the field of architecture and the construction of creating better products “from the point of view of sustainability, resistance and aesthetics”, he argues.
Soares, a native of Lisbon but living in Macau since 2003, crossed for the first time with the potential of this “beautiful material” in construction when he visited Macau in 1997. And what is such a routine element for those who live the region's daily life was for Portuguese, with a vision used to another urban landscape, the beginning of a trip.
At the Center for Architecture and Urbanism (Curb), which founded with designer Filipa Simões in 2014, has conducted investigation in this field, with work done with bamboo artisans.
Also at the University of São José (USJ), where he is at the head of the Department of Architecture and Design, Portuguese guides annually, in collaboration with industry, the construction of a bamboo pavilion - with material used in the assembly of scaffolding and that, in the end, will serve that same purpose again.
“An architecture that is very innovative, very challenging, which uses parametric design of the most sophisticated worldwide and then builds with a handcrafted technique,” ​​says the project, noting that only specialized companies and technicians are allowed to build bamboo for public safety reasons.
In the field of permanent construction, USJ is developing in partnership with Thailand's Assumption University, a project that foresees the building of a structure, “and then monitoring over the life period” and performance of the building and being able to draw conclusions.
Despite being a degraded material, there are techniques to deal with permanent bamboo construction that differ from the options for limited time works. “We should not prevent evolution,” he argues.
In addition to Thailand, where there is a code that allows the building of bamboo permanent buildings, without the term architecture is common in several other geographies of the region, such as Indonesia, being the Green School, in Bali, a private school, a prominent work.
"Bamboo, as a permanent construction, enters a classification of materials that are those that are the light structures, such as some metal structures. It is important that we use the materials that are suitable. In Macau we have so much experience and tradition of using bamboo, which it is already part of the urban landscape," he reflects.
It is necessary to realize where these bamboo structures can be useful: "namely in buildings in buildings that exist, terraces buildings, because they are structures that are light naturally, which carry little weight to the existing structure."
“Bamboo has legs to walk and things to do in the future, and we have already seen that there is a cutting-edge industry that is also working with bamboo, doing bamboo clusters,” he says, referring to the creation of compound products produced from this material.

In some cases, the minors themselves are the authors, with elementary and secondary students to use Deepfake technology through general AI sites and other tools.
The National Police Agency (NPA) plans to investigate the main image that generates images to discover any irregularity and elaborate prevention measures.
A elementary school student in eastern Japan will have generated a false image of nudity from a basic education girl who attended the same sports class and published the image in a group of chat on social networks. "I used the Generative AI to edit a photograph of the face of a girl I like," he said, according to police.
Many websites and applications allow users to generate images by giving instructions to AI, with some allowing users to generate false sexual images based on children's photos.
The boy will have used images shared by the class to his colleagues.
According to NPA, police received more than 100 consultations and complaints about false sexual sexual images in 2024. Most involved allegations such as "nudity images made with my face are on social networks."
Most victims are elementary and secondary students.
In most cases, known people are suspected of generating the images. Seventeen cases were identified as involving images made by AI with photos of school events and finalist albums.
The harassment directed to same -sex colleagues was a reason in some cases.
There have also been serious enough cases to trigger criminal investigations. In the Tokai region in downtown Japan, a elementary student was sent to the prosecutor on suspicion of defamation for generating a false image of nudity using the photo of a classmate and share it with friends.
The possession and production of sexual images of children are regulated by the prevention law of child prostitution and child pornography. However, the law presupposes that cases involve a real image of a child, which makes it difficult to accuse deepfakes.
Therefore, police across the country are applying other laws and regulations to these cases. A survey by a US security company found that 95,820 deepfake videos were identified online by 2023, 98% pornographic.
"The cases that the police are aware of are just the tip of the iceberg," said a high police official. Given this situation, the NPA is focusing on about 10 websites and applications of images generating images that are especially popular among elementary and secondary students, among the many found online.
Police will investigate and the results will be used not only for criminal investigations, but also for awareness -raising campaigns through delinquency prevention classes and similar programs.
"If sophisticated false images spread online, it violates the privacy of children whose photos are misused, even if they are false," said Masaki Ueda, an associate professor of criminal law at Kanagawa University, familiar with regulations on obscenity.
"The psychological impact is significant, so the deepfake images should be treated similarly to child pornography and should be considered legal regulations," said Ueda.
Countries increasingly regulate sexually explicit deepfakes.
In South Korea, a bill was approved in September 2024 to punish not only the creation of Deepfake images, but also the act of visualizing or possessing them.
In the United States, a federal law was promulgated in May that prohibited the publication of sexually explicit images or videos online without the consent of the subject in question. The law made it mandatory that social networking platforms and other operators remove these images and videos within 48 hours of receiving a request from the victims.
The United Kingdom and Australia also regulate the sharing of sexually explicit depfake images.
In Japan, the government of Tottori province reviewed in August a decree to ban - with penalties - the creation of sexually explicit false images using photos of children.
Appeals to action, including legislation, within the central government's working group that discusses the use of the internet by young people. However, the discussions did not advance much.
Childfund Japan, an international non -governmental organization based in Tokyo, interviewed 1,200 men and women across the country from January to February. About 70% of respondents believe that sexual images of children, including false images, should be regulated by law, regardless of whether subjects in the images actually exist.
