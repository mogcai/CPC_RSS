The number of support requests related to suicide registered an annual increase of 30% to 178. Paul Pun said that Caritas intends to optimize the online counseling segment of the line this year, so that this service is more professional

Last year, the “Life Hope line” of Caritas de Macao, which is intended to support people with emotional or psychological problems or even vulnerable to suicide, has registered more than 15,000 requests for help. This number reflects a significant increase of 50% compared to 2023, the year the line received "a little over 10,000" calls to request support, said the secretary general of Caritas.
Speaking to the newspaper TRIBUNA DE MACAU, Paul Pun also said that, in 2024, there was an annual increase of almost 30% in the number of requests for help to the “Linha Esperança de Vida” related to suicide, which totaled 178. According to the person responsible for institution, among these cases, those involving young people or adolescents registered a higher percentage increase than other age groups, being more than 30%.
According to Paul Pun, both in 2023 and last year, users of the line sought help mainly due to psychological, emotional or study-related problems.
For the secretary general of Caritas, the significant climb of requests for help will also be associated with the reinforcement of the line of the line and the institution itself. In this aspect, he mentioned that Caritas has been able to make free dissemination actions on this emotional support channel at an establishment in the McDonald's chain in the tape.
“It is not known whether it was the pandemic that led more people in Macau to ask for help in terms of mental health. But, in fact, we started to see relatively many situations with young people or teenagers wanting to end their lives. It is necessary for all parties to attach attention and importance to this issue”, highlighted Paul Pun.
On the other hand, it revealed that last year, Caritas received “very few” requests for help in the line segment in foreign language (English). “They (citizens of foreign nationality) rarely called us. Usually, they prefer to move to our social equipment, the Welanser Center, to receive support, ”he said.
Although the “Life Hope Line” has suffered a notorious addition of calls, the secretary general of Caritas understands that the number of users in the last year was not high for a service that, on the other hand, continues to have a number Reduced from personnel. Still, Paul Pun stressed that this year the line will remain open for 24 hours, and that to answer the calls, "there must be, at least one worker who knows how to speak English every day." In fact, he said, the service has already had foreign nationality volunteers.
Paul Pun expressed the desire to widen the service, namely in terms of foreign languages, but admitted that it would be necessary to gather many resources. "In the long run, to expand the coverage of the service, it would make sense that the line would also provide services in the languages ​​Nepalesa, Filipina and Indonesia," he said.
However, there are still no conditions for Caritas to expand this segment of the line, as the institution has to channel resources to other services. In this sense, this year, the institution intends, above all, to maintain the current conditions of the “Linha Esperança de Vida” and optimize the online counseling segment, to increase the professionalism of this service.
“On the computer, staff cannot immediately analyze whether help seekers are in crisis. For example, if you see a person saying on social media that they want to die, the team cannot immediately send people to intervene. It is necessary to observe and analyze, so we will reinforce training”, stated Paul Pun.
With regard to mental health, the secretary general of Caritas believes that “there is scope” for the local population, especially young people and adolescents, to improve their ability to withstand stress. “All residents should give greater importance to mental health, rest, sleep and do more physical exercise. It cannot be considered that this is just a responsibility of the Government or society, as the population itself must do something. In turn, it is obvious that, if the Government increases the resources channeled towards mental health, this will also be beneficial for people's general health”, concluded Paul Pun.
The authorities have been appealing to citizens to, if necessary, call the “Caritas Hope for Life” line (2852 5222), which also has a foreign language segment (2852 5777).</description><pubDate>2025-01-27 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Secretary promises to respond to “three major” concerns</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/secretaria-promete-responder-tres-grandes-preocupacoes/</link><description>Low birth rate, population aging and mental and physical health were the three main areas on which the associations focused during meetings with the Secretary for Social Affairs and Culture.

The leaders and managers toured the areas of the Temple of A-Má, the route of the parade of floats and the Lunar New Year Fair at Praça do Tap Seac, in order to find out about the situation on the ground, the crowd control plan , road traffic management measures, mobilization of police personnel, emergency evacuation plan, among other work.
“The aim of these inspections is to instruct the competent services and entities to be prepared and define plans and strategies well with a view to increasing the capacity to respond to emergencies in the face of possible sudden incidents, guaranteeing the carrying out of commemorative activities in an orderly and safe manner. ”, emphasize the SPU.
The inspection work, in addition to having the participation of directors and managers from the security area, also included the participation of the Directorate of Tourism Services, the Cultural Institute, the Institute for Municipal Affairs and the Directorate of Services for Public Affairs. of Traffic.
In a statement, the SPU stated that during this festive week, “the security forces and services will remain firm in their posts, timely adjusting police strategies and specific combat operations in accordance with the local security situation, in order to to safeguard social order and the safety of the population”.</description><pubDate>2025-01-27 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>STD reinforced promotion in Madrid</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/dst-reforcou-promocao-em-madrid/</link><description>With its eyes set on European markets, the Macau Tourism Office expanded its presence at FITUR, an important tourism event that took place in recent days in Madrid
 
This year, the Directorate of Tourism Services (DST) reinforced Macau's promotional activities at FITUR, one of the largest international tourism fairs, which took place between the 22nd and 26th of January in Madrid. During the event, it carried out several initiatives aimed at European operators and consumers, as part of efforts to attract international visitors to the Macao SAR.
After returning to Fitur last year with a promotion event organized in partnership with the Portuguese Association of Travel and Tourism Agencies (APAVT), STD cooperated again with APAVT, this time expanding the presence with a stand under the theme “ Feeling Macao ”. Throughout the five days of the fair, the stand presented the offers of Macao “Tourism +”, including a tour through virtual reality around the city, and served as a platform for contacts with tour operators.
The stand also welcomed “Macao's tourist product to 50 travel agents, which is part of the activities of a joint marketing campaign with HBX Group directed to tour operators from various European countries. In the Spanish capital, STD also supported a "afterparty" organized by the HBX Group for its strategic partners, which gathered 850 guests. According to the body, the joint campaign for Europe in 2025 will spread Macao promotion content in six countries (Portugal, Spain, France, Italy, Germany and the United Kingdom) through "Hotelbeds" and "Bedsonline", reserve online platforms of services and products for tourist operators of HBX Group.
The start of promotional activities at FITUR included a “Macau Tourism Exchange” at the DST stand, with the presence of officials from Turismo de Portugal, APAVT, European Confederation of Travel Agencies and Tour Operators Associations (ECTAA), Spanish Confederation of Travel Agencies and travel agencies, among others, with a total of more than 40 participants. Speaking at the event, Maria Helena de Senna Fernandes, director of DST, highlighted the relevance of joining efforts with key partners such as APAVT and its counterparts at ECTAA, in addition to large online tourism platforms, in order to “showcase the new dynamics of the development of Macau as a world tourism and leisure center” and increase tourist flows from Europe.
On the same occasion, Lídia Monteiro, member of the Board of Directors of Tourism of Portugal, thanked APAVT for helping to “bring Portugal closer to Macau”, and confirmed the intention of organizing a “roadshow” that will end at the APAVT Congress in Macau. In turn, the president of APAVT, Pedro Costa Ferreira, and the secretary general of ECTAA, Eric Drésin, defended that the initiatives to be carried out in partnership with the DST in 2025, such as the APAVT Congress and the ECTAA Summit in the Macao SAR , will contribute to “attracting a lot of attention to the destination among its member travel agents”.
This year, online marketing initiatives and special hotel offers will also be developed through the reservation platform for operators “Travelport” and the online travel agency “eDreams ODIGEO”, among other channels, to increase travel sales and encourage longer stays. long term tours in Macau.
After FITUR, DST will return in March, for the first time since the pandemic, to ITB Berlin, the largest tourism fair in the world.

"The biggest positive factor for Macao would be if the Chinese economy grew and consumer confidence levels improve," said Vitaly Umnsky, analyst at the Seaport Research Partners consultancy company.
More than 70% of people who visited the Macao SAR in 2024 came from Mainland China, whose economic growth reached the 5% target set by Beijing in 2024. But Nicholas Chen, an analyst at CreditSights, said the group company of financial rating agency Fitch expects a slowdown to 4.7% this year, in part due to weak private consumption.
The consumer confidence index in China fell in September to the lowest level of the last 34 years, stressed Jeffrey Kiang, analyst at Consultant CLSA.
That is, "if the prospects for Chinese consumers are not good, they will be able to tighten their belt, reduce travel and consumption," including Macao, Nicholas Chen explained.
Beijing has launched a series of stimulus measures, including the reduction of interest rates and the mandatory reserves of banks and the anticipation of thousands of millions of their budget in 2025 to finance construction projects. He also widened a consumer goods exchange system and increased the salaries of millions of civil servants to revive internal demand.
"The [Chinese] government has said it will launch more measures to stimulate the economy," said Vitaly Umansky, who expects mainly a recovery of the middle class confidence: "I think it will happen, it's just a matter of time."
Creditsights expects Chinese consumer confidence to rise in the second half of 2025, along with real estate price stabilization, which have been falling for 19 consecutive months. The issue concerns a lot of Beijing, due to the implications for social stability, since housing is one of the main investment vehicles of families and the real estate sector - adding indirect factors - represents about 30% of the Chinese economy.
"There will certainly be some side effect, because part of the measures that are adopted to boost domestic consumption may flow to the Macao game sector," said Nicholas Chen.
The analyst believes that China will still widen the list of cities whose residents can ask for 'individual visas' to visit Hong Kong and Macau, a method used by 35.2% of tourists who passed by Macao in 2024.
Vitaly Umansky does not have the same opinion and points out that since January 1st, residents of Zhuhai can now visit Macau once a week and stay for up to seven days.
On the other hand, analysts agree that casino revenues will be next year away from the maximum historical 303 billion patacas recorded in 2018.
"One thing is clear: the government aims to moderately growth in revenue in the future," said Jeffrey Kiang, recalling authorities predict gaming revenues of 240 billion patacas in 2025, which would be a 5.8%increase.
“When the Macau Government publishes a forecast, it is usually very conservative and is based on prior discussion with the Central Government Liaison Office” in the city, said Umansky.
The analyst does not believe that Beijing has some measure to control the resuming of casinos, similar to the campaign that began with the detention of the leader of the largest company raising VIP in the world, in November 2021. “Much of the reprehensible behavior in Macau disappeared with the 'junkets'. As long as things like that do not happen again, I don't expect any short -term campaign, ”he said.
 
Casinos revenues can rise 8% in 2025
Gaming revenue could rise 8% to 245 billion patacas in 2025, in annual terms, reaching around 84% of the level recorded in 2019, predicted CreditSights, a research unit of the Fitch agency. “This projection assumes that visitors in 2025 will improve to around 94% of 2019 levels, and gross gaming revenue per visitor will register a modest increase of 2% year-on-year, to 6,606 patacas”, says the analysts’ report. Nicholas Chen, David Bussey and Zerlina Zeng. CreditSights also believes that hotel occupancy will also grow “with the completion of casino renovations and room conversions”. However, he points out that the game faces “potential challenges”, mainly due to the “slowing growth” of the Chinese economy and “slow domestic consumption”.

Away from the glitter of Macau's casinos, the manager of a Cantonese seafood restaurant, a feng shui master and a young couple question the economic situation at the arrival of the new year of the snake.
At the entrance of Tong Vu, large lobsters drag themselves inside aquariums. This year are being sold to the purchase price, because the times so require it.
Tong Keng Seoi, the manager, has the Australian lobster at 498 Patacas, instead of the usual 900. Option that brings more business volume to the old Macao seafood during Lunar New Year, with full house and “a 30% increase orders compared to the previous year ”.
At this point, a banquet for 12 people, with lobster, ears and sea cucumbers, shark fin soup, suckling pig and roast chicken, can cost between four thousand and 12 thousand patacas.
“Consumption this year is much lower than in previous years, but we are very busy and the main reason is because we offer the lowest price possible,” says Tong, who laments the drop in local purchasing power.
At the Campo do Dragão restaurant, 200 meters there, the numbers also suggest retraction. Lin Zhiyuan, space manager, speaks of “600 to 800 tables” reserved throughout the month - “less 20% to 30%” than in 2024.
The difficulties can be recognized in other areas of the city. On a walk through downtown Macau, small street food businesses win over traditional restaurants and taverns.
Chan Chak Mo, deputy and president of the Union of Restaurant and Beverage Establishment Owners' Associations, confirms the cautious spending environment: “General consumption is low, street food costs around 60-70 patacas”, he says .
After three years of pandemic and rigorous politics 'zero covid', the game's engine, the engine of the local economy, are already approaching the values ​​of 2019. However, despite the regeneration of the sector, in small and medium enterprises, the wound maintains open.
In the case of restaurants, in November, according to the most recent official statistics, the turnover of “Chinese restaurants and food establishments and soup and chicken soup stores fell by 4.3% and 3.7%, respectively” .
And then there is the other side of the border. Quality products and services, lower prices and the possibility that, since 2023, two thousand vehicles with Macau registration plates will circulate daily in the interior of China, make neighboring Zhuhai a fierce competitor for small local businesses.
“It is estimated that there are around 50 million US dollars that were previously spent in Macau and Hong Kong per month and are now spent in Shenzhen and Zhuhai. And obviously this has a huge impact on the well-being of small businesses”, analyzes the president of the Luso-Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
Carlos Cid Álvares, also executive director of the Macao National Bank Overseas Bank, suggests adaptations: “Small businesses have done business equally for 20 years or 30 years and have to adapt to a new reality that is that of a younger population, with other needs ”.
Another sequelae of the economic moment: in 2023, 3,712 birth births were 43.5% than 10 years (6,571).
For Tao Xuemei and Wong Chio Fan, a young couple, personal finances and Chinese coffers do not allow them to take the step: “We are worried about having children because of the national debt, because of the economic recession. The choice for motherhood really depends on the country's economic capacity and debt repayment capacity”, summarizes Tao, 28 years old, working as a school counselor.
“We don’t want to have children just to pass on [our] debts to them,” adds Wong, a 35-year-old contractor.
Finances are the topic that around 20% of people take to consultations with Mickey Hung Sen Chun, master of 'feng shui', an ancient Chinese practice that studies the influence of space on people's well-being.
This Lunar New Year, which starts on Wednesday, casinos will continue to prosper, says the master. “As the symbolism of the serpent is associated with wisdom and mystical luck, many visitors may be more inclined” to gamble, Hung further predicts.
In the negative level, the year of the serpent “is often accompanied by indifference and hatred”, and the fact that “there were many important historical events” in this sign of the lunar calendar may be a source of apprehension, warns the master, who points to the risk of future “similar occurrences”.
The Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor in 1941; the Tiananmen massacre in Beijing occurred in 1989 and the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001. All years of the serpent.
At the national level, Hung estimates, “with the gradual recovery of the world economy, China's exports could be positively affected, which will help it achieve the growth objective set”.
China, shaken by a deep real estate crisis, the main investment vehicle for Chinese families, launched several economic stimulus measures in the last quarter of last year, including reducing banks' mandatory reserve ratios and interest rates. Beijing also promised to pursue “more proactive” budgetary policies and a “moderate easing” of monetary policy, to boost domestic consumption.
“The question is whether what they are doing at the moment, with all these macroeconomic support policies, is enough to stimulate domestic consumption”, assesses Nicholas Chen, analyst at consultancy Fitch Solutions, highlighting the weight of the real estate crisis “on sentiment of the consumer.”
Chen notes that, although China's gross domestic product reached Beijing's goal and grew 5% by 2024, Fitch Solutions foresees a slight slowdown by 2025 “to about 4.7% due to macroeconomic contrary winds, as well as slow domestic consumption, ”he adds.
Legend has it that the 'nian' ('year', in Mandarin), a mythical beast, takes to the streets these days and hunts for animals and people to devour and crop fields to ruin. As it is intolerant to noise and the color red, people started decorating their houses in red and launching fireworks and fireworks to scare away the monster.
Macao does not challenge the conviction. The city prepares the crossing for the new year. The streets dress as tradition dictates. Tong Vu, waiting for the serpent, hung red lanterns, to see also if for the year the lobsters sell better.
