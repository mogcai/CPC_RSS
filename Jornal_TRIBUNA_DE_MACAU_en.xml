They say, the situation will cause an unprecedented crisis in the last two decades

Traders in the Zape Zone, where they are satellite casinos that will end by the end of this year, held a meeting that was attended by more than 20 shopkeepers.
The owners of the establishments are concerned about the impact that decision could cause on the surrounding business environment, so they intend to ask the government a new assessment. In addition, retailers install their game operators to take on social responsibilities, intending to “suspend the satellite casinos closure to bring the zone trade to life,” as they mentioned during the meeting.
According to revealed, until yesterday more than 70 traders left their heading in a petition that will be delivered to the executive, with the aim of asking for help.
On the issue, stores leaders pointed out that “the government has underestimated the economic impact of the end of satellite casinos,” warning that this situation will cause an unprecedented crisis in the last 20 years.
At least nine satellite casinos should cease activity by December 31, after the three-year transition period granted by the agreements entered into between the operators of the gaming rooms and the concessionaires under which they operated. Among them are the GrandView, Fortune, Royal House, Ponte 16, Royal Arc, Kam Pek, Landmark, Legend Palace and Waldo.
However, two satellite casinos may be “absorbed”, by the intention of the SJM, which aims to acquire the ownership of the hotels where Ponte 16 and Le Royal Arc casinos are located. As for employees, the government has already required the gamekeepers to ensure jobs.
After the decision of the gamekeepers was announced, the government has minimized the economic impact of the closure of these spaces, but has been saying that it will launch measures to support commercial establishments in the vicinity of the satellite casinos, such as coupon packages and the installation of intellectual property check-in points.
 
Suggested Creation of Muslim Tourism Zone
Meanwhile, the Zape zone is pointed out by the subdirector of the center of collective wisdom policy, the Kaifong, as a place conducive to the dissemination of Muslim tourism. Choi Seng Hon suggests that the government transform that area into a space to attract tourists of great consumer power of the Middle East and Southeast Asia.
The official said that Macau, "despite having as its objective the transformation in a world center of tourism and leisure, is relatively late to make facilities for Muslim tourists, so they have not been able to attract sources of high quality visitors."
In this sense, and based on the revitalization of Zape's economy, urges the authorities to take various measures, with a view to attracting the consumption of Muslim tourists. Specifically, it proposes the transformation of the area stores into restaurants, supermarkets, or cultural and creative stores dedicated to this visitors segment.
In addition, it suggests the regular hold of Halal Gastronomy Festivals in Zape, the reinforcement of the online campaign and the formation of residents to serve, with good quality of service, tourists of this market.</description><pubDate>2025-06-24 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>“Gray spaces” with transformation potential in green areas</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/espacos-cinzentos-potencial-de-transformacao-em-zonas-verdes/</link><description>A study on strategy planning to increase green zones in “high density” cities used masters as a study case and concluded that the territory has few green spaces. Researchers identified underdeveloped places with the potential to be transformed, for example wide. The average 'per capita' green spaces of the peninsula is far below the national standard value
 
Pedro Milheirão
A recent study has concluded that the MSAR has a "small amount of green" per capita "spaces and" a lack of green space reserve resources. " Researchers also say that there are no "land in the urban reserve that can be directly planned as new green spaces." Titled “Planning Strategies to increase the occupancy rate of open green spaces based on urban geographical data in Macao: an investigation into cities of ultra-high density,” was published in the academic journal “Buildings”.
The group that conducted the investigation consists of Jitai LI, from the Department of Landscape Architecture of the Guangdong Ecological Engineering Polytechnic; FAN LIN, from the Faculty of Economics of the University of Macau; Hongcan Cui, from the School of Environmental Engineering at the University of Sun Yat-Sen de Cantão; Yile Chen, from the Faculty of Humanities and Arts of the University of Science and Technology of Macao; and Shuai Yang, from the School of Art and Archeology of the City of Hangzhou. The investigation was based on several MSAR maps, data and projections of the Statistics and Data Services Directorate (DSEC) and two studies of the Soil Services and Urban Construction Directorate.
The authors argue that there are several “open gray spaces” in the underused sgans, and that the average 'per capita' green spaces of the peninsula is below the national standard value of 30 square meters. For each resident there are only 3.3 square meters, based on the 532,700 inhabitants, for the year 2021. It should be clarified that the MSAR population density is one of the highest in the world, and in 2024 there were 20,600 people per square kilometer, according to DSEC data.
Researchers also identified several places with the potential to be converted into “green spaces”, totaling an area of ​​31,456 square meters. Of all this area, 21,506 square meters (68%) concern the peninsula, the remaining 9,950 square meters (32%) for mud and coloane, which would place the “per capita” value in 30.9 square meters, above the national standard.
The study advocates the implementation of a strategy to “turn gray into green”, in particular in the broad city. The authors argue that this would have a significant impact on increasing the “naturalness of street spaces” and improving the “quality of the human environment”. The opening to the population of Colina da Ilha Verde and Colina da Barra would also help to combat the scarcity of open public space.
The investigation focused on particular in the examples of the broadcasters of St. Augustine, St. Anthony, and the streets of Hortelães, Seng Tou and Coimbra. Regarding Largo de Santo Agostinho, there is still “a large area of ​​pavement without green”. In the case of Largo de Santo António, only a tenth of the area could be converted into green space, installing a small number of flower vessels, similar to the current state of Rua dos Minta. Regarding Rua de Seng Tou and Rua de Coimbra, which are “without any green”, there is still an “large open space area” not used.
The adaptation of the gray spaces of the streets of Seng Tou and Coimbra, with some banks and other facilities, could relieve the overcrowding problem of existing urban parks, read in the study. Even the authors indicate that the creation of recreational spaces and facilities for children, such as small green squares, called pocket parks, could significantly improve resident satisfaction.
"The adoption of planning strategies to optimize and use this type of open gray spaces could improve the green aspect of the high density streets and solve environmental problems such as the low per capita area of ​​green spaces," the study says. The authors indicate that one of the causes is the continuous growth of the number of residents in the bass of the mud in recent years.
Researchers give the examples of some cities in northern Mediterranean, such as Rome, Athens and Barcelona, ​​which usually “have narrow streets, a long architectural history, limited open space and an urban form characterized by high density houses with a high emphasis on squares”.
According to the research group, “the narrow streets and typical alleys of the mediterranean historic cities are often transformed into 'green veins' through street tree planting, the installation of green benches and the creation of small 'pocket parks'”, courtyards and terraces. These spaces can be combined with vegetation, water resources and living areas to form "small outdoor gardens that create microclimates and improve the quality of life of residents."
 
Vertical gardens and ecological corridors
If the eastern part of the peninsula continues to expand, the authors recommend that the "model of" green veins and green spots "be extended, creating areas with linear vegetation along new streets and integrating parks and gardens for better connectivities and accessibility.
They also suggest the incorporation of gardens into roofs and 'vertical' vegetation into the new buildings to maximize green spaces without consuming additional land. Other solutions would develop ecological corridors between natural zones to increase biodiversity and the number of recreational paths, and apply the “Greenways Embedded in Jade” model, creating wider greens between parks, natural and urban, and university fields.
According to the final report of the Public Consultation on the Director Plan (2020-2040), cited by the researchers, the 10 most popular questions included “landscape”, “green space or public open space”, “residential areas” and “ecological protection areas”. The implementation of the Director Plan, according to the investigation group, will undergo measures such as “protecting natural resources and areas with landscape”, combining “green spaces or public spaces through the green network” and “rationally planning open landscapes and spaces and integrating them with the natural ecological environment”.
The authors stress that “it is necessary to join the Green Development Directorate, with ecological conservation, green planning and green architecture as main axes of urban construction”. This will allow you to get a “pleasant to live, pleasant to work and pleasant to visit”. Resources with open, ecological, urban and sea and seaside spaces must be coordinated and organized, defend, in order to “promote the achievement of urban green development” and “satisfy the urgent demand of citizens and tourists of adequate leisure spaces”.
The suggested measures for the case of Macau study will be applicable in cities such as Tokyo or Shanghai, propose the authors, as they have “high density” urban areas.
In another study, carried out by the same group and published in the same magazine, several international cities were classified due to the “degree of urban spatial naturalness”. Macao was last, behind cities such as Canton, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Hong Kong and Taipei. Researchers say, however, that “there is still potential for continuous optimization,” in the image of the cities of Cantão and Taipei.
Academics point, however, some limitations. For example, planning strategies are proposed, but practical challenges are not deepened. "Factors such as land ownership, financing restrictions and bureaucratic procedures can make it difficult to perform expansions and optimizations of proposed green spaces," he says.</description><pubDate>2025-06-24 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Four more deputies announce reconditioner for direct suffrage</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/mais-quatro-deputados-anunciam-recandidatura-pelo-sufragio-directo/</link><description>The lists of four more groups competing for legislative elections were submitted yesterday through direct suffrage.

The Commission on Electoral Affairs (Caeal) yesterday received four lists of candidates for direct suffrage for the Legislative Assembly (AL). In the morning, the Promoting Union for Progress, the General Union of Residents' Associations (“Kaifong”), delivered a list of 10 candidates, led by current deputies Leong Hong Sai and Ngan Iek Hang. Lam Ka Chun, vice president of the promoter association for the development of the Taipa community, is the number three on the list.
According to Leong Hong Sai, the team's political program has the well-being of the population as a "most important component." In this sense, he said that he will suggest a regular pension adjustment mechanism for the elderly and continue to fight so that it is not lower than the social risk value, as it is currently. In addition, he promised to defend consumer rights and price supervision, as well as to exhort the government to respond to the demand for housing and to improve transportation and the employment environment for residents, especially for young people. Will also promote urban renewal.
Ngan Iek Hang has ensured that it will continually follow the use of residents and the operational situation of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), so it will review current employment support measures, evaluate the effectiveness of SME supports and try to find solutions to transforming visitors to consumer power.
Lam Ka Chun wants to work to promote the optimization of the legislative coordination mechanism, that is to review laws and legislate in the light of the importance and urgency of the subjects, giving priority to legal regimes linked to the well-being of the population. In addition, this candidate mentioned another goal of resolving the “overlapping of staff” and “weak functions” of MSAR's advisory bodies.
Also looking for a reelection, the current deputy Ron Lam, leads the list “Power of Synergy”, composed of six candidates, for the third candidacy for the elections of AL. Johnson Ian, president of the Macao Synergy Association, and Che I Kei are the two and three numbers on the list, which also has environmentalist Joe Chan as fifth candidate.
In the delivery of the list and the political program, Ron Lam highlighted the focus on employment, economy, guarantees for the well-being of the population, SME development and public finance. Lam expects the team to transmit in the al “real opinions” and “comprehensive attitudes” of residents for the government to respond to the various concerns.
The candidate has promised to urge the government to reduce the number of workers not resident in large companies, especially game operators, and to consider enabling SME development space besides ensuring employment, thus ensuring well-being through a “virtuous cycle”. In addition, Ron Lam said he will demand the “open and transparent” finances and public consultations for different policies.
Johnson Ian also pointed out that he expects to oversee the government to ensure the transparency of all budgets and opportunities for the public to express opinions.
On the other hand, the “Popular Liveliod Force” in Macau, linked to the Myanmar community, which competes for the first time, submitted a list of seven candidates. Tim Wong is the head of theist, followed by Leong Sio Iok and Che Meng Lam. According to Tim Wong, the team will focus on guarantees for employment, vocational and technical training, social benefits, housing policies and issue of closing casinos-satellite.
 
Loi I Weng replaces ma io fong on the list linked to women
Yesterday afternoon, the Bom Lar Alliance, a team of the Women's Association, submitted a list of 14 candidates, with an average age of 39 years. As in the last two races to the Al Elections, it maintains the current deputy Wong Kit Cheng as a head-chisel. This time, Loi I Weng, an education professional, is the number two on the list, instead of the current deputy Ma Io Fong. In addition, Wong Su Cheong, number three, was presented as a manager of an industrial and commercial company.
According to the agent of the list, Iong Weng Ian, the team gives high importance to the participation and formation of young people. Given the changes in the social environment, the increase in the number of voters and the constant change in the structure of voters, it hopes to ensure two seats in the hemiciclo.
Wong Kit Cheng stressed that the team will try to boost the government to implement several family -friendly measures, such as raising the birth allowance to 20,000 patacas, widening maternity and paternity license to 90 and 10 days, respectively, extending the childhood assistance allowance to six years and progressively increasing the amount of this allowance and birth subsidy, as well as release more policies of encouragement birth. The candidate also guaranteed efforts to increase the pension and subsidies for the elderly, disability and caregivers.
In turn, Loi I Weng hopes to boost the government to raise the prize for accreditation tests to 10,000 patacas per person and to improve the surveys related to the search for paintings of different sectors. In addition, it pointed to goals such as applying the exchange of economic housing fractions to young families who take care of children or the elderly, reinforce the channeling of resources for education, and launch policies in order to stabilize the teaching team. It also intends, among other measures, to simplify administrative procedures in schools and increase the number of psychological counselors.
 
Angela Leong and MA Chi Seng by the cultural and sports sectors
However, accompanied by the current deputy Chan Chak Mo, the Cultural and Sports Union of Sol Nascente submitted to Caeal the only list of candidates from the cultural and sports sectors, for the indirect suffrage. The two candidates are Angela Leong, current deputy elected of this sector for the indirect suffrage, and MA Chi Seng, current deputy appointed.
Chan Chak Mo, an elected deputy of this sector for indirect suffrage, does not advance with a reconditeration. According to it, the team obtained support signatures of 309 electoral persons.
Angela Leong has promised that she will continue to fight for the improvement of the athletes' guarantee mechanism, supporting innovation in the department for all, and reinforcing exchanges and cooperation with abroad in the sports area. Regarding the cultural sector, he said that he will support the realization of cultural and artistic activities, will encourage cultural and artistic innovation and the formation of paintings, as well as working for the enrichment of residents' spiritual and cultural life.
According to MA Chi Seng, the aim is to try the government to pay more attention and support to the cultural and sports sectors. In addition, the candidate expects the integrated development of cultural and sports industries to be accelerated and that the synergistic development of Macau sectors with Hengqin's cultural and sports projects is driven.</description><pubDate>2025-06-24 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Boss in the great bay to strengthen cooperation</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/chefe-na-grande-baia-para-estreitar-cooperacao/</link><description>The chief executive today ends a three -day journey through six cities in the Great Bay. In Shenzhen, Sam Hou Fai approached with local authorities collaboration in areas such as the sea economy, scientific and technological innovation, conferences and exhibitions. In Huizhou, he discussed, among other topics, the possibility of joint promotion of a tourist route, “Travel with various destinations”

Visits to six cities in the Great Bay have filled the chief executive's agenda for the last three days, in a journey that ends today.
In Shenzhen, Sam Hou Fai maintained meetings with local authorities, having exchanged opinions on ways to deepen the construction of cooperation mechanisms between the two cities. Among the topics covered, highlighting the intention of continuous collaboration in the areas of the sea economy, scientific and technological innovation, conferences and exhibitions, tourism and culture, financial sector, and to best perform the functions of the Macao platform as a point of connection between China and Portuguese -language countries.
According to a note from the Social Communication Office, the Chief Executive said that Macau is planning the construction of an industrial park for scientific and technological research and development. In this field, he pointed out the importance of taking as a reference to Shenzhen's “successful experiences” in the construction of Qianhai and Hetao zones in the areas of innovation and scientific and technological cooperation between Shenzhen and Hong Kong.
Before the meeting, the MSAR delegation, which includes the secretary for Economics and Finance, Tai Kin Yip, visited a computer system of Shenzhen and the Hetao Zone of Innovation and Scientific and Technological Cooperation between Shenzhen and Hong Kong.
In another stage of the trip to the Great Bay, Sam Hou Fai was in Huizhou, where he addressed collaboration in the development of industries on both parties, cultural exchange, cooperation in the tourism industry and support for young people in innovation and entrepreneurship.
Noting that Huizhou registers quick economic growth, with a strong base in the manufacturing industry, stressed that the MSAR has potential in financial and tertiary areas, so the two parties can, through the models of “Macao investigates and develops + Huizhou transforms” and “Macau + Huizhou products”, establish “full chain cooperation” that ranges from investigation and development of technologies, business incubation, to companies, to “Cultivation of industries”.
Huizhou "is a famous city in culture and rich in tourist resources," said Sam Hou Fai, "while Macau is an international renowned tourist town." Therefore, both sides "can integrate their resources, jointly promoting a tourist route" a trip with various destinations ".
In addition, both territories have a longtime relationship, "which makes it possible to launch more exchange activities, in terms of art and culture, customs and traditions, as well as in the formation of qualified frames in the tertiary industry," he said.
The entourage visited energy resources projects in the Huizhou City Bay Economic and Technological Development Zone.</description><pubDate>2025-06-24 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>China and EU warn for risks of possible closure of ORMUZ</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/ultimas/china-ue-alertam-para-riscos-de-possivel-fecho-de-ormuz/</link><description>China yesterday requested international efforts to “avoid an impact on world economic development” after the Iran Parliament has proposed the closure of the Ormuz Strait, where about 20% of world oil and gas. "The Persian Gulf and its surrounding waters are important channels for the international trade of goods and energy," said the spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
"Maintaining security and stability in the region is in the common interest of the international community," said Guo Jiakun, insisting that "efforts to promote conflict distension must be intensified."
Following the US attack on nuclear facilities in Iran, the Iranian parliament proposed the closure of Ormuz on maritime traffic - a measure with a global impact on the hydrocarbonet trade and which will still have to be approved by the Supreme National Security Council.
Guo reiterated that Washington's military operation “exacerbates tensions in the Middle East” and revealed that China, Russia and Pakistan presented to the UN Security Council a resolution project that appeals “an immediate and unconditional ceasefire” between Iran, Israel and the US. "Attacking nuclear facilities under the safeguards of the international atomic energy body is a serious violation of the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and International Law," said the spokesman, asking "all parts" to avoid climbing and defending the return to the "path of political solution."
Guo did not directly comment on the statements of the US Secretary of State, who urged China to intercede with Iran to avoid the closure of the narrow. "I appeal to the Chinese government in Beijing to contact you, as they are strongly dependent on Ormuz's Strait for Oil Supply," Marco Rubio said in an interview with Fox News.
About 84% of the oil that crosses the Strait of Ormuz is intended for Asia, including China, India, South Korea and Japan, economies very vulnerable to restrictions on maritime traffic in case of conflict climbing in the Middle East.
The high representative of the European Union (EU) for foreign policy also warned that the closure of Ormuz "would be extremely dangerous and would not be good for anyone." Kaja Kallas also said that the EU has always been in favor of diplomacy and recalled that the European bloc spoke to the Government of Iran on Friday. In this contact, he said, Iran was available to talk about the nuclear issue.
 
Israel attacks again
Israel launched a new series of air strikes against Iran, which in turn threatened the US with "serious consequences" after bombing against its nuclear facilities and warned of a possible "war spread" in the Middle East.
The Iranian state press reported attacks against the underground center of uranium enrichment and the revolutionary guard headquarters, the regime's ideological army in Tehran. On the other hand, in Israel, alert sirens were active again due to the release of Iranian missiles.
Iran's Foreign Minister, Araqchi, said US and Israel “crossed a large red line” and announced a meeting in Moscow with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who lamented the “aggression” against Iran and ensured that Russia will help the Iranian people.
US authorities have asked their citizens “redoubled surveillance” around the world, taking into account any retaliation of the Islamic Republic regime.
The Chinese embassy in Tehran yesterday indicated that the “vast majority” of Chinese citizens has already been taken from Iran, given the aggravation of the conflict with Israel.

Conversely, the recipes from the game grew and equivalent to a larger slice of total recipes, compared to the previous fiscal year
 
The “Emperor Entertainment Hotel” recorded net losses of $ 248.1 million from Hong Kong in the fiscal year ended March 31 this year. The previous year, the group holding the "Grand Emperor Hotel" and "Inn Hotel" in Macao had profits of $ 62.8 million from Hong Kong.
The negative results of the new annual exercise were even though the group revenues have grown by 6%, from $ 789.3 million from Hong Kong to 837 million in one year. In the game area, revenues grew 10.1%to $ 505.6 million from Hong Kong, compared to 459.2 million in the preceding year. Revenue in the game equivalent to 60.4% of total revenues, and in the previous fiscal year they equivalent to 58.2%.
In the hotel and real estate sector, revenues remained stable, with Hong Kong's $ 331.4 million, compared to last year's 330.1 million.
The company attributed the annual losses to a loss of $ 371.7 million in investment properties.
According to Portal Gggrasia, this month, the company confirmed it had received a notice from the SJM concessionaire, about the end of the operations of the Casino-Satellite licensed by the game operator. Of the 11 Macau satellite casinos, nine are licensed by SJM, and the operator announced plans to close seven of its satellite casinos, including the “Emperor Palace”.
In the report, the Emperor Group points out that, in recent years, the Government of MSAR has been making efforts to “transform the city” and diversify cultural, leisure and entertainment offerings, to attract a broader tourist market. The number of visitors in Macao has grown, benefiting from measures such as authorization from multiple entries for residents of Zhuhai and Hengqin, implemented earlier this year.
In addition to gaming tables and 'slot-machines', the 26 floors of the Grand Emperor Hotel offer a variety of amenities such as sauna, spa facilities, five restaurants with international kitchens and 311 rooms, in an area of ​​over 60,000 square meters. The “Inn Hotel”, located on Taipa Island, has 17 floors and 286 guest rooms in an area of ​​approximately 19,417 square meters.

After classes, students at Pui Va Secondary School remain in the classroom, distracted to explore a smart condition. These staff - explains Ruan Zhan Teng, school teacher at the school - act as interactive projectors and are used as soon as the first year, to write, watch videos or participate in classes with digital media.
"In the third year, students begin to learn to identify artificial intelligence in everyday life, basic programming and photos and videos generated by AI," the computer teacher added to Lusa.
The change took place in 2024 and is stipulated in the law: AI should be included in primary education (with a workload of 17 hours and 20 minutes per school year), 7th to 9th grade (19 hours and 20 minutes) and 10th to 12th (18 hours and 40 minutes).
Despite the requirement, Andy Chun Wai Fan, professor and director of the University of Macao Information and Communication Center in Education, Note that schools face two obstacles: lack of resources and faculty formation. “Some schools have only one information technology teacher,” said Fan, also referring that institutions generally have computer classes only once a week.
Pedro Lobo, a teacher in this area, with 30 years of experience in the territory, including at the Portuguese School of Macau, is concerned about the lack of training. "Most teachers are already a certain age, they have not grown with this new technology ... So the mindset is still short of all this evolution, and change is being so fast that it can hardly follow," explained the Portuguese.
Education authorities require teachers 30 hours of annual IA training, however, wolf considers not sufficient. Although this year has already studied almost 40 hours, the teacher says he is "little prepared".
Regarding this government policy, Andy Chun Wai Fan also remembers that it is required to schools that address ethics, innovation and collaboration in the domain of AI, although it fits the institutions the creation of the manuals themselves.
“We do not have a manual about what to teach (…), each school has its own ideas about what to do with its students,” wolf reacted, explaining that he teaches “transferring AI to school work”, either through image generation, small game development, AI ethics approach and copyright issues.
In a different record, the Pui Va Secondary School, which introduced AI in 2021, assumes to be “well prepared” to “the change”. The institution spends about two million patacas a year on AI tools, employs seven information technology teachers (IT) and hired a university professor in Beijing to support.
“We want students to be able to use artificial intelligence to identify problems and solve real -life problems,” noticed the IT Office Director of Chinese educational establishment, Chong Wai Yin.
Here, students work, for example, with programming languages ​​(Python, Tencent, Iflytek), and AI models such as Deepseek and ChatgPT, engaging in intelligent city projects, in the first cycle, and in the creation of applications, at a later stage, said Zhao Qihao, former professor at the University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, who taught in Puija VA.
“In the first cycle, we developed smart cities, automated houses and AI -powered parking systems (…). In the second cycle, students create mobile applications and sustainable technological projects,” he explained.
In April, the Secretary for Social Affairs and Culture, LAM, announced that Macao's educational reforms for 2025 will focus on AI and include plans for an intelligent classroom in all schools.
The Government of Macao attributed to the school network under the direction of the Directorate of Youth Education and Development Services (DSEDJ) 15 million PATACA for AI software for this academic year.
In an email sent to Lusa, DSEDJ stated that the government “attributes great importance” to the teaching of information technologies. "The medium and long term plan for non-higher education (2021-2030) identified 'reinforcement of creativity and technological education' as one of the main directions of development," he explains in the note.
However, Pedro Lobo questions the pressure on young students: "Are we seeing children 8, 9, 10 years old to develop applications? Maybe 1% is capable. The rest does the best they can. They have classes and homework that never end."

The Arraial de São João again held this year at the Torre de Macao venue. The threats of rain for the weekend did not dissuade the public who participated in the festivities who, according to Miguel de Senna Fernandes, pointed out “a historic date of Macao”. To the Jornal Tribuna de Macao, the president of the Macanese Association said this was a date that goes beyond the celebration of a popular saint and a day "celebrated by all the macanese communities."
Miguel de Senna Fernandes regretted the fact that there is no “that volume of people as we would like”, due to the “which is not so large” dissemination and the space of Arraial is more tiny. “As much as we want to be outdoors, it is always the space of someone,” adding that the organization has only “thanking the logistical support of the tower”, however, that it would take place in a neighborhood space or street.
"For 11 years, we celebrated in the neighborhood of São Lázaro, with very hot, but it was a very typical thing, attracted the tourists and was very crowded," explaining that "the most important thing is to keep the party." He also addressed the budget issue, short of what is desirable for "a party of burglary."
For António Monteiro, president of the Association of Young Macanese (AJM), “if it wasn't for June 24 (…) Macao would not be the same, since the heritage, the Portuguese language and presence”. Monteiro asserted that “this village is younger” and recalled when the festivities were held in Coloane, at Hac-Sá Beach, where “there were bonfires, such hammer, even in the style of Porto”.
Speaking to this newspaper, the AJM leader said that the organization's challenge is currently greater, "because we want [the Arraial] to be classified as Macao's intangible heritage." In this sense, he collaborated with the Association of Macao Heritage Ambassadors, an association formed by young Chinese, with which he tells “to open a window into the Chinese community”, in order to integrate it, “because after all is a Macao party”.
Finally, he highlighted the “small entertainment of the Portuguese part”, such as pimba, brand and folk dance, stressing that it is not a “typical village of Lisbon or Porto, is a Macao Arraial”.
Manuela Guerreiro, the exhibitor at the event, also highlighted the “Portuguese” of the party, where she finds known faces that sometimes “we don't see for almost a year” and where she releases Portuguese condom products. "I've participated since it started in São Lazarus," he said, remembering the neighborhood he considered to be "the ideal site to make St. John." "The community was all over there, even if it rained, which usually happened every year. But it was very cute because people gathered there, no one failed," he said, mourning the fact that there was less influx this year.
Sérgio, son of Manuela Guerreiro, said it was a good opportunity to join the Portuguese community and expose the Portuguese products. The owner of the “Lotus Cocktail” in Taipa says there has been an effort [by the organization] to have “more offer and more tents”, which “unfortunately did not translate into a larger number of visitors,” he lamented.
Marília Coutinho, the exhibitor, also stated that in last year's edition “there was more adhesion”. It justified with the lack of dissemination of the event, asking for more support from the media, and admitting to prefer when the camp was held in the neighborhood of São Lázaro.</description><pubDate>2025-06-23 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>New York parade resorts to collective funds after withdrawal from companies</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/lazer/desfile-de-nova-iorque-recorre-fundos-colectivos-apos-desistencia-de-empresas/</link><description>The drop in business donations after Donald Trump's policies against diversity and inclusion led the New York pride parade, the largest annual LGBTQ+ meeting in the US, seeking funds among community members.
According to NYC Pride spokesman Kevin Kilbride, this year was reached “only about 80% of the background goal” for the city's big pride party, which will be held on June 29 and expects to gather about two million people.
“We are trying to fill this gap with a participatory fundraising campaign,” says Kilbride.
In mid-May, the organization launched a campaign “between equals so that people can start their own background collections on the internet, share them with friends and allow people to donate,” he says.
The group “wants to lean a little more for individual donations and participatory support,” he says.
The organization responsible for the annual parade and other community projects said it has raised “almost 25,000 dollars of almost 200 donors” in a matter of days.
In previous years, extravagant floats sponsored by large companies paraded along the fifth Avenida de Manhattan along with others organized by community groups. And while many companies continue to contribute, some have discreetly reduced their commitments.
Muneer Panjwani, who leads the Engage for Good, said that "there was a massive withdrawal last year, specifically from companies that supported pride events for a long time and decided not to support anyone."
Panjwani Organization connects companies to non -profit organizations and reports on consumer contributions when they have the option of making a donation by paying a purchase in a store. “While companies remove their philanthropic money, consumers say: 'This theme is still important to us,'” he says.
One of the most prominent brands that decided to limit his participation in pride was Target, a popular chain of stores. Last week, he reported to AFP that he will not participate in the parade.
The network has been criticized and saw the price of their stocks on the stock market to fall as a result of a boycott on the Internet in response to its suppression of diversity programs, which justified by the "evolution of the external scenario."
At Brooklyn's annual pride parade, Progressive Democratic Councilman Chi Osse told AFP that "pride began on the basis through the community, and corporations that bend before a president who thinks a king only show us who they really are to us."
Brooklyn's pride manifestation is smaller and has long been considered more radical than Manhattan's, although it has a small number of participating companies.
Anya Glow-Kollisch, one of the leaders of the Sirens Women’s Motorcycle Club group of the parade, says that "it is great that companies are willing to say that they support equal rights." "But I think that, in the end, it is a movement driven by people who demand their rights, and many companies simply do it because they think they should do so," he says.
"Therefore, it is very valuable that people in the community manifest themselves and show that this is what we are."
