The lack of recognition of the qualifications of health professionals, the scarcity of information exchange systems and different regulatory staff are some of the obstacles. The author proposes some measures, for example, a “negotiating platform” to define the qualification requirements of those who exert beyond borders, a solid information sharing system and the recognition of medical records

The “lack of mutual recognition of medical qualifications, limited interconnectivity of sanitary information systems and divergent regulatory staff” are some of the “barriers” that “prevent effective collaboration” between Macau, Hong Kong and Guangdong in the medical field. The conclusions arise in the study entitled “Collaboration of China Health Services in the large area of ​​Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Bay: Barriers and Next Steps”. In this sense, the author, Wu Weidong, from the School of Humanities of the University of Jinan, Guangdong, lists a series of potential solutions, for a higher connection between the three regions in health.
"The Great Bay, which works in the framework of" a country, two systems ", results in various institutional regulations. Due to historical evolution, the economic and social evolution of Hong Kong, Macao and Continental China differ significantly from each other," says the author, adding that the three regions "have considerable institutional differences in terms of access, provision and regulation of health services."
First of all, he says that doctors' licensing systems "are not mutually recognized, reflecting institutional differences between the three regions." "This disparity creates significant challenges, such as the limitations of medical qualifications and the difficulties of mutual recognition of medical professional classifications. Continental China doctors, for example, cannot work in Hong Kong or Macao without first passing local medical qualification exams," he exemplifies.
On the other hand, although the interior of China issues short -term exercise authorizations for Hong Kong and Macau doctors, the scope of action “remains restricted”. For example, Macao's traditional Chinese medicine doctors who exercise at the Macao University School of Medicine and Technology Hospital in the deepened cooperation zone are allowed to prescribe medications, but cannot practice acupuncture. “These restrictions prevent their full use, limiting their ability to provide comprehensive care to patients,” argues Wu.
In addition, the misalignment between the mainstream China professional title assessment system and those of the RAE "contributes to an exceptionally low approval rate for Hong Kong and Macau doctors, despite the opportunity for certification."
On the other hand, differences in hospital management systems, health services standards and drug use “complicate the integration of information and medical services”. Also data protection raises questions. In Hong Kong, unauthorized disclosure of patient data can result in severe sanctions, including fines and prison, while in Macao the law classifies medical information as sensitive data. Although China has taken “a significant step” in this matter in 2021, the new law needs time to be improved and reinforced.
"This discrepancy can lead residents of Hong Kong and Macau to hesitate to share personal information with health institutions on the continent, probably due to concerns about potential data violations. There are still gaps in transmitting transmission of medical data and transionic health services, namely in terms of legal regulation," he says.
There is also the issue of medical records: "Recognition of medical records from different hospitals involves certain risks, as health professionals have to analyze the results of exams and diagnoses of other institutions and use them as a basis for their diagnoses. This process is closely linked to the levels of competence of health professionals from different hospitals."
Another aspect mentioned is the payment. In the RAE, health services are predominantly funded by public revenues, while the cities of the large bay work with a mixed social and universal health insurance system. "The continent's health system does not provide coverage to residents seeking medical treatment in Hong Kong and Macau. (…) [E] Although Hong Kong and Macau offer partial financial support to residents receiving medical care on the continent - for example, through valleys - this support has a limited scope," the study says.
For the author, another "critical question" is the legal jurisdiction associated with the location of the health services and the place of residence of the patient, "especially when medical disputes arise." "Patients often face difficulties in sailing unknown legal systems, which complicates their ability to effectively protect their rights in case of disputes," he notes. "Without comprehensive regulatory cooperation between regions, medical dispute resolution becomes increasingly difficult, which further limits the development of transfronheous health services."
 
Next Steps
To mitigate obstacles, it advocates “the establishment of comprehensive regulatory alignment, which ensures mutual recognition of health professionals' qualifications”, as well as “the development of integrated platforms for the sharing of information and the regulation of services is essential to promote effective cooperation in the provision of health services”.
In the field of medical qualifications, “it is essential to reinforce collaboration and exchanges among health professionals”. "The reinforcement of exchange and the formation of medical talent between mainland China, Hong Kong and Macao in various domains is essential to contribute to the construction of a 'healthy bay'. This can be facilitated by establishing collaboration platforms for service provision, talent training programs and the creation of interregional clinical trial centers," he suggests.
It also proposes the creation of a “negotiating platform” to define the qualification requirements of medical professionals who exercise beyond borders, promoting mutual recognition. "At the same time, potential challenges, such as the influx of foreign doctors, the reduction in the salaries of local doctors and the violation of the rights of local professionals, should be addressed proactively. Special attention should be paid to the concerns of Hong Kong and Macao health care providers in order to ensure fair and equitable practices," he argues.
It is also “essential to advance with collaboration mechanisms for medical referrals and emergency transfers”, and at this stage, “one of the priorities is the development of a solid health services sharing system between regions, facilitating interoperability and mutual recognition of medical records”.
As this collaboration progresses, the protection of the privacy of patients and the prevention of data violations should be the main priorities, continues Wu Weidong, stressing that the rights of professionals should also be safeguarded.
"Establishing a cooperation mechanism for the protection of health care rights in the large bay is critical to reducing medical disputes between regions and ensuring effective and effective responses when conflicts arise. The signing of cooperation agreements between Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau would offer a legal basis for the implementation of provisional arbitration measures ordered by courts or arbitration courts." considers.
The academic argues that there is a “critical need” of collaboration in health, “driven by the growing interregional demand due to increased migration, population aging and deeper economic integration”. According to data cited in the study, in 2018, more than 10,000 admitted patients from Hong Kong (8,037) and Macao (2,072) were reported in Guangdong, riding in 2021 to a total of 16,153, with 10,750 of Hong Kong and 5,403 from Macao, a growth of about 33.8% and 160%, respectively.
"After covid-19 pandemic, transfronheous medical consumption increased in the Great Bay. Only Shenzhen medical institutions provided diagnostic and treatment services to 640,000 residents of Hong Kong and Macao in 2023," he adds.</description><pubDate>2025-06-05 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>IC advance for the end of the year conclusion of the restoration of the old walls</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/ic-adia-para-final-ano-conclusao-restauro-das-antigas-muralhas/</link><description>The Cultural Institute has already ended the placement of elements of the “lower stone layer” of the old walls, which collapsed in 2022 due to a collapse near the St. Francis Road. The next step is to start the restoration of the Chunambo elements, the body told the Jornal Tribuna de Macao, ensuring that the structure, raw materials and the original construction methods will be respected again. Initially, it was expected that the restoration was completed in the second half of this year, but the IC now points to the end of the year

The restoration works of the ancient walls, which in 2022 collapsed due to a collapse by the San Francisco Road, should be completed in the fourth quarter of this year, the Cultural Institute (IC) said to the Jornal Tribuna de Macao, postponing the forecast initially. As this newspaper had already reported, the body led by Leong Wai Man expected the works to end in the second quarter of this year.
The CI did not detailed if there is any difficulties in doing these work, stressing that, “according to the restoration plan, it will carry out the works (…) with total respect for the original structure, as well as consideration by the raw materials and the original construction methods”.
Following the landslide, the authorities advanced with the demolition of 10 meters from the wall, due to “imminent danger”, and in June 2023 announced that five more meters were demolished as they still have safety risks. The part of the wall that still remains intact is about 22 meters.
According to the body, it has already been completed the placement of the elements concerning the “lower layer of stone”, and the authorities now prepare “to start the restoration of the chunambo elements of the upper layer”. Chunambo was the main material and construction technique used in the construction of the city's former defense walls, according to the IC.
"During this period, the IC will conduct regular surveys, with particular attention to the chunambo materials used, including adjustment of the proportions of Chunambo constituent materials based on the results of previous surveys and analyzes, to select the most suitable materials for the original chunambo formula that will be restored," the body explained in response to this newspaper. In addition, it will also be necessary to perform a simulation test to evaluate the composition of Chunambo, "in order to ensure the quality of conservation and restoration work."
The CI ensures that, after the completion of the restoration work, it will appoint an entity to “perform professional and regular monitoring” of Chunambo walls.
Before the restoration prepared work, the IC prepared Chunambo wall restoration plans, studied the raw material, components and traditional techniques, as well as confirmed the materials and restoration procedures. He also collaborated with the Experimental Center for the Conservation of Historical Buildings at the University of Tongji, in Shanghai, so that this will give an opinion on the plans. This academic institution in the interior of China has already helped in the restoration of the walls of Fortaleza do Monte, having “vast experience” in the repair of Macao's Chunamo walls, according to the IC.
It is recalled that the wall suffered a partial collapse, which was due, according to the summary of the final inspection report on the collapse, to the missing and deteriorated parts of the masonry containment wall below the old wall, the simultaneous realization of two works, which represented another risk to safety, as well as the torrential rainfall of June 8, 2022, which weakened further the stability of the wall of the wall Containment in masonry.
 
Work of the central library progresses “according to the plan”
The first phase of the construction of the new Central Library of Macau (demolition, foundations and cellars) is still underway, and its conclusion is planned by the end of 2025, and the superstructure work will begin next year, however the Cultural Institute (IC) is no use a forecast for space to be finished and entering operation. "After the first phase of the work, the second phase of the work will start in 2026," said the body, adding that the development of the execution project "is progressing according to the plan, and all works are being done in an orderly manner to ensure the quality of the project and the fulfillment of safety standards." It is recalled that in 2021, when the IC announced that Mecanoo's Dutch team had won the contest to project the new central library, it had been indicated that the works would be completely completed in early 2025.</description><pubDate>2025-06-05 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>President of Guinea-Bissau gathers this afternoon with Sam Hou Fai</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/presidente-da-guine-bissau-reune-esta-tarde-sam-hou-fai/</link><description>The president of Guinea-Bissau today begins a visit of less than 24 hours to Macao, where he will meet with the chief executive, Sam Hou Fai, about an hour after his arrival in the middle of the afternoon. In the evening, Umaro Sissoco Embaló, will receive the Guinean community resident in the territory. The issue of “student integration” should be one of the main themes of the meeting, according to the Jornal Tribuna de Macao the president of the Guinean Association Natural and Friends of Guinea-Bissau. The Chief of Staff of the African country is part of eight people in the entourage, including the Minister of Economy. Tomorrow at noon, Embaló will go to Hong Kong

Meetings with the Chief Executive, Sam Hou Fai, and the Guinean community resident in the territory are some of the points of the program of the president of Guinea-Bissau to Macao, almost a year after having moved to Beijing. Umaro Sissoco Embaló arrives this afternoon, at 3:45 pm, to Macao International Airport, remaining in the territory until noon tomorrow, Friday.
In the one that is the first move to the masters of head of state, Embaló will begin to fulfill his schedule at the government headquarters, where he will have a meeting with Sam Hou Fai. The president will be accompanied by the entire entourage of seven people who have made the trip from Bissau and even from the country's delegate to the Permanent Secretariat of the Forum for Economic and Commercial Cooperation between China and Portuguese -speaking countries, Abdú Jaquité.
Soon after, the Guinean delegation visits the permanent secretariat of the Macao Forum, and is expected shortly after a meeting with businessmen at the MSAR.
One of the highlights of the visit will be tonight at 9 pm, when the Guinean community resident in the territory, including a student representation, will have the opportunity to express their concerns to Guinea-Bissau's head of state.
Graziela Lopes, president of the Guinean Association Natural and Friends of Guinea-Bissau, anticipated the Jornal Tribuna de Macao that “the questions of student integration and the difficulties that sometimes face those who want to continue their studies or even stay in Macau” should be addressed at the meeting.
“I think this will be the main theme,” said the leader, recognizing that the weather was little, since she knew the coming from Embaló to Macau, to gather all the people who live here. At this time, the Guinean community encompasses just over 60 people, including students, “which constitute a floating community,” said Graziela Lopes.
Friday's agenda will be filled with two private meetings with Vera Zhou, director of Perfection Companhia LDA, and Yi Xiaohu, Director-General of the Huashi Group, interested in investing in a cement factory and building materials in Guinea-Bissau. At about 12:00 pm, the Guinean entourage will go to Hong Kong, where it will maintain contacts with authorities and entrepreneurs from the region.
The delegation is part of the Minister of Economy, Plan and Regional Integration, Soares Sambú, and the Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Fatumata Jau. In addition, the official delegation are part of the MSAR, the diplomatic and political counselors, respectively Ambassador Alfredo Cabral and Fernando Serafim da Silva, the presidential counselor, Yassenia Ibrahim, and the president's office advisor, Indira Yonhinte Tavares.
Umro Embaló arrives in Macau after a three -day visit to Malaysia, whose main objective was to reinforce cooperation in the fields of commerce, agriculture, vocational training and education. In the capital, Kuala Lumpur, President Guinean, who met Malaysian Prime Minister Annwar Ibrahim, also sought to attract Malaysian investors to the Guinea-Bissau market, namely Cashews and other agricultural products in the country, following a bet on a sector development policy.
Guinea-Bissau established political and diplomatic relations with Malaysia in 1974, a year after the independence of the African country.
It is recalled that, last year, in July, Embaló was visiting the Popular Republic of China for three days, when he also intended to reinforce cooperation in the areas of infrastructure, agriculture and fishing. In Beijing, he met with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Li Quiang. The city of Shanghai was another of the stops, having elapsed meetings with members of local government and visits to the Huawei Technology Group and the University City of Songjiang.
Two months later, in September, the Guinean President returned to Beijing to participate in the China-Africa Cooperation Forum, during which he contacted Xi Jinping again.
In this year 2025, Guinea-Bissau takes over the CPLP rotary presidency and has warranties, announced by Umaro Embaló itself, from China's support in building at least 300 km of roads, a new university campus for 12,000 students and a conference center.
In 2021, the two countries signed a memorandum of understanding under the project A Track and Route. China has been an unavoidable partner for Guinea-Bissau since the early days of independence-armed struggle, having been one of the first countries to form Guinean military frameworks, as was the case of legendary commander João Bernardo Nino Vieira, a deceased former president of Guinea-Bissau.

Projects involving Portuguese-speaking countries (PLP) will be focused on the Forum and International Exhibition on Investment Investment and Construction, which will take place for three days, from June 10, at Cotai Expo do Venetian. To date, more than 400 government representatives, business, as well as infrastructure sector elites from the PLP and the Great Bay, have enrolled in the event, including companies listed on the Stock Exchange and renowned brands.
One of the highlights of the fair, which goes in the 16th edition, is the Macau-Hengqin exhibition zone, installed in a space of 150 square meters. Based on the experience gained in the first installation last year, the area will present a “combination of multimedia facilities and products autonomously developed by companies”, according to a statement from the Institute for Commerce and Investment Promotion (IPIM).
One of the news is the dissemination of immediate installation structures and ready to inhabit, made of steel and concrete, as well as the 5G Intelligent Inspection vehicles, “capable of performing virtually the entire place of inspection on site, in order to highlight the images of brands, technologies, services and results of Macao and Hengqin infrastructure companies,” says the text.
The exposure zone will also “reinforce understanding” regarding the opportunities for joint development of Macau and Hengqin, by the representatives of the sector that will be present in the Forum.
In addition, among the more than 220 projects signed in previous editions, infrastructure projects involving PLPs and cities integrated in the Great Bay, in cooperation with national and international partners, represent a value of about $ 39 billion.
The areas of activity include construction, technical consultancy, energy and electricity, services to the population and technological innovation, highlighting the role of Macao as a platform.
In order to promote cooperation and exchange exchange in the infrastructure sector, the organizing entity has planned a series of exchange seminars, business meetings, forums, exhibitions and contact scholarship sessions, focusing on the elements of the PLP, the large bay and hengqin.
In addition to being held various infrastructure cooperation events between China and PLP, such as the Annual Conference “Intelligent and Industrialized Construction”, the PLP Infrastructure Development Index Analysis Report will also be released in the joint implementation of the Track and Route initiative (2025), providing the sector a “prospective reference” in the expansion of infrastructure cooperation.
On the third day of the Forum, on June 12, special meetings will be held between Macao and Hengqin companies and exhibitors, “accurately meeting companies' development needs and boosting more business cooperation related to Macau and Hengqin, through exclusive contact scholarship sessions”.</description><pubDate>2025-06-05 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>CPSP did not receive previous meeting notices for June 4</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/cpsp-nao-recebeu-avisos-previos-de-reuniao-para-4-de-junho/</link><description>The Public Security Police Corps indicated to the Jornal Tribuna de Macao that it did not receive previous warnings for meeting or demonstration for June 4, the day of the 36th anniversary of Tiananmen
 
The vigil by the victims of Tiananmen, who took place for three decades in Macao, returned yesterday to take place in the territory. The last time it happened in Senate Largo was in 2019. The Public Security Police (CPSP) said yesterday to the Jornal Tribuna de Macau did not receive "any notice of demonstration or meeting for June 4".
For decades, Macau and Hong Kong have been the only places on Chinese soil where the repression movement was peaceful, with annual watches that, in the case of Hong Kong, gathered tens of thousands of citizens. Since 2020, Macao authorities have banned the vigil, invoking the need to protect public health in the context of the pandemic.
In 2021, Macao police first cited political reasons to ban the honor, a decision later validated by the last court, which rejected an appeal filed by the Macao Union to develop democracy, former deputies NG Kuok Cheong and Au Kam San. In May 2023, those responsible decided to extinguish the association, "taking into account the revision of the National Security Act and the unpredictability of the future."
Ng Kuok Cheong told Lusa that he planned to mark the day private, possibly in Hong Kong. Not wanting to share details about the program of this June 4, which could still change, said that the people to be joined to mark the 36th anniversary of Tiananmen preferred to “not do so in Macao”, for fear of any police action. “They don't want to do anything in Macao and asked to join me,” added NG, who used to organize an itinerant photographic exhibition and a nightly vigil in public space annually.
Asked if the new generations know this episode of Chinese history, NG stressed that the people to be joined "are young" that, from experience, "want to discuss the story, but not in Macao."
Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee warned on Tuesday that "all activities" organized in that territory must respect the law and that acts that compromise national security will be considered serious crimes and face an "immediate and severe" police response.
However, in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian yesterday described as "an attack" deliberate the comments of the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who said the world "will never forget" Tiananmen. Rubio's “erroneous observations” “maliciously distort the historical facts deliberately attack the political system and the development path of China and constitute a serious interference in China's internal affairs,” Lin told a press conference.
"China manifests its profound dissatisfaction and firmly opposed these acts. We have sent a solemn protest to the US part," he added.

The Chinese Teaism Association will inaugurate the exhibition “Lu Yu's Legacy: a complete reconstruction of tea utensils from the classic tea”, at 11:00 am on Saturday, at the Cardinal Newman Culture and Performative Arts Center, on the Calçada da Vitória, to “promote traditional Chinese tea culture and present the deeds of macau tea studies”.
Until June 15, the exhibition will show the first complete and unpublished set of 25 tea utensils in the world, a legacy of Lu Yu, the “Sage of Tea”. This event “enriches the deep macao tea culture and contributes to the identity of a 'cultural macao',” says Lo Heng-Kong, president of the association, cited in a statement.
Lu Yu became famous with "The Classic of Tea"), a three-volume masterpiece that covers the origins of tea, the tools, the production, the utensils, the history and the regions, with illustrations, being considered the world's first encyclopedia on tea. According to the press release, a fifth of Lu Yu's work is dedicated to the tea tools, which reflects Lu's “meticulous patterns”, says the association.
Lo Heng-Kong decided in 1998 to try to recreate the artifacts mentioned in Lu Yu's work, until, in 2005, he managed to “successfully” to “successfully” the main tea utensils. The following year, in Hangzhou, during an international tea culture symposium, he presented his study "An Examination of the Wind Furnace and Water Filter in Chapter Four of the Classic of Tea".
In 2007, by an invitation from the Yixing Municipal Government, LO conducted a live demonstration of Lu Yu's techniques, using the tools he rebuilt. Five years later, he was invited to the Famen Temple Museum in Xi'an to present the study "Revisiting the Utensils in Chapter Four of the Classic of Tea."
Tea will have been discovered by Shennong, a legendary “divine farmer” who was the first to discover tea and taught several agricultural inventions to the Chinese. According to the press release, the drink was registered by the Duke of Zhou from the Lu Dynasty, having flourished in the Tang dynasty before reaching its peak during the Song dynasty and eventually spreading around the world.
Legend has it that Lu was born unnamed and orphaned, having been abandoned at the age of three, along with a lake in Jingling in Hubei province, and rescued by monk Zhiji, who, unable to educate the child, decided to consult the “I Ching”, a classic book of philosophy about the universe, with more than four millennia and widely used in divination. Under the guidance of Zhiji, Lu Yu learned the art of tea and later completed the "Chajing", with the help of Caligraph Yan Zhenqing, poet and monk Jiaoran and the governor of Jiangsu Province.</description><pubDate>2025-06-05 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Macao and Antwerp present “surrealism of the golden city”</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/macau-antuerpia-apresentam-surrealismo-da-cidade-dourada/</link><description>On the weekend, the multicultural project “Surrealistic Chinoiserie: Golden City of Seres”, from Art for All Society, will arrive in Antwerp in order to bring viewers in a “journey through desire, technology and cultural symbolism”.

Art for All Society (AFA) will debut the “Surrealistic Chinoiserie: Golden City of Seres” in Antwerp, from June 7-8, in a mix of visual art, dance, music and clothing design, in order to create a “journey through desire, technology and cultural symbolism”. The term "Golden City" evokes the transformation of Macao from Historical Port to "Cotai Strip", according to AFA.
O público vai poder apreciar o trabalho de Leong Chi Mou, através do qual o artista visual explora a ideia de um “novo tipo de seda”, com pinturas de acrílico sobre latão e aço. The co-realized and choreographed performances by Jay Zhang and Tina Kan will integrate Dunhuang-inspired forms with contemporary ballet, echoing “the cultural reconstruction of Leong's work”.
In the key pieces “Serica-Diamond Hill” and “Serica-Auspicious Drone”, a “familiar and strange” landscape will be represented from a traditional scenario with surveillance and drone images, according to a statement from the association.
Inspired by crystalline structures and cyborg shapes, the futuristic helmets of designer Mandy Cheuk "imagine the game between body and technology," while the song by composer Faye Choi and the flutist Iris Lo mixes "Eastern Tones with Western Electronic Textures."
The project also recognizes the initial guidance of Belgian artistic director Dirk Decloedt, with the support of Florence Fong production. For AFA, the work seeks to create “new artistic vocabularies” and spaces for reflection, by establishing a bridge between the surrealism inspired by Magritte and the cultural identity of Macau.
The association also reported that, next December, Parisian will receive the project organized by AFA, sponsored by the Culture Development Fund and supported by Antwerp French Salons.</description><pubDate>2025-06-05 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Concerts require more efforts for intellectual property</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/concertos-requerem-mais-esforcos-pela-propriedade-intelectual/</link><description>The Association of Macao Composers, Authors and Editors met with the Economics and Technological Development and Customs Services, to discuss the reinforcement of the protection of intellectual property and the promotion of the legal use of the rights of musical authors
 
The Association of Macao (Maca, English acronym) composers, authors and editors recently visited the Directorate of Economics and Technological Development Services (DSEDT) and Customs Services (SA), in order to “reinforce the protection of intellectual property” and “promote the legal use of musical copyright”.
The Maca Executive Director thanked DSEDT for the “consistent efforts” in promoting awareness of intellectual property and supporting the association's work. Ung Kuoc Iang noted that a growing number of world -renowned artists have been performing shows in the MSAR, something that has boosted growth in related industries and benefited to small and medium -sized local businesses.
However, Ung Kuoc Iang drew attention to “the management of the author's copyright in Macau”, in order to “better serve music users and safeguard the rights of creators”.
Cheang Hio Man, DSEDT's interim director, praised the association's efforts, with which he discussed the direction of intellectual property development in the deepened cooperation zone in Hengqin.
During the meeting with the SA, Ung Kuoc Iang thanked the body for the “longstanding commitment” in increasing public awareness “about respect for intellectual property”. The director also highlighted the fact that the theme of World Intellectual Property Day was the “IP and Music: Feel the Beat of Ip”.
“As Macao strives to settle as a“ city of the show's arts ”,” the same responsible, “intellectual ownership and musical rights systems have increasingly attracted the attention of collective management organizations and music creators abroad.”
According to the Association of Macao Composers, Authors and Editors, most concert organizers in the territory now reveal a “relatively high awareness of copyright”, something attested by the fact that they obtain musical execution licenses in advance. From the perspective of the association, this “safeguard the legal rights of music creators” and “guarantees the good execution of concerts”.
Both parties also debated worldwide trends in the development of intellectual property and ways to improve the public understanding of copyright.
In a statement, Maca stresses to be confident that “joint efforts between government and industry” further reinforces the protection framework of intellectual property. The association also believes that there will be "balanced progress in economic development and intellectual property."

The government announced yesterday the reinforcement of the budget for 2025, a change that articulates with the lines of government action that will allow the “payment of essential expenses” for the current year. Following the budgetary amendment, the total amount of MSAR expense becomes 116.2 billion patacas, an increase of about 2.5% compared to the initially planned (113.38 billion). Already the revenue of the ordinary budget decreases about 3.8% -from 121.09 to 116.5 billion -, driven by the low revision of the game's gross revenues, according to Ho in Mui, the subdirect of finance services at the Executive Council press conference.
The spokesman for the Executive Council, in turn, indicated that a cut in the forecast of gross casinos revenues were made, "after studying and analyzing the current global economic conjuncture and the effective situation of exploitation of the game sector since the beginning of this year." In particular, André Cheong has revealed that the estimate is now that gross revenues from the game for the year 2025 are reduced from 240 billion to 228 billion patacas, a break of 12 billion or 5%.
The low review arrives a day after it was known that the game hit a postpandeia record in May, with revenues to be cheered at 21.19 billion, although it is traditionally one of the strong months, as it is associated with the golden week of Labor Day. The subdirector of the DSF explained, however, that the cut in the forecast was based on the results verified between January and April, which were lower in the annual comparison. “In the second half of the year, there will be uncertainties, but in this budget we intended to have a balance in expense and revenue, and I think we got it,” said Ho in Ma.
According to data from the Game Inspection and Coordination Directorate, in the general five months of 2025, the game's revenues totaled about 97.71 billion of patacas, translating an annual increase of 1.7% and equivalent to 77.7% of the amount accounted for between January and May 2019.
The scrambles now made in the budget aimed at the outset “the effective implementation of the government's various policies and measures” for this year, and an increase in the budget in relation to subsidies attributed to vulnerable groups, ”said André Cheong. But there are other expenses to note: for example, the construction of the University of Macau campus (one) in Hengqin and investment in research and scientific and technological development.
According to the authorities, there is therefore a reduction in budgetary expenses under the Administration Investment and Development Plan (PIDDA), which are magazines for 19.5 billion, marking a slight breakage.
 
UM CAMPUS will cost 8.4 billion Patacas
Regarding the UM campus, the budget registration for this year is 1.75 billion patacas, according to the subdirector of the DSF. "According to the information provided by UM, the expense is six years, goes until 2030. The total cost is about 8.4 billion patacas," said Ho In Ma.
It is recalled that the government intends to create in Hengqin a university campus of international level, and one will be the first local university to settle, then followed others, such as the University of Tourism. This was one of the integrated measures in the SAM Hou Fai Executive's government lines, along with the highest investment in research and high technology.
Regarding scientific and technological investment, 340 million were registered for this year, said Ho in Ma. "In particular for the acquisition of laboratory devices, etc. Thus, we can satisfy the policy of the Government of MSAR," he added.
The DSF subdirector also revealed that the authorities are already conducting the budget for 2026. "All services need to consider more expenses, especially in the face of the current conjuncture. We have to have a more saving mindset and prudent using the public purse," he said, recalling that it has been in recent years.
 
Pecuniary check “is an important policy”
The Secretary for Administration and Justice did not answer yesterday directly to the question of whether the pecuniary reimbursement plan may be extinguished in the future, stressing that it is a provisional measure, however, pointed to the importance of the measure. "Although it is not a permanent measure, (…) is an important policy for the population, which can increase the happiness rate and improve well-being," André Cheong said, on the fringes of an Executive Council press conference, adding that "the Government of MSAR will surely listen to public opinions in order to improve the plan." Last week, changes were announced to the attribution of the pecuniary check, and a requirement of permanence of at least 183 days was introduced. The check will be granted in July, with permanent residents receiving 10,000 patacas and non -permanent 6,000.</description><pubDate>2025-06-04 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Foundless womanless woman coming out of sewage in the Philippines</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/lazer/encontrada-mulher-sem-abrigo-sair-de-esgoto-nas-filipinas/</link><description>A woman who was seen to crawl frighteningly out of a sewage in the Philippines was found and received help from the government - her sad situation triggered a discussion about the lack of urban housing in one of Southeast Asia's greatest growth countries.
Following instructions from Filipino President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., a team from the Ministry of Social Welfare, was able to locate “Rose” in a favela and led her to a “processing center” to “undergo a complete evaluation and appropriate intervention”.
Rose's photographs crawl out of a narrow sewage pipe on a busy corner in the late afternoon of May 26 in the city of Makati-her dirty-dirted dress and her hair stained-leaf hair and dry leaves-became viral.
These images caused shock and fun, with many comparisons to a Japanese horror movie about a ghostly killer trying to escape a deep well. But they also triggered lit discussions about the homeless people living in a underground world under shining financial districts such as Makati, in a country that has shown an average growth of 5% to 7% per year.
Philippine Social Welfare Minister Rex Gatchalian introduced Rose to journalists and said the ministry would give him 80,000 pesos (almost 12,000 patacas) so that he could open a store of various articles in the neighborhood. The ministry will also help your partner, who has welding skills, but is unemployed and is also a homeless, finding a job, said Gatchalian.
This gesture, however, was received with skepticism.
"But is it an entire community! Why do you choose a palliative solution?"
Rocky Galman, who lives in Brisbane, said about the same topic: "It's good to help people who need it, but first you need to educate them, ensure housing and food and then give them the opportunity to work or start a business. If you give them money without adequate education/training, you will be missed."
Others even throbbed the effort.
"Maybe come home in the Philippines, and look for a sewage to get 80,000 to start a business," said Charise Penafiel, who works in Hong Kong.
When he was presented by the minister to the press, Rose said she was not living inside the sewage. He said he crawled into the hole because he had dropped a "cut blade" into him.
Makati police spokeswoman Jenibeth artist, however, told GMA News that homeless as Rose used sewage as a point of entry and exit for networks that act as underground passages.
William Roberts, amateur street photographer who first took Rose's photographs, said in an Instagram post that found one end of this tunnel system along a stream that its users dubbed "Botanical Garden."
He said he had talked to a man, Jerwin, who found out of a sewage pipe. He said, Jerwin said to him, "We do not live in the channels. We hide in them from the Sun, the police, sometimes to hide the little we have, sometimes to keep each other safely."
Roberts said the story of Rose and Jerwin "it's about the cracks we cover with concrete, the faces we ignore when they crawl out the channel."
There are more than three million homeless people in the Manila Metropolitan area-an extensive metropolis with 16 cities and a combined population of about 14 million.
They live in tents, makeshift carts, known colloquially by "Kariton", and anywhere they find shelter - by the road, in cemeteries and apparently sewage and sewage tunnels.
The Borgen Project - a non -profit organization based in the US - said that extreme poverty, domestic violence, human trafficking and natural disasters are the factors that often lead to the lack of housing in the Philippines.
