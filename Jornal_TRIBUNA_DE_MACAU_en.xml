In a retrospective of Macau's development, the Chief Executive said yesterday, at the reception commemorating the 26th anniversary of the Macao SAR, that “the great practice of the principle of ‘one country, two systems’ has achieved enormous success in this promising land that is Macau”. Sam Hou Fai went further and, in the speech he gave, he even said that “this ‘pearl in the palm of the motherland’, ‘precious land of the motherland’ that gains shine day after day, is more vibrant than ever and opening a phase of development unparalleled in its history”.
“We are deeply aware that the country’s prosperity and strengthening are the source of our confidence and Macau’s firm support to maintain long-term prosperity and stability,” he continued, in front of around a thousand guests. Highlights in attendance were the vice-president of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Edmund Ho, the director of the Liaison Office of the Central Government in the MSAR, Zheng Xincong, the former Chief Executive, Ho Iat Seng, the commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China in the MSAR, Liu Xianfa, the commander of the Macau Garrison of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Yu Changjiang, the president of the Legislative Assembly, André Cheong, and the president of the Court of Final Appeal, Song Man Lei.
Previously, the flag-raising ceremony to commemorate the 26th anniversary of the Macao SAR had been held at Praça Flor de Lótus, which was attended by the holders of the Macao SAR's main positions, among other personalities. On the occasion, secondary school students sang the national anthem and there was also a sporting spectacle after the raising of the flags.
At the reception, Sam Hou Fai recalled that on this day last year, President Xi Jinping urged Macau to “fly higher and go further to achieve greater successes”. “These instructions are of great significance as they encourage us to continue the fight with commitment to take a new leap and to create new splendid successes”, he stressed. He also recalled that, recently, he was in Beijing, with Xi, who “expressed full recognition, guidance and encouragement for the new progress achieved throughout the year by the Macao SAR”. Furthermore, the Chinese leader “gave Macau affectionate attention and great expectations”.
Emphasizing that during the past year the Macao SAR Government “united and led all social sectors in the in-depth implementation of the spirit enshrined in the important speeches” of Xi during his visit to Macau, Sam Hou Fai noted, among others, that “the economy has recovered steadily, the trend towards the development of diversification of industries is positive and the construction of the Cooperation Zone in Hengqin has achieved new progress”.
Speaking at the Fourth Plenary Session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, he pointed out that it outlined the new plan for national development and the Central Government's proposals for the formulation of the 15th Five-Year Plan, also presenting “a strategic and important plan for the future development of the Macao SAR, which provides enormous new opportunities and political impetus for its development”. “Macau will, in compliance with the important instructions of (…) President Xi, articulate itself more actively with the national development strategy, prepare and implement well the 3rd Five-Year Plan of the Macao SAR, achieve greater successes in the new journey of serving the construction of a great country and national revitalization”, he guaranteed.
 
Priorities for the future
Sam Hou Fai continued by saying that, “faced with the challenges posed by unprecedented transformations in a hundred years, we must have firm confidence, liberalize thinking, keep up with the times, reform firmly, identify, manage, actively seek alternatives and open a new situation in the midst of change”.
In this sense, he promised that he will, together with his government team, “persist in thinking based on the assumptions of the most unfavorable situations, with the safeguarding of national security as the first principle”. “We must consolidate the firm barrier in favor of safeguarding the country’s sovereignty, security and development interests, improve the legal regime for the defense of national security and the respective enforcement mechanism”, he argued, adding that it is equally necessary to “comprehensively implement the principle of ‘Macau governed by patriots’ to strengthen the foundations of love for the country and for Macau”.
He also said that they will persist in promoting the reform of Public Administration, in establishing a modernized legal system, in consolidating the foundation of governance in grassroots bodies, in fully increasing the efficiency of governance and in building a government oriented to serve the population, “integrity, efficient and proactive”.
“We will persistently focus our efforts on overcoming the obstacles identified in the adequate diversification of Macau’s economy”, he further assured. Sam Hou Fai further admitted that both he and his team are “fully aware that promoting adequate diversification of the economy represents a profound transformation of the economic ecosystem, requiring resolute progress”.
The “Macau+Hengqin” integration could not be left out. In this field, the leader of the Macao SAR said that he will keep the original intentions in mind, pointing to the acceleration of the construction of the Deep Cooperation Zone in Hengqin.
On the other hand, Sam Hou Fai observed that “a dynamic Macau is intrinsically linked to the vitality of its communities”. Thus, he promised to continue to drive the economic revitalization of communities, supporting the innovation of small and medium-sized companies and the transformation and modernization of traditional industries, “ensuring that the benefits of development reach every corner of the city”.
 
“Brightest” bridge between East and West
He also assured that the Macao SAR will “better integrate” into the national development situation, “proactively” aligning itself with the 15th National Five-Year Plan. “We will continuously expand our international network of partners, acting appropriately as a ‘precise interlocutor’ between China and Portuguese and Spanish-speaking countries, transforming Macau into a higher-level platform for openness to the outside world,” he said, adding: “In this way, Macau, as a bridge between East and West, will be able to shine with renewed splendor in the new era and contribute to the country’s high-quality openness to the outside world.”
“Welcoming even more qualified professionals from all over the world” is another of Sam Hou Fai’s objectives. “We will seek to make Macau a hub that brings together qualified professionals from near and far, promoting an influx of innovation and wisdom”, he stated.
"The fundamental objective of development is to ensure that our citizens live in peace and work happily. We are sparing no effort to respond to the daily needs that citizens are most concerned about", he considered, adding that, in 2026, government action "will place even more emphasis on people-oriented policies".
Sam Hou Fai also highlighted that “the future of Macau rests on the young generation”. In this sense, he assured that they will continue “to create conditions and provide platforms for young people to showcase their talents, helping them to achieve their personal aspirations”.
"The wind blows for those who know how to navigate. In this new historical situation, although challenges lie ahead, the path is paved with unlimited opportunities resulting from integration and service to national development", added the Chief, almost at the end of the speech. In conclusion, Sam Hou Fai stated that he will join efforts to “build a Macau where government administration is more efficient, the democratic rule of law is more robust, economic development is more dynamic, cultural appeal is more intense, social governance is refined and the well-being of our people is more inclusive”.</description><pubDate>2025-12-21 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Viaduct project between Zones A and B seeks “balance”</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/projecto-viaduto-entre-zonas-procura-equilibrio/</link><description>The viaduct project between Zones A and B will move forward, with the Chief Executive indicating that the design is being improved.

The Chief Executive said yesterday that the Government “is improving the design” of the viaduct project between Zones A and B, “in accordance with the requirements of the World Heritage Protection Center”, with the objective being to find a “balance” between heritage and the need for transport. Sam Hou Fai was speaking on the sidelines of the reception commemorating the 26th anniversary of the Macao SAR when he also assured that the Executive maintains an “open attitude” towards society’s opinions.
“In April, I already mentioned that the Public Works Services are carrying out the design on the viaduct between Zones A and B, and the Government will maintain an open attitude to listen to the public's opinions, with the aim of resolving in the long term the demand for travel between Zone A and the Peninsula and at the same time contemplating the protection of cultural heritage”, said Sam Hou Fai in statements to journalists.
Recalling that this year marked the 20th anniversary of the inscription of the Historic Center of Macau as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the Macao SAR leader stressed that “protecting the Historic Center is an important mission”. Sam Hou Fai pointed out that the Social Affairs and Culture department, led by Secretary O Lam, “is maintaining close contact with the State Administration of Cultural Heritage of China and the World Heritage Protection Center”.
The objective, Sam stressed, is “to ensure the continuation of Macau's advantages of cultural fusion between East and West and play Macau's role as a platform for the integration of Eastern and Western cultures in the Asia-Pacific region and even throughout the world”.
It is recalled that, although the viaduct between Zones A and B of the New Landfills follows the “hill-sea-city” principle, the UNESCO World Heritage Committee considered that part of the project could violate height restrictions in the Guia Lighthouse area, having urged the Macao SAR to carry out a “comprehensive environmental impact assessment” and submit “detailed documentation”. A month later, in August this year, the Cultural Institute said it was following UNESCO's request.
Yesterday, the Chief Executive also noted that Zone A of the New Landfills will accommodate more than 100 thousand inhabitants, and it is “necessary” to build access between this new zone and the Peninsula. “The transport and public works department is studying a connection via the Light Rail,” he stated.
In the Lines of Government Action for 2026, the Secretary for Transport and Public Works once again addressed the Metro development plan, indicating that an extension to Coloane is planned. Raymond Tam also spoke about the various lines, including the Southern Line, which could connect the Macau border post at Ponte do Delta to the ES5 station in Zone A, passing through NAPE, lot A9 in Nam Van, Sai Van and Barra.</description><pubDate>2025-12-21 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Concessionaires have already allocated thousands of employees to satellite casinos</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/concessionarias-ja-alocaram-milhares-de-funcionarios-dos-casinos-satelite/</link><description>The process of closing the satellite casinos took place “smoothly”, with between 3,000 and 4,000 employees having already been “allocated to new jobs”, out of a total of almost six thousand, according to the Chief Executive. Sam Hou Fai said that “so far no complaints have been received”. Meanwhile, the Secretary for Economy and Finance highlighted that the areas surrounding the satellite casinos are being improved. Regarding foreign players in casinos, Tai Kin Ip said that “there is still no data”, considering that this information must be treated “in a very prudent way”

Between 3,000 and 4,000 employees of satellite casinos hired by gaming concessionaires “have already been allocated new jobs and, so far, no complaints have been received”, said the Chief Executive in statements on the sidelines of the Macao SAR's anniversary reception.
Speaking to the media at the end of the ceremony, Sam Hou Fai highlighted that “for six months, the process of closing the satellite casinos ran smoothly and, according to the law, concessionaires have the responsibility to take measures”, therefore, “employees will be transferred according to their employment preference”. The Macao SAR leader highlighted that several job matching sessions were organized with gaming operators.
Referring specifically to L’Arc, he stressed that “this satellite casino will now be operated by one of the concessionaires, as defined in the gaming law”. SJM, remember, acquired the property to manage that gaming space.
It is recalled that the 11 satellite casinos that existed in the territory were ordered to close before the end of this year, when the “transition period” provided for by the Gaming Law ends, and the issue of affected workers raised concerns.
This decision affects 5,600 local workers employed in the satellite casinos, of which 4,800 are directly hired by the gaming concessionaires and 800 by the satellite casinos themselves. There were also 400 non-resident workers in these spaces.
Also on the sidelines of the reception held at the Service Platform Complex for Commercial Cooperation between China and Portuguese-speaking Countries, the Secretary for Economy and Finance addressed the issue of satellite casinos, focusing on aspects of improving the areas where the spaces were located.
“We are paying a lot of attention to the closure of the satellite casinos and also to the transformation of the surrounding area”, said Tai Kin Ip, adding that recently some commercial associations in those areas were consulted by the Government.
As a consequence, “we have already implemented some measures to improve the environment in these areas, as in ZAPE, and in the interaction between the different areas, having made some improvements to these structures, for example the crossings, as we have widened the crossings, to try to attract more customers to these areas”, he mentioned.
On the other hand, “the Government has listened to commercial entrepreneurs in these areas and promoted various activities, such as Iluminar Macau, and also Christmas events at ZAPE”. For Chinese New Year, and also in March, “other initiatives are planned to attract more customers”, he revealed.
In addition to these improvements, Tai Kin Ip recalled that licenses for terraces were given to stores and opinions and suggestions were heard to determine how these measures would be accepted. “We will improve the transformation and be very attentive to the situation of these stores to improve the entire business environment”, he noted.
Meanwhile, asked if there are numbers related to foreign players in casinos and the benefits for operators that have these international bettors, as well as investments in non-gaming elements, the Secretary was short in his response. “We still don’t have data on foreign players and we can’t disclose this information yet,” he said, stressing that “this is information that we must treat very cautiously.”
 
Real estate tax exemption comes into effect on January 1st
The measure exempting stamp duty on transfers of assets up to the value of six million patacas will come into force on January 1, 2026 in the acquisition of autonomous housing units by elderly residents, said yesterday the Secretary for Economy and Finance. Tai Kin Ip also highlighted that, regarding the increase in the maximum mortgage loan ratio limit of 80% for local buyers, it will also be implemented next year, promising to release information soon. Regarding the recipients, priority will be “those of legal age, residents of Macau, who can benefit from these requests”. The measure, he added, “aims to alleviate the financial burden of people who want to purchase properties and also support the real estate sector”.</description><pubDate>2025-12-21 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Social changes motivate review of the anti-corruption law</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/mudancas-sociais-motivam-revisao-da-lei-anti-corrupcao/</link><description>The Commissioner against Corruption stated yesterday that it is necessary and appropriate to comprehensively review the Law on the Prevention and Repression of Corruption in the Private Sector, so that this diploma can adapt to social changes. In addition to noting discrepancies that exist between this legal regime and some international conventions and relevant laws from neighboring regions, Ao Ieong Seong pointed out that several cases of bribery in the private sector uncovered by the CCAC in recent years have attracted widespread attention in society
 
In the Lines of Government Action for 2026, the Commissioner against Corruption (CCAC) said that it will study the Law on the Prevention and Repression of Corruption in the Private Sector, with a view to presenting, “in a timely manner”, “relevant” revision proposals. Ao Ieong Seong, Commissioner against Corruption, yesterday defended the need to review the diploma comprehensively, so that this legal regime adapts to social changes.
On the sidelines of the reception for the 26th anniversary of the establishment of the Macao SAR, the Commissioner was asked whether the plan to revise the law is related to the bribery cases involving resort workers in recent years and about the concrete directions of the revision. Ao Ieong Seong noted that the law has been in force for more than 15 years, a period in which Macau's economy and social conditions have undergone profound changes.
Furthermore, he pointed out that the CCAC has uncovered, in recent years, several cases of bribery in the private sector, which attracted widespread attention in society, especially the impacts of corrupt conduct in the private sector on employment rights and interests and fair competition.
In this regard, the Commissioner also noted that there are relatively significant discrepancies between this diploma and some international conventions and relevant laws from neighboring regions, considering that, at the current stage, it is appropriate to carry out a comprehensive review of the law.
 
CCAC investigates complaint related to special taxis
On the other hand, on the same occasion, the Commissioner was asked whether the CCAC will investigate special taxis, following the report by the Audit Commissioner which revealed “several problems” on the part of the Directorate of Services for Traffic Affairs (DSAT) in supervising the services of these taxis and whether the former director of DSAT will be the subject of an investigation.
According to Ao Ieong Seong, the CCAC received the complaint about the matter and, as necessary, has already opened an investigation. The Commissioner stated that the CCAC will investigate this case through the ombudsman's office, to mainly investigate whether there were administrative infractions, insufficient supervision or institutional gaps during the supervision process.
Ao Ieong Seong said that the company monitors whether there was negligence on the part of staff in the case, ensuring that the CCAC pays attention and highlighting that an in-depth investigation is still needed to reach a conclusion. According to him, so far, there is no information that can be revealed.
Furthermore, the CCAC received a complaint involving the termination of the subsidy to the Smart Nursery daycare center, of Zonta Club de Macau, by the Social Action Institute. The Commissioner pointed out that the case is still in the investigation phase and that the CCAC noted that the daycare center had filed a lawsuit.
Promising that the CCAC will investigate the case as quickly as possible, Ao Ieong Seong emphasized that the CCAC's investigation work will not affect the validity of the administrative contracts and administrative acts themselves. As he indicated, the daycare center submitted a lot of information to the CCAC, which will be duly analyzed.</description><pubDate>2025-12-21 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Under-15 team achieves two victories in the East Asian Championship</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/seleccao-de-sub-15-consegue-duas-vitorias-campeonato-da-asia-oriental/</link><description>In the space of a month, two teams from Macau's youth football ranks participated in Asian competition qualifiers. First there were the under-17s, whose best results were a draw and a victory. Now it's the turn of the under-15s, who have won both matches played so far in the qualifying phase for the East Asian Championship, against Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands, facing Taiwan tomorrow

The under-15 football team is making a name for itself in qualifying for the East Asian Championship, which is taking place in the Chinese city of Zhangzhou, in the province of Fujian.
The Macau youngsters made their debut against Guam and won 5-0, with a minimal lead at half-time, with a goal scored by Wong Tak Chon, in the 26th minute, dominating their opponent and creating the greatest number of opportunities throughout the 70 minutes of the match.
The superiority of the “kids” led by Iong Cho Ieng took on the form of a rout in the second half, highlighting the two goals scored in that period by Wong Tak Chun, who scored a hat-trick. The rest were written by Leong Hou Teng and Chan Ion Hei.
Motivated by the triumph in the first round of Group B of the competition, the Macao SAR team won again in the second round, this time against the Northern Mariana Islands, by two goals to zero, with goals from Leong Hou Teng (in the 30th minute) and Wu Chi Him (66). The match took place in the main stadium of the Zhangzhou sports complex, unlike the previous one which took place in one of the secondary fields.
With these results, the under-15 team is in the fight for first place in the series, but to do so they will have to defeat Taiwan in the final match, to be held tomorrow, Monday, at 10:10 am, again in one of the complex's secondary venues.
The opponent is considered the main candidate to advance in the competition, having comfortably beaten the Northern Mariana Islands in their first meeting, 10-0. Therefore, a game of greater difficulty than the previous ones is expected.
Regardless of the result, the under-15s have already achieved an unusual feat in international competitions, beating two opponents.
In addition to the competitive component, this type of competition serves to offer experience to players who rarely have the opportunity to face teams from abroad and who are practically limited to playing only in the domestic league, organized by the Macau Football Association.
In addition to Wong Tak Chun's goalscoring streak, another member of the territory's team was in the spotlight: Leong Hou Teng, who despite being 15 years old, had already participated, weeks before, in the under-17 Asian Championship.
This qualifying phase, organized by the East Asian Football Federation, has four more teams in Group A, which includes China (hosts), Japan, South Korea and Hong Kong. In the games already played, the highlights are the two Japanese victories, 3-0 against China and 2-0 against the HKSAR.
As for the under-17 team, which was in Vietnam (Hanoi) participating in the category's Asian qualifiers, the higher level of demand was confirmed, due to the quality of the remaining teams.
Still, the team coached by Liu Kin Chou managed a 1-1 draw against Singapore, after having been winning until two minutes from the end, and a 2-0 victory against the Northern Mariana Islands. Furthermore, they recorded defeats in clashes with Hong Kong (2-0), Malaysia (5-0) and Vietnam (4-0).
The coach told TRIBUNA DE MACAU newspaper that the team underwent intensive preparation for almost 10 months, which has not been very usual in Macau national team work, including a training camp held in Portugal in the summer. Regarding the games, he highlighted that “the players showed a very good attitude and discipline”, adding that this level “is the future of Macau football”.
Liu Kin Chou says that he has been taking advantage of the qualities of these young people so that “they can play in a short time for the territory's senior team”.</description><pubDate>2025-12-21 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Sands program has already supported 4,700 SMEs</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/programa-da-sands-ja-apoiou-4-700-pme/</link><description>In 2015, Sands China launched a support program for local SMEs, together with the Commercial Association.

"Through a series of innovative support measures, including large-scale exhibition platforms, professional training and technical guidance, we have built a comprehensive support system to help SMEs improve their capabilities. Together, we have faced market changes and challenges side by side, forming a cooperative ecosystem of complementary strengths and mutual benefits," added Frederico Ma, quoted in a statement.

Regarding expectations for the government action of Sam Hou Fai's team in the future, the association noted that the residents interviewed “expect that the employment situation in Macau and the well-being of the population will improve”.
Currently, Lam Weng Ioi is the president of the association. It is recalled that, in the same period last year, specifically on the eve of the celebration of the 25th anniversary of the Macao SAR, the then “Macau People Power” Association published two “letters” on social media, allegedly “addressed to President Xi Jinping”. Specifically, the association called on Beijing to “pay attention to the voices of the Macau population” and defended the cancellation of Macau Foundation subsidies allocated to associations, so that these resources could be “transferred” to elderly residents.</description><pubDate>2025-12-21 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Sands brings fencing talents to Macau</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/sands-traz-macau-talentos-da-esgrima/</link><description>The Venetian's Cotai Expo will host the Asian youth fencing league for three days, from the 26th to the 28th of December, with athletes from various countries and continents, aged between eight and 20.

IAM installed three more garbage compressors
The Institute for Municipal Affairs (IAM) installed three new waste compression containers in three locations, specifically Praceta de 1 de Outubro, Rua Norte do Patane and Rua Marginal do Canal das Hortas. Thus, the number of garbage collection points in the city has increased to 135. Furthermore, there are less than 90 street trash bins in the city, a decrease of around 95% compared to the peak number of more than 1,600.

Next year, Macau will host the first major solo exhibition by Helena Almeida (1934–2018) in Asia, a retrospective of the internationally recognized artist. “Helena Almeida: I’m Here – Presence and Resonance” is an exhibition structured in two sections entitled “Presença” and “Resonance”, revealed the Cultural Institute (IC).
“Visitors will have the opportunity to witness the cultural dialogue between China and Portugal through around 42 sets, made up of 190 pieces by the artist”, can be read in a statement. The “Presence” section will present the artist’s works, which use the body as a medium.
In parallel, and with the aim of reinforcing the exchange of contemporary art between China and Portugal, the “Resonance” section was designed to “build a bridge of dialogue with the body of Helena Almeida’s work, preparing the way for the great retrospective”, adds the organization led by Leong Wai Man.
But, before that, the exhibition “Resonância – Corpo．Objecto．Reflexão” takes place as a prelude to the retrospective of the Portuguese artist. Six artists from Macau and Mainland China were invited to interact with Helena Almeida's work through recently commissioned works, “fostering a dialogue that transcends time and space”. This exhibition is now open to the public and runs until April 26, on the third floor of the Macau Museum of Art.
Artists Pang Yun, Wong Weng Io and Angel, Chan On Kei participated from Macau, while Min Han, Gao Fuyan and Sun Xiaoyu were invited from Mainland China. “With the body as a starting point, the artists investigate the limits of disciplines and subjectivity through the contemplation and deconstruction of symbols, authenticity and imagination, in response to the artistic philosophy of Helena Almeida”.
The works on display are consistent with the theme of the dialogue: Pang Yun explores the philosophy of materiality and eternity through a gilding ritual in Wu-Stone-Sardapass; whilst Wong Weng Io uses bodily dilemmas to metaphorize systemic violence and the cycle of self-silencing.
Angel, Chan On Kei, uses high heels as a metaphor to criticize the social discipline imposed by beauty standards. In turn, Min Han's drawings continue Helena Almeida's reflection on the presence of the body, expanding the individual experience to a cosmic scale.
In turn, “The Grid of the Mind”, by Gao Fuyan, embroidered with hair on paper, remotely mirrors Helena Almeida's concept of the body as an instrument, while Sun Xiaoyu adopts Helena Almeida's blue to expand the visual dialogue about existence and its borders through the eastern aesthetic practice of dissolving the “self” in the object.
Through these works, “the public can see how artists reinterpret the spirit of the European avant-garde and, as Helena Almeida revealed, recognize that the body, when placed in space, becomes simultaneously subject and medium, affirming its lasting influence on contemporary artistic creation”, says the IC.
The exhibition is organized by IC and co-organized by the School of Intermediate Art of the Chinese Academy of Art and the Macau Museum of Art. The Museum is open from 10am to 7pm, including on public holidays, and is closed on Mondays. Entry is free.</description><pubDate>2025-12-20 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>In a “year of transition”, Sam Hou Fai showed “discretion” and took “unconventional” measures</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/num-ano-de-transicao-sam-hou-fai-mostrou-discricao-tomou-medidas-pouco-convencionais/</link><description>Sam Hou Fai completes one year as head of the Government today, the day that also marks 26 years of the Macao SAR.

CATARINA PEREIRA, PEDRO MILHEIRÃO AND VÍTOR REBELO
 
Today marks the 26th anniversary of the transfer of Macau to China, in 1999, and also the first year of the mandate of the current Chief Executive, Sam Hou Fai, who replaced Ho Iat Seng, the only Chief who until then served only five years in office. The newspaper TRIBUNA DE MACAU tried to understand with several personalities – Amélia António, Frederico Rato, José Luís de Sales Marques, Rui Pedro Cunha, Kou Seng Man and Lao Pun Lap – how they saw this first year of Sam Hou Fai, with many highlighting the fact that one year is not enough time to make accurate assessments. Despite everything, they highlighted the changes in the Government and guidelines, the “care and discretion in carrying out the role” and the fact that they did not hesitate to take “unconventional” measures.
There were also those who highlighted the “expectations” created by the fact that Sam Hou Fai was the first Chief who does not come from the business world, and those who considered that the Macao SAR leader and his team lived up to expectations in this first year in office. In the same vein, it was also said that the “initial results” in terms of adequate diversification prepared “a solid basis for sustainable development”.
Lawyer Amélia António considers that it is “difficult” to evaluate results after a year in which “many changes” took place. "There are a lot of things that have changed, the Secretaries have changed, the guidelines... The results of any new guidelines are not yet tangible, so it is very difficult to evaluate. It was a year of transition, a calm year, with many changes at the top level of the different areas and the results are not yet very visible", he began by telling the TRIBUNA DE MACAU newspaper.
In her opinion, “the rotation of positions, in principle, can be expected to bring benefits, as all the people involved are people with a very high technical preparation and who know Macau well, and, therefore, this creates positive expectations, but to say that there are results I think it is still early”, reiterated the lawyer.
Regarding the differences she observes compared to previous Chief Executives, Amélia António pointed to the work related to Macau-Ilha da Montanha integration. "I think that there is fundamentally a great commitment to the relationship between Macau and Hengqin. I systematically notice an effort to get as many people as possible to live, to want to invest, to look and think about Hengqin, but I believe that the result of this is not very visible", he observed, saying that there are still no "benefits" for Macau from this relationship.
“I admit that this could be Macau's growth path, but how it will have to be developed seems still very unclear to me (…) For Macau to actually grow, it seems to me that Macau should have a more active voice in the management of this space, and what we feel is that Macau has a very secondary voice”, he argued.
For Amélia António, the combination of different administrative and legal systems does not seem to be “very functional”. "If Macau is to grow, there would have to be management that is more in line with Macau's legal system. It is not very easy to explain and more difficult to put into action, but I think that this growth would have to have a greater influence on Macau to become effective. Otherwise, people also feel lost between two worlds", he stressed.
Despite there being a lot of investment on the other side of the border, the lawyer observes that, on this side, “a period that is not easy” is going through. "In terms of local commerce, the pressure is very great and access to cheaper consumer goods through Taobao, etc. does not allow local commerce to balance itself. There are a lot of problems here that I think need a deeper analysis, deeper measures. And perhaps there hasn't been enough time yet to resolve all of this, which is why it's a little early to take stock", he continued.
Asked whether greater attention should be paid to local commerce to the detriment of integration in Hengqin, Amélia António replied that “perhaps greater coordination is needed”. "The imbalance between one thing and another is very large and to consider that it is a growth zone in Macau there needs to be a greater balance. There is talk of very large numbers of tourists entering Macau, but residents go away at the weekend to have access to a whole range of goods, and these numbers of tourists do not translate into trade, into benefits for Macau".
Regarding the Portuguese community, the president of Casa de Portugal in Macau admitted that Sam Hou Fai “is friendly and always says some nice words, but in practical terms things are not moving forward”. Specifically, Amélia António spoke of the need to find a solution, since since August 2023 restrictions have been imposed on the attribution of the BIR to Portuguese citizens.
"We need to look at the importance of having people in Macau who contribute to greater use of the language, to greater transmission of knowledge at various levels, whether cultural or artistic, everything that contributes to the identity of Macau. The Portuguese community and other Portuguese-speaking communities are very important in Macau if the territory is to truly have an identity different from Zhuhai or Shenzhen", considered Amélia António, adding: "If we let this presence disappear, if we let it erase everything that contributes to making Macau different, interest in Macau cannot be reduced exclusively to coming to see casinos, which are also decreasing”.
Amélia António stressed that, if there is no “effort, support”, “we are contributing to losing interest in Macau and I don’t think that is useful”. “Integration does not have to involve disappearing, erasing what is different”, he reiterated. In this sense, the association leader argues that “if they do not want to grant or facilitate access to the BIR, it is necessary to find a more expeditious formula for accessing another type of authorization”. And it should not only happen to qualified staff, but also to other professionals who do not have such superior academic levels, he stated.
 
“Discreet” but “affirmative” first year
Recognizing that a year in office is a relatively short time to make a comprehensive assessment, Frederico Rato considers that it has been “a mandate to initiate the exercise of constitutional powers, discreet but affirmative, with calculated public exposure”, which allowed Sam Hou Fai to gain visibility among the population.
In an interview with this newspaper, the Portuguese lawyer recognized the efforts made by Sam Hou Fai, among the citizens, having carried out several visits “to learn about the problems of the man on the street and to raise awareness of his image in public opinion, without prejudice to the day-to-day tasks of the position”. At the same time, “the Chief Executive has shown some care and discretion in carrying out his role, taking note of governance files, analyzing priorities, receiving people and representatives from institutions, defining profiles and selecting new leaders for positions and carrying out functions”.
Asked about the areas in which the Macao SAR leader intervened best or those he neglected, Frederico Rato reaffirmed that, in this initial phase of a five-year term, “any classification may appear premature”. “Political decisions of a structural nature are not compatible with initial or experimental timetables”. “All areas of intervention by the executive take the careful pace of raising problems and issues, studying and reflecting on alternatives and solutions and finally making decisions and implementing policy measures”, he defended.
Comparing Sam Hou Fai with the leaders who preceded him, Frederico Rato also said that it was “too early to collect specific and distinctive material from the exercise of the mandates of previous Chief Executives”.
“If Edmund Ho ensured the continuity and identity of Macau, under a new constitutional framework, with smooth adaptations, particularly in public revenues from gambling, Chui Sai On was the man of economic and social stability and some growth”, recalled the lawyer. “Ho Iat Seng was dynamic and confident in combating the pandemic, exploring the concept of ‘one country, two systems’, initiating greater consideration of the former”.
Sam Hou Fai, in turn, has shown himself to be “concerned with the area of ​​national security, the reform of Public Administration and the concrete adequate diversification of the economy”.
However, Frederico Rato regretted the lack of “special emphasis” given to issues of education, teaching, training, scientific research and development, support for innovation and technological advancement, which the lawyer considers to be “the best, largest and most reproductive areas of intervention for the present and the near future”.
Regarding relations between the Macao SAR and Portugal and the importance given to these ties by the leader of the Government, the lawyer recalled Sam Hou Fai's visit to the Consulate General of Portugal in Macau and Hong Kong, on the occasion of Portugal Day, an opportunity that the Chief Executive took advantage of to highlight Macau's role as a Sino-Lusophone platform.
“We hope to continue walking hand in hand towards a bright future, with new opportunities and platforms for strengthening cooperative relations between Lusofonia, China and the Macao SAR, so that, together, we continue to make history and promote, with 'ingenuity and art', a new scenario of development, commercial, economic and cultural exchange and cooperation”, recalled Frederico Rato, citing Sam Hou Fai's speech. “I couldn’t say better”, he emphasized.
The lawyer also pointed to the articulation with the Forum for Economic and Commercial Cooperation with China and Portuguese-Speaking Countries as “a privileged instrument for the development and execution of this political-economic desideratum”.
Regarding the Lines of Government Action for 2026, and more specifically the reform and restructuring of some public bodies, Frederico Rato argued that “public administration must be friendly to the citizen, the resident, the user and not a bureaucratic plot”. “It exists because of [the citizen] and for him”.
“It is from this perspective that the decision to reform public administration must be taken.” "It's a matter of vision and political-financial option. There are happy mergers and others not so much. There are divisions of administrative areas that work and others that fail", he emphasized.
“It can and should be discussed, for example, whether sporting performance has similarities with artistic performance and cultural production and decide what appears to be best for the citizen and most advisable in terms of allocation of human resources and public money, which are always scarce”, he argued, alluding to the merger of the Cultural Institute with the Cultural Development Fund and the Sports Institute.
Regarding the diversification of the economy, and in light of recent official data that indicate that, in 2024, the gaming sector will gain greater importance in the economic structure of the Macao SAR, Frederico Rato considers that “this is an economic reality and as a recipe to feed the region's budget it is a good fact in itself”. “What is not good is that this recipe increasingly tends to be the only one, which means that such dependence can mean insecurity, instability and consequent fragility”, he highlighted.
"The fact is that, in 1990, total revenue from gaming concessions represented around 40% of the financing of the territory's budget and this figure had already established 'diversification' as a watchword. Today, this number has risen to more than 80%", noted the lawyer.
 
Economy “remains vulnerable”
José Luís de Sales Marques, in turn, considers that in his first year as Chief Executive, Sam Hou Fai “demonstrates that he does not hesitate to take measures that in the context of Macau may seem unconventional”. It refers to the appointment of its then number two André Cheong to the Legislative Assembly (AL) as a deputy, subsequently elected as president of that body, and recently, on the 15th of this month, to the creation of the Local Development Center, a partnership between the Government and the General Union of the Residents' Association (“Kaifong”), to coordinate and articulate projects to boost historic neighborhoods, supervised by the “Kaifong”.
For the economist, these decisions aim, on the one hand, to “create greater coordination between Government and Assembly, under the leadership of the executive branch”, and on the other, “to make the implementation of practical measures and projects more efficient for the resuscitation of community economies in old neighborhoods and where tangible and intangible assets of historical and cultural heritage are located, measures and projects financed by the game's six concessionaires”.
These “unmistakable features” of Sam Hou Fai’s governance, “whose inauguration was marked by clear and guiding speeches from President Xi Jinping for the Macao SAR and the development of Hengqin, are clearly evident in the Lines of Government Action he announced for 2026, under the motto ‘Reform firmly, increase efficiency, face challenges together to promote diversification’”. “With strengthening the defense of national security as a top priority, this Government's reformist policies are already marking the reality of this region in public administration plans and economic policy options”, he highlights.
Under an international situation of “great complexity” and marked by the instability caused by North American trade policy, the Macao SAR economy “continues to recover”, with real GDP in the third quarter of this year approaching around 92.6% of the same level in 2019.
This is a “recovery driven by good results in the gaming sector, benefiting from the growing flow of tourists from Mainland China, with gross revenue last month reaching 21.1 billion patacas”, observes José Luís de Sales Marques, adding that, in this way, “initial concerns about their behavior were overcome, which led the recently installed Chief Executive to implement a budget change rectifying the fiscal revenue forecast of the Macao SAR budget for the current year, authored by the previous government team”.
Fortunately, he says, “the negative trend of the first semester is being corrected in the second, with the 2025 budget balances expected to reach significant amounts in the order of 20 billion patacas and that the Macao SAR's financial reserves will approach their historical maximum of 663.6 billion patacas, reached in February 2021”.
The economist emphasizes that despite the Macao SAR's fiscal health “being great”, its economy remains vulnerable, with “the imbalance visible” between the gaming and non-gaming sectors. “It is in the so-called community economy, the one that exists in neighborhoods and depends on traditional demand marked by territorial proximity, that such problems are most visible”, he observes.
Addressing the closure of satellite casinos, he states that the negative impacts on commerce and restaurants, located nearby, “have amplified this problem, whose root lies in the dualistic and almost parallel existence of the gaming and non-gaming sectors, so characteristic of the Macau economy and other economies that are too dependent on a single industry”.
Regarding the fact that Macau residents increasingly prefer to travel to neighboring mainland cities for weekly shopping and group meals, Sales Marques notes that “the new team is committed to structural reform of the sector, clearly refusing the distribution of consumption cards and similar palliatives, as they doubt their effectiveness”.
He adds that “the measures included in the 2026 LAG are to modernize the sector, increasing its competitiveness and support in promoting them to a wider audience, which includes tourists and online sales as well as the revitalization of historic neighborhoods, as mentioned at the beginning of this comment”.
Regarding the strengthening and consolidation of the Deep Cooperation Zone in Hengqin, “it receives new impetus”, he notes, speaking of “new measures aimed at strengthening the presence of Macau’s public administration on the island, the construction of campuses for several Macao SAR universities and the allocation of several ‘1+4’ economic diversification projects for that area”.
The clear bet of this Executive seems to be, in the opinion of the Macanese, in addition to investing in traditional Chinese medicine and the so-called “Big-Health”, the reinforcement of “modern finance”, which appears “well positioned to grow significantly, framed by new legislation, namely the Investment Funds Law that will come into force on January 1, 2026”. “It will be interesting to see what location is proposed for the park for scientific and technological research and industrial development announced in the LAG, and what its characteristics are”, he points out.
The reformist effort of this Executive also deserves attention in the analysis, "leading to the merger and reorganization of several public services, apparently driven by a perspective of organizational and economic rationality, but also by an effort to adopt operating models of public administration closer to those that already exist in other cities in the Greater Bay Area. This Executive presents a clear line of guidance towards strengthening the construction process in the Greater Bay Area, one of the major objectives of national development, which projects to become an integrated economic system by 2035, remember.”
The announcement of the creation of a cultural zone where a Museum of National Culture, a Center for Performing Arts and a Museum of Contemporary Art will be installed “are clear indicators of this Executive's desire to contribute to raising the quality of Macau's cultural and artistic offering, highlighting its distinct characteristic of a basis for multicultural dialogue”, he asserts.
Finally, “the design and implementation of the third five-year plan (2026-2030) will certainly mark a new cycle in the life of the Macao SAR, after more than twenty-five years since its establishment”, he concludes.
 
“Difference” created “expectation” of “drastic changes”
Meanwhile, Rui Pedro Cunha, executive vice-president of the European Chamber of Commerce of Macau, considers that, in this first year of governance, the new Chief Executive “has demonstrated a desire to make changes, but perhaps a year is too short a period of time to be able to assess the practical impact on society and the economy”. This Chief “makes a difference by being the first who does not come from the business world, and this difference has created the expectation of drastic changes in relation to the past, which are not yet very visible at the moment”, he points out.
Admitting that Macau “has old structural problems that remain unresolved and are not the responsibility of the current Government”, the also general director of the C&amp;C law firm, emphasizes that, on the one hand, the Macao SAR has “an excessive dependence on a single sector of activity, which was very successful and led to a situation of full employment for the local population”. As a consequence of this: “lack of human resources available to allow the development of other economic activities”.
On the other hand, “the success of the main economic sector created a comfortable standard of living for the population of Macau, who became very averse to change”. Consequence: “difficulty in attracting local workers to new sectors of activity, and extreme resistance from the population to any policy that facilitates the entry of human resources, for fear that they will compete with the local population”.
Thus, “if on the one hand the short-term vision demonstrated by the population is understandable, on the other hand what is expected of political power is that it has a strategic vision and takes the necessary measures for the development of Macau, even when these are unpopular, as only in this way will they be able to ensure the well-being of the population in the long term”.
Referring to what was said in the LAG, Rui Pedro Cunha mentions that the Chief Executive “establishes the objective of launching specific policies to attract qualified staff”, pointing out that if this “is followed consistently”, it is plausible to expect a “gradual reconfiguration of the image and economic role of Macau beyond the traditional sector”.
He continues his analysis by expressing that the “transition to an economy also seen as a center of specialized services and knowledge – whether in Education, Health, commercial mediation, in fintech niches or in cooperation platforms – will additionally depend on the creation of an agile, transparent and attractive regulatory environment for international investment”.
He who also holds the position of vice-president of the Rui Cunha Foundation emphasizes that “true openness” is built “less on declarations and more on solid institutions and efficient procedures that inspire external confidence”, adding that the recent start of the 3rd edition of the plan to recruit qualified staff “is a positive sign”. He hopes that the new features introduced will be enough to “effectively function as a plan to attract new qualified professionals, who are sorely lacking in Macau”.
He also defends the need for an “accurate selection”, as the talent plan is the first step towards obtaining residency. However, he says, “the fact that Macau spent a whole year without a working talent plan undermines international credibility and highlights that we may need a third option (other than resident status or non-resident worker status) to allow Macau to have the human resources it needs”.
Access to qualified staff “is not a sufficient condition for the development of the economy, but it is an essential condition”, he emphasizes. This policy, he continues, “could attract a more diverse and qualified flow of professionals, stimulating a demand for international education, cultural offerings, health services and other high-quality services”, and this movement, “if well managed”, could contribute to a “more cosmopolitan environment, without necessarily diluting Macau's unique identity”. The balance, he notes, “will be in ensuring that economic openness translates into tangible opportunities for the local population”.
For Rui Pedro Cunha, success will be measured by the ability to “convert intentions into lasting structural realities”, requiring “patient implementation and clear communication of the advantages for society and attention to internal balances”.
He argues that the direction to be taken, “if led with determination and realism”, could give Macau a “new relevance in the regional scenario and greater economic resilience, ensuring it a distinct and sustainable place in the decades to come”.
In conclusion, he highlights that the implementation of the four major works announced by the Chief Executive in 2025 (the science and technology park, the tourist and cultural district, the university city and the expansion of the airport) are structural projects that “have the potential to boost the development of the economy, and whose success also depends on the existence of qualified staff to make them work”.
 
Expectations met, but with “room for improvement”
This newspaper also interviewed Kou Seng Man, director of political research at the Institute of International Academic Research (Macau), who began by observing that the performance of the Chief Executive and his team in the first year of his mandate “met expectations”.
“After making a comparison between the Chief Executive's candidacy political program and the results of social development, I consider that the Chief Executive and his team basically implemented the candidacy philosophy dedicated to 'Working with an entrepreneurial spirit and moving forward together, persisting on the right path and focusing on innovation', announced in the political program, and effectively promoted the stable development of the Macao SAR,” commented Kou Seng Man.
For the academic in the field of Public Administration, last year, “with the strong support of the Homeland, the Macao SAR Government united sectors of society, achieving progress in many aspects”.
In 2025, “the principle of ‘Macau governed by patriots’ was implemented effectively, the reform of Public Administration achieved greater deepening, the economic recovery and adequate diversification of the economy gained steady progress, the construction of the Deep Cooperation Zone in Hengqin achieved new progress, the social and welfare works of the population were gradually optimized, regional cooperation was constantly strengthened, and the projects and programs of great importance registered an orderly development”, remembered.
Kou Seng Man highlighted that these results “led the Macao SAR to develop in a stable and progressive manner, with the main governance goals and tasks being basically materialized”.
However, the academic pointed out that, in the government action of the current Executive, there are still some areas with “room for improvement”, particularly those of society and population well-being, regional cooperation and the use of maritime areas. “For example, benefit policies should be biased towards vulnerable groups, in order to further increase residents’ feelings of happiness”, he argued.
Regarding cooperation with Hengqin, Kou Seng Man emphasized that “it is necessary to improve cadre policies in terms of training, return and import of cadres”. In addition, it understands that, based on the current “industrial transfer”, that is, the provision of land by Hengqin to Macau, the authorities should adopt innovative models such as “Registered in Macau + Produced in Hengqin” and “Research and development in Macau + Transformation in Hengqin”, in order to promote the in-depth synergistic development of the industries of the MSAR and Hengqin, allowing talents and industries to develop in parallel.
On the other hand, the academic from the Institute of International Academic Research (Macau) suggested that Sam Hou Fai's team “make good use” of the Macao SAR's 85 square kilometers of maritime areas, giving impetus to the development of the maritime economy.
 
“Solid foundation” prepared for sustainable development
In turn, Lao Pun Lap, president of the Macau Economic Association, noted that, in general, the Macao SAR economy achieved, in 2025, “initial results” in terms of adequate diversification, which “prepared a solid foundation for sustainable development”.
Heard by the newspaper TRIBUNA DE MACAU, the economist also commented that the 6th Macao SAR Government, in its opening year, guided by the compass “Innovate for Development, Move forward with commitment to a new situation”, “actively promoted economic recovery, stably promoted adequate diversification of the economy, guaranteed employment for residents and improved the business environment for small and medium-sized companies”.
According to the analysis, the Macao SAR economy achieved, in its 26th year of establishment, the most notable advances in four aspects, namely the “orderly promotion of industrial diversification”, “significant improvement in the business environment”, “the role of the ‘Working Group for the Coordination of Employment Promotion’ played” and “greater integration into the national development situation”.
For Lao Pun Lap, within the scope of industrial diversification, it is worth highlighting that, under the governance of Sam Hou Fai's team, the tourism sector had a “remarkable performance” in 2025, which is reflected in the annual increase of 14.5% in the volume of visitors in the first three quarters to more than 29.6 million and the “stable rise” in the number of international tourists.
Furthermore, the economist believes that Macau's ranking, for the first time, in first place in the ranking of the “10 Most Satisfactory Destinations for Chinese Tourists When Traveling Abroad” and the inclusion in the Global Muslim Travel Index also contributed to the “significant increase” in the international influence of MSAR tourism.
Regarding the traditional Chinese medicine and “Big Health” industries, it was noted that, based on the cooperation platform, the upgrading and transformation of the Chinese medicine industry were promoted and the establishment of renowned pharmaceutical companies in Macau was supported.
With regard to modern finance, the president of the Economic Association highlighted the “continuous innovation” of this emerging sector, associated with the legislative work ready for the Investment Funds Law, connection of the Macau bond market with Hong Kong and “proactive research and development” of digital pataca.
Regarding the cutting-edge technology industry, Lao Pun Lap recalled that 51 local companies have been certified as technology companies, while the “industry-university-research” mechanism “has been constantly optimized” and the preliminary proposal for the “Macao Science and Technology Research and Development Industrial Park” has been announced and has entered the consultation phase.
On the other hand, he highlighted that the conventions and exhibitions sector “has risen to the international stage”, with a total of 33 international convention events receiving authority recognition, which represents a year-on-year increase of 50%.
Regarding the “significant improvement in the business environment”, the economist argued that, this year, the development of Macau’s community economy received “multidimensional support”, with the “Great prize for consumption in community areas” stimulating consumption in excess of one billion patacas and the launch of the “Plan for Economic Development within the scope of Support for the Establishment of the First Store in Macau”. According to his observation, the support helped commercial establishments with their own characteristics in community neighborhoods to increase their competitiveness and visibility.
In the sphere of employment, the president of the Economic Association highlighted the “stability” of the job market in the Macao SAR, pointing out that the unemployment rate among residents “stood at just 2.4%” in the third quarter of this year, while companies were encouraged to “release more job vacancies for young people”.
With regard to integration into the national development situation, he considers that the “deepening” of the connection between the Macao SAR and Hengqin stands out, the role as a Sino-Lusophone platform “actively played”, the joint creation of the Center for Economic and Commercial Services between China and the Portuguese/Spanish speaking countries, synergistic attraction of investments and staff, as well as the strength contributed to the opening of the country to the outside world. high standard.</description><pubDate>2025-12-20 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Telecommunications law wants to simplify price regulation</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/lei-das-telecomunicacoes-quer-simplificar-regulamentacao-dos-precos/</link><description>CTT is consulting the telecommunications sector as part of the drafting of the new law proposal. In a session, some details about the purpose of this law were disclosed. For example, it has been said that it intends to simplify the regulation of service prices, as well as impose specific regulatory obligations on companies in the event that competition in the market is “insufficient”. On the other hand, it was also highlighted that the amount of fines will be “increased” and that companies must create a “compensation mechanism” in case of incidents that seriously affect services.

The Directorate of Postal and Telecommunications Services (CTT) is listening to the sector about the new Telecommunications Law, as part of the preparation of the proposal. In a clarification session for the sector, some details were revealed, namely that one of the objectives is to simplify the regulation of service prices, “so that telecommunications companies can respond more quickly to changes in the market”.
On the other hand, it was said that “specific regulatory obligations may be imposed on companies that have significant market power”, in cases where competition in the market is “insufficient”.
With regard to guaranteeing the rights and interests of consumers, a note from CTT states that companies must implement a “compensation mechanism” for users in the event of “an incident that seriously affects services”. In addition, “the amount of fines will be increased”, and a “pecuniary sanction” may also be applied in case of violation of legal standards by telecommunications companies.
According to what was announced, holders of existing licenses and concessionaires of telecommunications concession contracts can choose to transition to the new license within six months of the entry into force of the new law.
The Telecommunications Law aims to “create a comprehensive and future-oriented legal framework for the installation, management, operation of networks and provision of telecommunications services”, establishing a convergence regulatory regime centered on “technological neutrality”. Under the new regime, the installation of networks and the provision of services will be licensed independently, adopting an application regime.
In addition, network operators can accelerate the construction of public telecommunications networks by sharing passive infrastructure or leasing space in conduits and associated facilities to providers designated by the Macao SAR Government. Service providers, in turn, in cooperation with network operators, can develop new telecommunications services, either individually or in packages.
In the clarification sessions, the director of CTT, Derby Lau, stressed that the consultation, which runs until January 2, “constitutes an important part of the law drafting process”, thanking the different sectors for their participation. He also guaranteed that CTT will analyze opinions and suggestions, improving the proposed Telecommunications Law.
After years of advances and setbacks, according to the Government Action Lines report for 2026, the conclusion of the legislative process is now scheduled for the last quarter of next year. In 2019, although the Government consulted the sector on the new convergence regime, the proposed law was never presented. The presentation of the proposal for the new law was also scheduled for the second half of 2021. However, at the time, the Government ended up separating the processes of 5G licenses, the convergence regime and the control of concession assets.</description><pubDate>2025-12-20 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Cinemateca exceeded the objective of digitizing a thousand Portuguese films</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/lazer/cinemateca-ultrapassou-objectivo-de-digitalizacao-de-mil-filmes-portugueses/</link><description>The Cinemateca Portuguesa has already surpassed the objective of digitizing a thousand Portuguese cinema films, within the scope of the Recovery and Resilience Plan (PRR), and should reach 1,300 in the next quarter, the director, Rui Machado, told Lusa.
The Cinemateca Portuguesa, in Lisbon, symbolically marked the achievement of the goal defined in the PRR, with the screening of an excerpt from the thousandth digitized film, “Três Dias sem Deus” (1946), by Bárbara Virgínia, and with the announcement of an online page where data from all digitized films will be available. "We wanted to show that we fulfilled the measure within the established deadline, but this does not mean that the project is over, because we will have the possibility of digitizing more films by at least March. (…) We can easily reach 1,200, 1,300 digitized films", explained Rui Machado.
According to the Cinemateca, between 2022 and 2025, 333 feature films and 697 short films were digitized, and in some cases digitally restored, 333 feature films and 697 short films, in a total of 1,030 films, that is, 43,645 digitized minutes, by more than 283 authors.
The PRR measure had an allocation of 10.8 million euros, with a final execution deadline of December 31, 2025 – according to information on the Transparency Portal – and involved the participation of 30 to 40 external professionals.
According to Rui Machado, this PRR measure “was essential” to safeguard the heritage of Portuguese cinema, “despite not structurally solving the problem of the Cinemateca laboratory”, namely the lack of human resources and bureaucratic management constraints. The director of the Cinemateca stressed that "without digitization, most films would quickly stop being seen. Apart from the Cinemateca and very few cinemas, no cinema can project a 35mm copy".
The PRR measure covers more than a century of cinematographic works and, consequently, the History of Portuguese cinema, from silent cinema to the present, from different genres and eras.
Information about digitized films is available on the page https://digital.cinemateca.pt/, serving as a “consultation tool” for anyone who wants to program them, such as “festivals, film clubs, distributors, museums, universities or other entities, both national and international”.
Rui Machado recalls that, from now on, there will be a catalog of Portuguese films with the possibility of reaching more audiences both in cinemas, television channels and streaming. The Cinemateca grants the use of the new digital film supports through a contract with the holders of the rights to the cinematographic works, which includes the payment of a sum, depending on the duration of the films.
“We have more than 200 films with signed contracts and we no longer have them because, for this type of work, we did not have support from PRR, we have a person to deal with this”, said Rui Machado, clarifying that there are still cases in which cinematographic works are under the supervision of the State or in the public domain.
The director admitted that some producers disagree with the clauses of the agreement and that, in most cases, the disagreement relates to the values ​​requested for the transfer. According to the draft agreements, the rights holder of a digitized film undertakes to pay Cinemateca between 200 euros (for a work lasting less than 10 minutes) and a thousand euros (for a film lasting more than an hour) “for the definitive transfer of the digital copy”.
"This is an economic good. We are asking for a single amount forever and ever. The matrix [digital of each film] will be responsible for exploring the film in theaters, on television, on platforms for all the years that it is possible to explore. (…) There are detailed things that we can negotiate in the clauses, but others cannot", he highlighted.
For Rui Machado, this PRR measure to digitize Portuguese cinema will facilitate its circulation, “but it is not enough to have a room with a digital projector”. “We have always believed that digitalization could help fill out the schedules of cinemas in Portugal a little, not to mention the rest of the world, but it all depends on who is on the other side”, he said.
The presentation session of the thousandth film was attended by the Minister of Culture, Youth and Sports, Margarida Balseiro Lopes, for whom the digitalization of Portuguese cinema “is a first big step”, but it is necessary to “consolidate public access to this collective heritage, guarantee its sustained circulation”.
