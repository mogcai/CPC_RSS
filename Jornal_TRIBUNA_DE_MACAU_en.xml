The Coordinating Office of Social Services Sheng Kung Hui Macao follows, an average of 76 cases of young people with internet addiction. Under the one that is the only program of its kind in the territory, entitled “We-Connect’ Hidden and Internet Addiction Youth Service Project ”,“ comprehensive services ”are granted, which include prevention, development and counseling for young people and their guardians.
According to data from the Institute of Social Action (IAS) provided to the Jornal Tribuna de Macao, last year, there was an increase in the number of cases compared to 2023, since there was an increase of 68 cases to 72 in 2024. The years when the most cases were treated 2022 and 2019 (87 cases each year), as well as 2021 (86 cases). In turn, in 2020 there were 57 cases.
The body led by Hon Wai pointed out that, "as some cases have been accompanied or reopened over the years, the sum of the referred numbers is not equal to the total number of people accompanied during these years." Asked what the total number of young people identified as having internet addiction and supported by Sheng Kung Hui, IAS did not respond.
As for age distribution, they are mostly young people with ages between 14 and 18 years old. However, according to data released by the center earlier, a tendency for the average age of help applicants was observed in Macao: the youngest were only six to eight years.
It was mainly the family and friends of the young people who sought help, but there were also cases where the people who work under the program were aware of young people with this problem, following the organization of activities.
These young people access the internet, especially through mobile phones: “They played mainly gaming and competitive, and mainly used social applications such as Youtube, Instagram, Tik Tok and XiaoHongShu,” IAS said.
There are “many” the factors that contribute to the “internet addiction”, with the government organism to enumerate “personality traits, low self-esteem, depression, low social support”. Regarding social workers, the biggest difficulties they encounter to deal with these cases are the “low sensitization of young people for internet addiction; lack of alternative activities; influence of family factors, such as the little family control over the use of the internet”.
According to IAS, social workers usually need “a lot of time” to establish a relationship of mutual trust with young people and understand the reasons for addiction, how family communication and relationships work works. Só depois disso conseguem “fornecer apoios adequados e sugestões de programas que levam à melhoria da situação desses jovens”.
Asked if you intend to finance more associations or institutions to carry out these programs, IAS has ensured that "it will continue to fund this program to help young people in need and their guardians," but said it was not currently planned to "finance other non -governmental organizations to promote related services."
In 2021, the program coordinator, Cabell Hoi, had said in an interview with this newspaper that there should be many more cases of young people with internet addiction than those who are registered. The same responsible explained that the government has indeed given important support, but admitted that the team could do more and reach more young people if there were more human and financial resources.
In the academic year 2025/2026, the Directorate of Youth Education and Development Services (DSEDJ) will launch reference guidelines, so that schools and guardians are aware that mobile phones taken by students to schools must be subject to management measures. In addition, DSEDJ will provide a measure to support schools in the acquisition of centered mobile management equipment.</description><pubDate>2025-07-08 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Macau chosen to receive Asian minigp project</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/macau-escolhido-para-receber-projecto-de-minigp-asiatico/</link><description>Coloane's karting track received, for the first time, a stage of the “World Series End Minigp”, which provides competition for young riders from 10 to 16, in a path that could lead them to the highest level of motorcycling, MotoGP. All three continental events in Southeast Asia will be held in Macau. The next will be in August. At the premiere were corridors of the continent, Hong Kong and Taiwan, as well as a local representative and one of the Philippines. The Chinese Huang Ting Nuo won the competition

Dozen and a half of young pilots from east Asia and Southeast Asia, aged 10 to 16 years, participated in the debut of the “World Series MiniGP” in the coloane karting.
This is a project called MotoGP's “Road”, created by the International Motorcycle Federation (end), to provide experience for riders who want to embrace a professional career, with a view to participating in senior motorcycle-world competitions, MotoGP. To this end, he understood in order, the various continents are challenged to launch the newest runners in competitions seriously, and Macau joined the initiative, receiving all three rounds from the “Southeast Asia Series”, with pilots from this region, whose majority comes from the Popular Republic of China.
In the first of three rounds in the MSAR, the remaining two of which made in August, the karting - which has an international license and is therefore within the requirements of the end, especially with regard to safety - received eight pilots from the continent, three from Hong Kong, two from Taiwan, one of the Philippines and a representative of the MSAR.
On a very hot weekend, the right races were held on Saturday afternoon and Sunday, and the mornings were dedicated to free and qualification training.
In both events, with 14 laps to the circuit, the victory was up to Huang Ting Nuo, from the Popular Republic of China, ahead of his compatriot Chen Pin-Chi. Also Chinese Li Yuheng was third in the first race, while Cheung Yan Kit of Taiwan finished last in the second race podium. Mand's only driver Liam to Ieong Chi Him was not happy as he couldn't finish any proof.
The “Southeast Asia Series” debuted this year in the project, along with “Northeast Asia” and Turkey, to have 22 competitions throughout the time. Pilots participating in the 160 CC class are aged between 10 and 14, while the rest, until 16, compete in the category of 190 cc, but only after they have the experiment of at least one year in the lower displacement.
The president of the Macau-China General Association told the Jornal Tribuna de Macao that this initiative serves to "support the development of our car sport, hoping to promote it with the citizens of Macao, so that they know that they can run by motorcycle since childhood." Roberto Osório adds that in Macau “there is a lack of motorcycle riders”, unlike Karting, who has had a larger projection. “In our gym we have already trained more than 44 Karting pilots,” he said.
Meanwhile, Jorge Viegas, president of the end, mentioned on the body's website that "this is the starting point that was missing at Road to MotoGP and will allow all talented riders to step on the" podium "with an extremely low budget."
The official stressed that "in addition, this joint initiative, between the end and the company Dorna Sports, puts national federations at the forefront of the system, as it is worth all the national series and choose their best in each country or region."
On the other hand, the Dorna Sports Executive Director stressed that “Road to MotoGP” is “very important”. Carmelo Ezpeleta says he feels "proud" to see "another initiative added to our talent promotion portfolio, in partnership with in the end", adding that the competition plays a relief role "in the standardization of competition for young riders around the world, helping their talent shine on equal circumstances and creating more opportunities than ever."

Despite proving to be optimistic, Lau Pun Lap recalled that changes in consumption pattern are bringing difficulties and questioned the effectiveness of the intellectual property promotion plan
 
The economic performance of MSAR in the second quarter of this year is expected to have a sequential improvement, anticipates the president of the Macao Economic Association, Lau Pun Lap. In an interview with the newspaper or Mun, quoted by Macau News Agency, the economist pointed out that the economic basis of the territory remains “quite stable,” however, persist concerns.
It is recalled that Macau's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) retreated 1.3% in annual and real terms in the first quarter of this year, with data released by statistical and censuses (DSEC) services to 99.78 billion patacas, equivalent to 85.2% of the first quarter of the first quarter of 2019. The amount also represented a decrease of 6.1% over the last three months 2024, marking the sixth consecutive quarter of deceleration.
Looking at Macau's economic performance in the first three months of the year, Lau Pun Lap was optimistic, pointing out that in the second quarter there was an increase in the number of tourists, especially in May and June, as well as stronger revenues in both game export and service. In this sense, it suggests that there will be an improvement compared to the first quarter.
However, it pointed out that the biggest challenge that the economy of the territory faces has to do with unequal development. Property prices continue to fall, affecting the assessment of mortgages for small and medium -sized businesses (SMEs), as well as their funding capacity, while reducing consumers' confidence among residents, he emphasized.
Lau Pun Lap continued, saying that small businesses are facing difficulties due to a change in tourist consumption patterns, leading to a trend of falling overall consumption.
Suggesting that the government collaborates with industrial and commercial associations, as well as local companies, to explore ways to improve tourist consumption experience in Macau, thus increasing the volume and quality of consumption, Lau Pun Lap also criticized the intellectual property promotion plan.
When asked about the effectiveness of this initiative, the economist admitted that the concept is valid, however, but questioned if enough attention had been paid to partnerships with community associations and companies. In concrete, he pointed out that tourists often visit these areas just to take photographs with thematic facilities and then leave, little contributing to boosting the local economy.
The homologous breakdown of GDP registered in the first quarter-the first in two years, as the latter was registered in late 2022-among other factors, based on relatively high comparison of the first quarter of the previous year and the change in the consumption pattern of visitors, ”DSEC said, and came after consecutive slowdown.</description><pubDate>2025-07-08 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Studied integration of metro works and flood prevention</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/estudada-integracao-de-obras-metro-de-prevencao-de-cheias/</link><description>The government will study the integration of the construction of the west of Metro with the flood prevention works, the secretary revealed for transport and public works. Raymond Tam also assured that a public consultation will be held for the subway line surrounding the artificial island
 
The Secretary for Transport and Public Works said yesterday that the Government will hire a specialized entity to conduct a study on the western line of the Light Metro, in which the possibility of integration with flood prevention works will be evaluated.
In response to an oral interpellation of Deputy Leong Hong Sai, the secretary also said that the government will consider how to increase the area of ​​the interior port, as the construction of the western Metro line, the flood prevention works and the revitalization of the inner port "are directly related to the increase of the interior port space."
In addition, the ruler highlighted the “narrow cooperation” with the Institute for Municipal Affairs, so that the rainwater pumping stations in the south and north of the interior port play the “essential role” of improving the flood situation on Almirante Sérgio Street.
According to the secretary, the government will continue to promote the revitalization of the interior port zone, and the conclusion of the quarter current of the structural restoration of the-country bridges 23 and 25.
Describing the overall optimization of the inner port as “a long -term process”, he stressed that the executive will continue to improve the general spatial provision of the zone, based on the directing plan and considering the current situation and development needs. At the same time, in an integrated way, traffic, disaster prevention, environmental protection and public spaces, with a view to reinforcing the vitality and resilience of the area will be considered.
Asked by Leong Hong, he goes on the idea of ​​building a pedestrian tunnel between Wanzai and the inner port, Raymond Tam clarified that Macao's part never mentioned this proposal. Currently, the government is studying, with the Hengqin authorities, the creation of a new access road between the two territories, whose developments will be timely.
On the other hand, the secretary said "to have confidence" to achieve the goals of completing the construction of the East Metro line in 2028 and start the operation in 2029.
With regard to another subway layout, Raymond Tam said it will be thoughtful as this line, from the artificial island, can pass through Zone A and Zape, and reach the city center and Barra. "This line will be very important for Macau and its construction may be faster than the West Line, because the conditions for doing works should be a little better. We will develop the respective studies and we will certainly consult the public when the choice of layout is ready," he said.
In addition, according to Raymond Tam, for the meter to be able to penetrate several areas of the MSAR, an inevitable solution that is already underway is building underground rails in some zones.
The secretary said, on the other hand, that, in the elaboration of the detail plan for northern zone I, the government will study the feasibility of a road corridor, with a connection between the West Zone of Lam Mau and Ilha Verde.
 
Adjustments to bus contracts
In addition, Raymond Tam pointed out that the revision of the concession contracts of the Bus Service is underway, and adjustments will be introduced, according to the requirements of social development and the progress of the construction of road networks and carril transportation. In particular, factors such as the departure of buses, the reorganization of careers and the way of distributing the front line workers will be considered.
Still in the area of ​​transport, it has ensured that the government will prepare in advance response to traffic traffic jams at San MA lo in the golden week of October, to divert tourists to different bus stops.
Raymond Tam also took the opportunity to point out that the government created more than 800 parking spaces for heavy vehicles on proper roads in the Cotai zone for the use of the transport sector.
 
Maritime protected zone will not be expanded
In another scope, in response to Deputy Lam Lon Wai, the secretary considered that the conditions for the expansion of the Macao Maritime Protected Zone are not gathered, taking into account the natural characteristics of the water and various factors. In this respect, he stressed that the delimitation of the area obtained the recognition of the Ministry of Ecology and Environment and the Ministry of Natural Resources of China.
In turn, the director of maritime and water affairs services said a local boat company plans to cooperate with Shenzhen so that a 70 meter -long boat type performs maritime tourism activities between the two cities. On the other hand, Susana Wong ruled out yacht lease, taking into account security management.
However, Ron Lam appealed to increased transparency of information on public works. The secretary stressed that, even if no plants of urban conditions are issued, the competent services request binding opinions to the direction of soil services and urban construction on public works. In this regard, he added that public works services have already proceeded to 34 public consultations in the first half of this year, asserting that their guardianship will not ignore the approach in the form of public consultation.
 
Exchange of economic fractions in study
Raymond Tam stated that the feasibility study is underway for the implementation of an economic housing exchange regime, which will allow the government to identify the real needs of the population, clarify the target audience and define the conditions applicable to this regime. As for the possibility of affecting economic fractions to the use of social housing, the secretary indicated that he will be analyzed with prudence, taking into account the concrete circumstances.</description><pubDate>2025-07-08 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>CPSP's number of promotions grew</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/cresceu-numero-de-promocoes-cpsp/</link><description>The Public Security Police Corps registered, last year, more promotions than the previous year, which were more visible in the class of agents.

The US market appears as the “less favorable”
 
The attitude of industrial entrepreneurs on the prospects of Macau exports for the next six months “became more prudent,” said the Directorate of Statistics and Census Services (DSEC), based on the results of the conjuncture survey to the industrial sector for the first quarter of 2025.
Between January and March, the average duration of the ordering portfolio of industrial businessmen performed fell to 3.0 months, less 0.4 months than in the fourth quarter of 2024. The “clothing and clothing” portfolio took the first place with 4.9 months, followed by the sectors of “pharmaceutical products” (4.4 months), “electronic and electric equipment” (3,4) and (3,4) and (3,4) and (3,4) and (3,4) and (3,4) and (3,4) and (3,4) and (3,4) (3,4) and (3,4) and (3,4) “Other non -textile products” (1.0).
According to DSEC, 68.2% of entrepreneurs interviewed mentioned the “insufficient volume of orders” as the biggest problem they were facing, while 38.2% pointed to “high prices of raw materials” and 36.4% the “most competitive prices practiced abroad”. As for the prospects for the next three months, 43.2% were concerned mainly about “insufficient orders” and 15.8% with “most competitive prices abroad”.
During the first quarter of this year, Macao's main exported goods were “pharmaceutical products”, “electronic/electric equipment”, “alcohol and tobacco drinks”, “clothing and clothing” and “other food products”. The Asia Pacific region (excluding data from the interior of China, Hong Kong and Japan) was the export destination market with “relatively better behavior”, with the respective rate to present a variation of 25.6%. On the other hand, “the behavior of US markets was the least favorable, presenting the rate variation of -43.3%,” says DSEC.
In a preview of the next six months, 26.9% of respondents anticipated “an optimistic perspective”, plus 3.9 percentage points compared to the fourth quarter of 2024, however, 52.3% predicted “a less favorable evolution”, which reflects an increase of 29.2 points compared to the last three months of last year. In addition, 20.8% of entrepreneurs predicted “a stagnation”, less 33.1 percentage points compared to the previous quarter.
DSEC calculates the various indicators and results, taking as reference the statistical methodologies, definitions and classification criteria, adopted in the “conjuncture inquiry to the exporting industrial sector”, previously published by the Directorate of Economics and Technological Development Services.</description><pubDate>2025-07-08 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>30 vacancies for internships in cross -border finance</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/30-vagas-para-estagios-em-financas-transfronteiricas/</link><description>Applications for the 30 internship vacancies in cross -border finance of the Directorate of Services for Labor Affairs start tomorrow.

The secretary for social affairs and culture yesterday indicated that, in general terms, 64.5% of the local Macao population has at least one type of health insurance (individual or work). In addition, 42.9% of residents aged 16 or older have already acquired individual health insurance and 46.8% benefit from health insurance provided by their employer.
In response to an oral challenge of Chan Iek Lap, in which the deputy suggested to the government to take advantage of a third of health valleys, not used annually, to assign a subsidy to residents, in order to encourage them to participate in the voluntary health insurance plan, LAM clarified that there are no plans for now to subsidize the acquisition of individual health insurance.
According to the secretary, the implementation of a health insurance subsidy program would only benefit residents who already have health insurance, so it would not be in accordance with the principle of universality governing public policies. On the other hand, he stressed that Macau's current health care system already covers the basic needs of the majority of the population, ensuring that vulnerable groups have access to the health care they need.
The LAM also said that, according to the budgetary framework law, unused health valleys balances cannot be applied in other purposes.
"Even though the government government partially subsidize health insurance, residents will have to assume remaining costs. The government will continue to follow the evolution of the health insurance market and, in vaguely evaluate, the need to adjust relevant policies," he continued.
In addition, the secretary revealed that last year, the government subsidized non -profit and private medical institutions to provide 1.614 million services, representing about 25% of the total volume of Macao medical services.
"Relevant measures effectively relieved pressure on the public health system and promoted synergistic development among public and private health sectors," the ruler said.</description><pubDate>2025-07-08 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Gastronomic Forum starts with award -winning Asia chefs</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/forum-gastronomico-arranca-chefs-premiados-da-asia/</link><description>Two renowned Asian chefs will inaugurate the “International Gastronomy Forum”, which will take place in Macao.

The 20 paintings personify the artist's “various identities”

The Rui Cunha Foundation (FRC) inaugurates today, at 18:30, the exhibition “Diligently”, by artist NG Sok Chan Jane. The curatorship of the 20 oil paintings, acrylic, digital and collages was in charge of Leong Sin Teng Cinny, the artist's longtime friend, says the statement.

I am part of the working class, but I am also a painter,” explains the artist. “I conciliate several roles and identities and effort to manage the responsibilities that each one brings. The burden can be overwhelming,” confesses the artist who considers the painting “a sanctuary” and for whom the process is “self-regenerating”.

"City of Dreams" presents until September 12 the exhibition "Horst: Photographer of the Style" with the help of the London Museum "Victoria and Albert". The show features “the legendary Horst fashion photography over six decades”, according to Melco Resorts &amp; Entertainment. On display is a curated “carefully” selection of the author's “most representative works”. Visitors are invited to “explore a world of timeless fashion, art and light, and to celebrate the legacy of one of the greatest masters of photography,” according to the game operator.
The images are divided into five central themes, “haute couture”, “surrealism”, “fashion in color”, “living in style” and “stage and screen” and offer “a rich and multidimensional vision of Horst P. Horst's artistic universe”. In addition to the “balanced elegance” of Parisian haute couture, “bold” surrealistic explorations, the pioneering color photography and “vivid portraits” of cinema icons, the exhibition also includes the special section “tribute to Horst”, with works of five influential Chinese photographers.
The works of Hai Feng, Nick Yang, Trunk Xu, Wu Zeng and Yuangi Mei offer "a glimpse of China fashion photography from the last thirty years, showing their rich cultural dialogues and artistic discoveries." The works of the Chinese artists “capture the fascinating interaction between tradition and modernity, oriental and western aesthetics, as well as timeless elegance and contemporary innovation,” says the statement.
Horst is considered one of the most influential fashion photographers of the twentieth century, "celebrated by its masterful use of light" and a "meticulous" composition. His creative career lasted over 60 years, shaped by artistic movements such as surrealism and the rise of color photography, refers to Melco. His work is known for combining "dramatic tension and artistic depth, delivering unparalleled aesthetics that remains unmatched." Horst also left a "unforgettable" legacy of portraits of figures such as Coco Chanel, Salvador Dalí, Marlene Dietrich and Andy Warhol.
Tim Kelly, president of “City of Dreams”, said the company is committed to “merging the local culture of masters with global artistic perspectives, creating unique cultural landmarks and continually raising the city's artistic experience”. "The lasting elegance and the creativity that goes beyond the limits on Horst's photography are perfectly aligned with the philosophy of our brand," he added.
In turn, Duncan Forbes, head of photography at the “Victoria and Albert” museum, said that the “rich fusion of fashion, design and contemporary art” of “City of Dreams” reflects “the spirit of Horst work”.

The four -day program will also have theater workshops, intended for participants “with or without experience”
 
On September 20, at 20h00, the play “Júlio César”, from Companhia do Chapitô, will take the stage of “Black Box I”, at the Cultural Center of Macau (CCM), announced the Somos! - Portuguese Language Communication Association (ACLP). The program also includes a series of “physical and visual theater” thematic workshops on September 21, 22 and 23. These are “intended for participants with or without experience in theater” and will take place at the Casa Garden Amphitheater of the Oriente Foundation.
The play is inspired “in life and historical events around Julius Caesar” and uses “comedy as a language to reinvent history”, according to the press release. The show explores “historical inconsistencies” and recreates facts documented with the characteristic “disregard” of the Chapitô Company. "Actors use body, movement and gesture to create characters and convey emotions universally, allowing an affordable experience to different audiences."
The Roman general was a member of the first “triumvirate,” led the Roman armies in the conquest of Gaul and defeated Pompey in a civil war. Self -proclaimed “perpetual dictator of Rome”, he was eventually murdered by a group of senators who considered him “a threat to the Republic,” the association explains.
During the theater workshops, participants will have the opportunity to “explore improvisation techniques, character creation and nonverbal communication, using the body as a central tool for artistic and narrative expression”. The workshops will be divided into three themes, “body, space and improvisation”, “characters and gestural archetypes” and “dramatic game and creative improvisation”.
These workshops address the “creation of narratives and the construction of characters in a physical and visual way”, through “characterization techniques, use of space and development of archetypes and psychological profiles”. The trainers Jorge Cruz, Pedro Diogo and Susana Nunes will conduct the sessions, in English with translation to Chinese, for a maximum of 20 participants. Registration is open on Somos-ACLP website, with a discount by the end of July.
The time and a half piece will be presented in Portuguese and subtitled in Chinese. Tickets cost 200 patacas and can be purchased at Macauticket. Following the show, the Chapitô Company will also hold conversation sessions between the artists and the public, to “an exchange of ideas and reflections on the withered theatrical experience”.
Since 1996, the Chapitô Company has produced and presented about 40 original creations in several countries, including Portugal, Brazil and China, among others. The company's multidisciplinary work is “based on physical theater and communication through gesture and image”, in which comedy is valued “as a language to question physical and social reality”.
The initiative is sponsored by the Culture Development Fund and the support of the Portuguese Institute of the East and the Oriente Foundation.

Despite the very high temperature, LEGO fans attended the park's mass, the world's largest Legoland with 318,000 square meters.
"I love to play with Lego and have many at home. So I wanted to come to Legoland as soon as possible," said Shi, a 35 -year -old man and a resident of the neighboring city of Hangzhou, who visited the park with his wife and son.
Despite the slow growth of the Chinese economy in recent years, the national tourist market has grown 18.6% in the first quarter compared to the same period of 2024, according to official data. This economic scenario favors the increase in the offer of leisure activities in the country, which means, on the other hand, that Legoland Park will have to face a harsh competition.
In May, a new attraction of “Spider-Man” was inaugurated at the Shanghai Disneyland, while Warner Brothers prepares the opening in 2027 of a Harry Potter park in the city that is considered to be the China Economic Center.
On the other hand, the American toy sector company Hasbro also announced last week that the huge park of the character "Peppa Pig" that will be inaugurated in this Chinese metropolis is already "in the creative design phase."
With all this offer, it is assumed that it gets even worse, the profitability of these mega parks, particularly for them managed by local companies and have as attractive themes and less known themes and figures. By the end of 2024, almost 40% of these local parks had not yet made a profit, according to state press.
 
Attractions to all ages
The large inauguration was marked by a spectacular ceremony, where an imposing 26-meter lego figure called the first wave of visitors. Given, with his cheerful smile and vibrant colors, gave the tone for the festivities of the day, incorporating the playful spirit of the Lego brand.
The mayor of Shanghai, Gong Zheng, alongside Fiona Eastwood, CEO of Merlin Entertainments, and Niels B. Christiannsen, president and CEO of Lego Group, officialized the inauguration, expressing enthusiasm for the potential of the resort to become an important cultural and tourist center in China.
Legoland Shanghai has a variety of thematic areas designed to captivate visitors of all ages. One of the prominent attractions is Minilândia, a meticulously elaborate section that replicates famous milestones from around the world using over 20 million lego pieces. Highlights include detailed temple models of the Temple of Heaven in Beijing and the iconic Shanghai Bund, offering a miniature but authentic view of China's rich architectural heritage.
For younger visitors, the resort offers interactive zones such as Lego City, where children can participate in dramatization and Monkie Bond activities, a new addition to Chinese mythology and culture.
In addition to the main attractions, the resort offers themed hotels, dining options and retail stores, ensuring visitors a complete and comfortable experience. “The integration of local culture with international standards promises a perfect mix of tradition and innovation” stresses the promotion of the new park.
