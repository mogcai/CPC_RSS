The proportion of women among candidates for the elections of the Legislative Assembly (AL), scheduled for September 14, increased by the last scrutiny, in 2021. According to the data provided by the Commission of Electoral Affairs of the Legislative Assembly (Caeal) on the definitive lists, 85 candidates (71 in direct suffrage and 14 in the indirect suffrage), of which 32 are women, of which 32 are women. the equivalent of 37.64%. Four years ago, there were 138 competitors to Hemiciclo seats, 46 being women, representing 33.33% of the total.
Of the six lists in the race to direct suffrage, three have women as a head-to -ist-the good home alliance, led by Wong Kit Cheng and linked to the Women's Association; the union for the development of workers, with it law first; and the Macao United Citizens Association, linked to the Fujian community, whose singer is Song Pek Kei. In all cases, they are deputies with seat in the same. In 2021, of the 14 competing lists, four were led by women, but only two ended up elect deputies.
Wong Kit Cheng's list is the most female elements. Among the 14 candidates, 10 are women. Secondly on the list comes Loi I Weng, who is a teacher, and only third comes a man, Wong Su Cheong, who works in the administrative area of a company.
The union for development has six women and six men. After Ella Lei, Leong Sun Iok, also deputy to Al, and third place to lawyer Cheang Ka Man.
The Association of United Citizens of Macao has a woman in the lead, Song Pek Kei, but the following places are occupied by men: Nick Lei, current deputy, in second position, and Chan Lai Kei, who works in the area of education, in third place.
In turn, the Nova Esperança list, led by the current deputy José Pereira Coutinho, president of the Public Office Association, has six women and five men. In the first three places, however, it is the male that dominates: besides Coutinho, Chan Hao Weng appears in second position and Che Sai Wang in third.
Among the lists with more men emerge the promoting union for progress, led by Deputy Leong Hong Sai, who has Ngan Iek Hang, also deputy, as the second candidate; Thirdly comes Lam Ka Chun, aviation pilot. This list has eight men and only two women: Cheong Sok Leng, in fifth position, and Choi Hang Kit in ninth place.
Also the union of Macau-Guangdong is predominantly composed of men-there are 11 elements of males and only three of the female. Economist Lao Chi Ngai is the second-place head, Lee Koi Ian, head of a retail and tourism trade group, and in third place comes a woman, ng nga Fan, manager of a kitchen utensils company.
In indirect suffrage, the discrepancy between men and women is much more visible. As in 2021, for these elections only a woman, Angela Leong, for the cultural and sports sector. In total, 13 men against 11 years ago four years ago. In terms of the number of lists are six, against five by 2021.
 
“Weight” of young people decreased
In general, the six lists admitted to direct suffrage and the six for the indirect then 85 candidates are part of 44.49 years, just above 2021, according to the analysis by the Jornal Tribuna de Macao. The youngest is 20 years old, called Ng Wan Hei and is a student. Competing for the Song Pek Kei team, being the last candidate on the list. And it is precisely the List Association of United Citizens that has the lowest average ages, with 32.9 years.
Already the oldest candidate is 78 years old: is Tam Leng I Melina, retired civil servant, who competes for the list of José Pereira Coutinho, specifically in fifth position. A Nova Esperança é, por sua vez, a lista que tem a média de idades mais elevada, com 58,6 anos.
Amazing 49 candidates from both suffrage, the age group from 35 to 44 years old continues to stand out, with 41.17%, against 31.88% of the total in 2021. Candidates with 34 or less years are now less, with a “weight” of 16.47%, in a total of 14 people, and in 2021 accounted for 23.9% of the total universe.
Those in the 45th to 54 -year -old level increased from about 20.3% to about 21.1%, totaling 18 candidates. In the age group from 54 to 64 years old are eight, equivalent to 9.4% of the total, while candidates 65 years or older are seven, making 8.2% of the total.
It should be noted that in the indirect suffrage the average age is far higher than that of direct suffrage: while in the first one is 54.85 years, in the second is 42.45 years.
It is recalled that in the indirect suffrage, 10 of the 12 seats for the 8th Legislative Assembly are already attributed: four at the Electoral College of Industrial, Commercial and Financial Sectors (Deputies José Chui Sa Peng and IP Sio Kai, as well as Si Ka Lon, which goes from direct suffrage to the indirect, and Kevin Ho, who debuts); Three from the professional sector (Iau Teng Pio, who was appointed deputy, and rookies Vong Hou Piu and Wong Chon Kit); one of the social and educational services (the repeatant Ho Ion Sang); and two of the cultural and sports sectors (Angela Leong, who remains, and Ma Chi Seng, who was appointed deputy).
It is later to decide the two seats of the Labor Sector, as this year are applied for two lists: the union of workers' associations, with Leong Pou U and Choi Kam Fu, and the joint commission of the candidacy of employee associations, current deputy Lam Lon Wai and Kong Ioi Fai. The Chief Executive will also appoint seven deputies within 15 days after receiving the general investigation.
In 2021, it is recalled before the disqualification of 21 candidates for elections for “not defending the basic law” and “not being faithful to mashes”, were in the race to direct suffrage elections a total of 159 people. This year, Caeal has again excluded candidates, based on the opinions of the State Security Defense Commission for the same reasons. In this case, 12 candidates were disqualified, six of which were part of the list of current deputy Ron Lam, which was elected in 2021. Before the exclusion were 97 competitors.
Already before this year's disqualification the number of candidate lists was the lowest ever since the creation of the MSAR. The territory currently has 333,391 people qualified to vote, of which 9,759 are new voters. In 2016, the year preceding legislative elections, 25,138 new voters were recorded, while by 2020 there were only 15,903.
Four years ago, the influx rate at the direct suffrage, reached 42.38%, representing the lower percentage since the establishment of the MSAR. That year, 137,279 people voted in a universe of 323,907.
Asked several times about what impact he expects to go to the polls after the disqualification of candidates, the president of Caeal, Judge Seng Ioi Man, circumvented the issue, just saying that voting is a right, but also a duty.
The AL is made up of 33 deputies, 14 elected by direct suffrage, 12 elected by indirect suffrage and seven appointed by the chief executive. Looking at the composition of the hemiciclo, there are only five women, representing 15% of the total deputies.</description><pubDate>2025-07-31 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Defended “large cultural space” in the zone of the ecumenical center Kun Iam</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/defendido-grande-espaco-cultural-na-zona-centro-ecumenico-kun-iam/</link><description>On a guided tour of the Kun Iam Ecumenical Center, which was recently refurbished, architect Cristina Leiria argued that a cultural zone should be created that integrated various spaces in the surrounding area
 
Pedro Milheirão
Cristina Leiria argues that the entire surrounding area of the Kun Iam Ecumenical Center should become a “large cultural space,” he said on the sidelines of a guided tour of the center, which was recently remodeled. The architect also regretted the fact that the Center was being pretended by the government because it had other priorities. "I don't criticize, I just liked to realize," he said. "I go there, I take envelopes, written letter, to give me an answer. The effort I have made," he said.
Cristina Leiria has asserted that since December, she has been trying to talk to Sam Hou Fai, Chief Executive, Lam, Secretary for Social Affairs and Culture, and Leong Wai Man, President of the Cultural Institute. "I want to gather with [Sam Hou Fai]. First about the Eumenic Center and, secondly, creating a large surroundings of a cultural space without being the cultural center. And this could be linked to the cultural center. It is nearby," he continued, adding that "the tourist paths could integrate the ecumenical center."
The idea of a cultural area, which integrates different points of interest, dates back to 2014, when the architect of the Ecumenical Center Kun Iam, the landscaper Caldeira Cabral and engineer Jorge Lipari Pinto planned several projects to renew the zone. The various changes would include an airfare of Dr. Carlos D 'Assumpção Park to the Ecumenical Center and was linked to the Science Center and the area in front of the MGM.
“Zone A [new landfills] will bring three times more traffic here,” predicts Cristina Leiria. "So we need a lot. While there is no big arrangement, an airfare, that's what I ask. I've been asked for it for over 10 years," he continued, lamenting that previous governments had also given priority to other things.
For now, it remains concerned with “this small element”, referring to the ecumenical center Kun Iam. "I want to grab this. And then integrate it into a broader thing, with dignity," he reiterated. "We can have here, in Macao, something that deserved a great respect. It's not just the ecumenical center. It's all. All this is all in a great area of culture," he insisted.
The Kun Iam Ecumenical Center is located on an artificial island and attached to Dr. Sun Yat-Sen's Avenue in Nape, for a 60 meter isthmus, measuring a total of 32 meters high. Symbol of the center, the statue of the goddess Kun iam weighs 50 tons, consists of about 50 pieces cast in bronze and measures 20 meters high. The architect conceived the statue and center based on the ideas of “silence and well-being”. The purpose of the place is to provide a quiet and restful space for the public.
Kun iam, a deity that embodies love, mercy, and compassion, "is a figure that symbolizes this message of solidarity and approach between people, being venerated even outside the scope of Buddhist religion." In the decoration of the summit the artists of Macau Kwok Woon and Joana Ling painted, on rice paper, figures, symbols and texts related to Lao TSE, Confucius, Mencio and Buddha.
The face of the sculpture was specifically worked to transpare the universality expressed in the “ecumenical” concept without any ethnic allusion. Inaugurated on March 21, 1999, the center was conceived by the Portuguese architect, with the support of UNESCO, "aiming to perpetuate mutual respect and friendship between all peoples and civilizations." "I always tried to do everything, combining the western culture, with which I was familiar, with the eastern culture, which I studied," said the architect.</description><pubDate>2025-07-31 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>More than 8,900 assessments for lack of civility until June</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/mais-de-8-900-autuacoes-por-falta-de-civismo-ate-junho/</link><description>More than 8,900 assessments for lack of civility between January and June this year. According to AMI data, more than half of cases concern "abandonment of any solid waste." Other frequent situations are the “spit or launch of nasal mucus” and the “placement or abandonment of any materials or objects”

In the first six months of the year, 8,916 people under the General Regulation of Public Spaces were charged. According to the Institute for Municipal Affairs (AMI), the number of assessments corresponds to half of those accounting throughout the last year (17,730).
The “abandonment of any solid waste” is the most committed infringement, totaling 4,672, equivalent to more than half of the recorded cases. Although the volume of cases was relatively stable over the months, in January it was when more (846) were registered.
“Other” types of lack of civility, not detailed, with 1,594 cases, “spit or launch of nasal mucus” (1,308 cases) and “placement or abandonment of any materials or objects” (1,225).
“Pets waste” motivated 63 assessments between January and June this year, while the “fall of water drops from air conditioners” originated 54 fines.
Regarding the amount of fines, there is no information provided by AMI yet.
The regulation, which has been in force since 2004, and the “Catalog of Infringement” have established the amounts of fines depending on their classification as common infractions (300 or 600 patacas), bass (from 700 to 2,500 patacas or from 700 to 5,000) and very severe (between 2,000 and 5,000 patacas or from 2,000 to 10,000).
Intempted to the public, this regulation defines the obligations of anyone in public areas, which include the prohibition of behaviors against cleaning rules, personal hygiene and public health, prohibition of attitudes that can cause or increase the danger in normal circulation of vehicles or pawns, environmental protection and the balance of a variety of habitats, as well as preventing transgressions in restriction zones.
In addition to the definition of a system of fines or penalty of infrastructors, there are other forms of penalty. Infringers may choose to participate in Social Work programs instead of paying fines, but this form of penalty is only applicable to MSAR residents. The AMI, however, does not have these data on your website.
 
They “raised” 8.2 million under the regime of public spaces
Last year, the fines paid due to the application of the general regime of public spaces yielded 8.2 million patacas to the Institute for Municipal Affairs (AMI), reveal the statistical data updated earlier this month. It should be noted that in 2024, the number of assessments ascended to 17,730, with about 46% of cases respecting the “abandonment of any solid waste”. According to the information provided by the body, about 53% of the offenses were committed by “non -local residents”, totaling 9,358, while the remaining 8,372 were practiced by “local residents”. Most of the fines were paid to the counter, a total of 5.3 million patacas, and the remaining amount was paid over the internet.</description><pubDate>2025-07-31 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Defended easier access to temporary child care</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/defendido-acesso-mais-facil-cuidados-infantis-temporarios/</link><description>The Administrative Subdirector of the Women's Association Department of Social Services has called for the simplification of procedures for the request for temporary child care provided by kindergartens, adjusting the duration of this service calculation model and reinforcing the campaign for more families to know this source of support. The suggestions come after the recent case in which a boy left alone at home ended up falling from the building
 
Following the case of a boy who fell from the building where he lives, when he was home alone, Chao Kam Kin, administrative department of the Department of Social Services of the General Association of Women, suggested simplifying procedures for the request for temporary care service. This service is currently provided by some government -subsidized day care centers or operated by associations.
Chao Kam Kin highlighted in a “or Mun Tin Toi” program held yesterday that this service has an “important meaning” to deal with emergency situations. Therefore, the representative of the Women's Association also expects the duration of this service to be calculated per hour, and that the disclosure actions will be intensified so that more families in which the two parents work know this support system.
In addition, Chao Kam Kin stressed that awareness of school and hospital personnel is "very important," suggesting the reinforcement of the campaign on help and notification channels.
On the other hand, it considers that the notification mechanism for cases related to the protection of children should be reviewed, so that they can be discovered as early as possible. As for parents, the associative leader stressed that they should resort to caregivers as soon as possible, according to the degree of maturity, the ability to deal with different situations and the physical state of children, or take them with them.
For its part, Bondy Li, director of the Child Protection Center of the Children's Fighting Association, proposed the participation of domestic maids in family-organized technical-professional courses organized by the government or private entities, to learn care of children and the elderly, as well as first aid.
According to the center's head, many families have not yet become aware of the problem of stress derived from children's education and emotional management, considering that activities promoted by social service institutions can help discover potential cases.
On the other hand, Bondy Li found that family -friendly measures taken by companies are at an early stage. In this sense, it has called on companies that they are “friendlier” compared to parents' requests to adjust working hours due to emerging children's care needs.</description><pubDate>2025-07-31 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Magnitude 8.8 earthquake in Russia activated tsunami alerts in the Pacific</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/ultimas/sismo-de-magnitude-88-na-russia-fez-activar-alertas-de-tsunami-pacifico/</link><description>EPASELECT EPA12272020 A STILL IMAGE Taken from a Handout Video Provided by the Geophysical Center of the Russian Academy of Sciences Shows The Flooded Area-Kurilsk, Sakhalin Region, Russia, 3025.

A 8.8 magnitude earthquake in the far east of Russia, one of the strongest ever registered, caused tsunamis with waves of up to four meters on Wednesday and evacuation alerts in several countries in the Pacific Basin, from the US to Colombia. Russian authorities reported slight injuries, but did not record deaths.
On the Kamchatka Peninsula, in the far East of Russia, the authorities ended up lifted Tsunami's alert, more than 11 hours after the strong earthquake, which took place in the morning on the Petropavlovsk coast, at a depth of 20.7 kilometers, the United States Geological Service (USGS) reported. Hours later, a new earthquake was registered, with a magnitude of 6.6.
In Russia, a tsunami flooded the Severo-Kurilsk port on the Curilla islands, about 350 kilometers from the earthquake epicenter, according to the regional seismic monitoring service. Waves up to four meters high reached 400 meters on land and reached a World War II Memorial, said Alexander Ovsiannikov, head of the Northern Curillas District, where nearly 2,000 people were evacuated.
Japan has issued an evacuation alert to nearly two million people, but at night it lowered the risk level to the regions of Ibaraki and Wakayama to "warning." A woman died in Japan after falling from a cliff with her car while trying to get out of one of the areas on alert, the local press said.
A 1.3 -meter tsunami wave hit Miyagi, Porto north of the province of Iwate. In the Northeast, workers at the Fukushima Nuclear Center, devastated by a tsunami in 2011, were evacuated by precaution, the operator said.
China also suspended Tsunami's warning to Shanghai and to the coast of Zhejiang province. The same happened in the Philippines and Taiwan.
Authorities from various countries in the Americas have also issued evacuation alerts to coastal populations. The US Pacific Tsunamis Alert Center warned of one to three meters on the back of Chile, Costa Rica, French Polynesia, Guam, Japan and other Pacific Islands. However, the center suspended the evacuation warning to Hawaii a few hours later.
Ecuador ordered the preventive evacuation of beaches, docks and low areas on the Galapagos islands, 1,000 km from the continent, due to the risk of tsunami.
Authorities from Guatemala, Costa Rica, El Salvador and Panama also asked inhabitants to avoid aquatic activities on the Pacific coast. In the Marquesas Islands, the territory of the French Polynesia, the authorities warned of possible waves of up to four meters.
 
Macau expected “little wave”
The tsunami generated by the strong earthquake on the Russian coast “will not have direct impact” on the MSAR, predicted Macao's meteorological and geophysical services (SMG). Still, the SMG anticipated that "a small wave of tsunami" would reach the coast of Macau between 18:00 and 19:00 yesterday, which could cause "a water level fluctuation of 0.1m or less." In turn, the Directorate of Tourism Services (STD) did not receive requests for help until 17:00, having only been notified by a resident who is safe in the Japanese city of Hakodate in Hokkaido and consulted by a person about to travel to Japan. Data provided by the Tourism sector to STD indicates that about 48 residents are traveling on Hong Kong tours in Osaka, Hokkaido, and Hokkaido and Hokkaido and Hokkaido Kyushu.

Together with the Institute for Municipal Affairs, the body will evaluate the repair and maintenance of the floor, as well as the materials that can be placed there
 
The Cultural Institute (IC) said it will continue to evaluate, together with the Institute for Municipal Affairs, the repair and maintenance of the pavement in Lilau Beco. The warranty arose following complaints related to the slippery floor, due to the Portuguese sidewalk and the used granite floor.
Quoted by “or Mun Tin Toi”, IC has ensured that it will evaluate the materials that can be used and study the viability of optimization proposals.
It is recalled that Lilau's Largo, next to Beco, is part of the historic center, classified as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since July 15, 2005.
Prior to the IC reaction, some listeners of a “or Mun Tin Toi” program warned that it is easy to slip in that area by driving on rainy days, so they have to redouble attention. A listener suggested that the sidewalk and the granite route are replaced by asphalt or concrete pavement. On the contrary, another driver defended the maintenance of the current Largo and Beco do Lilau, given its cultural characteristics.
In the opinion of Yu Zhentang, director of the Association for the Reinvention of Macao Cultural Heritage Studies, the granite floor and the Portuguese sidewalk reflect the course of the urban evolution of Macao. Therefore, it should not be fully replaced by concrete if it is necessary to optimize the pavement.
The associative leader suggested that opinions from the public and the engineering sector be consulted, as well as a reference as a reference from abroad, to study the introduction of new paving materials and techniques. From its perspective, it is important to ensure the waterproofing and drainage of the pavement and also preserve its cultural value.
The Jornal Tribuna de Macao tried to understand with the IC what are the optimization measures that the body intends to adopt and a possible replacement of the Portuguese sidewalk in the alley of Lilau with other materials, or even wide, but did not respond to the closing of this edition.</description><pubDate>2025-07-31 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Secretary requires “Surveillance” on Chikungunya fever</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/secretaria-exige-vigilancia-sobre-febre-chikungunya/</link><description>LAM was inspecting the elimination of mosquitoes in the "high risk" places of the territory.

The Secretary for Social Affairs and Culture, LAM, was to inspect, with an entourage, the work of eliminating mosquitoes in the “high risk” zones of chikungunya fever. The LAM recognized “the efforts made by Macau” in the prevention and control of the spread of the disease, stressing, however, that it is necessary to “maintain vigilance” and “not neglect the situation”.
Yesterday, health services (SSM) reported another case of chikungunya fever. He is a 66-year-old man, resident of Macau, who lives in Zhuhai and works at Cotai.

This was thus classified as 6th imported case this year. The body led by Alvis Lo has ensured that he will send personnel to make the preventive elimination of mosquitoes near the residence and the main places of activity of this patient.
At the inspection, LAM was also at the workshops, gardens located on the peninsula, such as Jardim do Areia Preta, and places with higher incidence of hygiene complaints. Some of the “black points” include the Espinho courtyard area, the unoccupied houses in the Mungo courtyard and the Mau Tan building.
During the visits, LAM and the entourage "heard detailed reports from those responsible for mosquito and prevention and control work, as well as exchanged opinions with community residents to better understand the situation."

In the first half of this year, a total of 7.09 million Patacas was granted on support, under the support plan for young entrepreneurs, with February registered an amount of two million (28.21%), more than any other month. In January 1.27 million (17.91%) were awarded, in April 1.15 million (16.22%), in May 750 thousand patacas (10.58%) and, in June, 1.92 million (27.08%), according to data analyzed by the Jornal Tribuna de Macao on the page of the Directorate of Economics and Technological Development (DSEDT).
Like previous years, retail trade remains the area of economic activity that the most funding receives, with 3.26 million patacas, or 46% of the total amount. 1.41 million were granted to the areas of education, medical services and social assistance (19.9%). Young people who created restaurants in the area of restaurants and hotels received 1.3 million patacas (18.3%), while vehicle and barber repair services received 550,000 patacas (7.8%). The services provided to the companies were granted 200 thousand patacas, 2.8% of the total amount, and, finally, the construction and public works received 70 thousand patacas (1%).
In the first six months, DSEDT received 59 requests for the support plan for young entrepreneurs. Of these, 42 were approved and 16 rejected. During March, although DSEDT received nine requests, none was approved or rejected, and therefore no financial support has been granted. Both in January and February, the body received 10 requests; Already in April there were eight, in May nine and, in the last month of the semester, 13.
In June, the services approved the largest number of requests (12) and rejected five, more than any other month of the year. DSEDT approved seven requests in January, 11 in February, seven in April and five in May. In February, as in May, DSEDT rejected two requests and the same happened to another three in April. In January, four were rejected.
Last year was also the period in which the least money was attributed, with just over 14 million patacas, in line with the decrease trend since 2022. This should be due to the fact that 2024 was the year in which the young people made fewer requests (114), since 2020. Consequently, fewer requests were also approved, in addition to 78, and 33 were rejected, only one less than one that in 2023.
Between August 1, 2013, the date on which the plan came into force, and the end of 2024, a total amount of 453.53 million patacas has already been granted. Of this value, more than 210 million intended only for retail trade (46.4%). The second most supportive economic activity received by 2024 was restoration and hotel (12.6%), which this year was surpassed by educational, health and social services. Until last year, education, medical services and social assistance received 34.79 million patacas (7.7%).</description><pubDate>2025-07-30 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Among the South Koreans grows the "fever" of various jobs</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/lazer/entre-os-sul-coreanos-cresce-febre-de-varios-empregos/</link><description>Kim Sol-Nim, 33, writes blogs to lawyer hospitals and offices after returning from his main work around 6 pm. It dedicates one to four hours a day to Biscates, earning between 600,000 wons (3,500 MOP) and 800,000 (4,676 MOP) per month as extra income.
He managed an Airbnb and gave lectures at the weekend related to his current insurance work. Now you are preparing with friends with a pet furniture design business.
This does not mean that it plans to leave the main employment, which offers you a health plan, reform benefits and job stability, benefits that it is not sure if your free -term performance can provide in the long run. Kim considers himself an "n-jobber"-someone who has or seeks to have several jobs.
"The biggest reason for multi-work is the money," he told The Korea Herald. "The salary of my main work is enough for my livelihood, but it's not even close to buying a house in Seoul."
It is one of the many South Koreans who are taking over, or considering assuming, secondary jobs. For respondents, money is the main motivator, but workers also want to try new things and find out what they really like.
Experts say the trend should accelerate in the midst of rising prices and growing employment instability - a change in part by rapid technological changes, including the appearance of artificial intelligence.
According to an inquiry carried out by the Flea Market classifieds site, 82.1% of the 1,327 salaried workers said they are doing or considering secondary jobs. The main reason is low wages (55.1%) and the most popular type of work is the creation of content for social networks, such as blogs or youtube (20.2%), with average gains of about 620,000 wons per month.
A KB Financial Group report indicates that 54.8%of the 2,000 salaried workers were involved in parallel jobs - an increase of 12.8 percentage points compared to the same 2022 inquiry. The most common reasons include saving for emergencies (38.7%), using free time (18.7%) and covering subsistence expenses (13.2%).
A 37 -year -old engineer from one of Korea's largest conglomerates - who writes under the Pseudonym AMTUN on the Brunce Blog Platform - has tried several secondary work over the years.
“I struggled a lot, but one day I had a reality shock,” she said. "I was running fast in the corporate race, but I was taken by a feeling of emptiness. It made me wonder if spending my time so it was really worth it. So I started to turn a little off the company and look for a better balance between personal and professional life."
He bought a property of 80 million wons (almost half a million patacas), to renew, in the province of Gangwon and turned it into an Airbnb. “I love to travel and, abroad, I always enjoyed being in Airbnbs,” he said.
Living in Seoul hired someone to clean the property and only deals with reservations. It earned about 7 to 8 million wons per year (40,000 to 46,000 patacas) with it until recently, when the first child gave birth.
"It was something I really liked and thought it was significant, so I didn't feel so tired. I used to have a blog and be a representative of shopping abroad, but that seemed a second job full time."
“Managing an Airbnb offers more than just income. Give people space to rest. It means a lot to me,” he confessed.
Professor Lee Byung-Hon, honorary professor of sociology at Chung-Ang University, explained that the phenomenon stems from financial and cultural factors. "Firstly, people seek multi-unemployment because they are dissatisfied with the performance or meaning they get from their main work and want to prepare for something new," he said. "Second, people no longer see jobs as careers for life. They are mentally prepared to go out when it comes to height."
The teacher also pointed to deeper social roots. "The Korean education system doesn't help people find out what they like. Many only start asking these questions after entering the job market," he said.
From the employer's point of view, this trend may not reflect the ideal work ethics, Lee noted. "Companies want their employees to rest after working hours." However, the trend is expected to accelerate.
Unlike the twentieth century, jobs are now less safe and were interrupted by advances like AI. More people are likely to change job opportunities, instead of staying in a company for the rest of their lives, he said.
