Maria José de Freitas criticized the “secrecy” regarding the plans for this space, also stressing that it was important to understand concretely what fate should be given to the Portuguese-style houses in Coronel Mesquita. At the same time, the architect also regrets that the location of the association's new headquarters is not yet public. AAM president Christine Choi told this newspaper that she hopes to be able to announce and open the new space in December

Maria José de Freitas criticizes the “secrecy” surrounding the future of the building where the headquarters of the Association of Macau Architects (AAM) were located between 1998 and 2024, on Avenida do Coronel Mesquita, and which was recovered by the Government, without plans for the use of the space having been announced so far. “I think it should be known what the actual occupation of that house is and it should also be known where the headquarters of the Association of Architects will be, but I see some secrecy in this situation that I think should not exist, it does not benefit anyone”, he defended, speaking to the TRIBUNA DE MACAU newspaper.
From his perspective, these issues should be “overcome with more transparency”. “I'm curious to understand what the fate of that house will be, because, over time, it had been altered and modified by some of our colleagues, some who are no longer there, but they were small additions that allowed it to have a certain range of organization and functionalities inside, which were used by the Association”, explained Maria José de Freitas.
The architect noted that, since she has been in Macau, “the association has always been there”. "The house is representative, it has an extremely interesting modernist design, it is well designed and had a potential that allowed it to be used. I was sad that the association left there, I don't know where it is going, it is unknown, but it is a shame that it is not there", he stated.
Questioned several times by this newspaper, the president of AAM, Christine Choi, always postponed the announcement about the association's new space until later. To write this article, we asked again about the new location of the headquarters. Christine Choi now said she hopes that the announcement can be made next December, and that the headquarters can also open doors at that time.
At the same time, after the Government announced the restoration of that house, the TRIBUNA DE MACAU newspaper questioned the Cultural Institute (IC) about the future of the building. However, the organization led by Leong Wai Man limited itself to saying that “it is planning the housing complex on Avenida do Coronel Mesquita and will announce the plans in due course”. This newspaper asked the organization again about the future of that space, but did not receive a response by the time this edition closed.
Another aspect highlighted by Maria José de Freitas is precisely the planning of those houses on Avenida do Coronel Mesquita. “In general, the specific plan for occupying the houses of former administration employees is not known, although it is known that it will be in order to narrate the history of the site and promote places for cultural activities linked to workshops, artisanal products, among others”, he stressed.
In this sense, the architect considers that a “more plural and inclusive approach should be implemented, in order to equally integrate other communities in Macau society”. As he recalled, in the meetings he participated in regarding the Master Plan and the Heritage Safeguarding Plan, “many citizens complained about the lack of spaces for community meetings and spaces where the creative industries of music and theater were promoted... And I think that these houses could be used for this purpose”.
Maria José de Freitas argued that housing should be “more open”, allowing the participation of communities “not only with local characteristics, more Chinese, but also with Filipinos, Brazilians and many other nationalities that are represented in Macau”.
 
Heritage continues to be a cultural element that unites
For the architect, in Macau, heritage continues to be a cultural element that unites communities. "This is evident. My doctorate is exactly about the issue of Macau's multiculturalism, which was revealed at the time of the arrival of the Portuguese and which despite everything continues to be revealed, even with other participants of other nationalities (...) there are already many cultures present that with them also bring their knowledge, their culture and also in some way like to share it and are sharing it", he described.
Pointing out that the “cultural amalgam” has coexisted in the territory for centuries, Maria José de Freitas observed that “it is a situation loved and absorbed by the citizens of Macau, who are committed to its preservation”.
"This common ground that exists is a ground that has inscriptions, over time, of these different cultures living together, and we all inhabit it, and we all converge, and we all, in short, feel this cultural sharing with pleasure, and we continue to cultivate it. Luckily, the Central Government also agrees and, in some way, sponsors this situation", he continued.
The architect spoke, as an example, of the Lusofonia Festival that ends this weekend, next to the Casas Museu da Taipa. "This place is a place of cultural sharing. It's not just a question of strolling through the houses, it's also the small spaces that are gaining ground, linked to different cultures, everything that happens in the amphitheater, with the character of music, dance, theatrical event", he stated.
The theme of “heritage as a common language”, which can be used to promote peace and moderation, was discussed in Lumbini, Nepal, at the general assembly of the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS), in which Maria José de Freitas participated.
“The theme was related to conflicts, wars, situations that put heritage in danger and also the way in which heritage, as a common language, can be used to promote peace, moderation, coexistence between people”, he added. In his view, it was interesting that the discussion took place “in the place where the Buddha was born”.
ICOMOS was founded in 1965 following the publication of the Venice Charter in 1964. The general assembly also served to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the organization's founding.</description><pubDate>2025-10-31 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>IAS with no plans to expand child support allowance</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/ias-sem-planos-para-ampliar-subsidio-de-apoio-a-infancia/</link><description>The Government does not intend to increase the value of the child care allowance, nor even extend support to children up to six years old. The position was left by the president of the IAS, in response to a written question from deputy Ngan Iek Hang
 
Catarina Pereira
 
The president of the Institute of Social Action (IAS), Hon Wai, ruled out the possibility of increasing the amount of the child care subsidy or expanding the age range of those who receive this support. The plan, remember, was launched in July this year, and covers children up to three years of age, but several deputies have been asking for it to include children up to six years of age.
"As babies and children grow, they will benefit from Macau's education, medical care and other relevant welfare policies. The Macao SAR Government has, at this stage, no plans to increase the value of the child care allowance or extend the age range of beneficiaries", highlighted Hon Wai, in response to an inquiry from Ngan Iek Hang.
The support that the Government started granting in July is 18,000 patacas annually. Despite ruling out changes for now, the leader of the organization said that, “in the future, the Macao SAR Government will continue to monitor factors such as changes in the newborn population and the general economic situation in Macau, summarizing in a timely manner the experience and effectiveness of the implementation of the Plan, to carry out a comprehensive assessment and consideration of relevant policies”.
The Government launched the plan to respond to the declining birth rate in the territory and taking into account the additional expenses that families will face due to the needs of raising children. The idea was, then, to “alleviate the expenses of families with children through subsidies”, transmitting a “positive message to encourage birth rates”.
On the other hand, and also in response to the same deputy, but in another written question, Hon Wai indicated that daycare services currently have around 7,700 places, of which 69% are occupied by children under three years of age. As for the number of places available for children between the ages of two and three, it has already reached 100%. “In the future, the need for daycare services for children aged two years and under will be addressed, in order to provide adequate support for families with children”, he added.
Furthermore, he said, as of September, there were 22 daycare centers that provided urgent/temporary child care services. The fee is charged according to the full-day or half-day service rate, “in order to help guardians with urgent needs and who require the support of temporary care to provide care to children for a short period of time”.
In this context, the IAS says that it will maintain close communication with daycare centers regarding service requests, the evaluation process, fee charging methods, among others, in order to address the various possibilities for improvement. At the same time, the IAS is preparing the “Development Plan for Day Care Services from 2026 to 2030”, having collected opinions from the management entities of subsidized day care centers in the period from June to August 2025. According to Hon Wai, the organization intends to define the content of the “Plan” this year.
As for the “Standards Regulating the Installation and Operation of Daycare Centers”, which dictate that the recipients of daycare services are children who have not reached the age of four, the director opposed its change. Taking into account that children of various age groups have “different physiological or care needs”, Hon Wai stressed that this must be taken into account in daycare services. “For this reason, widening the age ranges of recipients of urgent/temporary child care services in daycare centers have not yet been considered,” he added.</description><pubDate>2025-10-31 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>MGM posted record revenue in the third quarter</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/mgm-registou-receitas-recorde-terceiro-trimestre/</link><description>Between January and September, MGM recorded operating earnings of 7.25 billion Hong Kong dollars, 5% more than in the same period in 2024. Analyzing only the third quarter, MGM's net revenue was 8.51 billion, while operating earnings reached 2.37 billion, two historic values ​​for the company
 
PEDRO MILHEIRÃO
In the first nine months of the year, MGM recorded earnings before interest, taxes, amortization and depreciation (EBITDA) of 7.25 billion Hong Kong dollars, corresponding to an increase of 5% in annual terms and 80% of the value recorded in the 2024 general calculation. Between January and September, the gaming operator recorded an annual growth of 7% in net revenues, with a total of 25.2 billion Hong Kong dollars.
Considering only the months of July to September, MGM's net revenue was 8.51 billion Hong Kong dollars, which means growth of 17.4% year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA, in these three months, was 2.37 billion Hong Kong dollars, which is equivalent to an increase of 19.6%, compared to the same period in 2024. Both values ​​set new records for third-quarter results in MGM's history, according to the concessionaire.
In the third quarter, the EBITDA margin, a profitability indicator that illustrates the relationship between net revenues and operating earnings, improved to 27.9%. This value is above the 27.4% recorded in the same period of the previous year, resulting from “a business focused on the masses” and a “continuous improvement in operational efficiency”, stated the company.
Between July and September, MGM's average daily gross gaming revenue rose 20%, “even despite the closure of casinos due to typhoons in September,” MGM explained. Average daily revenue from the mass market, including slot machines, grew by 17% compared to the same period in 2024. Furthermore, the combined number of daily visitors to MGM Macau and MGM Cotai increased by 17% year-on-year. In general, the daily number of visitors to Macau exceeded 113 thousand, corresponding to 5% above the pre-Covid period in 2019.
Throughout the third quarter, the MGM Macau resort alone recorded revenue of 3.39 billion Hong Kong dollars, up 11.7% year-on-year. Considering the same period of time, the project's EBITDA gains increased by 13.7%, to 914.4 million Hong Kong dollars. MGM Cotai, in turn, recorded revenues of 5.1 billion Hong Kong dollars, an annual increase of 22%. EBITDA earnings grew 23%, to almost 1.5 billion Hong Kong dollars.
On the other hand, compared to the quarter that ended in June, EBITDAR earnings, which include rental costs, fell 6%, and total revenues fell 2%, according to the online edition of “Inside Asian Gaming” magazine.
The market share of the MGM game in the Macao SAR rose to 15.5% in the third quarter, compared to 14.8% in the same period in 2024, above the 10% in the pre-pandemic period. However, between April and June, the operator's share was 16.6%.
At the end of September, the dealership's total liquidity was approximately 22.3 billion Hong Kong dollars, including cash, cash and credit lines.
Kenneth Feng, executive director of the dealership, said the group is “delighted to see MGM China have a record third quarter.” “With more non-gaming entertainment events taking place in Macau, we believe that visitors will have many more reasons to visit and continue to drive the growth of the Macau market”, said the official.
Furthermore, in September, the group participated in the Macau street promotion, together with the Tourism Services Department, which took place in Lisbon. “We jointly presented the unique appeal of Macau as a World Tourism and Leisure Center, as well as fostering exchange and cooperation in tourism, culture and trade between Macau and Portugal”, highlighted MGM.</description><pubDate>2025-10-31 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>“Civic Pulse” wants to “echo” the cultural agenda of Lusophony</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/civic-pulse-quer-fazer-eco-da-agenda-cultural-da-lusofonia/</link><description>José Basto da Silva recently launched the “Civic Post” page, with the intention of grouping advertisements for the Portuguese community's recreational and cultural activities in a single site. Starting from an idea considered “for a long time”, the purpose of the platform is to help both the public and event organizers, as he told TRIBUNA DE MACAU
 
PEDRO MILHEIRÃO
José Basto da Silva is the author of the recently launched website “Civic Post”, a platform through which the Macanese intends to bring together all the cultural events of the Portuguese-speaking community, in one place. In addition to contributing to their dissemination, Basto da Silva also wants to help organizing entities to avoid overlapping events on the same dates, for the benefit of the public.
As the author explains, “the project consists of a website where people can access, in a single site, information about local events, more specifically, events organized by associations or groups based in Portugal, which can be available in different locations”. “Another issue has to do with the fact that our community, of Portuguese origin, and I'm not just referring to Portuguese speakers, is very present and vibrant”, highlights Basto da Silva to the TRIBUNA DE MACAU newspaper.
"For example, the Rui Cunha Foundation organizes many events and usually promotes it through Facebook. Casa de Portugal does too. But even though they use the same platform, the information is not on the same page", laments José Basto da Silva. “A person has to go and see [the page] of the Foundation, or Casa de Portugal, or the Macau International Institute, or ADM”. “Then there are still cases in which events are announced by email or are on the organizations’ own pages and, therefore, the information is dispersed.”
“One of the comments I have heard, recurrently over the years, is that there are many activities organized by associations, not just Portuguese ones”, says Basto da Silva. "So many activities are organized. Sometimes, some associations don't even know what the others are doing."
"They can be events, book launches, which happen on the same day, at the same time, in different places. This has happened several times. The [Rui Cunha] Foundation is launching one and, in the meantime, there is another launch at Clube Militar. Or in the Portuguese bookstore." "It becomes difficult for us, the community, to enjoy and participate in all the events that may be of interest. That's where this idea came from."
José Basto da Silva also confessed that it was a project that “he had in mind for a long time”. "I came on vacation, the opportunity arose, things came together. And now, taking advantage of artificial intelligence tools, it's much easier. As long as a person has ideas and the desire to do something, they can create many interesting things."
Another objective of the project was to create a more community space, according to Basto da Silva. “The main characteristic of this website is that it does not have a centralized organization, that is, anyone in the community, as long as they register on the website, can create a record of an event”, he explains. "Someone launched an event on Facebook and I saw the announcement. I can go to the 'Civic Pulse' website and reference that event. I put the poster, the title and a description there. If it exists, just copy a 'link', date, time and location. Something that takes less than a minute to create. The events are organized by the entities. The community has here, let's say, a platform where it echoes the events it discovers."
In the platform's community guidelines, it is requested that it not be used for commercial or political promotion purposes. “As moderator of the page, I was careful to create a usage policy.” "Do not use this site for politics or self-promotion. It is to help publicize events", highlights José Basto da Silva. “Doing politics, advertising campaigns for one or another product or self-promotion, no”, reiterates the creator of the page. “As the site administrator, I can go there and, if there has been misuse, delete the record.”
Regarding the investment, the author of the project assumes that he is paying out of “his own pocket”. “It’s something I do for the benefit of the Portuguese community in Macau, taking into account my own financial availability”. “The fact that it is community-managed also reduces [financial] and time costs”. “The fact that people get more involved is also an advantage”, he highlights.
As for the effects of the platform, Basto da Silva hopes that the investment “will be of some use”. "Promotes inclusion, diversity of interests. This site is not just for Portuguese speakers." "That's why I was careful to use English. I want it to be inclusive and diverse", he asserts.
Regarding the reception from the community, the Macanese reveals himself to be “a bit surprised”. "I have received messages from organizations congratulating me, saying that the idea was good and that it is useful. In fact, people are already organizing events." “It seems to me that they are having a good impression of this page and that it is capable of working”.
Regarding new projects or features for the website, José Basto da Silva claims to have “more ideas”, still in development. However, he assumes that he will talk about them after they are completed. “I prefer to talk less and do more”, he concludes.</description><pubDate>2025-10-31 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Trump reduces tariffs on China and promises to strengthen cooperation after meeting with Xi</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/actual/trump-reduz-tarifas-a-china-promete-reforco-da-cooperacao-apos-encontro-xi/</link><description>epa12492356 US President Donald Trump (L) and Chinese President Xi Jinping (C) emerge from their talks at the Naraemaru reception hall inside an Air Force base in Busan, South Korea, 30 October 2025. EPA/YONHAP SOUTH KOREA OUT



The North American President announced yesterday, after meeting with his Chinese counterpart, that he will reduce tariffs on China imposed due to fentanyl from 20% to 10%, promising bilateral cooperation in several areas. Donald Trump and Xi Jinping concluded a bilateral meeting lasting around two hours at an air base in Busan, in the south of South Korea, marked by promises of cooperation, gestures of detente in the trade war and an agreement for a new meeting in 2026.
Upon leaving the meeting, Donald Trump stated that Washington and Beijing “will work together” to end the war in Ukraine. The American leader also revealed that he did not address the issue of Taiwan during the conversation with Xi. “It was not discussed,” he said, fulfilling what he had already anticipated the day before, when he indicated that he would only address the topic if Xi did so.
Trump announced that, following the meeting, he will reduce the tariffs he imposed this year on China from 20% to 10% in response to its role in fentanyl trafficking. “We had an incredible meeting,” declared the Republican, aboard Air Force One, on his way back to Washington. “I believe they will help us with fentanyl,” he said, referring to commitments made by Beijing.
Also according to Trump, an agreement was reached for China to resume purchasing North American soybeans, suspended since May in the context of the trade war between the two countries. The issue has particular political weight for Trump, who has strong support among rural US voters.
The North American leader said that he will meet Xi Jinping again in April 2026, this time on Chinese territory.
The meeting took place at a military base adjacent to Busan international airport and was attended by several senior US officials, including the Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, the Secretary of the Treasury, Scott Bessent, the trade representative Jamieson Greer and the US ambassador in Beijing, David Perdue.
Trump and Xi left the building where the talks took place together, exchanged words at the door and said goodbye with a handshake. Xi was the first to leave the site.
In his opening statement, Trump welcomed what he classified as a reunion with “a friend” and stressed that both had already agreed “on many things”. Xi Jinping said that “it is normal for the world's two main economies to have friction from time to time”, but that China and the US “are fully capable of prospering together”.
The American President also declared that “there are no longer any restrictions on rare earths”, referring to the measures imposed by Beijing in retaliation for US tariffs. China is the world's main supplier of these essential metals for the technology, military and energy industries.
The Chinese Ministry of Commerce confirmed that “it will suspend for one year the application of the export control measures in question, announced on October 9, and will study and improve specific plans”.
The meeting between the two leaders took place on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit, which officially begins today, in Gyeongju, about 76 kilometers from Busan. Xi will remain in South Korea to participate in the event, while Trump has already returned to Washington.
Despite the cordial tone of the summit and signs of rapprochement in specific areas, analysts warn that structural differences between Washington and Beijing remain, especially regarding the control of sensitive technologies, the geopolitics of Asia-Pacific and the rivalry for global economic dominance.
 
Xi says he has reached consensus with Trump and calls for a speedy conclusion
Xi Jinping claimed to have reached consensus during the meeting with Donald Trump and called for the results of the negotiations to be “finalized as soon as possible”. “The economic and trade teams of China and the US held in-depth discussions and reached consensus on solutions to problems,” said Xi, quoted by the official Chinese news agency Xinhua. “The two teams must now improve and complete the follow-up work as quickly as possible (…) and present concrete results, in order to reassure the economies of China, the USA and the world”, he added.

The measure, according to the director of Health Services, is part of the policy of “optimizing the community healthcare network”
 
VÍTOR REBELO
 
The Government has an area of ​​150 square meters to carry out a future expansion of services at the Tap Seac Health Center. The space was reserved at the Cultural Institute's facilities, located next to the Center, said the director of Health Services (SSM) in response to a question from deputy Leong Hong Sai. Alvis Lo said that this expansion arises out of necessity, “after evaluating the development of services at the Tap Seac Health Center”.
At the same time, in the response to the deputy, he states that the SSM continue to evaluate, in the areas surrounding that Health Center, suitable locations that could serve as spaces to provide services. The authorities promise to study “in a timely manner” an “optimization plan in accordance with real needs, in order to provide a complete and efficient response to the health care needs of residents of this area”.
According to Alvis Lo, the expansion is part of the policy of “responsing to the demand for medical services by the population in different areas”, with the Government “optimizing the network of community health care services”.
In collaboration with non-profit medical institutions, the SSM are preparing work to launch the “Chronic Disease Management Program”, which aims to gradually transfer chronically ill patients in stable condition from health centers for follow-up in consultations at community institutions. This plan will first begin at the Tap Seac Health Center, and will be successively extended to centers located in other community neighborhoods in Macau.
Alvis Lo recalled, however, that, in recent years, several health centers have been completed and started operating, namely in Ilha Verde, Praia do Manduco, Seac Pai Van, as well as in the New Neighborhood of Macau in the Deep Cooperation Zone between Guangdong and Macau in Hengqin. The objective, he says, is to “expand the coverage of health care services and improve their accessibility”.
The SSM intend, “through the adoption of a series of measures”, to encourage residents to proactively manage their health, in order to cultivate a healthy habit of “early screening and treatment”.
In addition, “work on the prevention and treatment of chronic diseases, including cancers, will be further strengthened to increase the provision of community health care services, and promote diversified development, in order to ensure the health and well-being of the entire population”, highlights the response to Leong Hong Sai.</description><pubDate>2025-10-31 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Registration requests increase for brands and decrease for patents</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/pedidos-de-registo-aumentam-nas-marcas-descem-nas-patentes/</link><description>In the first half of this year, the number of patent registration requests fell by 11%, compared to the same period in 2024, official data indicates. Similarly, requests for extensions of existing patents and registration of product designs also decreased. On the other hand, there were another 1,045 submissions to register trademarks
 
PEDRO MILHEIRÃO
Between January and June, 31 patent registration applications were made in the Macao SAR, translating into an annual drop of 11%. These requests corresponded to 24 applications for invention patents and seven for utility patents, according to data from the Directorate of Economic and Technological Development Services (DSEDT) analyzed by the TRIBUNA DE MACAU newspaper. In the same period, 518 invention patent extensions were requested, 50 fewer than in the first half of 2024. However, it is important to note that, overall last year, 1,359 patent extension requests were submitted, a record number since 2004.
As distinguished by the DSEDT, an invention patent is a “presentation of a new technical project in relation to the product, method or its improvement”, while a utility patent “refers to new technical schemes of shapes, structures or their combination in a product”. Both categories grant the holders an “exclusive right to patents, inventions and creations within a period stipulated by law”, explains DSEDT.
“It is a component of intellectual property and an invisible intangible asset”, which can be “inherited and transferred during its period of validity, like tangible assets”. Both types of patents emphasize attributes such as “improvement of functions, adopted technologies, manufacturing techniques, user convenience” of a given product. Generally, an invention patent is valid for 20 years, while a utility patent is valid for only 10.
Until June, requests for registration of product designs and models fell by almost half, with only 115 being requested, compared to 213 in the first half of last year. In general, 2024 was the year in which the most requests for registration of designs and models were submitted (385).
Conversely, between January and June 2025, there were 1,045 more trademark registration applications, for a total of 8,561, translating into annual growth of 14%, the data indicates.
A brand, or a “distinctive”, is “a type of sign that allows consumers to adequately distinguish the products or services of one company from those of other companies”, according to the DSEDT definition. This sign can be “one or more of a word, letter, number, drawing or figure or several sets of colors, as well as a three-dimensional design, for example, the shape of the container or packaging of the product, and may also be sound”.
In turn, designs and models are their own product that “translates into an appearance of all or part of the product and is made up of shapes, figures, colors or combinations thereof”. Designs and models refer to product concepts whose aesthetic characteristics are “capable of having industrial application”. Furthermore, “they place more emphasis on the aesthetic sensation and artistic nature of creativity in order to increase the competitiveness of products in the market”.
As the organization distinguishes, “brand support does not have to be a product, but support for designs and models must be a product”. When granted, the validity period for registering a design or model is 25 years from the date of the request.
Finally, in the first six months, two registrations were also requested for the name and emblem of establishments, compared to the only request made in the first half of 2024.
Recently, DSEDT and the National Directorate of Intellectual Property (DNPI) signed the “Agreement for Deepening Exchange and Cooperation in the Area of ​​Intellectual Property Rights”, as reported by this newspaper. In this agreement, cooperation between the two parties was also added in the “Pilot Project for Priority Examination of Qualified Invention Patent Applications Submitted by MSAR Applicants in Mainland China”.</description><pubDate>2025-10-31 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>IC wants to facilitate access to library resources</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/ic-quer-facilitar-acesso-aos-recursos-das-bibliotecas/</link><description>????????????????????????????????????



The Cultural Institute is studying the feasibility of making the number of book requests more flexible, among other aspects, in order to increase the ease of use of library resources. The organization also intends to continue installing lockers for collecting books in schools, which are currently present in 12 educational institutions
 
The Cultural Institute (IC) intends to increase the ease of access to library resources for the population, and is therefore analyzing several hypotheses. From the outset, he revealed that he is studying the feasibility of making the number of book requests outside the library and the number of request renewals more flexible. Furthermore, it also intends to “continue to expand the number of electronic book platforms and the number of collections, reinforce promotional work and respond, in a more flexible way, to the needs of different groups of readers”.
As for the Automated Book Collection Lockers installed in educational institutions, in collaboration with the Education Services, the president of the IC, Leong Wai Man, indicated that they currently cover 12 schools, compared to initially only six. “In the future, depending on the space conditions and usage needs of libraries and schools, the respective facilities will gradually be expanded in order to expand the service coverage area, further increasing the ease of use of library resources”, he stressed, in response to a question from Ho Ion Sang.
Public libraries, a total of seven, also have Automated Lockers for Book Collection. These include new facilities for the Patane Library in 2025, according to what can be seen in the response.
On the other hand, Leong Wai Man said that, taking into account the reconstruction of the building where the Red Market Library is located, the IC is “actively evaluating all possible projects, with a view to meeting the reading needs of the area's inhabitants”.
The IC president also recalled the activities that the organization has organized regarding the promotion of reading, both in schools and in the community. Specifically, he spoke about the Family Book Fair, the “Reading Program for Babies and Children” and the “Activity between parents and children – having fun reading at home”, among other illustrated book projects and writing workshops.

Works by Paganini, Saint-Saëns, Massenet and Sarasate will be interpreted and transformed “into a living and pulsating experience, full of emotional depth and technical mastery”, according to the Cultural Institute (IC).
To commemorate the 120th anniversary of the birth of Xian Tribute will be paid to the “musical giant”, who “awakened the fervor and hope of an era through his stirring melodies, powerful emotional resonance and deep national feeling”.
The Macau Orchestra will also perform the pieces “Alegria”, by local composer Lam Bun-Ching, and “The Firebird” by Stravinsky, “a work that revolutionized the orchestral panorama of the 20th century”, says the press release.
On November 8th, violinist Daniel Hope will lead the Gstaad Festival Orchestra, from Switzerland, with interpretations of “The Four Seasons” by Antonio Vivali and Max Ritcher, in a “timeless celebration of beauty and innovation”.

Before the show, a conversation about the “essence of the concert” will be organized at 7pm, with the participation of professional music critic Edison Hung. Additional tickets for the concert are now available at the “Enjoy Macao” Ticket Office.
Among the additional activities of the “Festival Extra”, the documentary “Crescendo”, by Heather Wilk, stands out as part of the “Música na Tela: Cinemateca Paixão” series.

The Tourism Bureau (DST) has partnered with South Korean credit card companies to launch a “Macao edition” of a debit card with access to discounts on travel bookings and activities in the city. A video featuring a Korean actor and other promotions were released together to continue raising Macao's profile as a preferred destination and expanding the Asian country's visitor market.
In a joint effort between DST, “KB Kookmin Card” and “Mastercard Korea”, the first card “KB Kookmin Travelers Check Card – Macao Edition” was launched this month. “Kookmin Card”, a subsidiary of “KB Financial Group”, is one of the leading credit card companies in South Korea, providing a range of financial services, including travel debit cards, a type of card increasingly used by Koreans when traveling abroad.
In addition to the basic benefits of the “KB Kookmin Travelers Check Card”, the “Macao edition” provides exclusive privileges for products related to tourism in Macau. Through collaboration with large companies and establishments in the territory's tourism sector, the card gives access to designated discounts for online reservations for plane tickets and hotels, as well as benefits when in the city, including restaurants and activities such as resident shows.
The promotion has been made through a “lifestyle” video starring Korean actor Chae Jong-hyeop in Macau, in a co-production between DST and “Mastercard Korea” and the magazine “Marie Claire Korea”, to show the attraction of the destination.
“KB Kookmin Card” is also promoting the card on social media and other platforms, including initiatives in which participants can win round-trip tickets between South Korea and Macau. Special physical cards decorated with silhouettes of Macau's cultural heritage buildings were also issued.

Among the highlights, visitors will be able to find a “pot with lid in blue and white porcelain with brocade pattern” from the Yongle Emperor Period and a “kendi in porcelain decorated in blue underglaze in the shape of a phoenix” from the Ming Dynasty. Both pieces fuse Chinese and foreign cultural characteristics.
Other highlights are the porcelain with Portuguese heraldry from the Oriente Museum, the image of the “Big Yellow Book” document from the Ajuda Library and the export porcelain fragments excavated in Macau. “With high historical and artistic value”, these artefacts take the public “to transcend time and space over four centuries, to feel up close the tangible artefacts and the spiritual essence of the Sino-Portuguese cultural fusion”, highlights the IC.
From November 15th, there will be guided tours in Cantonese on weekends and holidays, and booking of these services will also be available. O MAM encontra-se aberto, com entrada gratuita, entre as 10h00 e as 19h00, todos os dias exceptuando às segundas-feiras.
The IC will also organize a series of activities throughout the exhibition period. On November 8th, at 3pm, Rafael Alfenim, a ceramics specialist, will lead the lecture “Blue Traces: the influence of Chinese porcelain on Portuguese ceramics since the 16th century”, with translation into Mandarin.
Between November 15th and 23rd, the “Guangcai Porcelain Painting Workshop” and the “Engraving Workshop for Young People” will be held, in order to “encourage the transmission of the beauty of traditional crafts through practical creation”. The IC informs that registration for activities can be done through the Single Account, and participants will be selected by draw.
Furthermore, the Macau Chinese Orchestra will perform at the MAM exhibition gallery, on the 9th of November and 21st of December, at 4pm, and interpret “the beauty of the fusion of Sino-Portuguese culture through music”.

In a statement, he said that “in the face of increasing pressures and risks” and after “cautious consideration”, he decided to close after the 150th edition, also announcing that he will launch a special paper edition, to take stock of the topics he has followed over the last 10 years. On December 20th, the website and online platforms will no longer be updated with news, thematic reports and exclusive columns. The note states that since October last year, in some official activities, the entry of AAM journalists for news coverage has been restricted. In April this year, reporters from the publication were prevented from entering the Legislative Assembly. “Three of our journalists were associated with involvement in crimes due to this situation, and could be charged”, he pointed out, adding that, this month, the Social Communication Office informed the newspaper that, according to the Press Law, “All About Macau” “no longer has the legal conditions to carry out its respective activities”, which is why “the registration number of the monthly newspaper was cancelled”. "AAM has depended on advertising revenue and reduced reader subscriptions, as well as a small amount of donations to maintain limited operations. Given the scarcity of resources, increasing external pressures, and the situation in which our journalists have to deal with legal proceedings, our team realizes that it would be difficult to maintain the quality of news and reports, so we could only make this difficult decision", it can be read. Stating that the closure is just “a phase”, the publication calls on readers to continue “safeguarding civic society (…) and freedom of expression in the territory” and emphasizes that publishing professionals have only been fighting for the rights enshrined in the Basic Law.</description><pubDate>2025-10-31 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>South Korea discovers 4th century tomb, perhaps from the Kingdom of Silla</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/lazer/coreia-sul-descobre-tumulo-seculo-iv-talvez-reino-de-silla/</link><description>For the first time, the remains of a military commander from the Kingdom of Silla (57 BC-935 AD) were found, along with fragments of his gilded bronze crown, armor and helmet, in a significant advance in the study of the ancient Korean kingdom. The artifacts were discovered in the first outer tomb, dating from the 4th and 5th centuries, beneath a royal tomb in Hwangnam-dong, Gyeongju.

The excavation, led by the Korean Heritage Service (KHS) in partnership with the city of Gyeongju, unearthed artifacts from Hwangnam-dong archaeological site No. 120, a large wooden tomb chamber covered in stone and earth. Below it, archaeologists confirmed the existence of an ancient outer tomb, where the commander's skeleton was found along with a long sword, presumably marking his elite military status.
“This is a rare moment, showing the public a complete set of commander armor for both man and horse,” said KHS administrator Huh Min at a press conference at the site.
“It is an invaluable opportunity to witness a historical reality – even the commander’s teeth were found”, he highlighted.
The opening is timed to coincide with the 2025 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit, and the burial site and artifacts are open to the public until this Saturday.
The main chamber of Hwangnam-dong's outer tomb No. 1 housed the commander's remains and weapons, while an adjacent chamber contained a skeleton, probably that of a chamberlain who served the commander closely during his lifetime and was buried next to him in a vassal sacrifice.
The discovery also included a rare example of horse armor – only the second of its kind found in a Silla tomb – offering a clearer picture of Silla's heavy cavalry and military organization in the 5th century.
“Analyzing the wear on the teeth, we estimate that the commander was around 30 years old,” said researcher Lee Min-hyung, who works with the Silla Cultural Heritage Research Institute. “Traces of a human figure were also detected above the horse's saddle, although there are only faint traces,” he revealed.
The armor set provides important information about the military hierarchy. Researchers noted that the lower part of the armor was made of leather – a different design from a similar discovery from 2009 – reflecting status and functionality.
“This is only the second set of Silla armor confirmed to date,” said one researcher, adding that “the leather components suggest attempts to make the armor lighter, while also indicating the extremely high status of the wearer – probably one of the top commanders of his time.”
Significantly, the gilded bronze crown fragments in the tomb may be the oldest of their kind ever found from the Silla period. The decorative elements on the crown resemble those of Goguryeo (37 BC- 668 AD), suggesting cultural exchanges or influence between the two kingdoms.
"When we excavated Hwangnamdaechong's tomb earlier, earrings believed to have been made in Goguryeo were found at the queen's burial site," said researcher Kim Hun-suk of the Gyeongju National Cultural Heritage Research Institute.
“Now, similar patterns appear on this crown, further indicating the influence of Goguryeo on Silla during the tomb construction period,” he pointed out.
The discovery sheds new light on the transition of burial practices in Silla from wooden coffins to more complex stone-covered tombs, offering rare archaeological insights into the ruling elite of early Silla.
