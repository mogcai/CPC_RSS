In this context, “the whole paradigm of support for families” will be “different,” said the secretary yesterday for social affairs and culture. On the other hand, LAM has announced a series of new measures to deal with a future marked by a quarter of the aged population
 
Currently, the birth rate in Macao is 0.8%, the secretary noted for social and culture affairs, warning that local society is marked by the low number of births. According to it, the rate could become “super low” in 2029.
"This will not only lead to the change in the distribution of social resources but will also accentuate the load of the entire elderly care system," said Lam, in the debate of the governmental action lines. "And all our families support paradigm will also be different," he continued, stressing that the government expects to improve work on three strands.
First, in order to relieve the pressure of young parents, the executive will launch the childhood assistance allowance -whose registration opens from summer holidays -as well as raising the birth allowance to 6,500 patacas.
Then, it will be “well prepared” measures and complementary facilities for support for birth and childhood assistance. Namely in terms of medical services, subsidy for medically assisted procreation, which "has been well received by women of adequate age to have children," and "good health care for women and children."
Finally, the secretary highlighted the implementation of “best friendly policies in the family,” including awareness to encourage men and women to join the housework together.
LAM also stated that a plan will be prepared for the improvement of day care centers. In addition to discussing the issue of demand for children under two years old, the government intends to continually provide training opportunities for day care centers to obtain licenses to exercise the profession, as well as introduce a mechanism and criteria for evaluating services.
The secretary also pointed out that 14.6% of the population is over 65 years old, a rate that should increase to 21.4% in 2029, higher than the criterion of a society such as “super aged”, and will reach 24.8% in 2041, almost a quarter of the population. "It is necessary to all society to think and deal with the question together, while the government will have to develop work systematically," he said.
The LAM highlighted the goal, before society becomes super aged, a “circle of community care for elderly for 15 to 20 minutes”, which means that in that time a service entity can be found for this layer of the population.
Regarding the elderly homes, he said that "there is a lot of work to do." The intention is to build more homes, including in Zone A, with 1,100 vacancies; Another solution is, based on social consensus, to assign some land to the private sector to build homes. In addition, the authorities will seek “homes” in neighboring regions. LAM indicated that the waiting time for a vacancy is 16 months.
"Aging society has no longer involved the issue of disease treatment and began to imply nursing throughout the life cycle," he said. In this sense, it has revealed that community health care centers may be created where teams composed of nurses, social workers and rehabilitation therapists can provide chronic disease management services.
Another hypothesis is the model of “hired family nurse”, responsible for periodically providing nursing services to the elderly at home, together with the measure of forming “health caregivers” to support families.
On the other hand, in addition to wanting to launch instructions for the elderly housing design, the government has already begun to survey and register those who are in a situation of isolation and the families in which both are elderly. About the matter, LAM added that those who have mobility difficulties can live with caregivers at the residence for the elderly, who still have “enough” fractions.
In any case, he pointed out that the entry of Macao in a “super aging” society will foster “many new jobs” such as “health assistants and homework delivery”.
 
Studied legislation for environment without barriers
Also according to LAM, the government will soon begin a preliminary study on the legislation for the environment without a bar, with a view to regulating private works. The idea is that they include, in addition to the situation of people with physical disabilities, the needs of the visually and hearing impaired, and also thinking about the travel of the elderly.
In addition, LAM noted that the Institute of Social Action is reviewing the mechanism for adjusting the value of social risk, hoping that it will be completed later this year. The government will also begin to study, in the second half, the viability of the pension for the elderly to be linked to the value of social risk. In addition, it plans to disseminate the result of the study on the introduction of a “price index in elderly consumers” this year.
On the other hand, a revision report on non -compulsory central social security is already ready, whose results will be disclosed “in due time”. According to the Social Security Fund, the report approves the transfer of the regime to a mandatory nature. However, the unequal rhythm of economic recovery makes a more comprehensive consideration.</description><pubDate>2025-04-29 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Bela Vista and Art of Bessmertny come together to value heritage</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/bela-vista-arte-de-bessmertny-juntam-se-para-valorizar-patrimonio/</link><description>An exhibition of works by Konstantin Bessmertny began a cycle of presentation of artistic works that, for some time, will integrate the furniture of the historic building Bela Vista. The idea, according to consul general Alexandre Leitão is, at the same time, "to spread the art of authors of the great bay and promote the historical building." The doors of the consular residence will be open to the public on May 3 and, in the future, the initiative may be extended

A first experience of joining art and cultural heritage was launched inside Bela Vista, a building that has gone through history by multiple occupations and, for several years, is the consular residence. The first event of the exhibition cycle entitled “Bela Vista by…” has already had an earlier “vernissage”, which was essentially had people linked to the art of Macau and Hong Kong, but also with other guests, as elements of the consular area advisory council, including communities advisers.
During the ceremony there was also a short action of Portuguese guitar musicians Paulo Soares and Rui Poço Ferreira, who last Saturday gave a concert at the D. Pedro V. Theater.
The show is part of a dozen works by artist Konstantin Bessmertny, who temporarily will constitute members of the decoration of that building.
According to the Portuguese consul general to Macao and Hong Kong, “this is a way to promote art and cultural appreciation at the same time”, in this case, “disseminating the art of authors of the Great Bay, and not only, and disseminating the historical building”, through a “dynamic” exhibition, to which artists are challenged to expose their works to solo.
"It seems that it makes perfect sense to give those who work here, in the area of ​​the Great Bay," he said, adding: "Our goal is not to come people from Portugal or other countries, but from Macao and the Great Bay, because it can be interesting even in this line of cultural diplomacy, of public diplomacy, which we also have to go on."
Considering that it is important to "reach the market and the people of mainland and Hong Kong," he stresses that this "is the logic of the great bay and so we want to contribute modestly to this Macau's effort to attract attention and bring visitors from the region and beyond."
Show and visit on May 3rd
Alexandre Leitão and Konstantin Bessmertny then decided to give a more artistic image to the interior of Bela Vista, there exposing painting works that could be appreciated by the public on May 3, Saturday, in a period of four hours, between 15h00 and 19h00.
"We will do this day the opening of Bela Vista so that people, through pre-registration, can freely visit the social areas of the building and enjoy the works of art of this recognized artist from Macau, who are dispersed by various rooms," the ambassador told the Jornal Tribuna de Macao, for those who would be a good opportunity for those who would like to see the building inside.
The display of the nine frames and a screen, with oil paintings on canvas, will remain for a while and will later be possibly before the end of the year, replaced by productions of another artist. It will therefore be an exposure of turnover.
“Our idea is to do for an open -door journey now, but with the possibility of other days they can also receive the visit of people, all depending on receptivity,” explained Alexandre Leitão.
On the other hand, this week will be launched a virtual visit, both from the exhibition and the social areas of Bela Vista.
“À medida que formos coleccionando essas visitas virtuais, ficamos com um espólio, podendo assim contribuir, já que temos à nossa disposição um património notável, para valorizar todo o património de origem e matriz portuguesa de Macau”, sublinha o representante de Portugal na RAEM, sustentando que “esse é um dos grandes trunfos de Macau, até como produto turístico e cultural, com efeitos económicos, porque é aquilo que torna Macau absolutamente Unique, not only in China, but in the region. ”
The exact year of building the building is unknown, thinking it was around 1870. It was sold to British Captain William Clarke and his wife Catherine Hannack, being converted into a hotel in 1890. As the hotel unit was surrounded by beautiful landscapes, it was known as "Hotel Boa Vista". In 1936, it was called “Hotel Bela Vista”.
After changing ownership several times, the building was used as a school, refugee camp and English retreat house, ending up being used again as a hotel. He closed on March 29, 1999 to be converted at the official residence of the Portuguese Consul-General in Macao.
In summer last year, the residence was filmed for the production of a Netflix movie. “Here you can see the curiosity that the building awakens,” said Alexandre Leitão.
 
Miscellaneous Oil Paintings on Screen
In turn, Konstantin Bessmertny said that this is an idea that he himself applied to old buildings throughout his career, specifically in cities such as Lisbon, London and Hong Kong, and is now put into practice in Macao, Bela Vista.
“After some attempts, I managed to convince the consul to make this kind of exhibitions in such a historical place, from so many memories to many of those who have already visited the building,” the artist began to say to this newspaper.
Patent -screen oil work in Bela Vista are diverse, presenting details of the ruins of São Paulo and Praia Grande, as well as highlighting an interiors of a traditional Hong Kong house, Japanese elements and fictitious images of Napoleon Bonaparte suns away on Thailand beach. The Biombo is a painting about the "Battle of Macao".
About the virtual show, Bessmertny said it was an experience performed at the height of the pandemic. "I want with all this to contribute to the cultural richness of Portugal here in Macau. I, who have been Russian of birth and education, alive in the territory since 1992 and know very well Lisbon and Alcobaça, where I work at various heights of the year," he said.
The artist, who has presented work in international renowned galleries, such as the Kong Kong Art Basel, has scheduled for Japan in September this year, an exhibition with paintings about Macau.
 
Photography works will mark the history of the building
A photographs show from the Bela Vista, Interior or abroad building, especially from the times when it was used as a hotel and then when it had other functions, will be organized by the end of the year at the consular residence. Consul-General, Alexandre Leitão, wants to collect work from various times and for this he appeals to those who have these old photos “to share them”, in order to gather as many works as possible to the exhibition and have a collection of documentation related to that building.</description><pubDate>2025-04-29 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Cultural and sports sector will have new spaces</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/sector-cultural-desportivo-tera-novos-espacos/</link><description>Two or three lots will be used for the area of ​​sport, by provisional way, according to the secretary for social affairs and culture. LAM also revealed that several Portuguese -style houses on Colonel Mesquita Avenue will soon be opened to use the cultural sector

Decoration of less restrictive restaurants in buffer zones
The revision of the cultural heritage safeguard law, scheduled for this year, aims to “properly download restrictions” to restoration facades decoration works in the world heritage buffer zones, said the secretary for social and culture affairs. Defending being “necessary” the revision of the law, LAM stressed that this process will focus on optimizing the prior license of work and commercial operations. According to the president of the Cultural Institute (IC), except cases involving picturesque streets or very close to places of cultural heritage, the body has given answers “without opinions” to 95% of requests for facades remodeling works of establishments in the buffer zones. Thus, Leong Wai Man considers that there are conditions to relieve restrictions, abolishing the obligation of IC opinions.</description><pubDate>2025-04-29 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>“Pico” of the Golden Week scheduled for May 3</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/pico-da-semana-dourada-previsto-para-3-de-maio/</link><description>Golden Week associated with Labor Day holidays is approaching and the authorities predict that Macao's entries and exits fluctuate between 3.4 and 3.5 million, ie a daily movement of 680,000 and 700,000 people.

The Government has set up a Working Group to Monitor The Blackout Affecting Portugal from North to South and Nother European Countries, Noting That the Problem "May Have Originated" Outside Portugal. Tiago Petinga/Lusa



A "massive" blackout continued to affect the entire Iberian Peninsula at the time of the closing of this edition, preventing the normal operation of airports, trains and other means of transportation, telecommunications, hospitals, banks and numerous services. Some areas of southern France also suffered partial cuts, but the problem lasted a short time.
In Portugal, REN - National Energy Networks indicated that, following the cut, which impacted continental territory “from 11:33”, the restoration plans were being activated by energy supply stages, coordinating with European energy producers and operators. At the same time, the possible causes of this incident were being evaluated.
The prime minister stated that "everything points" that the origin of the energy failure is in the interconnection with Spain and, admitting that "nothing is away," he considered that there is no indication of a cyber attack. "We know that the origin was not in Portugal. We have our interconnection with Spain and it all points out that it was where this whole situation originated, but I do not want to be speculating," said Luís Montenegro in the middle of a meeting of the Council of Ministers before moving to Ren, adding to be done joint work with the Spanish government.
Montenegro said he hoped the electricity could be restored "in the next few hours." "We expect that from the Bode Castle Center and the tapada do Outeiro the entire electric production system in Portugal can be activated," he said, regretting an “episode that plagues a lot of what is the daily life of the Portuguese.”
Medical emergency hospitals and services in Portugal were operating with emergency generators, which were also activated at airports. The National Civil Aviation Authority said that the contingency plans of national airports were activated, and asked passengers to "not go to airports." Still, the conditioning of Lisbon airport has left thousands of people abroad, and no one can enter.
In turn, the operator of the Electric Spanish Electric Network warned that the total restoration of the energy would take between “6 and 10 hours” and asked to avoid “speculation” about the cause of the blackout, which is still under investigation. In Spain, rail traffic was interrupted throughout the chain and, as in Portugal, traffic jams and lines were recorded at the door of stores and markets.
Already in Brussels, the European Commission said it was "in contact" with the Portuguese and Spanish authorities to "understand the underlying causes" of the blackout. The executive vice president of the European Commission, Teresa Ribera, said there were no evidence of cybership in the mass cut in the electric supply in the Iberian Peninsula, but in a "of the largest failures in the system" in the European Union.

The Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge, the longest sea crossing in the world, recorded more than 172,000 foreign passengers until Sunday, an increase of 70% compared to the same period of 2024, according to official data cited by the Xinhua agency. "This increase is largely due to the expansion of visa exemption policies by China, and Zhuhai's land border post is the only one in the Chinese continental territory that offers direct road access to Hong Kong International Airport," said Chinese state news agency. Until Sunday, the total number of trips through the bridge had increased by 18.9% in homologous terms, exceeding 10 million passengers, a goal reached 25 days earlier than in 2024. According to Xinhua, residents of the Chinese continent increased 30.3% to 4.18 million, while the crossings of vehicles registered in Hong Kong and Macau for the zhuhai border post upside down 32.4% for almost 1.2 million this year, with a daily average of over 10,000. With a length of about 55 kilometers, which include an underground tunnel of nearly seven kilometers between two artificial islands to facilitate navigation in the Pearl River Delta, the bridge began to be built in 2009 and was inaugurated in 2018. The final cost of the infrastructure was estimated at $ 16.4 billion, plus 25% of the initially planned. The infrastructure, which reduced the travel time between Macau and Hong Kong by about half, was pointed out by the central government as an important symbol of the great bay of integration policy.</description><pubDate>2025-04-29 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Pope Francis' friend who broke the Vatican protocol</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/lazer/freira-amiga-papa-francisco-quebrou-protocolo-vaticano/</link><description>Your image turned to the world. Sister Geneviève broke the protocol as she leaned in front of Pope Francis' coffin, with whom she had a relationship born in the tragedy: her aunt's murder during the military dictatorship in Argentina.
This religious, with a girl, a member of the Fraternity Sisters of Jesus, born in 1943 in France, spent several minutes before the Pontiff's coffin, after the transfer of his remains to St. Peter's Basilica, stealing the protagonism of the cardinals.
Contacted by AFP, the religious refused to give interviews to the press, but sent a video of her on a YouTube channel, created the same day with the name of her congregation. In it, she reports her friendship relationship with Francis, she met in 2005, when she was still the archbishop of Buenos Aires.
At the time, she had just returned from her aunt's funeral, also nun Léonie Duquet, in the Argentine capital. Duquet was thrown into the sea in a “flight of death” on the night of December 14, 1977, along with the French religious Alice Domon and 10 other activists in the middle of Argentina dictatorship.
However, his body was returned from sea to land that same year and buried in a common ditch. Already in the 21st century, he could be identified and, in 2005, was buried with the endorsement of then Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio in the garden of the Church of Santa Cruz, Buenos Aires, where he had been detained.
“I cried practically from the beginning to the end of the Mass… I couldn't accept that part of the church had the dictatorship,” he remembers in the video Sister Geneviève Jeanningros about this deeply moved experience.
The memory that Éric Domergue has her in those days is his "penetrating look and the permanent smile." With her, the Pope shares the murder of a family member during the dictatorship: Brother Yves, missing in 1976, and whose body was identified in 2011.
In October 2024, the religious signed a letter that a group of family members sent to French President Emmanuel Macron to ask her not to forget the victims before an official trip to Argentina.
But Geneviève lamented the absence of the Catholic hierarchy in his aunt's funeral, so in 2005, he decided to write to the future Pope.
Bergoglio was in the Vatican city for a synod of bishops and called her the same day. He assured him that he knew the situation and therefore allowed the Duquet burial and two mothers in May Square in the church room, but Geneviève was not convinced.
Eight years later, the nun was in St. Peter's Square when the newly elected Pope Francis left the counterpart of the homonymous Basilica. “I took my hands to my head and thought, 'My God, what will happen?' I was afraid, truth be told,” he explains in the video.
But Francis' message in favor of a church for the poor reassured her and, weeks later, went to a mass at Santa Marta's residence at the Vatican, at the invitation of the Pontiff. His friendship relationship began to bear fruit.
Francisco even visited the caravan where the religious lives, within a circus community, in the Luna Park amusement park, on the Roman coast.
The covid-19 pandemic even brought them closer. Geneviève made contact with him to ask him for help from Luna Park's circus community, who was out of income, and acted as a messenger of a group of Latin American trans prostitutes from the Roman coast, to which Francisco also helped materially.
"In April 2020, the women asked me if they could thank Pope in person ... Then I called Geneviève, who is a friend of the Pope, to ask him how to do that," D. Andrea Conocchia, parish priest of a small church in Torvaianica, on the Roman coast.
Francisco answered him positively, and when he resumed public hearings, he received them and continued to receive, weekly, people from the LGTBQiapn+community, accompanied by Geneviève.
"I always wrote a little message to tell you who carried. It was fair to know," the religious said.
The last time he saw him alive was when he toured St. Peter's Square aboard the Paparmobile on the eve of his death.
She thought she was already recovered from the respiratory crisis that left him hospitalized for 38 days and was already thinking of asking for entries for a next public hearing.
Sister Genieviève's last gesture to her friend was immortalized by the cameras: Praying for him in front of her coffin in the chapel.
