CATARINA PEREIRA AND VÍTOR REBELO
 
The image of General Vasco Rocha Vieira with the flag of Portugal next to his heart, on December 19, 1999, just hours after the transfer of Macau to the People's Republic of China, will forever remain in the memories of many. “I felt like I wasn’t the one there. There were many generations. I felt like it was a moment that represented centuries of history. That represented the effort and life of generations and generations of Portuguese”, he described, in the book “All the Ports I Arrived”. In memory, there are also the nine years that Rocha Vieira was in charge of the Praia Grande Palace, in a decisive period for the territory. The last Governor of Macau died yesterday in Portugal, aged 85. He leaves his wife, Leonor Rocha Vieira, whom he married in Lisbon in 1976, and three children.
Born in Lagoa, Portugal, on August 16, 1939, Vasco Joaquim Rocha Vieira was the son of João da Silva Vieira and Maria Vieira Rocha. He spent most of his childhood across borders: at the age of one, he went to Mozambique, where he remained until he was 10. He then went to Portugal, having been a student at the Colégio Militar, in Lisbon.
He held many positions throughout his career, until, in 1991, he was appointed Governor of Macau by President Mário Soares, having been confirmed in the position in 1996, after the election of the new President, Jorge Sampaio. Rocha Vieira took office as Governor on April 23, 1991. Macau, a place in the East where he had already been on commission in the 1970s, became his home.
As Governor, he was responsible for a vast program that aimed to reinforce Macau's own identity, consolidate its autonomy and promote the territory as a regional platform, with a specific role, at that time and for the future, in Macau's relations. China with abroad. Under his administration, Macau has seen, in recent years, the strengthening of the local political system and the Rule of Law, namely through the consolidation of the judicial system, the reform of the education system, the training of staff, the modernization and extension of systems health and assistance.
Three days before the transfer of Macau, in an interview with RTP, when asked about what it was like to be the last Governor, Rocha Vieira said he had the feeling that he played the role “at a historic moment”, but he described himself simply as being “the interpreter of the sovereign bodies here in the territory” and the “interpreter of the fulfillment of the obligations that Portugal assumed in the Joint Declaration”. “I take it naturally”, he stated then.
He said he was convinced that Portugal administered the territory “in a unique way”. And this, he stressed, was seen in the way the Chinese said goodbye to the Portuguese: “They come to us, they hug us, they want to take photographs, they say they will miss us”. “I think Portugal has fulfilled it over the centuries (…) I think we left behind a good work, of which we can be proud”, he argued.
“There is no future if there is no history, if there is no memory. And this history is fundamentally linked to the presence of Portugal and the Portuguese here in Macau”, he continued, adding that there were “very many things” from Portugal in the territory. From the outset, a political system based on the separation of powers, laws, judicial instructions, and an administrative culture were enumerated.
Asked whether Deng Xiaoping's “one country, two systems” formula gave any security in terms of rights, freedoms and guarantees in the future of Macau under the sovereignty of the People's Republic of China, Rocha Vieira stated: “I think that when he signed and wrote what he wrote, and when he wrote the chapter on fundamental rights in the Basic Law, he did so in a sincere and responsible way. Then I think that the future authorities of the Macao SAR share the same values, the same principles that we share, the Portuguese Administration”.
As for his relationship with China while he served as Governor, he said it was “always good”. “I managed to have a very frank relationship, of good cooperation, very open, with the Chinese. Naturally, we had many disagreements (…) But this understanding, in a context that has always been favorable, of friendship, which is traditional and historical between the Portuguese and the Chinese, helped a lot. And I think that disagreements never led to rupture situations.”
On Portugal's side, the relationship was also “always good”, as he said at the time, but he stressed: “Of course, Macau and Portugal are physically separated, but they were always together through affection, solidarity and the sense of responsibility that the governing bodies sovereignty they always had before Macau”.
For the future, the last Governor asked for attention to the territory. “Portugal must continue to pay attention to Macau and I think the international community must pay attention to Macau, naturally without interfering with Chinese sovereignty, which must exercise it. But it must follow this process, because the Joint Declaration is an international treaty, signed by two countries”.
Regarding the criticism that Portugal could have been “submissive” in relation to the People's Republic of China, Rocha Vieira said, days before the transfer, that he no longer heard these types of accusations. “Today people realized that we took good advantage – in the good sense of the term ‘taking advantage’ – of good relations with China to defend our interests in the best way possible. Because having good relationships, speaking frankly, being friends, having a sense of the future, being serious in your goals is not incompatible with being firm, determined. On the contrary. We took advantage of this climate to be able to be very determined and very firm, say what we thought and fight for the interests that we believe to be the interests of Macau”, he concluded, in the same interview.
On the night of the transfer, after the official ceremony, the presidents of each country, Jorge Sampaio and Jiang Zemin, exchanged formal greetings, but they were not the only ones. Among the various greetings, special mention goes to Vasco Rocha Vieira, who was finishing his position, and Edmund Ho, his successor and first Chief Executive of the Macao SAR.
If it is true that the last Governor was loved by many, and his role in the transfer negotiations was recognized “in the country and within the international community”, it is also true that Rocha Vieira was the target of much criticism. Mainly in the context of the Jorge Álvares Foundation case, which caused controversy, both in the first month of Chinese administration in the territory, and in Portugal.
Formalized on December 18, 1999, the eve of the departure of the Portuguese administration from Macau, the Foundation had an initial allocation of 100 million patacas coming, in equal parts, from the Macau Tourism and Entertainment Society and the Foundation for Cooperation and Development, based in the territory and fed by local public funds. The president of the Board of Trustees of this latter foundation was Rocha Vieira himself at the time it was decided to transfer 50 million patacas to the newly constituted Jorge Álvares Foundation.
Over the years after the transfer, the General sporadically returned to Macau. The last time he was in the territory, at least as far as is publicly known, was in March 2023. He came to receive an honorary doctorate in Social Sciences, awarded by the Macau University of Science and Technology. “Returning to Macau is always very pleasant. All the people who were, lived and worked here have Macau in their hearts, as I do, so returning here under these circumstances is very pleasant”, he then told journalists, stating that he was still optimistic about the future of the territory.
Rocha Vieira was Chief of Staff of the Army and, inherently, member of the Council of the Revolution between 1976 and 1978. In 2015, he was awarded the Grand Cross of the Military Order of the Tower and Sword by former President Cavaco Silva. Previously, he was decorated with the Grand Cross of the Order of Infante D. Henrique (1986), awarded by General Ramalho Eanes, with the Grand Cross of the Order of Christ (1996), awarded by Mário Soares, and with the Grand Collar of Order of Infante D. Henrique (2001), awarded by Jorge Sampaio, a decoration awarded exceptionally, as it is normally intended for heads of State.
 
“A huge loss”
“Desolate”, this is how Anabela Ritchie reacted to the death of the last Governor. “I was very dismayed. I knew he was seriously ill, but we are never prepared. I’m not”, he stated, speaking to the TRIBUNA DE MACAU newspaper. He met closely with Rocha Vieira, as president of the Legislative Assembly, and guarantees that, in addition to the working relationship, they ended up creating a friendship.
“I had an excellent working relationship with the Governor. A relationship of great solidarity, also very determined by the fact that we were aware that we were in the transition period. And we had a lot of work ahead of us”, he recalled. “It was possible for us to become friends”, he added.
Anabela Ritchie points out that she always felt she “could speak freely” with Rocha Vieira. “I can say that we had a very good relationship. Sometimes we agreed, other times we disagreed. But there was space for us to explain our way of thinking, the way we were seeing things.” The objective was always to “find solutions”.
Stressing that she enjoyed working with the Governor, Anabela Ritchie also praised the “important figure” he was for the transition: “I really admired the determination with which he did things, his competence and dedication”.
He also recalled that Rocha Vieira “listened to others and allowed them to speak”, heard different opinions, from the most varied people. “It was a facet that I really admired”, he observed, also saying that he was a “calm, serene” man.
In turn, Jorge Rangel stated that it was “an enormous honor” to serve Portugal alongside Rocha Vieira, “in the Government of Macau, as part of its government team, and in civil society institutions, such as the Historical Society of the Independence of Portugal, military associations, foundations linked to Macau and the Macau Scientific and Cultural Center, in Lisbon, of which he was the founder”.
“I highlight his sense of State, his attachment to fulfilling his mission, his intelligence, his capacity for leadership and achievement, his dignity, his responsibility, his dedication to his family and causes and his love for Portugal”, said the former Secretary for the Administration, Education and Youth of the Government of Macau, adding that he will always remember him “with respect and admiration for the example of life he was for those who worked with him and collaborated in some way”.
“It was a privilege to get to know him up close, to accompany him on multiple and diverse journeys serving Portugal and Macau, to live with him within civil society institutions and to deserve his trust and friendship”, he concluded.
José Luís de Sales Marques worked directly with Rocha Vieira for around eight and a half years during the transition period, as president of the Leal Senado and also as a member of the Governor's Advisory Council. Subsequently, the economist continued to work with the General within the scope of the Portuguese School.
“It is a huge loss, in terms of the importance of the figure that General Rocha Vieira was, his importance in the history of Macau as the last Governor, but not only because of that, because he actually worked on Macau's transition”, he stated.
“At the same time that infrastructures were being built and the material conditions were being prepared for the transfer of administration to China, this was also done through his wisdom, his diplomacy and the vision he had of things”, he continued.
For Sales Marques, the former Governor was always careful to maintain the stability and prosperity of Macau. “His role in the transition process and his role as a moderator in certain circumstances of what happened is known, and that is why he is an unavoidable figure”, he also told this newspaper.
 
“He dedicated a lot to Macau”
Meanwhile, Jorge Neto Valente stressed that he lost a friend and remembers the last Governor of Macau as a “man who remains in history, not in the footnotes, at the center of history”. The lawyer considers that “Macau owed him a lot”. For Neto Valente, Rocha Vieira was very important in the transition period, “which he followed until the end, as we know, and left Macau with all dignity”.
After returning to Portugal, recalls the lawyer, “the General continued to be interested in things in Macau and contributing to the good of Macau”. Rocha Vieira returned to the territory a few times and on one of his last visits he received an Honoris Causa doctorate from the University of Macau.
The lawyer reinforces that the former Governor “did what he had to do and was a person who dedicated a lot of his life to Macau”, having been in the territory long before that, in the 1970s, as a troop engineer.
“I met him at that time”, points out Jorge Neto Valente, adding that Rocha Vieira returned to be Governor “at the hands of Mário Soares, after the experience of civil governors had not gone well from the point of view of Portugal, from the point of view of from a political point of view, and Mário Soares went to get him from the Azores”.
After remembering that Rocha Vieira was a member of the Board of Trustees of the Fundação Escola Portuguesa de Macau, an educational establishment founded during his mandate in 1998, agreed in the Liaison Office, Neto Valente points out that the former highest representative of Portugal in Macau left many things that are still valid today.
“He and the people he chose to accompany him in governance in recent years faced a very difficult period, with a lot of work and only people with a lot of desire and love for Macau and Portugal were able to do what he did”, he considered. After leaving Macau, he concludes his statement, “the General always remained linked to the territory”.
José Rocha Diniz, co-founder of JTM, also mourned the death of Rocha Vieira. “I'm very sorry, but it was something that didn't surprise me, because I followed the last few months, in which he was hospitalized, seriously”, he said, adding: “I was with him at a dinner after the tribute to Dr. António Aresta at the Cultural and Scientific from Macau, in Lisbon”.
Recalling that the last governor “managed to mobilize the majority of Macau's population during the last years of the transition”, Rocha Diniz pointed out that he had a “great advantage”. “I knew the Territory very well, because I had already been deputy secretary, I knew the two diverse communities and also the way the Chinese understand power, so I had a great advantage over previous governors,” he said.
“Man of the 25th of April and the 25th of November,” continues Rocha Diniz, “nowadays, when we talk about General Rocha Vieira Portugal, almost everyone highlights the way he placed the Portuguese flag on his chest” at the time of the transfer . “In Portugal, the full complexity of the transition process is unknown, in which Macau was not called to the negotiations, which were between Portugal and China, but Macau, however, had numerous fundamental issues to be resolved, ‘on the spot’”.
“Rocha Vieira was very creative and firm in the way he always maintained Macau's positions, sometimes even against Portuguese institutions”, he recalled, adding that “contrary to what some people might think, he was a man of dialogue, with a deep spirit mission of the interests of Portugal and the Portuguese who lived in Macau, but always recognizing that it was at a decisive moment in the solution of a 'problem inherited from history', in which Portugal had to do well”.
“The Portuguese administration left Macau, but the Portuguese remain here, continuing to contribute to its progress and development”. Rocha Diniz concluded with a word of deep condolences, in this hour of pain, “to Dr. Leonor Rocha Vieira and her children”.
In turn, António José de Freitas began by stating: “More than the last Governor of Macau, I lost a great friend”. Then, he remembered that three months ago he had spoken to Rocha Vieira on the phone.
The Ombudsman also recalled that Rocha Vieira came to Macau annually, as he was part of the Board of Trustees of Fundação Escola Portuguesa, and in 2019 he came at the invitation of Santa Casa, on the occasion of the institution's 450th anniversary. “At the time, he was proclaimed a benefactor of the Santa Casa”, he pointed out, reiterating that he lost “a great friend”.
“For me, he was the best Governor of Macau”, continued António José de Freitas, adding that they always had a lot of contact.
António Félix Pontes, economist and former administrator of the Monetary Authority, stated that Rocha Vieira “was a good governor, loved and respected by the entire population of Macau, and who honored Portugal in a historic phase of this Territory”.
“I owe him the appointment as deputy to the Legislative Assembly of Macau, from 1991 to 1999, having never interfered in my political activities in that role”, he also recalled, regretting having lost “a great friend”.
 
“It fulfilled”, but it was not to “everyone’s liking”
Jorge Fão also said he was saddened by the news, which was given to him through JTM. Regarding the mandate of the former Governor, the president of the general assembly of the Association of Retirees, Retirees and Pensioners of Macau highlights that “he did what he had to do, but it was not completely to the satisfaction of public administration workers”.
However, Jorge Fão says that General Rocha Vieira pleased the general population and also businesspeople. “I think he did well there.”
Regarding public service workers, “he wasn't that worried, but in the end we had a happy outcome, let's say, since the entire public administration achieved what it wanted, that is, what it was fighting for: for a pension, for a transfer of his functions to Portugal”.
Fão says he personally has no reason to complain. “I had many contacts with him due to the role he held outside the public service, but I was attached to the Public Service Workers' Association, having spoken a lot with him, although these conversations were not very satisfactory”, he acknowledges.
Despite everything, he points out, the association “happily managed to achieve the desired results, also because we traveled to Portugal and had several meetings with Mário Soares and Cavaco Silva and were in Beijing to talk about our desires and concerns”.
Jorge Fão concludes by highlighting that the former Governor of Macau, as the highest representative of Portugal in the territory, “fulfilled the mission given to him, even if, I repeat, it was not to everyone's satisfaction”.
The Association of Public Service Workers, led by José Pereira Coutinho, also lamented the loss of Rocha Vieira and thanked him “for resolving, during the transition phase, many issues facing public service workers, Macanese and Portuguese who chose to continue providing services in the Macao SAR”. In a message, Coutinho also recalls that the use of the association's current headquarters was authorized by Rocha Vieira.
 
PR and PM recall “sense of State”
The President of the Republic expressed “deep regret” at the death of Vasco Rocha Vieira, praising his “marked patriotism” and remembering him as “one of the most illustrious officers of the Portuguese Army in the transition to Democracy and in the first decades of its affirmation” . “Always closely linked to the Commands, he also held political functions such as Minister of the Republic for the Autonomous Region of the Azores”, states the note published on the official website of the Presidency of the Republic. Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa also highlights that Rocha Vieira was “very close to President António Ramalho Eanes”, having been “appointed Chancellor of the Ancient Military Orders” by him. “The symbolism of the moment of transfer from Portuguese to Chinese administration will remain in the memory of many Portuguese as an example of a sense of State, a sense of service to the public cause and marked patriotism”, it can be read. The President of the Republic, who claims to have followed “closely the last months” of Rocha Vieira’s life, “presents to his family, and, in particular, to his widow and children, the testimony of gratitude from Portugal, with much missed friendship". The Prime Minister also remembered Rocha Vieira as “one of the most brilliant soldiers to embody the patriotic sense of being Portuguese”, highlighting his “historical and remarkable connection with Macau”. “General Vasco Rocha Vieira was one of the most brilliant soldiers to embody the patriotic sense of being Portuguese, with special services in consolidating our democracy and in the historic and remarkable connection to Macau, where he was the last governor”, ​​wrote Luís Montenegro, in a post on the social network
 
Eanes remembers “extraordinary man”
“General Rocha Vieira was an exceptional man for his excellent actions and his assumed social responsibility, deserving to be, rightly, considered 'one of the best of our greatest'”, wrote former President of the Republic Ramalho Eanes in a note sent to Lusa. He remembers him as “an extraordinary man”, especially “on three levels: for his distinctive personality, for his relevant military performance and for the services he provided to the country at a political level”. On a personal level, he “possessed superior qualities of spirit”, had “exceptional intelligence”, “a good temperament” and “had a strong personality”. At the military level, “he was one of the most distinguished of his generation, providing relevant services to the Army, in difficult times, namely, in the throes of the political regime prior to the 25th of April, during the 25th of April and, even, in the 25th of November, having also played an important role as a representative of the Portuguese Armed Forces within NATO”. Regarding the political level, he had an activity of “great quality and great importance for the country, both as minister of the Republic for the Azores, and also as governor of Macau, putting all his commitment into the design and successful execution of a policy of successful transformation of Macau, also participating, with the success that is known, in the transfer of the administration of the territory of Macau to the People's Republic of China”.
 
Army praises “patriotism” and “legacy of service”
The Army expressed its regret over the death of Lieutenant General Vasco Rocha Vieira and praised his “legacy of service and patriotism”, hoping that he “continues to inspire future generations”. In a note, the Army states that “it is in mourning, having lost one of its most notable soldiers”. “His life and legacy justify deep recognition and enduring respect for his memory, and constitute a factor of motivation and pride for all who serve in this centuries-old institution. May his legacy of service and patriotism continue to inspire future generations”, he highlights.

Tomorrow, the wake will resume at 10:00, followed by a mass before lunch. After the ceremonies in Lisbon, the procession will head to the Algarve, where the funeral will take place at the Lagoa Municipal Cemetery.
 
“Dignified” Portuguese presence in the East
Former President of the Republic Aníbal Cavaco Silva lamented the death of Rocha Vieira, a “remarkable figure” whose legacy dignifies the last years of the Portuguese presence in the East. “We keep from General Rocha Vieira the solemn and dignified image of lowering the National Flag in Macau, now 25 years old. More important than this image, is the work of Rocha Vieira as the last Governor of Macau, dignifying the last years of our presence in the East, allowing us to leave the territory reconciled with our History and proud of the work we left behind”, he stated, in a condolence note sent to Lusa. Cavaco Silva expressed “deep sadness” over the death of Rocha Vieira, a “remarkable figure” in recent history, with whom he maintained “close bonds of friendship”. He also highlighted the “importance of the high military functions he performed, as Chief of the Army General Staff, in a critical period of consolidation” of Portuguese democracy, between 1976 and 1978. “His exceptional qualities of command, his firmness, integrity of character, and his ethical and military training helped to restore hierarchical authority and discipline in the Armed Forces in a troubled period in the country's life”, he maintained.
 
“One of the best interpreters of the importance” of Macau
The PS expressed regret at the death of Rocha Vieira, praising a life “entirely dedicated to the service of Portugal”. Noting that “his life was forever linked to Macau”, for the PS this “was one of the best interpreters of the importance” of that territory “for the relationship between Portugal and the People's Republic of China”, as well as the uniqueness of the SAR. “The last years of the Portuguese administration of the Territory of Macau, under the leadership of General Rocha Vieira, are marked by the completion of several important public infrastructure works to support the subsequent development of Macau, as well as administrative reforms for its preparation for the subsequent period”, he praises. The socialists also refer to the transfer ceremony, in which the way in which Rocha Vieira “personified and symbolized the dignity and tribute to the Portuguese presence in Macau for centuries” was undeniable. “And it marked the friendship and respect that the Portuguese maintain with Macau and the People's Republic of China, and which allows, after 25 years of transition, to preserve the uniqueness of Macau, which continues to be a meeting point between cultures”, he added. The PS thus gives “public note of its deep respect for the services to the country” and “addresses its deepest condolences to his family and friends”.
 
He performed public functions “always with dignity”
The president of the Government of the Azores, José Manuel Bolieiro, lamented the death of Vasco Rocha Vieira, recalling that the lieutenant general “always performed his public duties with dignity”. “I pay tribute to a man who, throughout his career, always performed his public duties with dignity, a sense of duty and a deep commitment to the public interest”, he stated, quoted in a press release. He also adds that he “leaves a legacy of service to the country, which will be remembered with respect and gratitude”, expressing “deep regret at the death of the lieutenant general”, who “performed relevant functions in the service of Portugal”. Rocha Vieira, who was minister of the Republic for the Azores between 1986 and 1991, “stood out for the integrity and responsible way in which he held his position, contributing to the strengthening of relations between the Autonomous Region of the Azores and the State, always with respect for regional autonomy and the specificities of the Azores”. The Azorean executive also refers to his performance in the role of Governor of Macau.</description><pubDate>2025-01-23 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>“We have to enrich” functions of the Sino-Lusophone platform</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/temos-de-enriquecer-funcoes-da-plataforma-sino-lusofona/</link><description>The Macao SAR must “further enrich and expand the role and functions of the Sino-Lusophone platform”, which has a “relevant significance” in the process of opening up to the outside world, highlighted the Chief Executive before the consuls general in the territory and delegates of Portuguese-speaking countries in the Macau Forum. Sam Hou Fai also defended the strengthening of cooperation with Southeast Asia and praised the contributions of the Filipino community to the development of Macau
 
Macau will remain committed to boosting cooperation between China and Portuguese-speaking countries, as well as between the territory and Southeast Asia, assured the Chief Executive, at a dinner offered to the consuls-general in the Macao SAR and delegates from Portuguese-speaking countries at the Secretariat Permanent of the Macau Forum. “Macau has deep and friendly historical links with Portuguese-speaking countries and Southeast Asia”, highlighted Sam Hou Fai, considering that the results achieved in the areas of exchange and cooperation are “inseparable from the extraordinary work and diligent dedication” of the consuls. general and delegates of the Forum.
“In the new phase, guided by President Xi's important speeches, the Macao SAR will continue to comprehensively, precisely and unswervingly implement the 'one country, two systems' principle and boost development in all aspects, and will certainly provide new opportunities and platforms for strengthening cooperative relations” between China and Macau with Portuguese-speaking countries and Southeast Asia, he highlighted when speaking at the dinner, which was also attended by the commissioner of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Liu Xianfa.
Taking into account the Macao SAR's opening and exchange process with the outside world, and in line with the guidelines recently transmitted by President Xi Jinping, Sam Hou Fai began by highlighting that cooperation with Portuguese-speaking countries is “very important and has a relevant meaning ”. “(…) We must further enrich and expand the role and functions of the Sino-Lusophone platform, actively implement the various agreements and instruments established within the scope of the 6th Ministerial Conference of Forum Macau, especially the Action Plan for Economic Cooperation and Commercial (2024-2027) and we must continue to promote joint development characterized by equality, cooperation and mutual benefits, comprehensively raising the level of Sino-Lusophone cooperation” in several areas, he stressed, calling for the intensification of exchanges, both at official level and in the private sphere.

He also maintained that the Macao SAR “has become one of the favorite destinations for international investments, which provides advantageous conditions to become a place for the concentration of high-quality international qualified staff”.
At the same time, the Chief Executive expressed the desire to “constantly deepen cooperation between the Macao SAR and Southeast Asian countries”. “The MSAR and the countries of Southeast Asia, including the Philippines, which are geographically close, have close economic and commercial cooperation, with intense exchange of people and in the cultural area, being traditionally good neighbors and good partners. For example, according to data from the 2021 Census, the Filipino population accounts for around 5% of the total population of Macau, being the second largest community in the Region after the Chinese community, and makes valuable contributions to development socio-economic situation of Macau”, he acknowledged.
From his perspective, it is important to “take advantage of this good basis of traditional cooperation” to “seize new opportunities, explore more potential for cooperation in all aspects and encourage greater progress” in exchanges between Macau and Southeast Asian countries.
It is recalled that, during the celebrations of the 25th anniversary of the Macao SAR, Xi Jinping stressed that the territory must adopt “a more open and inclusive stance to intensify international ties and increase global projection and attractiveness”. In particular, according to the Chinese leader, “Macau must concentrate efforts on building a platform for opening up to the outside world at a higher level, to reinforce bilateral openness with Portuguese-speaking Countries, promoting comprehensive cooperation of mutual benefits”.</description><pubDate>2025-01-23 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Up to 670,000 border crossings expected on Chinese New Year</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/esperadas-ate-670-mil-passagens-nas-fronteiras-ano-novo-chines/</link><description>Between January 28th and February 4th, during the Lunar New Year holidays, Macau could see 630,000 to 670,000 border crossings per day, the CPSP predicts, anticipating that the peak of entries and exits will occur on the 1st and 2nd of February. On the other hand, according to DST, as of last Thursday, 80% of hotel rooms had already been booked for this festive season, with the average price of rooms varying between 1,000 and 2,000 patacas.
 
The Public Security Police Corps (CPSP) predicts that, during the Lunar New Year holidays, between January 28th and February 4th, Macau's borders will be able to record 630,000 to 670,000 entries and exits per day, which which means a total volume that varies between 5.04 million and 5.36 million. The estimates were presented yesterday, at a press conference where representatives from various public services presented the preparatory work to respond to the increase in tourists during this festive period.
Compared to Chinese New Year 2024, there could be an increase of at least 3%, the CPSP predicted, pointing out the peak period for border crossings to be the 1st and 2nd of February (4th and 5th day of the lunar calendar).
Furthermore, the corporation revealed that, between the 1st and 21st of this month, the “one entry per week” visa policy, aimed at residents of Zhuhai, attracted 73 thousand visitors, which translates into a daily average of 3,500 people, while the “one visa, multiple entries” measure, applicable to Hengqin residence card holders, brought 18 thousand visitors to the Macao SAR, a daily average of 900 people.
Regarding Chinese New Year, the CPSP assured that it had prepared a series of action plans, in order to ensure the fluidity and order of the flow of people in the city, road safety and smooth border crossings.
According to what he presented, in places of festive activities and popular tourist attractions, the CPSP will reinforce patrol agents and activate measures to control the flow of people when necessary, in order to maintain a good travel environment. In addition to planning to deploy more agents at the borders and open more customs inspection counters, the corporation assured that it will be committed to strengthening the fight against taxi violations and illegal driving behavior. At the same time, more agents will be mobilized to combat illegal pedestrian crossings.
In turn, the Directorate of Tourism Services (DST) pointed out that there will be an increase in both the number of visitors and the hotel occupancy rate during the Lunar New Year. As noted, by the 16th of this month, the hotel sector already had an occupancy rate of almost 80%, and this rate could record constant increases as the holidays approach. According to the organization, during this festive season, the average price of hotel rooms varies between 1,000 and 2,000 patacas.
DST highlighted that, on the one hand, it has made many preparations to serve tourists well and guarantee the quality of the tourist service, and, on the other, it will maintain regular inspections at border posts, tourist attractions and shopping places, to combat illegal guides and illicit accommodation.

In view of the increase in car movements on the Delta Bridge, the SA is prepared to put more crossing routes into operation during peak flows, as well as deploying more customs agents and technical personnel, in order to increase the efficiency of car passage at the customs post.
At the same time, the SA will intensify inspections at borders, in the city and at sea, with a view to maintaining the stability of Macau's public security environment during the Spring Festival. Customs will also continue to monitor the trend of “fake tourists” activities and will reinforce inspections to prevent holidays from being taken advantage of by illegals for smuggling.
On the other hand, due to the Lunar New Year, a time when decorative plants from Mainland China, such as orchids, are frequently transported, the Institute for Municipal Affairs will set up a temporary checkpoint for plant inspection on arrivals at the Chinese border. Portas do Cerco, which will run between the 26th and 28th of January, from 9:00 am to 11:00 pm. Inspection fees will be waived.</description><pubDate>2025-01-23 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Fines for illegal works totaled 1.5 million</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/multas-por-obras-ilegais-totalizaram-15-milhoes/</link><description>Last year, fines totaling around 1.5 million patacas were issued due to the execution of illegal works in the territory, and the Public Works Services Department warned that the fines relating to eight cases had not yet been paid, so that there will be coercive collection. There were 838 cases opened in 2024, an annual drop of 25%, with demolitions rising 85% to 238
 
Last year, authorities issued fines totaling around 1.5 million patacas due to illegal works, according to the Land and Urban Construction Services Directorate (DSSCU), which initiated 838 cases in this area. According to the data available, there was a drop of around 25% in relation to processes opened in 2023, which totaled 1,114.
Of the total number of cases, 238 concerned voluntary demolitions – an increase of 85% compared to the previous year, and 39 concerned the imposition of fines for carrying out illegal works. The body responsible for Public Works states in a statement that “the fines relating to eight cases were not paid within the set deadline, so the Administration will proceed with the respective coercive collection”.
“Compared to the past, the new legislation increased the fines imposed on offenders who carry out illegal works and added new fines for offenders who do not comply with demolition orders. In addition, other sanctioning measures were also created, including the crime of disobedience, the interruption of water and energy supply”, states the DSSCU, justifying the increase in voluntary demolitions.
Since the entry into force of the legal regime for urban construction, the Macao SAR Government has reinforced the fight against illegal works, with the DSSCU giving priority to cases of new illegal works, renovation of illegal works, buildings in a state of disrepair and to cases of illegal works located in buildings whose use license was issued after the new law came into force.
The data available on the DSSCU website shows that, in 2024, there were 48 processes with notification of the final decision. In this regard, the organization explains that it acts in accordance with the law and that offenders must demolish the illegal works and restore the site “as soon as possible”. However, in case of non-compliance, DSSCU will continue the administrative procedures until a final decision is made in the case. “Once notification of the final decision has been received, the offenders must proceed with the demolition of illegal works and the replacement of the site within the stipulated period, otherwise, DSSCU will carry out the appropriate demolition actions, the expenses of which will be borne by the offenders”, he adds.
If after the hearing regarding the illegal work and after the DSSCU makes a final decision and issues the demolition order, the offender requests voluntary demolition within the set deadline, the fine is reduced by half. However, the law determines that this reduction and exemption benefit can only be applied once. The DSSCU also states that if the offender violates the law again within the next five years, it is considered a repeat offense, meaning the fine is increased by a quarter.
The organization reiterated, in a statement, that it will continue the fight against illegal works to safeguard the safety of buildings and the housing environment in the territory.

The European Union (EU) also hopes to work with Trump to face “global challenges”, said the president of the European Commission), Ursula Von der Leyen. “Together, our societies can achieve greater prosperity and strengthen their common security. This is the lasting strength of the transatlantic association”, Ursula published on the X social network.

The head of the German government, Olaf Scholz, wished for the continuation of what he called “good transatlantic relations” with the USA, Germany's “closest ally” and reinforced that “the objective of our policy continues to be to maintain good transatlantic relations. The EU, which has 27 members and more than 400 million people, is a strong union”, highlighted Scholz. Still in Europe, Italy's PM, Giorgia Meloni, expressed her “best wishes” to US President Donald Trump. “I am sure that the friendship between our nations and the values ​​that unite us will continue to reinforce the partnership between Italy and the United States, facing global challenges together and building a future of prosperity and security for our people”, published the extreme leader right on social media, the only European leader to travel to Washington. For his part, King Charles III sent a personal congratulatory message to Donald Trump, in which he cited what he called the “special and lasting relationship between the United Kingdom and the USA”, while the PM, Viktor Orban, one of the few European leaders close to of Trump, anticipated that it is “our turn to occupy Brussels”, the headquarters of the EU.
In Portugal, PR Marcelo defined Trump as a President “for whom the Pacific is very important, for whom relations with China are very important, for whom relations with Russia are the same as they were in his first term, in which Russia, therefore, is not a problem for his vision of the USA”, and that he does not give importance to Europe, which, “on its own has to make a living”.

At the meeting, they suggested, for example, adjusting the location of some crossings and extending the crossing time for pedestrians at some traffic lights. DSAT promised that it will analyze the feasibility of the proposals discussed as quickly as possible
 
Following an accident that occurred three days ago on Rua da Tribuna, in which a secondary school student was run over by a public bus on a pedestrian crossing, the Directorate of Services for Traffic Affairs (DSAT), the Public Security Police Corps (CPSP) and the Directorate of Education and Youth Development Services (DSEDJ) organized an urgent meeting on road safety the day before yesterday, together with representatives from several schools located in the North Zone. The meeting aimed to encourage interested parties to jointly assess the current traffic situation around schools and discuss improvement proposals.
According to a statement issued by the three organizations, school representatives made several suggestions, including adjusting the location of some crossings, making the crossings at some intersections controlled by traffic lights, extending the crossing time for pedestrians at some traffic lights and expanding the scope of some pedestrian islands.
In reaction, DSAT promised that it will study the feasibility of the respective proposals as quickly as possible and organize interdepartmental “on-site” inspections together with schools in a timely manner, in order to continuously improve the road environment.
At the same time, the organization revealed that it will collect suggestions from all educational establishments in Macau regarding improving road safety around schools. To this end, DSAT, CPSP and DSEDJ will create a specific channel to collect opinions on the matter, in order to make student travel safer.
DSEDJ called on schools to continue to reinforce road safety education among teachers and students. For its part, the CPSP recalled having promoted 124 lectures on road safety last year, with 11,000 participants.
DSAT noted that, since 2019, it has prepared more than 300 proposals for optimizing pedestrian crossings, of which 286 have been implemented, including 60 carried out last year. As for the remaining proposals, the organization indicated that they are being developed in an orderly manner.
At the same time, since the end of 2021, DSAT began installing diagonal crossings in suitable locations, creating omnidirectional pedestrian crossing facilities. Currently, eight intersections with traffic lights in Macau are equipped with similar facilities for pedestrians. This year, four more locations in the North Zone will also host this type of installation, indicated DSAT.</description><pubDate>2025-01-23 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Guaranteed stable food supply</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/garantido-fornecimento-estavel-de-alimentos/</link><description>The Chinese Ministry of Commerce guarantees the arrival of safe food products for consumption by the population of Macau.

The Judiciary Police has been fighting hard in this matter, having managed to reduce the number of cases. Cases of internet fraud increased by 4% year on year to 906, with phishing being the crime that saw the biggest increase
 
VÍTOR REBELO
 
In a city where violent crimes have decreased year after year, with only one case of homicide having been recorded in 2024, authorities are currently focusing a large part of their investigations on the increasing number of frauds. The director of the Judiciary Police (PJ) is peremptory in stating that “criminals no longer steal; defraud using increasingly advanced technological means”.
And among those targeted there are many students. Of the 354 cases of telephone fraud, 109 concerned young students (around 30%), which caused losses of around 68 million patacas, and in total losses of around 154 million were recorded. “It’s a very high value,” said Sit Chong Meng. Despite the large losses, misleading situations via telephone still reduced by 13% annually.
This reality received special attention yesterday at the PJ's annual meeting with the media, where the head of the corporation took stock of last year's activity, releasing statistical data and comparing them with 2023 and 2019.
“We have carried out many awareness campaigns at schools, also to alert parents, so that great care must be taken when students intend to go and study abroad”, said the director of the PJ, adding that “criminals use technologies increasingly advanced, very concealed, hence the great difficulty for the police in discovering them”.
Referring specifically to students, the PJ director highlighted the actions that have been carried out in schools, and also to alert parents, “so that great care can be taken when students intend to go and study abroad”.
On the other hand, and taking into account the issue of security in educational establishments in the territory, the PJ seeks to “create a safe environment for young people to grow and guide them towards development and success”. The Minors Monitoring Center continues to play “the role of a communication bridge”. Last year, 152 cases were monitored at the request of schools, 27 of which resulted in the initiation of monitoring processes.
 
Scams via the internet registered an increase
On the other hand, in cases of fraud via the internet, there was an increase of 4% to 906 cases. “We have carried out many awareness campaigns so that cases of fraud can be reduced”, assured Sit Chong Meng.
According to the PJ, fraudsters have abusively used phishing messages and websites to steal credit card data, attracting the public through news, “which has made prevention difficult”. In 2024, there were 689 cases related to this type of crime, an increase of 1.1 times, and which caused losses of more than 14 million patacas to companies and the population.
“This is the type of crime that registered the biggest increase last year”, maintains the PJ, which states that throughout 2024, 697 sessions were held to disseminate information about fraud, which had 120,000 participants and 1,600 posts were published online. Among the actions, the PJ launched, in cooperation with the Education Services, the “Anti-fraud vaccine program on campus”, to consolidate awareness among students.
In the fight against money exchange scammers, “new achievements were achieved”, says the PJ. With the coordination of the Ministry of Public Security and in collaboration with the public security authorities of Mainland China, “the PJ carried out a strong repression, which fought crime at its origin and dismantled its entire chain up to the black and gray industry that is behind”, stated the director of the corporation.
Furthermore, “it was possible to produce a deterrent effect on these illicit activities through several phases of the ant removal operation”. According to the data released, until last December, the police resolved 84 cases of illegal exchange of money for gambling, which resulted in the arrest of 120 fraudsters and the seizure of money and chips, with a total value exceeding 11 million Hong Kong dollars .
Following communication with the banks, the PJ revealed that 680 accounts suspected of being used by fraudsters were reported, with 991 websites being blocked that were used by fraudsters to try to achieve their intentions.
In 689 cases of various types of bank fraud, victims revealed their credit card details when trying to buy goods or services online, more than double the number recorded in 2023, causing losses of 14 million patacas.
The PJ noted at the conference that, thanks to an alert mechanism to suspend suspicious transactions and stop payments, it managed to recover almost 110 million patacas in 597 fraud attempts.
In the context of cross-border crime, the authorities arrested 236 members of groups, an annual increase of approximately 50%, having managed to dismantle “guess who am I” and false soothsayer networks, preventing the spread of crime, in collaboration with the Chinese police , Hong Kong and internationally.
 
Almost 1,500 investigations into gambling crimes
In other aspects, there was an increase in crimes of robbery, theft or crimes related to gambling, however, this number is still lower than in 2019. In cases linked to the gambling industry, 1,423 investigations and complaints were opened, amounting to an increase of 28.6% compared to 2023 and a reduction of 34% compared to 2019.
There were 252 cases of loan sharking and 47 cases of kidnapping. Despite being higher figures than in 2023, it is still significantly lower than what occurred in 2019. The proportion of violent and serious crimes related to gambling continued to decrease. “This is the very positive result of prevention and combat”, highlights the PJ.
Another issue addressed was the information given by the PJ about human trafficking, specifically that it had managed to prevent a resident from being a victim of human trafficking to a center, in Southeast Asia, dedicated to fraud and extortion using telecommunications and the Internet. Two weeks earlier, the PJ said that five residents had been victims of the same crime, in Taiwan and Cambodia, deceived with false promises of high remuneration for supposed jobs.
Finally, the statistics relating to serious and violent crimes. The director of the PJ considers that the situation has remained at a “very low” level.

The 19-year-old had long-standing anxiety problems at school and found it difficult to make new friends. However, he eventually found solace in “BooBoo,” a pet-like robot that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to interact with humans.
“I feel like I have someone to share happy moments with,” he confessed to AFP in his apartment, where he lives with his parents and a pet duck.
AI-powered devices are increasingly being used in China to combat social isolation.
“BooBoo”, a furry robot that looks like a guinea pig created by “Hangzhou Genmoor Technology”, costs 1,400 yuan. Since May last year, around a thousand copies of the rugby ball-sized robot, designed to meet the social needs of young people, have been sold, according to Adam Duan, from the company that developed it.
Zhang Yachun named his “Aluo” and carries it in a shoulder bag. Your furry companion has the same role as a human friend, she says, ensuring that “he makes us feel like someone is needed.”
The market for “social robots”, such as “BooBoo”, could grow seven times by 2033, reaching 42.5 billion US dollars, according to consultancy IMARC Group. Asia already dominates this market.
Guo Zichen, 33, believes that a pet robot makes up for the time he doesn't spend with his children. “People are spending less time with their children now”, observes this man, as he looks at a robot dog in a “Weilan” company store in Nanjing, in the east of the country. A robot can help “check or carry out other activities”, he highlights.
“Baby Alpha”, the robot dog from the company “Weilan”, is sold for 26,000 yuan. About 70% of buyers are families with young children, according to the company.
However, Guo Zichen is skeptical about the ability of these robots to provide the same joy as a flesh-and-blood dog. “The main difference is that real dogs have souls”, he highlights.
In China, there are a growing number of AI products that aim to respond to consumers' emotional needs, such as conversational agents or virtual avatars of deceased people.
According to several experts, the effects of the long-standing one-child policy are boosting this market. People born at the beginning of this policy, in the 1980s, are now in their forties and often do not have time to dedicate themselves to their family, because competition for jobs is fierce.
This leaves “little space for personal interactions, which leads people to look for alternatives to meet their emotional needs”, considers Wu Haiyan, a professor specializing in AI and psychology at the University of Macau. This monitoring, even if it is virtual, “improves the well-being of individuals who would otherwise feel isolated”, says the researcher.
Zhang Peng, Zhang Yachun's father, understands his daughter's attachment to the robot “Aluo”. “When we were young, there was no shortage of friends. We had a lot of them as soon as we walked out the door,” explains the 51-year-old. But, “currently, young urban people seem to be under a lot of pressure and, as a result, may not have friends”, he adds.
Zhang Yachun, an only child, highlights that purchasing “Aluo” helped her discuss her concerns with her parents. “People of my generation generally have difficulty communicating in person, but what they feel inside hasn’t changed,” he says, stroking the mascot.
