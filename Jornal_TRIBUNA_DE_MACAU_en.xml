The International Monetary Fund (IMF) once again revised downwards its forecasts for the growth of the Macao SAR's Gross Domestic Product (GDP), according to the most recent report on the “World Economic Outlook”. This year, GDP is expected to grow just 2.6%, below the IMF forecasts published in April, which pointed to a 3.6% increase. For next year, the same institution predicts that GDP will grow 2.8%, 0.7 percentage points less than what it anticipated six months ago.
According to data from Macau's Statistics and Census Services (DSEC), the value of the territory's GDP only increased 1.8% in the first six months of 2025, in real and annual terms, representing 87% of the economic volume of the same period in 2019, the pre-pandemic year. Between April and June, the local economy advanced 5.1% in real terms, compared to the same quarter of 2024, and 0.62% compared to the previous three months.
The latest IMF estimates also point to inflation in Macau being 0.5% in 2025, below the 0.9% initially forecast in April. For 2026, the organization expects inflation to be 1.2%, which would contradict the downward trend that has been observed since 2023, in the territory.
The latest data from DSEC shows that the annual inflation rate completed 14 consecutive months of slowdown, standing at 0.25% in August. In the general calculation of 2024, inflation was estimated at 0.74%.
Furthermore, with regard to unemployment rates this year and 2026, the IMF maintained its April projections, both at 1.7%. In turn, DSEC reported that the general unemployment rate stood at 2.0% between June and August 2025 and 2.6%, maintaining the level of the previous period (May to July).
Conversely, the international institution's forecasts for the Macao SAR's balance sheet for 2025 and 2026 improved by 5.5 and six percentage points, respectively, to 35.5% and 34.9%.
For 2030, the IMF estimates that Macau's GDP will grow by 3% and an inflation rate of 2.2%, values ​​identical to those predicted in April. Furthermore, it also expects the Macao SAR's balance sheet to be 33.2% at the end of the decade, above the 28.9% projected half a year ago.
Forecasts for GDP growth in the Macao SAR remain above estimates for the average of advanced economies in the world, whose value will grow by 1.6%, both in 2025 and 2026, predicts the IMF. China's GDP is expected to grow 4.8% this year and 4.2% next year. In turn, the US economy will grow by 2% and 2.1% in 2025 and 2026, respectively. In turn, Portugal's economy will increase by 1.9% in 2025 and 2.1% next year. Overall, analysts have revised upwards projections for the world economy, expecting it to grow 3.2% in 2025 and 3.1% next year, whereas in April expectations were that it would grow 2.8% and 3%, respectively. However, “risks remain tilted downwards”, warns the IMF.
In the universe of advanced economies in Asia-Pacific, the IMF forecasts overall growth of 4.5% and 4.1% in 2025 and 2026, respectively. In estimates for 2025, the Macao SAR is now behind Taiwan (+3.7%), but continues to surpass the increases projected for Hong Kong (+2.4%), Singapore (+2.2%), Australia (+1.8%), Japan (+1.1%), South Korea (+0.9%) and New Zealand (+0.8%). Overall for Asia, including large emerging economies such as China and India, the IMF anticipates increases of 4.5% this year and 4.1% in 2026.
In advanced economies worldwide, inflation is expected to slow down, to an average of 2.5% this year, and 2.2% in 2026. According to the IMF, price developments in China will stagnate this year and register an increase of 0.7% next year. US inflation will be 2.7% and 2.4% in 2025 and 2026, respectively. Portugal will see its inflation rate stabilize at 2.2% and 2.1% between this year and next.
Regarding China's unemployment rate, the IMF predicts that this indicator will remain at 4.9% until the end of next year. In the cases of the USA and Portugal, unemployment is expected to fall by 0.1 percentage point between 2025 and 2026. The USA will record an unemployment rate of 4.2% in 2025 and 4.1% next year, while Portugal's rate will decrease from 6.4% to 6.3% in the same time frame.
 
“Modest” impact of trade tariffs
In the report published in April, the IMF highlighted the impact that trade tariffs imposed by the US on most of its partners could have on the world economy. In the same month, North American President Donald Trump had announced the application of a series of customs duties on imports from several countries, which generated uncertainty and destabilized international markets. After six months, the organization considers that the effect of the new rates has been “modest”.
“The impact of the trade shock on growth has been moderate so far,” said IMF chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, cited by AFP. The agility of the private sector, which accelerated imports in the first half of the year, in anticipation of the tariffs coming into force, and reorganized its supply chains, containment by some countries and the various agreements between the US and its partners “kept the commercial system open”.
However, the IMF believes that trade tensions continue to "cast a shadow over the global economy, with trade policy uncertainty remaining high. The effect of these tensions may well increase over time as companies gradually pass tariffs on to consumers as trade is redirected more permanently and the global economy gradually becomes less efficient." “Everything is very fluid,” observed Gourinchas. “It’s a very useful reminder that we live in a world where this kind of escalation of trade tensions and political uncertainty can emerge at any time,” he added.
In the preface to the report, Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas also points out the existence of “other important forces”, such as a “poorly balanced” labor market and an unchanged unemployment rate. For example, in the US, “tighter immigration policies are reducing the work provided by foreign workers, another negative shock”. For the chief economist, “until we see, this has been offset by a relatively equivalent decline in labor demand, resulting from a cooling cycle after many years of strong employment growth”. The devaluation of the dollar also worsened inflation driven by the North American country's new tariffs.
On the other hand, emerging markets and developing economies have benefited from easier access to financing, due to the depreciation of the dollar. In China, the country most targeted by the Donald Trump administration's tariffs, economic growth is expected to slow down “modestly”, influenced by the depreciation of the effective exchange rate, a boost in exports to Asian and European partners and some fiscal measures. In the eurozone, growth was also driven by Germany's fiscal policies.
The IMF expects the world economy to slow down by the end of the year and register a “partial recovery” in 2026, having also listed a set of potential risks such as the possible overvaluation of the artificial intelligence industry, the weak prospects for China's real estate sector, the public accounts of some countries and the growing political pressure that central banks face.
Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas encourages governments “to ensure that private entrepreneurs can innovate, prosper and generate the growth of tomorrow”. “While it may be tempting to implement industrial policies, evidence suggests that their effectiveness may be very limited and the side effects significant.” “The use of horizontal policies is preferable”, argues the Frenchman, such as investing in education, research, public infrastructure, good governance, macroeconomic and financial stability and a regulatory environment that balances, with caution, flexibility and innovation.
For the economist, an important factor in the resilience of the world economy is the fact that most countries "exercised restraint in retaliating against trade policies, sought to forge better deals, and are still operating under the well-established norms of world trade. Recent geopolitical tensions highlight how the need for an adaptable and pragmatic multilateral system is greater than ever", concludes Gourinchas.</description><pubDate>2025-10-16 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Airport will have 56 parking platforms after expansion</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/aeroporto-tera-56-plataformas-de-estacionamento-apos-expansao/</link><description>At a meeting of the Islands' Community Services Advisory Council, the Civil Aviation Authority revealed that the number of parking platforms at Macau Airport will increase from 36 to 56 when the airport's expansion is completed.
 
After the completion of the expansion of Macau International Airport, scheduled for 2030, the number of parking platforms will be increased from 36 to 56, said Li Yongjian, deputy coordinator of the Islands Community Services Advisory Council, and Ieong Weng Kuong, member of that advisory board, citing representatives from the Civil Aviation Authority (AACM).
According to them, the construction of the new parking platforms will be completed in 2028.
According to Chinese-language media, at a meeting of the respective advisory body, AACM representatives presented the planning for the airport's expansion and corresponding arrangements. At the meeting, the organization also recalled that the expansion project began in April this year, and the works will increase the airport's capacity from 10 million to 13 million passengers per year. At the end of the contracts, the airport's usable space is expected to increase from 177 to 325 hectares.
On the other hand, AACM representatives stated that they had already submitted contingency plans to the Government in terms of preventing floods and typhoons during the period of works at the airport. Ieong Weng Kuong said that the quarterly results of environmental and flood prevention tests have been completed.
As noted, one of the landing and take-off runways will be closed from 0:00 to 8:00, but not daily, throughout the works.
 
Air Macau will launch Macau-Jinan route in December
From December 11th, Air Macau will operate a new air route, between Macau and Jinan, capital of Shandong province, served by A320 aircraft. According to the Chinese press, there will be three flights per week (on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays). It is worth remembering that Air Macau first opened the route to Jinan in 2013, but ended up suspending this connection due to market adjustments.
 
Government will encourage the exploration of more scenarios for the use of drones
The Civil Aviation Authority (AACM) revealed that the Working Group for the Development of the Low Altitude Economy is studying the optimization of the approval process for the use of drones, in order to support companies and scientific research institutions in carrying out more commercial applications and tests. In response to a written inquiry from Congressman Si Ka Lon, the AACM promised that the Government will continue to encourage the sector to explore application scenarios for drone technology, and will proactively deepen exchanges and cooperation with neighboring regions, such as the Greater Bay Area, exploring possibilities for collaboration in the field of low-altitude economics. Furthermore, he revealed that he will study, with the aeronautical authorities of Mainland China and the HKSAR, coordinated control between unmanned aircraft and traditional civil aviation, creating a timely communication mechanism. Furthermore, he indicated that the Tourism Services plan to introduce drone presentations in “Iluminar Macau 2025”, scheduled for December, “as a concrete practice in the local low-altitude economy scenario”.</description><pubDate>2025-10-16 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>IAS points to advances in women's development</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/ias-aponta-para-avancos-desenvolvimento-das-mulheres/</link><description>The plans for the second period of the “Macao Women's Development Objectives”, which will run between 2026 and 2032, will be “even more in line” with the needs of women, according to the president of the Institute of Social Action. The organization pointed to advances in this matter
 
The results of the first policies related to the development of women in Macau and the presentation of the second objectives, to be achieved by 2032, were the themes of a sharing session at the Science Center.
Around 120 people were present at the event promoted by the Council for Women and Children's Affairs, including representatives of public services, current and former members of that body, workers from private associations and social service institutions.
After creating a specific group for this purpose, seven years ago, “the dynamic efforts of several public services and the joint participation of private institutions and social sectors” led to the implementation of the measures and the obtaining of “significant results”, according to the Institute of Social Action (IAS).
For the second planning, between 2026 and 2032, the president of the organization and vice-president of the Council for Women and Children's Affairs said that the number of public services participating in these objectives will increase to 21.
Furthermore, Hon Wai highlighted that work on “gender mainstreaming” will continue, as well as that authorities will launch more measures to encourage motherhood, including plans for daycare centers. They will also create a support course on childcare knowledge to provide help to new parents in need and will promote the updating of the division of domestic work “to resolve contradictions between different generations”.
For the 278 action plans drawn up in the first phase, “all goals were achieved”, concluded the IAS number one.
Regarding the assessment of the first period of women's development objectives, carried out between 2019 and 2025, one of the examples focused on was the “gender mainstreaming” of public sector workers. In this parameter, one of the conclusions points to the fact that the salary difference is now “extremely small”, placing it in an advanced position worldwide, according to the IAS.
On the other hand, opportunities were created for women to participate in international affairs, “training young people to be aware of social participation”, he highlighted. As for medical care, the improvement of health policies “allowed a significant increase in the level of health of women, whose life expectancy became the first worldwide”.

The author, who will be present at the session, told TRIBUNA DE MACAU newspaper that the publication aims to publicize the vast collection of around 1,900 photographs, newspaper clippings and posters kept by his father Victor Lemos

 
VÍTOR REBELO
At a time when Macau is undergoing a period of preparation for another edition of the Grand Prix (GPM), the international automobile event is the subject of a publication by Carlos Lemos, which will be launched on November 6th, at 3pm, at the headquarters of the Association of Retirees, Retirees and Pensioners of Macau (APOMAC).
The second volume of the book, with photographs taken between 1967 and 1978, completes the history of the GPM reported in the first volume, between 1954 and 1966. It is a personal collection of Victor H. de Lemos – now deceased, a motor sports enthusiast – which his son Carlos Lemos decided to publish in a book.
The second volume has 356 pages, 100 more than the first. The content and composition are very identical, including more Chinese newspaper clippings. The main highlights are the first fatal accident of the GPM, the failed attempt to create the Far East Motor Racing Association Circuit, the first “Guia Race”, the Race of Giants and the gradual evolution of the event, from amateur races to becoming a world-class sporting event, recognized by the International Automobile Federation (FIA) for Formula Atlantic and Formula 3 races.

The book contains around 471 photographs, as well as an introduction to another collection by Victor H. de Lemos, “World of Motor Racing”, consisting of more than 1,900 autographed photographs of internationally renowned drivers, car owners and designers, such as “II Commendatore” Enzo Ferrari, Stirling Moss, Michael Schumacher, Roy Salvadori, Dan Gurney, Jack Brabham, Juan Manuel Fangio, Helmut Marko, Colin Chapman, Jackie Stewart, Janet Guthrie, Sid Walkins, Tony and Mary Hulman (owners of the Indianapolis circuit), Frank Williams, Charlie Whiting, Louis Meyer, among others.
“It was always his desire to gather all the photographs, many of which contain autographs from drivers, managers and other people directly linked to the automotive world, but also newspaper clippings, posters, circuit access tickets and other elements alluding to the event”, the author of the publication, who will be present at the launch session, revealed to Jornal TRIBUNA DE MACAU.
Having emigrated to Canada since 1978, Carlos Lemos, 77 years old, says that his father's estate is quite valuable. “If it were not published, it would be losing a great legacy”, he highlights, recognizing that “at that time, in 1978, when he finished his collection, it was very difficult to compile everything into a book, but now, with new technologies, it becomes easier”.
In a publicity note, APOMAC emphasizes that Victor H. de Lemos “was the greatest motorsport enthusiast who, for successive years, followed, very closely, the races on the Guia circuit, having managed to gather a vast collection of photographs and autographs of great drivers”.
This book “will be a relic for all lovers of motor sport and particularly for all those who participated in that event and, as well, for collectors of iconographic records”, adds the introductory document.
“The book is very well organized, with clippings from Portuguese, English and Chinese newspapers, being a work that completes the first”, said the president of the APOMAC board, Francisco Manhão.
The cover price of the publication is 400 patacas, with a discount to 350 during the promotion period. Part of the net proceeds from the sale will go to the Macau IC2 Association (I Can Too), which supports people with autism and other disabilities, with the other part going to APOMAC. The book can be purchased in advance via the email address [email protected] and delivery will be made on the day of release.</description><pubDate>2025-10-16 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Overconfidence and Szoboszlai ‘plotted’ Portugal</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/desporto/excesso-de-confianca-szoboszlai-tramaram-portugal/</link><description>Portugal ended up a victim of its own overconfidence, in the draw against Hungary (2-2), in a match in which the Portuguese team saw victory slip away in stoppage time, postponing qualification for the 2026 football World Cup. At the José Alvalade Stadium, in Lisbon, Roberto Martínez's team was already preparing to celebrate Portugal's ninth qualification, seventh in a row, for a World Cup, but Szoboszlai, in the 90+1 minute, had another idea.
Before, in the eighth minute, Szalai had given the Magyars the advantage, but Cristiano Ronaldo, at 22 and 45+3, in another night of records for the captain, led the turnaround, leaving Portugal very close to qualifying.
The excess of confidence shown in the final moments ended up being 'fatal' for Portugal, which even so only needs a point in Ireland, in November, in the fifth round of Group F, to move on to the next World Cup.
The lack of aim ended up being decisive for Portugal not to be celebrating qualification, especially in the first minutes of the second half, a period in which the 'quinas' team was clearly superior and wasted several opportunities to increase the advantage, including two balls hitting the posts.
Portugal continues to lead Group F, now with 10 points, five more than Hungary, second placed, four more than Ireland, third, and seven more than Armenia, which is no longer able to qualify directly.
As usual, Ronaldo once again made history and this time isolated himself on the list of all-time top scorers in qualifying stages for World Championships, with 41 goals, leading five in the group. Furthermore, the 40-year-old forward went on to score nine goals against Hungary, now his second main 'victim', only behind Luxembourg, who have already conceded 11 from Ronaldo.
This was the first qualifying game of the Martínez 'era' that Portugal did not win, after 10 victories on the way to Euro2024 and three at the start of qualifying for the World Cup. It was also the first time that Portugal failed to beat the Hungarians at home in official games, the second time counting away and neutral games.
Surprisingly, Hungary appeared quite bold at the start of the match, imposing high pressure on the Portuguese defense, with the aim of not letting Portugal out to play, and were soon rewarded, with Szalai scoring for the Magyars. Diogo Costa, who was practically a 'spectator' with Ireland, even saved a first ball for a corner, but, following the move, he looked bad in the 'photograph', with the Hungarian central defender finding it very easy to head in the face of defensive passivity. Szalai, 1.92m tall, appeared in the shot to be scored by Bernardo Silva, who is 1.73m tall.
At a disadvantage, Hungary logically lowered both lines, looking for the “best counterattack in the world” (a phrase said by Roberto Martínez minutes before the match), proving to be more enlightening than Portugal. At this stage, the 'corner' teams had more ball, but without practical results, while the Hungarians, with two or three touches, quickly reached the Portuguese area.
It was only necessary to introduce some speed for Portugal to reach a draw. Nelson Semedo broke through on the right side of the Hungarian area and crossed low for Ronaldo, completely free, to touch.
For better or worse, Portugal had reached the draw and even achieved the turnaround before the break, after Bruno Fernandes received a yellow card that ruled him out of the November game in Ireland. The recipe ended up being practically the same, but this time on the left and with Nuno Mendes crossing the ball at the edge of the area for Ronaldo, who appeared again completely alone to make it 2-1.
Portugal returned from the dressing room with new energy (Martínez's talk had its effect) and came very close to 3-1 twice, ending up both times being offside by the Hungarian goalkeeper's left post. First, in a move that he doesn't usually do much, Ruben Dias threw a 'bomb' from outside the area and then it was Bruno Fernandes with a shot from the edge of the area.
Martínez 'threw' João Palhinha, Francisco Conceição and João Félix onto the pitch (Bruno Fernandes, Rúben Neves and Pedro Neto left) and the third goal was once again close to happening. Conceição crossed for Félix, but the Magyar goalkeeper prevented the celebrations.
Without taking advantage of the opportunities, Portugal had a terrible scare when Szalai hit the bar, with Ruben Dias preventing the Hungarian central defender from reloading, when some Magyar players were already celebrating the draw.
Hungary gained confidence and once again believed that they could bring at least one point from Alvalade, while Portugal lost its spark, leading Martínez to remove Cristiano Ronaldo and Nuno Mendes, clearly exhausted, and to launch Gonçalo Ramos and Nuno Tavares. In an inexplicable way, the Portuguese team ended up letting the Hungarians take the game until the end and Szoboszlai, already in added time, took advantage of the Portuguese overconfidence, freezing the Alvalade stands.
 
Ronaldo isolates himself as the best scorer ever in qualifying
Cristiano Ronaldo isolated himself as the all-time top scorer in the qualifying stages for the World Championships, scoring his 40th goal against Hungary. Ronaldo scored in the 22nd minute and surpassed Carlos Ruiz, a retired Guatemalan striker, who shared the top scorers with the captain of the Portuguese team, with 39. With 36 goals, Messi remains in third place on this list and, at 38 years old, it is practically certain that he will not compete again for World Cup qualification with Argentina, while Poland's Robert Lewandowski, with 33 goals and 37 years old, it is also very difficult for him to ‘threaten’ Ronaldo. A very different scenario is already happening with Chris Wood, forward from Nottingham Forest, who has scored 29 goals with New Zealand and, at 33 years old, could still have another qualification ahead of him and in an area of ​​Oceania where the New Zealanders are completely dominant.
 
England opens batch of European candidates
England became the first European team to qualify for the World Cup, after beating Latvia 5-0 in Riga, in a Group K game. In Group E, European champion Spain accentuated its unbeatable campaign against Bulgaria (4-0) and now has 12 points and can qualify for the next round. Turkey remains in pursuit of the leader of the FIFA rankings, after defeating Georgia 4-1 at home. Isolated leader of pool I, Norway was not in action and saw Italy come closer with a victory against Israel (3-0). Italy is second, with 15 points, three behind Norway, which will visit the transalpine mountains in November. In African qualification, Côte d'Ivoire, Senegal and South Africa secured the last three of nine direct places for the World Cup, while Gabon, DR Congo, Cameroon and Nigeria advanced to the play-offs. The Ivorians, Senegalese and South Africans joined the previously qualified Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt, Algeria, Ghana and Cape Verde, in the winners of the nine groups entering the final phase, to which another African representative will be able to access through the intercontinental play-off. The third phase of Asian qualification for the World Cup also ended, with the delivery of two more 'passports', which will go to Saudi Arabia and Qatar, as expected. The United Arab Emirates and Iraq, which drew a 'null draw' in Jeddah, can still reach the World Cup, but the path is not easy, as they will now play against each other to advance to a difficult intercontinental play-off. Saudi Arabia and Qatar join, in the Asian contingent, the already qualified South Korea, Iran, Japan, Jordan, Uzbekistan and Australia, which had to compete in the Asian qualification.

The meeting also served to promote dialogues on financial cooperation
 
A meeting held in the Portuguese capital, aimed at the Central Banks of Portuguese Speaking Countries (PLP) and attended by a delegation from the Macau Monetary Authority (AMCM), focused on global economic and financial issues, “promoting in-depth dialogues on matters of financial cooperation between the PLP”, according to a summary note of the meeting released by AMCM.
The main objective was to monitor dynamic global trends in economic and financial development and strengthen cooperation with the central banks of Portuguese-speaking nations.
Speaking during the “Lisbon Meeting between the Central Banks of Portuguese-Speaking Countries”, the substitute president of the AMCM Board of Directors highlighted that Macau is accelerating the construction of a bond market, aiming to “serve as a bridge to Mainland China and create connections with the international market”.
In this context, Vong Sin Man said that the territory is promoting, “in stages, the optimization and updating of the central infrastructure of the bond market” – the Macau Securities Deposit Center. The initiative aims to “align with international practices and respond to the needs of external markets with regard to multi-currency settlement and multi-level custody models”, he highlighted.
Furthermore, he stated that the Macau Renminbi Real-time Immediate Settlement System (RMB RTGS) can provide PLPs with settlement services in a convenient and efficient manner. In the future, AMCM will continue to “improve financial infrastructures, improve cross-border financial services and promote regional financial stability and inclusive development”, giving “a new dynamic impetus to the sustainable development” of Macau and the PLP, he said.
During their stay in Lisbon, the AMCM delegation also visited the Portuguese Insurance and Pension Funds Supervisory Authority, where the feasibility of creating an advanced training center for supervisors from the Portuguese-speaking Insurance Supervisors Association was discussed.
This center will serve to build a base for training financial talents between China and the PLP, “further reinforcing Macau’s role as a financial services platform”.
AMCM has so far signed bilateral cooperation agreements with 12 financial supervisory authorities from eight Portuguese-speaking countries.

On Monday, he arrested six residents (five men and one woman), aged between 17 and 43, two of whom were said to have been main members of the network. A 17-year-old detainee identified herself as a student at a night school.
According to the PJ, the detainees allegedly enticed at least nine residents (eight men and one woman, three middle-aged, five young people and one minor) to travel to Taiwan to scam other people and help the network transport the funds handed over by the victims.
In September last year, the PJ began receiving requests for help from family members of these people, and investigations indicate that they have been traveling to Taiwan since the second half of 2024, in order to participate in illegal activities. The nine residents were eventually detained by Taiwanese police and sentenced to three to eight months in prison. Four who had served their prison sentences have already returned to Macau, while the other five are still serving their sentences in Taiwan.
The PJ revealed that the network first recruited the two main members, who later cooperated with the other suspects by searching online for alleged “highly paid motorcyclists” to “work in Taiwan”. The two main members earned 3% of the funds received from victims.
On the other hand, some of the nine residents claimed that their documents were “seized” shortly after arriving in Taiwan and they were forced to commit the crime. According to the investigation, each “motorcyclist” has so far collected thousands to tens of thousands of patacas.
Meanwhile, in another case, a 40-year-old worker, resident of Mainland China, was arrested and taken to the Public Prosecutor's Office, accused of sexual harassment, after touching the thighs of a tourist also from Mainland China.
Furthermore, the PJ was notified, in the early hours of yesterday, of a case in which a middle-aged man, non-resident, was found dead in a massage shop located on Avenida da Amizade. According to the PJ, the man did not suffer criminal injuries or injuries caused by violent acts. The cause of death will be determined by autopsy examination.</description><pubDate>2025-10-16 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>EPM and other institutions “lose” part of DSEDJ support</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/epm-outras-instituicoes-perdem-parte-dos-apoios-da-dsedj/</link><description>Several institutions, including the Portuguese School of Macau (EPM), will not receive part of the funding from the Education and Youth Development Services Department (DSEDJ) for having violated their duties as beneficiaries, specifically, for having submitted the report after the deadline.

The social houses planned by the Government may not be sufficient if adjustments are not made, consider academics interviewed by the TRIBUNA DE MACAU newspaper, arguing that housing policy must be rethought. According to data provided by the Housing Institute (IH) to this newspaper, of the 15,558 representatives of households renting social housing, more than half were aged 65 or over. Specifically, in mid-September, there were 8,406 elderly tenants, equivalent to 54% of the total population.
According to IH data, there are 4,674 tenants (around 30%) in the 45 to 64 age group, 2,465 (around 16%) in the 23 to 44 age group, and, finally, just 13 tenants aged between 18 and 22.
Taking into account the continued aging trend in the territory - projections from the Statistics and Census Services indicate that the oldest segment of the population will increase to 164,400 in 2041, at an average annual growth rate of 3.5%, “considerably higher” than that of the total population (0.7%) -, Agnes Lam, director of the Macau Studies Center, considers that social housing could “probably be insufficient, if there are no adjustments”.
"The percentage of elderly people is increasing and greater life expectancy means longer periods of occupation, increasing the accumulated demand for social housing units. Turnover is low, that is, elderly people vacate housing units less frequently, delaying availability for new candidates", noted the also former deputy.
Furthermore, Agnes Lam added that “if the new supply is far from transport, clinics, markets or community centers, for example in Zone A, the practical demand for these units may be lower than the nominal supply suggests”.
According to data provided by the Government, as of September 25th, 1,727 applicants for social housing were on the waiting list, of which only 184 had already been notified to present documents for consideration before being allocated a home. The majority, 946 (around 55%), were households made up of just one person, followed by households with two members (568), with three members (193), with four people (16) and with five people or more (4).
As for the age group, there are 358 candidates on the waiting list who are 65 years old or over, representing 21% of the total, with the majority being in the group between 45 and 64 years old and between 23 and 44 years old, for a total of 682 and 875, respectively. There are only 12 candidates aged between 18 and 22.
The fractions available for allocation, in turn, were 1,054 in mid-September, in addition, 5,494 were under construction (all in Zone A of the New Landfills) and 352 in the process of repair.
Asked whether the planned social homes will be sufficient to meet demand, Jacky Ho, director of the Faculty of Medical Sciences at the University of Saint Joseph (USJ) and specialized in Gerontology at the University of Sydney, argued that “the main focus should not be demand and supply, but rather rethinking our housing policy and the eligibility of potential residents, such as those who own an apartment in an old building”.
"It is important to keep in mind that GDP growth has increased dramatically in the last decade and that these 'potential residents' belong to a generation without an adequate retirement plan. They may have had an apartment, but they cannot meet the eligibility requirements of the current social housing program," he added.
Jacky Ho noted that Macau has many buildings that will exceed 50 years old in the next few years. “Without long-term strategies on how to rebuild these areas in time, these potential residents will have no choice but to remain in these old buildings, without adequate facilities or equipment for elderly care,” he predicted.
In the opinion of the USJ professor, it is necessary to outline strategies for the next decade, "If we expect an increase in the number of elderly people in the future who will try to find a home outside of these old buildings, we also hope that they will be able to find housing options with the help of the Government. Which means that the Government must work with social service organizations and experts in designing homes with an environment suitable for elderly people. I believe that social housing can be a great platform for this”, he stressed.
From Jacky Ho's perspective, one should not just think about building more apartments for the elderly, but rather find social housing and establish a quota there, for example, 20% of the units being allocated to the elderly. “I believe this could be a way to help alleviate the predictable burden that the population will have to deal with due to the aging population,” he added.
Regarding the ten-year policies that are being reviewed by the Institute of Social Action, Jacky Ho also argues that the Action Plan for Support Services for the Elderly and the Planning for Rehabilitation Services “should be analyzed together and aligned”. “Part of the rehabilitation plan has a lot in common with elderly care services, because as elderly people get older, their bodies become fragile and, in some way, they may have some type of disability,” he noted. Furthermore, it also proposes that the Executive create an independent department that focuses on population aging.
 
Elderly people “pushed” into subsidized options
Agnes Lam explained that it is natural for social housing to have a mostly elderly population, an “international and regional” trend. Firstly, because “the pension is normally lower than the salary of someone who works”, then because they have a greater need for health care. “Proximity to public services such as clinics and community centers, as well as accessibility features make social housing attractive relative to older private buildings without elevators or renovations,” he noted.
The academic also highlights that the criteria for evaluating economic resources and the priority score tend to favor older candidates, in addition to the fact that private house rents are higher in relation to the average income after retirement, “pushing the elderly towards subsidized options”.
Does this mean that the support granted by the Government to the elderly population is insufficient? “Not necessarily, but there are signs of gaps”, responds Agnes Lam. “Subsidies can reach many elderly people, but still not cover the real costs of rent, healthcare and assistance, especially with inflation and medical expenses”, she highlights.
Furthermore, it also points to the “gap in housing supply”: “Even with subsidies, if affordable and well-located units are limited, elderly people will accumulate on waiting lists for social housing or remain in unsuitable homes”.
Jacky Ho also notes that the majority of elderly people in social housing depend either on their savings or on those who support them. "From the research perspective in Macau, we realized that almost 85% of elderly people depend on government subsidies or financial support. This means that if they do not have [their own support], they actually depend on less than 5,000 patacas per month from the Government." In this sense, “the only housing options that may exist are housing with government support, in this case, social houses”.
 
Requirements for new social housing
The professor considers that, in basic terms, the requirements for new constructions include “having a social service organization to serve the residents of these social housing”, “implementing a project for an adapted structure for the elderly and people with disabilities in these buildings” and “installing technology that can help monitor the individuals who live in this environment”. At the same time, “we have to increase the number of home care services,” said Jacky Ho.
Agnes Lam considers that there are five criteria to take into account: accessibility, well-being, services and community, location and mobility, and, finally, management and maintenance. "Step-free paths, wide doors/corridors, reliable elevators are necessary, as well as non-slip floors, door handles, clear and high-contrast signage. Bathrooms must have a 'walk-in' shower and grab bars, and kitchens must be accessible", he stated.
The academic also considers that it is essential to have “welcoming common spaces on all floors” and “small corners for neighbors” to create a sense of belonging and well-being. Regular social activities should also be organised, there should be follow-up visits and easy access to advice and support, as well as staff trained to understand and respond to isolation or distress.
On the other hand, within the scope of services, he argues that nurses and social workers should be deployed nearby, as well as meal programs, in addition to the need for spaces for family visits and short stays for caregivers. “Intergenerational activities” are another point highlighted by Agnes Lam.
For this population group, it is also important that, close to social housing, there is public transport, clinics, pharmacies, markets, parks; barrier-free sidewalk, shade and benches every 50-100 meters; as well as covered and safe areas for boarding/disembarking. In terms of management and maintenance, he argues that repairs must be quick and that there must be clear help channels for emergency situations.</description><pubDate>2025-10-15 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>“Blackbird” on the balcony and on the street resulted in “positive interaction”</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/blackbird-a-varanda-na-rua-resultou-em-interaccao-positiva/</link><description>The show “Jazzés &amp; the Blackbird”, promoted by Casa de Portugal at the Fringe Festival, once again gave wings to jazz music on the balcony of the headquarters building of the Portuguese-based association.

Jazz music, taking as its stage the balcony of the building where the Casa de Portugal headquarters are located, was once again the basis of another “out the window” show, this time integrated into the Fringe Festival program. “Jazzés &amp; the Blackbird” was the title of the event with which the Portuguese-based association contributed to this year's edition of the artistic event that transforms the city into a stage, taking shows and activities to different areas of Macau, including community neighborhoods.
Being a festival that integrates unexpected initiatives, it was with some surprise that passers-by on Rua Pedro Nolasco da Silva, more specifically those who passed by the door of the Western-style building, with number 28, came across a “bird in the shape of people”.
On the walk, the bird's mission was to “flutter”, attracting the attention of young people and adults. Above, on the balcony, three more giant birds, these static, placed behind each member of the band playing jazz music. With this apparatus, many stopped to watch and take photographs. That was the objective of the initiative.
This whole performance, designed to mark yet another contribution from Casa de Portugal to the Fringe Festival program, “resulted in a very positive interaction”, according to the interpreter of the “black bird” exhibition, Elisa Vilaça, to the newspaper TRIBUNA DE MAC AU. The person responsible for dressing the animal's “skin” highlighted that the “public's reaction was very interesting, both from Chinese tourists and residents, who at first were surprised and somewhat apprehensive about my figure there on the street, but quickly joined in the games, especially the younger ones, providing moments of great laughter”.
The artist, who produced all the figures, considers that the show was “very positive”, noting that “the only problem is the fact that the place is very busy, with a lot of traffic, and therefore we need to be very careful, because people then start to gather on the other side, on the street next to the Consulate, to stay in the shade, watching the show and taking photographs”.
The “Jazzés &amp; the Blackbird” event took place over two days, in two daily sessions of half an hour each, in the morning and in the afternoon, with one of the sessions having to be postponed until the following week, due to the passage of Typhoon Ragasa.
In reviewing the activity, Elisa Vilaça states that “it is an initiative to repeat in the future, because it is always very interesting to interact with the public”. In his particular case, the “black bird”, the experience was positive.
“Contrary to what it seems, appearing to be an expansive person, I am often not that much, but there is a characteristic in me, perhaps because I have worked with children and theater for many years, the moment I play a character in a show, when I stop being Elisa and start being a bird or something else, I assume the role to the maximum, in what I really think are the characteristics of the element I am playing”.
The important thing is “to have a young spirit, and I do despite my age, since my mind remains perfectly open”, he emphasizes.
Tomás Ramos de Deus was the lead singer of the “show”, alongside musicians Paulo Pereira (saxophone) and Miguel Andrade (guitar), who had some supporting audio, having repeated the experience of singing on the balcony, after “Fado à Janela”, which Casa de Portugal also launched in March this year.
The musician from the institution's resident band, “80 &amp; Tal”, revealed to JTM that “Bye Bye Blackbird”, being a song written in honor of Charlie Parker, “was the one we chose because we really liked it, so we designed the project around that, starting to select an entire jazz repertoire around that involvement”. More classic songs were chosen, “but we also looked for some bossa nova songs, old ones from the 40s, and also selected modern jazz”, he highlighted.
Comparing it with “Fado à Janela”, he says that “the impact was the same, just something different, because this one had a greater visual impact, but in musical terms it was similar”.
“80 &amp; Tal”’s next performance is next weekend, at the Hush!” Festival, at Hac Sá Beach and at the Temporary Leisure Zone, in Coloane, followed by a performance at the Lusofonia Festival, on the 25th of October, immediately before Kalema’s take to the stage. “Then we’re going to play our Portuguese popular music project, pimba music, which is going to be a funny thing”, he observes.
Regarding Casa de Portugal's next initiatives, Elisa Vilaça told this newspaper that “there is a lot of work to do” for the Chinese New Year Celebration Parade, in the second half of February, and the Macau International Parade, in March, with no themes yet defined. “These are large-scale projects and our concern is to always give a good image of the House with great care”, he mentions.</description><pubDate>2025-10-15 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Coimbra and UM share database on Camões</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/coimbra-um-partilham-base-de-dados-sobre-camoes/</link><description>For the first time, the Portuguese poet Luís Vaz de Camões will have a universal, online database, developed by the University of Coimbra and with the support of its counterpart in Macau.

A universal online database on Luís Vaz de Camões, developed by the University of Coimbra (UC) will be available for consultation, from the middle of next year, both at the higher education establishment in that Portuguese city, and at the University of Macau (UM). The archive of information relating to the life and work of what is considered the greatest poet in the Portuguese language and one of the greatest in world literature, has the support of UM, and this collaboration will be expressed in a document to be initialed today in the early afternoon, in a ceremony to be held at the Macao SAR's “flag” university.
“There are already databases on Shakespeare, Cervantes and others, but there is nothing on Camões, so we give our support to the work carried out by UC”, Rui Martins, vice-rector for Global Affairs at UM, told Jornal TRIBUNA DE MACAU, adding that “this database will exist online at UC and also here at UM”.
Luís de Camões has a connection to the territory, “being a very important figure in Macau, which is why it makes sense to have a database here that makes the poet known universally”. The vice-rector thus explains the reasons for his connection to this project, through the support of the university's own Foundation.
In Macau there is nothing like this. “This will be a universal database that requires some development and research work from UC colleagues who will apply it to this project”, he expresses, highlighting that “it will be open to everyone, but will be based in Coimbra and also here in our university library”, and is expected to be available in 2026, “in a significant year for UM, which celebrates 45 years of existence”.
Before the collaboration signing session between the two sides, UM's admission to a UNESCO chair at UC will be formalized, which will be attended by the vice-rector of the Coimbra university, João Nuno Calvão da Silva.
The chair, which is a study or research center, is focused on the area of ​​intercultural dialogue and Portuguese-influenced heritage. “This is a chair coordinated by Coimbra, which covers several Portuguese-speaking and European universities, with UM now being admitted to this group”, indicated Rui Martins. A professor responsible for the chair, Walter Rossa, from UC, will also be present at the event, “and we will have our colleagues who will talk about the topic”, informed the academic.
Regarding the importance of this admission, remember that Macau is part of UNESCO heritage. “Therefore, this is a chair linked to intercultural dialogue between heritages, particularly those of Portuguese heritage, which is why it makes sense for us to also participate in research projects with colleagues in this area, in collaboration with Coimbra and other universities in Portuguese-speaking and European countries”, he stressed.
 
Law seminar brought together more than 100 experts
A joint UM and UC seminar brought together more than 100 experts and academics from Mainland China, Macau and Portuguese-speaking countries, who discussed emerging themes in the construction of the rule of law.
During the lecture, the rector of UM, Yonghua Song, stated that the principle of “One Country, Two Systems” guided the direction of legal research and the practice of the rule of law, providing Macau with “a miracle of development”, establishing a unique legal system and governance model.
Also speaking, the vice-rector for External Relations and Alumni at UC, João Nuno Calvão da Silva, highlighted the historic partnership between the law faculties of both universities, stating that the collaboration “has expanded to areas such as medicine and cultural heritage, reflecting the deep friendship between China and Portugal”.
António Menano, executive vice-president for Legal Affairs at MGM, highlighted that UM, UC and the gaming operator signed a cooperation agreement aimed at promoting, over the next four years, research and teaching in matters that include the reconfiguration of international law in the context of ecological transformation and the constitutional principle of the “one country, two systems” policy. This aim, he said, “will be achieved by holding seminars, granting scholarships and awarding academic prizes, with the aim of supporting students in developing diverse perspectives”.
The director of the Faculty of Law at UM, Tong Io Cheng, stated, in turn, that the harmonious coexistence of different legal systems and the deep integration between tradition and modernity allowed Macau to develop as a 'manual' of public law practice.
With the theme “Public, International, Constitutional and Administrative Law”, the event included three panels, with the participation of 14 academics from Mainland China, Macau, Portugal, Brazil, Angola and Mozambique.</description><pubDate>2025-10-15 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Chinese women's consumption is in countercycle with the economy</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/lazer/consumo-das-mulheres-chinesas-em-contraciclo-economia/</link><description>The consumption trends of women who are spending on themselves, especially on personal care and travel, have attracted attention in China, in a context of slowdown in the world's second largest economy. As President Xi Jinping's leadership works hard to encourage marriages and procreation in an attempt to stem the declining birth rate, these independent women appear unfazed.
The size of the market, called the “female economy”, is estimated at more than 10 trillion yuan per year.
An all-male dance group whose name literally means “Male Dog Theater” in Chinese has become extremely popular thanks to fan engagement strategies such as photo shoots and autograph signings.
Known for their sensual choreography, the group performed around 340 shows this year in just over a hundred cities in China. The presence of minors under 16 years of age is not permitted at the performance venues.
Fans scream as the group members take off their coats to show off their shapely, semi-naked bodies.
“We try to create a stage where the audience can reveal their true selves and have fun,” said Mr. Ge Junyi, 32, founder of the group.
The driving force behind the “women's economy” are Chinese women in their 20s and 40s, who grew up under the country's one-child policy. Typically, they completed higher education, especially in urban areas, and became financially independent. The wage gap between women and men has also decreased.
With economic prospects uncertain and social values ​​changing, many women do not want to marry or have children.
Income is money to be spent to “pamper ourselves”, as an employee in Shanghai said, as a reward for the exhaustion of hard work and fierce competition in society.
New types of services have emerged for women in China, such as hiking guides accompanying women on mountain trails and amusement parks with handsome men.
While some see this trend as a sign of the improved status of women, others oppose the “commodification” of men.
Traditional Chinese values ​​expect women to be good wives and wise mothers.
