In an interview with this newspaper, Spencer Li, professor at the University of Macau, listed a series of socio-economic factors that explain this evolution. In the same period of time, the incarcerated population also aged, which, for the professor, may suggest a decreasing trend in crime in the coming years

PEDRO MILHEIRÃO
“Crimes against sexual freedom and self-determination” increased by more than double (167.33%) in a decade. In 2014, 101 crimes of this nature were registered, while last year there were 270 cases registered, according to official data. In the same period of time, crimes “against the reserve of private life” increased from 94 to 231 (+145.74%), “crimes against property in general” almost doubled, from 1,835 to 3,605, and the number of transgressions “against public order and tranquility” rose more than 10 times, from just three to 35.
For Spencer Li, professor at the Faculty of Social Sciences at the University of Macau (UM), the increase in the first two categories reflects the impact of the new law against domestic violence, which was enacted in 2016. As he explained to the TRIBUNA DE MACAU newspaper, “after the approval of the 'Law to prevent and combat domestic violence', acts of domestic violence, including those that are against sexual freedom, self-determination and private life, were reclassified as public crimes and thus became more likely to [result in] arrest and prosecution.”
Additionally, “public awareness of sexual assault and sexual harassment as criminal behavior has grown, making individuals more likely to report such incidents to the police,” the professor noted.
On the other hand, “a large part of the increase in property crimes can be attributed to the deterioration of economic conditions experienced by certain segments of the population”. "The Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent economic recession have led to high unemployment rates, making it difficult for some individuals to make ends meet. As a result, some may have turned to property crime as an illegitimate source of income to support themselves and their families," he said.
The professor also does not neglect the role of the rise in cybercrime, with regard to property crimes. According to Li, "cybercrime mainly targets the assets of individuals and companies through schemes such as telephone fraud, Internet fraud and computer piracy. Given the high rate of Internet usage in Macau, cyberspace has provided greater opportunities for criminals to engage in property crimes."
In the same sense, and in relation to the increase in offenses against public order, Spencer Li argues that, “when people feel insecure and helpless, they may take to the streets to express anger and frustration, especially under the influence of alcohol”.
Conversely, “crimes committed in the exercise of public functions” were almost non-existent in 2024, with only one recorded, while in 2014 there were 33. Crimes “against public authority” and “crimes against the territory” also decreased by less than half, year-on-year. The first went from 671 cases to 192, while the second dropped from 903 to 398.
 
Incarcerated population is older than it was 10 years ago
In addition to there being 121 more prisoners in 2024 (1,326) than in 2014 (1,205), most prisoners have also aged.
In 10 years, there was a reduction in the proportion of prisoners up to 29 years of age, if we consider that, at the end of last year, the 202 prisoners in this age group corresponded to 15.23% of the total, while a decade earlier, the 347 prisoners in this group represented 28.80%. In the same period, incarcerated individuals aged 30 to 39 increased by 8.8 percentage points, rising from 362 (30% of the total) to 514 (38.8%). The share of people over 50 years old also grew, in the same time frame, from 169 (14.02%) to 291 (21.95%).
However, the UM professor does not believe that this phenomenon is due to the fact that younger people commit fewer crimes, on the contrary. “In fact, young people are more likely to commit crimes,” Li refutes. “However, the crimes they commit are often less serious and non-violent and therefore may not result in criminal charges or convictions. On the other hand, older individuals are more likely to be involved in violent crimes and drug trafficking. These crimes are more likely to appear in official statistics from the crime”, he says.
Still, the academic believes that “demographic changes may suggest a decreasing trend in crime in Macau over the next decade”. "As the birth rate declines, the proportion of youth in the population is decreasing. Since youth commit the majority of crimes, crime rates may decrease as the youth population declines," he notes.
"However, the economy faces significant challenges, one of which is the rising unemployment rate, especially among young people. Studies show that unemployment can contribute to higher crime rates. To help reduce crime, the Government must continue its efforts to maintain high levels of economic activity and prosperity in the city", considers the professor.
The Children's Institute also saw the demographic profile of its inmates aging. From 2014 to 2024, the number of minors between 12 and 15 years old registered in the correctional institution increased from nine to four. Young people over 16, on the other hand, rose from five to six. Furthermore, in the space of 10 years, the institute went from having four girls to none.
 
Challenges and reforms of the penal system
“Another challenge is immigration and its potential impact on crime,” notes Spencer Li. “Criminological research shows that crime rates tend to be higher in areas with larger immigrant populations. Macau is a diverse society with a high level of immigration and the integration of immigrant populations into the community remains an ongoing challenge to maintaining public safety and social stability.”
Asked what are the most urgently needed reforms to the penal system, Spencer Li finds it difficult to identify them. For the academic, “the criminal justice system has maintained a good balance between punishment and treatment”. "Under the current system, those who break the law receive the punishment they deserve. At the same time, the system makes significant efforts to rehabilitate offenders and help them reintegrate into society."
“However, one of the problems that affects residents the most is the widespread issue of telephone and Internet fraud,” Li reiterates. Although this is a complex problem, I hope that the criminal justice system can develop more effective strategies to resolve it.”</description><pubDate>2025-10-10 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Hengqin opens Lusophone Festival tomorrow</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/hengqin-inaugura-amanha-festival-lusofono/</link><description>Crafts, musical shows, gastronomy demonstrations and traditional Portuguese games will fill the first edition of the “Lusophone Cultural Festival” in Hengqin, which will take place tomorrow and Sunday.

Anyone traveling to Hengqin this weekend will be able to attend the first edition of the “Lusophone Cultural Festival” of the Deep Cooperation Zone, which will take place on Saturday and Sunday at the Cultural and Artistic Center. The event, organized by the Department of Social Affairs of the Deep Cooperation Zone and produced by Cable TV, with the support of the Cultural Institute, was scheduled for September 20th and 21st, but bad weather conditions caused it to be postponed for this occasion.
There was practically no publicity about the initiative in Macau and the elements that exist are all in Chinese.
The TRIBUNA DE MACAU newspaper learned that the “mini Lusophony festival” will only feature a Portuguese-based association, Casa de Portugal, “who was asked to collaborate, given their experience in this type of Lusophony events”, said the institution's general coordinator, Diana Soeiro.
Amélia António, president of Casa de Portugal, visited the space and said it was a “very beautiful, completely new area”.
The Cultural Institute was also contacted to provide programming suggestions, as it has extensive experience in organizing the Lusofonia Festival.
One of the strengths of the Portuguese-speaking event in Hengqin is the presence of artisans from Macau, Portuguese and locals, who will showcase their work at eight stalls. “We will have ceramics, jewelry, that work by Cláudia Falcão on the cobblestones, typical Portuguese pieces with hand-embroidered cloth and roosters, all creative works made by local artists at the Casa de Portugal Workshops”, revealed Diana Soeiro.
Furthermore, the Casa's participation will also take place on a musical level, as its resident band, “80 &amp; Tal”, will perform on Sunday's program, together with Betchy Barros, Giuliana Fellini and Dança Brasil. On Saturday, the Dance and Song Group “Macau no Coração”, Rita Portela with the “Fado Oriente” project, Ax Capoeira and Tuna Macaense will be on stage.
Details of the musical program were provided by Luís Bento, the musician responsible for the band “80 &amp; Tal” coming to Macau in 2013, who after six months performing at the Hard Rock Cafe was hired by Casa de Portugal. The artist, responsible for the technical production and logistics at this Lusophone Festival, in addition to being one of the band members, told JTM that “the space is very pleasant”, with the stage installed in a canopy area, therefore covered, next to the Hengqin Cultural Center building, “while the remaining activities will take place outdoors”.
In the field of gastronomy, the festival, whose opening ceremony is scheduled for tomorrow at 4:30 pm, with the event running both days until 9 pm, includes culinary demonstrations by Antonieta Manhão (chef Neta). “During the weekend, between 5pm and 7pm, I will prepare barbecue and Portuguese desserts”, the cook told JTM, adding that the fair will feature 12 food stalls.
In a Portuguese-speaking festival where the culture and customs of Portugal will be strongly represented, there will be no shortage of fun moments with traditional games, led by Cândido de Azevedo.
This “Lusophone Cultural Festival” in Hengqin takes place two weeks before the “Lusophony Festival” in Macau, which this year again has two consecutive weekends of celebration, six days in total, between October 24th and 26th, and October 31st and November 2nd at the Casas Museu da Taipa.</description><pubDate>2025-10-10 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Robots and ‘big health’ highlighted at MIF</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/robos-big-health-destacados-na-mif/</link><description>The Venetian's Cotai Expo will host the 30th Macau International Fair, in which more than 40 countries and regions will participate. The five exhibition areas will be aligned with the Macao SAR’s “1+4” industrial diversification strategy, with emphasis on the robotics and ‘big health’ industries.
 
The 30th edition of the Macau International Fair (MIF) will take place between the 22nd and 25th of October, at the Venetian's Cotai Expo, with the participation of exhibitors from more than 40 countries and regions, under the theme “Macau, Gateway to Global Business”, announced the Trade and Investment Promotion Institute (IPIM). Furthermore, 20 new technologies and products will be presented in this edition, “taking advantage of the innovative elements of Cotai Expo”.
Several pavilions will also be set up, including on “Robot Industry” and “Macao Big Health Brand Export”. In line with the “1+4” industrial diversification development strategy, the five exhibition areas include “Partner City”, “Macau-Hengqin Economy and Commerce”, “Mainland China Economy and Commerce”, “Macao Local Enterprises Exhibition and Sale” and “Industries Diversified”, in a demonstration of the Macao SAR’s “industrial diversity”.
During the event, a 'flash mob' street promotion activity will be organized for the first time in community neighborhoods, with a robot as an ambassador, “to show the deep integration between science and technology and the convention and exhibition area”.
The more than 50 convention sessions and forums will “comprehensively reinforce the role of the Macao SAR as an economic and commercial platform at a regional level”. At the same time, several contact exchanges will also be organized, in order to “create more connection scenarios for participating businesspeople, continually increasing the effectiveness of this exhibition”, can be read in the statement.
For this edition, the Macao SAR authorities invited Cantão as a “Partner City”. The essential idea is to “enrich the connotation of the event with innovative thinking and continually deepen the function of the Macao SAR’s economic and commercial platform”.
Furthermore, this year's MIF will be held in conjunction with the 2nd “China-Portuguese-Speaking Countries Economic and Trade Exhibition”, the “Macao Franchise Exhibition” and the “Conference on the High-Quality Development of Skilled Personnel of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area”.
Created in 1996, MIF was the first professional exhibition to be recognized by the Global Exhibition Industry Association. Over the years, it has deepened its role as a platform to promote the development of adequate diversification of the Macao SAR economy. IPIM recalled that, in recent years, the size of MIF has grown more than 10 times compared to the first edition of the event, with a circle of international friends of Macau in constant expansion”.

Although it fell a little short of the authorities' forecasts, the number reflects an annual increase of 1.9%, according to the CPSP. In total, 1.14 million visitors entered Macau
 
The eight-day Golden Week ended on Wednesday, the day Macau welcomed 88,993 visitors. Thus, the total number of visitors during China's National Day holidays exceeded 1.14 million, which translates into a daily average of 143 thousand, slightly lower than the 150 thousand predicted by the authorities.
Still, according to the Public Security Police Corps (CPSP), this average daily number reflects a slight increase of 1.9% compared to the same period last year and an increase of 2.8% compared to Golden Week in October 2019. In absolute terms, it is not possible to make a direct comparison since Golden Week had eight days this year, one more than in 2024.
Between October 1st and 8th, local borders recorded more than 5.53 million crossings, which represents a daily average of 692 thousand, rising 2.2% in annual terms and reflecting an increase of 20.9% compared to the same period in 2019.
According to the CPSP, the Macao SAR registered, on October 4th, 821 thousand border crossings and more than 191 thousand visitors, with both numbers breaking local records for October's Golden Week. On the same day, the Hengqin Border Post recorded 125 thousand entries and exits, the second highest daily record at this border.
On the other hand, CPSP data indicates that the majority of people who visited Macau during Golden Week came from Mainland China (82.4%). Visitors from Hong Kong, Taiwan and overseas accounted for 11.2%, 1.4% and 5% of the total, respectively.
With regard to border posts, 50.9% of entries and exits occurred at Portas do Cerco in these eight days. The Qingmao, Hengqin and Delta Bridge stations absorbed 15.6%, 15.1% and 11.3%, respectively, of border crossings. Macau International Airport recorded 3% of arrivals and departures.
Also according to the CPSP, between the 1st and 8th of October, nine infractions committed by taxi drivers were detected, four of which were refusing transport. Nine cases of lack of politeness in serving passengers were also forwarded to the Traffic Affairs Services and six situations of carrying out transport services without due authorization were identified.</description><pubDate>2025-10-10 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Israel and Hamas agree to ceasefire and release of hostages</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/ultimas/israel-hamas-acordam-cessar-fogo-libertacao-dos-refens/</link><description>epa12441289 Internally displaced Palestinians celebrate the announcement of a ceasefire agreement between Hamas and Israel in Khan Younis, southern Gaza Strip, 09 October 2025.

Israel and the Islamist movement Hamas yesterday reached an agreement for a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of hostages, following American President Donald Trump's plan to end two years of war in Palestinian territory. According to a source close to the negotiations consulted by AFP, the pact will be signed in Egypt after four days of intense indirect negotiations in Sharm el-Sheikh, in which the USA, Qatar and Turkey participated as mediators.
The time of entry into force has yet to be announced and the live hostages, captured during the Hamas attack on October 7, 2023 that triggered the war, will be released “according to conditions on the ground” in Gaza, said another source from the Islamist movement.
Referring to “a great day for Israel”, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would meet his government yesterday to “ratify the agreement”. Only after approval will this agreement come into force, as clarified by the Executive. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, from the far right, anticipated that he would vote against.
In Khan Yunis, in the south of a besieged, devastated and starving Gaza Strip, Palestinians applauded, shouted and danced upon learning of the agreement, according to AFP. In the hostage square in Tel Aviv, the Israelis also hugged each other and celebrated the agreement.
A high-ranking member of Hamas assured AFP that 20 live hostages under its control will be released in exchange for around 2,000 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli penitentiaries. Of the 251 people kidnapped by Hamas in 2023, 47 remain in Gaza, 25 of whom died, according to the Israeli army.
To complete the exchange, the Israeli army assured that it is already preparing the withdrawal of troops from the Gaza Strip, of which it controls approximately 75%.
Trump was “very proud” when announcing the pact, with which “all hostages will soon be released and Israel will withdraw its troops to an established line, the first steps towards a strong, lasting and eternal peace”. The US President estimated that the hostages “will return on Monday”, including “the bodies of the deceased”.
Before releasing the agreement, Trump anticipated a possible visit to the Middle East at the end of the week.
In a statement, Hamas confirmed that it had reached an agreement that “provides for the end of the war in Gaza, the Israeli withdrawal from the territory, the release (of the hostages) and the entry of humanitarian aid”. According to a Hamas source, at least 400 humanitarian aid trucks are expected to enter the Gaza Strip daily during the first five days of the ceasefire.
In addition to the truce and access to assistance, Trump's 20-point peace proposal also establishes the gradual withdrawal of the Israeli army from Gaza and the disarmament of Hamas.
Several world leaders readily welcomed the peace agreement, praising the imminent end of the war in Gaza and the release of hostages.

The Chief Executive of the Macao SAR was present at the lighting of the flame that marked the beginning of the decreasing date of one month until the official start of the 15th edition of the National Games of the People's Republic of China (PRC). The ceremony took place in Nansha, in the Guangdong district, where Sam Hou Fai was alongside his Hong Kong counterpart, John Lee, and the Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Huang Kunming, at the moment of the joint lighting of the flame, before it later traveled to the three regions of the Pearl River Delta.

The tournament, which offers one million dollars in prizes, will also feature English veteran Lee Westwood and today's top Chinese golfers

























The list of entries for the 2025 Macau Golf Open was completed with the entry of North American John Catlin, winner of the “Order of Merit of the Asian Tour” in 2024. The player returns to the territory, after participating in the “International Series” in March of this year.
Catlin, 34 years old, currently occupies a modest position in the world rankings (201st), but his international experience makes him one of the main favorites for first places in the Macao SAR competition. He won 13 times “Asian Tour” tournaments, having finished tied for fourth place in the 2024 Macau Open, after having won the title, in March of that year, in the “International Series”, also played on the Coloane lawn.
In other highlights of the territory's competition, English veteran Lee Westwood, former world number one and Macao SAR champion in 1999, appears. The 52-year-old golfer will have at his side, as his main rivals, the South Korean Sungjae Im and the Thai Rattanon Wannasrichan, winner of last year's edition.
In addition, the competition will feature China's current best player, Li Haotong, who will be joined by Taichi Kho, from Hong Kong, gold medalist at the 2023 Asian Games, and the first HKSAR player to triumph in an “Asian Tour” event at the “World City Championship” two years ago.
Three Thai athletes have won the trophy since its creation in 1998. Pavit Tangkamolprasert, winner in 2016, is back, after taking third place in the “Jakarta International Championship” last week. The 36-year-old will try to become the fourth to win the Macau Open twice.
Another golfer identified as an “outsider” in the title issue is rising Chinese star Ding Wenyi, 20 years old. The young Beijing native turned professional in 2024 and has had a solid season so far, with five top-20 finishes. His career highlights to date include victories at the 2024 Asia-Pacific Amateur Championship and the 2022 US Junior Amateur Championship.
Malaysia will have four representatives on the 18-hole course at the “Macau Golf &amp; Country Club”, with Ervin Chang, Shahriffuddin Ariffin, Marcus Lim and Galven Green. The top two will be making their third consecutive appearance at the event, while Lim and Green are making their debuts.
This year, the Macau public is curious to see a second Westwood in action, as Samuel is Lee's son. The 24-year-old Brit, who turned professional in 2022, is now gaining notoriety and has already won second place in the “Alamos Open II” of the “Portugal Tour” this season. Samuel was his father’s caddy, both in the “Masters” and the “Ryder Cup”.
As previously announced, Chinese golf legends Zhang Lianwei and Liang Wenchong will compete alongside some of the country's rising stars, including Team Hong Kong's Asian Games bronze medalist Matthew Cheung and local talent Kelvin Si Ngai.
The entry list also includes Ethan Tian Jun, just 15 years old, member of the Hong Kong team, and Irish professional Brian O’Dovonan. Launched last year to nurture new golf talent, this year's Macau Open Qualifying Tournament took place in late September, with the top two teams securing places in the main event.
For the first time on the “Asian Tour”, fans, who have free entry, will be able to follow their favorite players with the “Player Locator”. By scanning QR codes at various locations around the field, visitors can access the tournament's interactive map to follow performance in real time.
The tournament with one million US dollars in total prizes, takes place between the 16th and 19th of October, with the presence of 144 players, from various countries and regions. The organization is in charge of the Sports Institute, the Macau Games Society and the international golf company IMG, with the support of the “Asian Tour” and the Macau Golf Association.

The event will take place on Sunday and will serve, according to coach Nuno Marques, to “energize and promote the sport in schools in the territory

Close to 50 students from various educational establishments in Macau will participate in the second edition of the School Climbing Championship, which will take place in the fixed structure of the Portuguese School of Macau (EPM).
The competition, organized by the Mountaineering Federation, will include student-practitioners from 20 schools, divided into three age categories, from 8 to 11, from 12 to 15 and over 15 years old. The tests will take place on Sunday, starting at 10:45 am, when the qualifying phase will take place. The finals are scheduled for 3:30 pm, while the awards ceremony will take place at around 5:00 pm.
EPM participates in the competition with eight young people, five in the men's sector and three in the women's sector, “with some of them being able to argue for the first places”, the team's coach told Jornal TRIBUNA DE MACAU, who believes that there is “some progress”, especially with the entry of more young people into climbing in the territory.
Regarding the holding of the championship, Nuno Marques, physical education teacher at EPM, stated that the Federation's objective is to “boost and promote the sport in schools in the territory”, with the aim of creating a Macau team in the short term that can participate in competitions abroad.
“It is groundwork that needs to be done so that climbing can reach another level, thus trying to reduce the difference that exists between Macau and Zhuhai and Hong Kong, for example, where more venues and teams have appeared in recent years”, he stressed.
The Mountaineering Federation held the first school climbing championship in September 2024, on the wall installed in Bairro do Hipódromo, with the presence of a dozen educational establishments. EPM won one of the categories and was third in one of the remaining disciplines.
The entity that oversees the sport in the Macao SAR has held several tournaments, including youth and senior levels, and last year launched a championship aimed solely at students.
As for the existing climbing facilities at EPM, they were opened in 2014 and during these years several competitions have been held there, more internally, since the modality integrates extracurricular activities, in this case sports.
Even with little competition, “we have already taken our young people to competitions outside Macau, namely Hong Kong and Foshan”, concludes Nuno Marques.

The proposed prices vary between 308 million and more than 370 million patacas, and deadlines between 558 and 590 working days. This contract has a maximum execution period of 620 working days and will begin immediately after the completion of the foundation and basement works. Upon completion, the work will be handed over to user services for exquisite interior decoration and equipment installation, said DSOP. Installed in the former Hotel Estoril, the New Central Library will occupy an area of ​​around 2,960 m2. According to the project, the library will be four floors high and have a basement, with a gross construction area of ​​around 13,800 square meters, that is, 10 times greater than the area of ​​the old central library. The ground floor and upper floors will house specific areas, including auditoriums, a newspaper and magazine reading area, a library for adults, a library for children, a library for young people, meeting rooms and multimedia spaces, among others, thus creating a “smart library” that will integrate reading, exchange, learning and leisure. DSOP also emphasizes that the library was designed for all ages and will be accessible to users of all age groups, being equipped with barrier-free facilities. Taking into account that, currently, access between Estrada da Vitória and Rua Filipe O’Costa is dependent on stairs, the Government will incorporate an elevator into the project to provide access to the public 24 hours a day.</description><pubDate>2025-10-10 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>ONE in the “top 150” of the “Times Higher Education” ranking</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/um-top-150-ranking-da-times-higher-education/</link><description>The University of Macau (UM) rose 35 places to 145th position, entering the group of the 150 best universities for the first time in the “Times Higher Education” table for 2026.

Furthermore, Korean Aero K Airlines is expected to start flights between Macau and Cheongju, in South Korea, in December, CAM indicated, also recalling the launch, at the beginning of this month, of air connections to Sihanoukville, in Cambodia. According to the company, Macau airport received 167 thousand passengers and handled 1,378 aircraft during the Golden Week holidays, that is, between the 1st and 8th of October, numbers that represent increases of around 2.6% and 1.8% compared to the previous year. “The slow recovery is mainly due to current global economic challenges, changes in traveler preferences and the operational impacts of typhoon conditions”, considered CAM, admitting that “Golden Week performance fell short of expectations, leaving the airport cautious about its performance for the rest of the year”. The same note also states that the airport will open a service center at the “Shenzhen Shekou Cruise Center” this month to improve connections to the Greater Bay Area.</description><pubDate>2025-10-10 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>There is a new relationship among young South Koreans</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/lazer/ha-um-novo-namoro-entre-jovens-sul-coreanos/</link><description>The fear of being a “relationship virgin” began to have an impact on young South Koreans. One of the main drivers behind this dating trend is the desire to avoid the dreaded label of “mosol”, Korean slang for someone who has never been in a relationship, which directly translates to “single since birth”.
South Korean singer Jang Yoon-jeong was surprised when her children shared an unusual aspect of their peers' dating culture: dating only during one part of the school day to avoid being labeled as "mosol."
These “one-period couples” start dating during recess and break up before the next class starts, Jang said in a recent TV appearance. Considering that a single period in South Korean elementary schools lasts 40 minutes, these fleeting relationships last less than an hour.
Adults may wonder what these children do during this period, whether such brief relationships can be called real and why they get involved in them.
To escape the “mosol” label, some are engaging in brief, practically symbolic relationships, lasting just an hour, just to prove that they were in love.
"You simply hand a note to a friend you like saying, 'Do you want to go out with me?'
When asked what she does when she has a boyfriend, or what a boyfriend means to her, she said they are “closest friends”. And they play hide and seek.
In South Korea, where relationships are often seen as an indicator of social competence and normality, the fear of being a “virgin” in this field began to affect young people from an early age. These brief relationships act as a social shield, allowing children to feel included and accepted.
This stigma, combined with the incessant promotion of ideal relationships on social media, has trickled down to the youngest members of society, leading children to develop their own dating habits. For example, confessions of affection are sometimes externalized. Students post messages on social media asking for volunteers to speak out on their behalf.
One of them posts something on social media like: "I liked someone. Can you guess who it is? I'll reveal it to the first person who comments." Then, the first commenter demonstrates this romantic interest on behalf of the author of the original publication.
“When my son explained this culture to me, I was shocked,” said Kim Joong-whan, 45, in an interview with “The Korea Herald”. "'Is this some kind of substitute for real emotions?' I asked. It's shocking how what used to be an emotional and harrowing moment of confession has turned into a playful online trend," he added.
To avoid the embarrassment of rejection, the children also adopted the “janggo” strategy, a term created by children, which is an abbreviation for “confession joke”.
If a romantic proposal is turned down, one can quickly backtrack, claiming it was just a joke and keeping up appearances. This method has gained popularity among younger people as a way to protect feelings while testing a possible relationship.
Experts point to the widespread influence of social media as a key factor driving these behavioral trends.
Hallym University sociology professor Shin Kyung-ah said: “Platforms are flooded with content that ‘glamorizes’ relationships, from romantic confessions to selected couples’ aesthetics.”
“This constant exposure influences children to imitate the behaviors they see, often without fully understanding the implications.”
Relationship-related terms such as “ppoppo” (a peck on the lips or cheek), “kiss” (typically used in a romantic and intimate context in Korean), “skinship” (a Korean word created from English terms to mean physical affection) and referring to each other as “lovers” have become part of children's everyday vocabulary, according to a 31-year-old teacher of basic education.
"My students openly discuss these terms with their peers. Words like kiss, which were once whispered, are now used casually," said the teacher.
While some parents find the innocence of these interactions endearing, others express discomfort with the rapid pace of their children's emotional development. Educators and experts also highlight the importance of teaching children about boundaries and consent so they can navigate relationships responsibly.
