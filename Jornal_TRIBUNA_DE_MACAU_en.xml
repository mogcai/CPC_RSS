Despite the desire to give way to the younger ones, they are maintaining in office, because people are still missing “availability” to ensure the future of the association. In an interview with the Jornal Tribuna de Macau, the leader does, with the “pride” of the duty accomplished, the balance of the long period of “fight”, “permanent challenge” and “high and downs”

Half of 43 years of permanence of Amelia António in Macau has been dedicated to work at the House of Portugal, namely from the moment she assumed the position of president of the Board, on June 30, 2005, succeeding João Manuel Costa Antunes.
The 20 -year -old balance is considered by the guardian as “very positive, for what the house has grown, in what he was able to do, and he could be proud in his way,” he told the Jornal Tribuna de Macao. This despite "a lot of struggle to face the difficulties and setbacks that have arisen."
A few years ago Amelia António seeks to find people who can replace her to "guarantee the future," but it has been difficult. Meanwhile, it delaying the exit, adding several mandates. “Looking back, when I started the position of president of the House of Portugal, I never imagined that, 20 years later, it would still be in the same position,” acknowledges the leader.
In the balance sheet, the profession lawyer says it has been two decades with "ups and downs" and a "permanent challenge", in a cause where "the arms cannot be lowered." Having accepted the invitation to be number one of the Board, after two years at the General Assembly table, the leader states that she was convinced that “it could be useful” to try to continue the projects of the house.
"We had no structures, we had no backgrounds, we had nothing and gradually, step by step, we were looking to find ways," he said, recalling that at that time, in the early years of Casa de Portugal, founded in 2001, on an important date for the Portuguese community (June 10), "there was a lot of controversy, there was a lot of opinion division over the role of the house."
It recalls that “there were those who argued that the association should have a more active political intervention, which should be turned mainly to aspects related to the Portuguese situations here, in terms of work and a number of other aspects”.
It was following this initial period of development that Amelia António was “convinced” to accept the position. "They thought I could be useful and the person indicated to jump, to solve these differences and connect the community, unite people otherwise," he says, adding that "the house went out, looking for government support, that we first got the executive of Edmund Ho and after Chui Sai On, as they were doing things, because we could achieve goals."
Later, the Macau Foundation (FM) subsidies came, “but slowly, for concrete projects”, because FM “did not know our association well”. Gradually, “we grew up, doing work, gaining credibility,” he expresses, noting that a subsidy began to be requested for operation. "Without this, without being assured the operation and a support structure for working, the projects were very difficult to accomplish."
 
Community aggregating pole
For the leader, the "association never asked for anything they did not do, never made proposals that were unrealistic or not possible to realize, and as it did it was gaining this credibility." Therefore, "it was the normal way of an institution that always worked hard, that mobilized people to accomplish things, and to be a community aggregating pole of the community and diffuser of Portuguese culture."
The objective was, reinforces, “creating conditions for more Portuguese to develop personal work, having their ideas and leading them to practice, so a whole path that, when done, was ensuring respect for the work developed”. In 2011, the executive attributed the cultural merit medal to Casa de Portugal: "This was a very important step for the recognition of the work done."
Eight years later, the Covid period came to "to stop everything, create a new situation." “A lot of people wanted to get out of the territory, frightened by the situation and, therefore, we lost trainers, lost very qualified people who participated in the formation and had, say, to lie down to the participation of people who had already been formed in the house, who had already learned certain arts over time,” recalls Amélia António. "We again restart, trying to replenish and put things to work, which was a challenge."
Throughout his journey as president, he recalls some disappointment, such as the closing of the commercial space located in the “Yellow Casa”, a building near the ruins of São Paulo, in which the government had provided the installation of a series of stores and where there was a tourist information station. "It was a window of products of Portuguese culture, gastronomy, with quality products, which was indeed a very beautiful thing, very well-made," he said. The space would eventually close, because the owner demanded a very high income that the government did not accept.
"It was a great concern, because we had a huge charge, resulting from the requests for loan to banks, and had to reorganize, work hard, sell products and services of ours, make a kind of canteen at our headquarters, to keep people to work and not to give the project as failed," he explains that the house competed for several competitions and in one of them was not eliminated.
The limited arts and crafts CPM, whose single partner is the Casa de Portugal Association in Macao was created. “It was a good solution, to be within the rules,” I wins Amelia António, ensuring that “everything has been achieved with hard work, a lot of struggle and conviction that we have to have a position that is useful to her masters, and that it is in your interest as well, making known that it is a diffuser pole of Portuguese culture, our language, what is best made in Portugal, etc.”.
 
Conjugation of interests enriches cultural panorama
In the role played over the 20 years in which she has exercised the presidency of the association, the leader states that “it is a way to keep the activity and presence of the Portuguese alive, contributing to this enrich the cultural panorama of Macao and the knowledge of Portuguese culture that should not be erased”.
Underlines there is a conjugation of interests. "If, on the one hand, the community has all the interest in seeing its work, its culture, language, among other aspects, on the other, China has also defined as an objective of Macao exactly being linked to other cultures, constituting a pole connecting with Portuguese -speaking countries," he says.
Since Portugal is the oldest Portuguese -speaking country, “which is completely intertwined in local culture and what gives Macau a different identity, I think we have an obligation, while residents of this feature, with this identity, to develop a work that meets the interests on both sides”.
About his stay in office for so many years, Amelia António acknowledges that she has long wanted to leave, because, says "I've been 80". However, there is no people who are available, because work "is actually very demanding, practically full time, voluntary." So, “I'm staying,” he adds, not knowing how much more time.
In what is to do in the nearest times, it states that there are areas that need reinforcements, to jump, namely in the part of the art and craft workshops, such as the question of the people who left. "We need to have some properly qualified trainers, people who know well of certain areas." On the other hand, he concludes, "it is necessary to value, to rethink the way of giving workshops, to teaching, showing and qualifying, giving them a clear status that it is there to teach things for people to be properly formed."</description><pubDate>2025-07-02 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>New plan draws projects in hengqin until 2029</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/novo-plano-traca-projectos-em-hengqin-ate-2029/</link><description>The five-year planning of industrial development in the hengqin cooperation zone was published this week and defines the main projects to be developed by 2029.

Caeal's decision on the verification will be released on the 15th of this month. On the other hand, until yesterday, Caeal did not receive complaints or information on electoral propaganda during the prohibition period
 
Until Monday, the last day for the candidates' candidates' list of candidates to challenge the decision of the Legislative Assembly Electoral Affairs Committee (Caeal) on the regularity of the candidates' presentation process or the eligibility of candidates, Caeal did not receive any challenges, said Seng Ioi Man, chairman of the committee.
Following a Caeal meeting held yesterday, Seng Ioi Man explained that Caeal is checking all lists of candidates delivered to realize the regularity of dossiers, the authenticity of the files and the eligibility of the candidates.
In addition, it has already submitted the lists and information from candidates for the State Security Defense Commission (CDSE), which will verify whether they advocate the basic law and are faithful to MSAR. Asked about the specific questions that will be verified, the president of Caeal clarified that it is up to CDSE to judge the matter in accordance with legal rules.
Under the electoral law, regarding the decision taken by Caeal, according to the opinion on the verification issued by CDSE, it is not allowed to submit a complaint or filed a litigation. CAEAL's decision on the verification of the applications will be disclosed on the 15th.

If the candidate is considered not eligible for not meeting the above legal requirements, he may submit a complaint or appeal.
In addition, asked if Caeal ponders publicly publicizing any negative opinion on candidates, Seng Ioi Man stressed that the documents are still underway. "When we have the results and when we have the decisions, we will publicize to the public," he said.

On the other hand, the Commission will develop a voting model that will allow voters visually impaired to enter the voting booths and stamp the bulletins without the company of others. In addition, at voting assemblies, magnifying glasses will be placed to help voters with visual impairment or weak vision to see the bulletins more clearly and vote according to their will.
Already the deadline for legal persons voting voters to deliver the lists of voters will end on the 7th.

Guide -oriented, participants may perform the measurement and design of common fish, and know the species through the mobile application of DSPA.
 
Promoted sessions on weather education
Meteorological and Geophysical Services (SMG) perform two activities for parents and children this month: “family activity to know meteorology” and “exploration of meteorology with fun”. Registration is open until July 6, and the activities will be held in Cantonense. The first one happens on the 12th, directed to children aged 6 to 12, and includes weather observation, interactive games and workshops. The second is scheduled for July 19 and 26, for children from 4 to 8 years, including visualization of a theater, experimentation of typhoon signals and simulation of presentation of the meteorological forecast. In both cases, a visit to the Meteorological Forecasting and Alerting Center and the Centennial Meteorological Station is planned.</description><pubDate>2025-07-02 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Students will have a platform for mental health consultation</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/alunos-vao-ter-plataforma-para-consulta-de-saude-mental/</link><description>A 24 -hour online consultation platform for students will be launched in the scope of mental health.

To intervene early on mental health problems, the government will “reinforce psychological support in community neighborhoods and schools”. In particular, the Directorate of Youth Education and Development Services (DSEDJ) will launch “a 24 -hour online consultation platform for all students”, in the context of mental health.
This tool will allow, “in view of the risks detected and the hidden cases of students”, directly forward students to “timely support”, through the Verde Verde provided by health services (SSM), revealed the body's director, Alvis Lo.
At the same time, “the size of students' counseling services teams will be increased, reinforcing their functions in identifying, supporting and monitoring students with needs”. This is through “Chat with U-Open Line Program for Students and Support through the Internet”, which provides an immediate open line and online emotional support services to students with needs, can be read to respond to a Song Pek Kei interpellation.
The deputy was concerned about the issue of suicide, asking for a monitoring mechanism to reinforce support and intervention. According to information released by the authorities, 84 suicide attempts were reported in the first quarter of this year, "which reflects the high risk of suicide in Macao," he noted.
In this context, he argued that all age groups face different pressures and challenges, and it is difficult to count only on the strength of a single public service or a professional aspect to deal effectively, with psychological pressure and emotional problems. Specifically, he pointed out that emotional problems need to be detected at an early stage.
Alvis Lo pointed out that the SSM, the DSEDJ and the Institute of Social Action (IAS) have maintained a close communication with community institutions, realizing the joint mechanism of “joint four level prevention” on mental health. He also said that DSEDJ promoted the creation of the “Working Group on Physical and Mental Health at School” in all schools, and the students 'mental health identification table and their work guidelines so that schools can identify, in due time, the students' needs and support them taking into account the corresponding level.
In turn, Si Ka Lon also expressed concern about this issue. The deputy recalled that in recent years, the number of suicide deaths has been increasing in Macao, with 91 cases in 2024, "the highest number of the last 10 years." In view of the international suicide rate, "which is 9 to 10 per 100,000 people, the Macao rate is 30% higher, which shows that mental health has already become a major challenge for public health," he warned.
In the response also signed by the SSM director, it is said that there are currently more than 7,000 people who have accepted the formation of being “guardian of life”-people who engage in promoting mental health and community well-being, being encouraged to pay attention to the psychological health of those around them.
In the future, says Alvis Lo, IAS will cooperate with different institutions and associations to continually disclose the idea of ​​“affectionate people”, dedicated to forming more “life guardians”.
It also underlines that “in the face of possible psychological or emotional disturbances”, SSM, “in addition to providing psychological support measures, also appeals to residents to develop a healthy lifestyle, namely regular exercise, balanced diet and enough rest”.</description><pubDate>2025-07-01 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Macao Catholic churches were erected with innovative techniques</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/igrejas-catolicas-de-macau-foram-erguidas-tecnicas-inovadoras/</link><description>The first bamboo reinforced concrete techniques will have been used in the Catholic churches of Macao in the 16th century. One study stresses that the architecture of the churches influenced the urban development of the city and the Lingnan region. It also points out that “the process of building the modern Catholic churches in Macao deeply reflects the double trajectory of colonial expansion and cultural adaptation”

The construction of the 16th century Catholic churches in Macao will have launched the foundations for the city's urban development and influenced the architectural evolution in the Lingnan region, indicates an investigation published in the Journal of Asian Architecture and Building Engineering ”. According to the article entitled “A Study on Architectural Characteristics and the Value of Modern Catholic Churches in Macao”, the churches have become spaces that allowed the expression of new techniques in religious architecture.
The use of bark powder and straw to reinforce the strength and durability of buildings, for example, were innovative methods, according to the researchers group composed by Francisco Vizeu Pinheiro, from the Faculty of Arts and Humanities of the University of St. Joseph, and the Academics Yao Wu, Yonglan Wu and Mingrui Miao, from Suzhou University.
Researchers suggest that at that time the first bamboo reinforced concrete techniques were used in European architectural constructions. The "choice of the place, the layout, the unique style and the structural requirements" reflected "a deep architectural wisdom."
The modern Catholic churches of Macao, "with new materials and elements," contrasting "strongly with Lingnan's architecture", and exhibited "various well -defined spatial styles and functions." Construction materials and decorative patterns typical of Lingnan's traditional culture, in turn, were also incorporated, "reflecting respect and continuation of local culture." Constructions gave rise to “distinct and attractive” urban landscapes, as well as provided “essential” support for the sustainable development of the city.
For the conduct of this study, the group of researchers analyzed 12 churches -such as the São Francisco Xavier Church, Sé, St. Augustine, São Lourenço or Penha -from four dimensions: Layout, style evolution, construction technology and cultural value. According to the authors, Macao became a “unique stage for the intersection and integration of oriental and western architectural art, religious thinking and even social culture”.
The article describes the “influence of the diffusion of western culture”, but also the “adaptation” to what was local. “As an architectural product of a special historical context, the process of building modern Catholic churches in Macao deeply reflects the double trajectory of colonial expansion and cultural adaptation,” says the study.
Events such as the discovery of commercial routes in southeastern China by the Portuguese, the attempted Dutch invasion of Macao and the British occupation of Hong Kong will have influenced the development of Catholic churches in the territory.
These events would eventually introduce classic elements of the West into local architecture, such as baroque and gothic styles. Ties with Portugal, Southeast Asia and Islamic Religious Culture also shaped Macao's architecture, “enriching the cultural diversity and uniqueness” of the churches, can read.
More concretely, as regards the plant of churches, it is said that they have three types - the convex symmetrical plant, which “inherits the tradition of European basilicas and reinforces the sacredity of ritual space”; the parallel rectangular plant, which adapts “to the dense urban texture of Macao with a single compact main hall”; and the symmetrical curved plant, which "reaches acoustic optimization and the translation of maritime cultural symbols through curved walls."
For the authors, "this type of differentiation shows that by transplanting western spatial paradigms, the architecture of the churches of Macau has developed a local adaptation logic based on the geographical environment and functional needs."
The façade of the churches, in turn, also shows that style has undergone four phases of transformation: the proportional law of Renaissance classicism, the dynamic composition of baroque aesthetics, the simplified form of neoclassicism and the local experience of gothic rebirth. In the study, it is noted that "the styles of each phase are not simply copied, but cultural translation is achieved through the local transformation of crafts."
By way of example, researchers point out “the reduction of the depth of relief in the baroque gerine of the Rosary Church [São Domingos Church]” and “the elevation of the classic base of the Saint Joseph Seminary column”. “This double mechanism of 'imitation of the form-formal form' confirms the essential attributes of colonial architecture as a field of cultural negotiation,” they continue.
 
Social changes and cultural exchanges
In addition, research offers a perspective for understanding the social changes and cultural exchanges of Macao and the entire coastal area of ​​China. The connection of churches to the Silk Maritime Route, for example, contributed to a free economic flow, greater integration and cooperation between markets, as well as an improvement in cultural exchanges between civilizations and connectivity between Asia, Europe and Africa.
The arrival of Catholicism also reconfigured religious practice, which involved, above all, the worship of the sea gods and a reverence for natural forces. The Catholic Church brought rooted ideals in justice and ethics, and the new churches served as instruments of social control and cultural reproduction.
Through “a comprehensive analysis of the intersection, merger and coexistence of oriental and western cultural influences”, this investigation provides ideas for the conservation of Macao's architecture and heritage, consider the authors of the study.
"In part of the cross analysis of space, technology and culture, it reveals the complexity of the churches of Macau as 'intercultural construction products'. The study confirms that the 'local nature' of colonial architecture is not only reflected in the imitation of form, but also exists in the multifaceted interaction of material translation, adaptation of the process and symbolic reorganization," they reiterate. Investigators also point out that "the continuous use of the church to this day makes it in a typical case of living cultural heritage protection."</description><pubDate>2025-07-01 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Authorities bet on creating “sustainable” AI system</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/autoridades-apostadas-em-criar-sistema-de-ia-sustentavel/</link><description>Continue to develop studies on artificial intelligence technology, as well as formations for civil service workers are some of the government's objectives, which is betting on creating a “sustainable” AI platform for public services.

The executive intends to establish “a sustainable artificial intelligence platform for use of public services” and, for this, will reinforce the results of AI support work, namely “through training in possible scenarios and practical experience”. The idea is to contribute to “the general and detailed planning of the IMA practical application” in the future, including, for example, the space of machine rooms, computing resources, knowledge training, the development platform, indicated the substitute director of administration and civil service services (SAFP), Joana Maria Noronha, in response to an interpellation of deputy Wong Kit Cheng.
Stressing that the government “pay attention” to AI development trends, “proactively exploring its development space within the scope of services provided to citizens and the internal operation of public services”, the SAFP substitute director pointed out that this technology is currently used mainly as an auxiliary means. The SAFP public information center, for example, has applied AI in telephone service services, “increasing the efficiency of service and treatment of complaints presented”.
On the other hand, according to Joana Maria Noronha, 11 services “related to the life of the population from various areas” were selected to organize the information of these services and to the IMA training, “which will be gradually extended to other services according to their results”.
In relation to the application of AI on government electronic platforms, authorities plan to promote the work of updating the single account, introducing “new elements” and “changing the more passive service model to a more active model”. By way of example, the substitute director indicates that, according to the age of the use, the new model may send information from services that will be useful, or the user may interact with the AI ​​helper through voice or writing messages, "offering him an innovative experience."
At the same time, the government intends to explore the use of AI tools to assist public services workers in the treatment of official documents, "namely in the wording, revision and translation, in order to increase administrative efficiency."
"With the continuous development of AI technologies and the promotion of MSAR government's experimental studies and works, SAFP plan to provide training actions to workers at different levels, from management to basic practice, in order to increase personnel knowledge about AI development trends and their technical application," adds the answer to Wong Kit Cheng.</description><pubDate>2025-07-01 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Australia offers special “climate” visa and residents of Tuvalu are applying</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/lazer/australia-oferece-visto-especial-climatico-residentes-de-tuvalu-estao-candidatar-se/</link><description>With the rising of sea level, Australia decided to offer a special and unheard of climate visa to the citizens of Tuvalu, an island polynesia nation with atroes and sand benches, where the waters are corroding the earth. The draw draw was opened last week and almost half of the population of Tuvalu has already applied.
In any respect, Tuvalu is one of the smallest countries in the world. It only houses about 10,000 people, spread over nine small coral islands that total less than 26 km².
It has lost land due to rising sea level, and new losses can make it one of the first countries to become uninhabitable due to climate change.
Seawater is increasingly infiltrating the few drinking water in the country. Within a century, according to some scientists, the high tide, which occurs twice a day, will flood more than 90% of the country's capital, the island of Funafuti, as well as the only Tuvalu airport.
Most tuvaluans live in Funafuti, which is a few meters above sea level.
Concerns such as these have undergone a deal two years ago between Tuvalu and Australia, with it committing not only to help build containment walls, but also to grant a special visa to 280 Tuvaluanos per year, which would “provide a path to mobility with dignity as weather impacts get worse”. The agreement, known as the Treaty of Union Petepili, allows beneficiaries to obtain permanent residence and move freely between countries.
But both countries endeavored to avoid the use of language that implies that Tuvalu can one day cease to exist.
If the most pessimistic predictions come true, Tuvalu would be a test of how the world treats citizens who have not lost their land due to annexation, but due to climate change.
The Australian Ministry of Foreign Affairs states that the program is an opportunity for Tuvalu citizens to work or study in Australia.
The covenant "recognizes that sovereignty and tuval state condition will continue," the ministry said in a statement.
With a rate of 280 people a year, it would take about 40 years for all Tuvalu citizens to move to Australia.
Australia's immigration attitude towards Tuvalu contrasts with that of the US, who considered adding Tuvalu to a list of countries subject to travel ban, recently reported The New York Times. The State Department refused to comment on the reason for the inclusion of Tuvalu in this list.
In 2023, Tuvalu joined five other island nations of the Pacific in the claim of a global treaty of non-proliferation of fossil fuels. It has promised to lead this movement, ending the use of these fuels that cause global warming as soon as possible.
Tuvaluan authorities have sought to use the country's difficult situation to highlight how climate change are already having drastic effects on communities and cultures, and how small islands and developing countries are impact.
In 2021, then -foreign minister Simon Kofe released a widely shared video in which he is in a pulpit, dressed in fact, and appeals to the world to limit global warming. As he speaks, the House goes away, revealing that he actually has water to his knees in a pond. "We won't be in our arms crossed as the water rises around us," said Kofe.
In addition to offering special climate visas, Australia is also contributing millions of dollars to the Tuvalu coastal adaptation project, which aims to recover land around Funafuti. These funds and the modest number of visas represent a relatively low price for Australia to pay Tuvalu for something the Oceania giant is much more concerned: China.
Beijing has been offered to invest in the Pacific's island nations if they renounce Taiwan's recognition of independence. Tuvalu is one of the only 12 nations in the world that still maintain formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan.
The agreement with Australia states that Tuvalu will not enter any other international security agreement without the explicit approval of Australia.
The country's representative in the United Nations in New York, as well as his director for climate change and catastrophe coordination, did not respond to requests for comments.
