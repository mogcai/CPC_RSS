The difficulties that the Portuguese school has been going through, with regard to the lack of teachers, may be debated in direct contact with Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, when their visit to the territory. This is at least the intention and conviction of Jorge Neto Valente, president of the founding of that educational establishment. Although considering that the Portuguese of Macau “have been abandoned” by the rulers of Portugal, the lawyer admits that there is some expectation to try to sensitize Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa for a series of issues that affect the community

The trip to Macao of the President of the Portuguese Republic, on the occasion of the celebrations of June 10, Portugal, Camões and Portuguese communities, is being awaited with some expectation. Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa made a point of extending Macau the celebrations and should reach the territory before or after that date.
"It is a pity that he [Marcelo] does not come even on June 10, because it will change the program a little," he told the newspaper Tribuna de Macau Jorge Neto Valente, arguing that the president "should come around 7 or 8 and return to 9, to be in Portugal on the morning of the 10th ”.
The theme of the Portuguese School of Macau (EPM), specifically the lack of support of Portugal in solving the problem of the lack of teachers, may constitute one of the focuses of attention in the visit of the President of the Portuguese Republic to Macau.
Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa will probably remain shortly in the territory, so it will be difficult to be able to hear all the main associations, as they expect. However, an EPM travel is expected to happen, because it has been a tradition in the visits of presidents and senior members of the government.
This time, the possible stop at the school's premises is somewhat different from the usual meaning, given the problems that have existed since the beginning of the school year. If you have the opportunity to talk to Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa about the main difficulties with which this educational establishment is faced, the president of the EPM Foundation guarantees that he will try to sensitize the Portuguese head of state. “There has been communications, there has been information that goes on, asking them to support us in what is needed,” says Neto Valente.
Specifying, it points out that Macau doesn't need much support from Portugal, “only needs any”, for example, “who send some teachers here”, needs to “ensure excellence, the quality of the school, and this is not always obtained for lack of collaboration of the Republic ”.
 
“Lack of affection to the community”
“This will certainly be another opportunity for Portuguese leaders to declare that Macau is very important, but unfortunately the experience shows that words are not always followed by acts,” says the leader of the EPM foundation, adding that Macau assumes importance in the speeches , "But then nothing happens." In his view, this is the confirmation that “lack affection to the Portuguese community”.
It was important, he indicates, “that the statements that are of absolute certainty will be made, that Portugal wounds the Portuguese a lot, who expect a lot from the Portuguese”, to be followed “in practice by acts and not just banalities and things that do not happen later, They have no realization for the most varied reasons. ” It is pity, regrets, pointing out that “this also devalues ​​the position of the Portuguese”.
Still in relation to the possible trip to the facilities of Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa's EPM, Neto Valente hopes that “it is not simply the unveiling of a sign”, because, if so, “it is just another sign that is on the wall, never again No one remembers, no one else does anything. ”
For several years, “the community has been very abandoned by the government of Portugal or its leaders,” he emphasizes, giving an example of what has been happened with the school. "The Minister of Education said that Macao was very important with regard to Portuguese language abroad, but then, when Macau needs, he says that there are no teachers who arrive and so they are much missed in Portugal."
The lack of teachers in some subjects has required, recall, to the request for request, with the Ministry of Education, of teachers from Portugal with special license. Most of the requests were rejected, following the reaction of the leaders of the Foundation of the EPM and the Association of Parents and In charge of Education, with email to Minister Fernando Alexandre and Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa himself.
 
Hope that words translate into acts
Understanding that the President of Portugal is a suprapartisan figure and “supposedly” will come to Macao thinking about the “immaterial and more general interests of the Portuguese”, the lawyer maintains the critical tone, stating that the community is used to not depending, nor to need Much from Portugal. "We are used to being very well accompanied by Portugal and this will probably not change," he says.
Nonetheless, Neto Valente maintains the hope that the statements of the Portuguese rulers will be "more than mere words and translate into some meaning." Hence the causal consider being important, above all, that the leaders of Portugal and specifically the President of the Republic, “because he is a more neutral figure”, make these visits to the masters “with the objective of promoting language and culture Portuguese, regardless of national political problems, which actually interest Macao. ”
Among the "problems" faced by Macau and those with which Portugal "has to confront", there is a "big difference," says Neto Valente, referring to the global political situation of current, as "a dangerous world." In this sense, it argues that it is important that there are “bridges” and Portugal can play this role, “this connection”, in relation to China, Lusophone countries and Portuguese culture.
About the expectations of the associations, in order to also be aware of the President of the Republic for some issues, Neto Valente points out that "it is necessary to have the awareness, the consciousness, that Portuguese associativism in Macau has a very small expression." The lawyer looks, however, to the positive aspects of the President of the Republic's visit. "It's a proximity, a comfort that we need a lot, and that's good for those who are naturally here."
Neto Valente expresses that the ideal would be for the visit to contribute to realizing China that the Portuguese play a different role from the rest of Europeans: “The Portuguese in Macao play a role, which is referred to in Basic Law, is the only community which is referred to in the basic law, as we know, besides the Chinese naturally. ” The Portuguese, he concludes, "have a position, which is more theoretical than something else, but ready is there, and that's important."
This is the second time that Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa comes to Macau as president of the Republic. The last visit was in 2019, between April 30 and May 4th. The coming to the territory of Marcelo was inserted in the state visit that he made to China, at the invitation of Xi Jinping, with the sins one of the stops of Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, who maintained a meeting with the chief executive, Fernando Chui leaves on.</description><pubDate>2025-02-14 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Rose number of professionals dedicated to mental health</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/subiu-numero-de-profissionais-dedicados-a-saude-mental/</link><description>There are just over 100 mental health professionals in Macao, an increase of nine before May last year.

The "green transformation of land transport" is one of the government's objectives, which aims that the area of ​​vehicles can "reach almost zero emissions before 2050". To this end, it has launched an electric vehicle promotion plan, hoping that by 2035 the goal of 100% of vehicles (light, motorcycles and mopeds) can be reached new registered zero emissions.

The Directorate of Environmental Protection Services (DSPA) referred all questions to other organisms, indicating only that, in 2022, the executive launched, in two phases, the financial support plans for the slaughter of obsolete motorcycles and the replacement by electric vehicles New as well as the Support Plan for the slaughter of old motorcycles.
