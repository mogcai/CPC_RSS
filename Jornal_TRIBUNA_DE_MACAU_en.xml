The “continuous decrease in the number of births” also influences the young population, which tends to decrease. In concrete, this group included 85,900 people, equivalent to 12.5% ​​of the total population. The proportion of young people from 0 to 14 years old descended 0.7 percentage points.
In the opposite direction, the elderly population (65 years or older) stood at 100,200, corresponding to 14.6% of the total population. The proportion of elderly grew 0.6 percentage points in annual terms.
The trend of population aging remained, observes the DSEC, and the official data even reveals that the aging rate reached 116.6%, plus 10.5 percentage points in annual terms, and the highest since 1990 and marking the 28th consecutive year of growth.

Cerebrovascular diseases, self -project (suicide) and diabetes lesions also contributed, representing 5.8%, 3.5% and 3.4% of total deaths last year.
 
Almost 23,000 residents domiciled in Zhuhai
Migratory data, in turn, show that in November 2024 they were domiciled in Zhuhai and around 22,800 residents of Macao, who had activities in the territory (+14%, in annual terms). As for age distribution, 55.7% were aged between 25 and 54 years. In addition, 53.1% were men.

At the opening of the ANP, Chinese prime minister reiterated the guarantee that the central government will support Hong Kong and Macau in economic development and improve the welfare of its populations. The leader of the mandate promised to transform the spirit of the "two sessions" into "concrete actions"

The 3rd session of the 14th National Popular Assembly (ANP) began yesterday, with Chinese Prime Minister (PM), Li Qiang, presenting the central government's work report. The document highlights the duty of full, accurate and unshakable pursuit of the guidelines “a country, two systems” and Hong Kong and Macau governed by their people, with a high degree of autonomy.
Another underlined duty is based on the defense of the constitutional order of the RAE defined in the Constitution and in basic laws, as well as in the implementation of the principles of Hong Kong and Macao to be governed by "patriots".
In addition, the PM has asserted that it will support the RAE to develop the economy, improve the well-being of the population, integrate better into the conjuncture of national development, and maintain long-term prosperity and stability.
The head of the Executive of the MSAR, who was present at the opening of ANP, in Beijing, returned to thank the attention and support of the central government in relation to Macao. Sam Hou Fai stressed that the Government of MSar will continue to implement the “a country, two systems” principle in an “unshakable, full and accurate way”, and “consolidate and develop the successes” obtained in the practice of this political formula with Macao characteristics. At the same time, according to an official note, he stressed that “Mand has to continue to safeguard sovereignty, security and state development interests”, as “national security is the fundamental principle” of “one country, two systems”.
Sam Hou Fai has promised that the government “will learn seriously and implement the spirit of the 'two sessions',” as well as “grasping the opportunities” derived from modernization with Chinese characteristics, following the spirit consecrated in President Xi Jinping's speeches during his visit to Macau at the end of last year to write “a new chapter in brilliant development” of the territory.
He stressed, the Executive of the MSAR will, according to Beijing's plan to fully deepen the reform, transform the spirit of the "two sessions" into "concrete actions". This implies “reinforcement of interdepartal collaboration and policy synergy, increasing the effectiveness and level of governance”, boosting the development of the proper diversification of the economy, “building a higher -level opening platform” and “effectively enhancing Macau as an interlocutor between China and Portuguese -speaking countries, contributing to the country's high quality development”.
Sam Hou Fai expects Macao vowels to continue to scrupulously fulfill their duties, play the double role, as well as actively participate and discuss political affairs, with the purpose of contributing further to the development of the country and Macau, and to the stable and lasting implementation of “one country, two systems”.
Already Chui Sai Peng, Member of Mand at ANP, praised the report of Li Qiang for its "high quality", "highlight in science and technology" and "very clear focus on the economy". From its perspective, the document will make the population “gain even more confidence”. Another vowel, Chan Hong, described the report as "pragmatic" since "contemplates economic development and mentions education at the same time."
In the same vein, Kevin Ho considered that the document is "pragmatic" and also "progressive", especially because the central government plans for this year in the aspect of the revitalization of the economy "occupy a considerable weight" in the content of the report.
Prior to the opening of the ANP, the director of the Hong Kong and Macao affairs office with the Council of State, Xia Baolong, met in Beijing with the deputies of Raehk and Masters at ANP. At the meeting, Xia Baolong linked their expectations so that the vowels, with a high sense of responsibility and mission, properly fulfill their functions, actively transmit public opinion and present suggestions.
 
From the “background” to the “talent sharing”
On the other hand, several MSAR vowels at the Chinese people's Political Advisory Conference (CCPPC) presented proposals in Beijing. Choy Meng has suggested the creation, by the governments of Guangdong and MSar, of an “investment fund” of Hengqin dedicated to the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI), low altitude economy and green energies.
Un Kin Kuan hopes that small and medium -sized companies in Macao with potential, in the areas of souvenir sales or linked to cultural and creative industries, are supported to transfer production to hengqin and expand business to the interior of China and Lusophone countries.
On the other hand, Chui Sai Cheong, a member of the CCPPC Permanent Committee, defended the “talent sharing” in the Great Bay, proposing to the governments of the three regions that study and jointly define measures of simplification of talent flow.
 
Rae astronauts praised
The two astronauts of Hong Kong and Macao are in “very good condition” and have obtained “good results” in training, Yang Liwei said, vowel at the Chinese people's political advisory conference and also China's first astronaut in space. On the sidelines of the “two sessions”, Yang considered that the two astronauts, payload experts, have a “good base” and “should not take long for them to sail” in space. However, it pointed out that this will “depend on the organization of the whole mission”. The two experts were selected for China's fourth group of astronauts along with eight space pilots.</description><pubDate>2025-03-06 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Caritas Clinic will grow and hire three doctors</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/clinica-da-caritas-vai-crescer-contratar-tres-medicos/</link><description>The Secretary General of Caritas said that the institution's clinic, with the “mission” of helping low health care people, will reopen later this year, in the black sand, with three consultation rooms and three western medicine doctors, possibly including a dentist. Regarding the consultation fee, Paul Pun indicated that the "goal" is to charge between 100 and 200 patacas. On the other hand, it pointed to the entry into operation of the Caritas Bakery for April this year
 
At the last charity dinner, Caritas received donations in a value of 300,000 Patacas, Paul Pun, secretary general of the institution, told the Tribuba de Macao newspaper, noting that these funds will be used to support some projects not subsidized by the government, for example the future clinical.
Located in Sand Black, Caritas Clinic will have three offices and three Western Medicine doctors, enabling the care of several patients at the same time, Paul Pun said, stressing that the institution expects one of the doctors to be a dentist to provide services such as tooth cleaning. This is because, he explained, dentistry services are “very important” for some elderly people who live in that zone, especially for periodontal disease.
Paul Pun pointed, however, that Caritas does not intend to make pediatric dental services available, since "the government already exempts fees of this type of consultations to children."
In addition, the clinic, whose “mission” is to benefit low income, including non -resident workers (TNR), the needy and elderly population, “should also be able to provide vaccination services,” added Paul Pun.
It is recalled that, before the closure in March 2021, due to the lack of doctors, among other operational difficulties, the Caritas Clinic, located at Rua da Caldeira, worked with two consultation rooms and two doctors. For the new phase of the clinic, and in relation to doctors, Paul Pun pointed out that "it would be great to know how to speak English and Mandarin."
After the request for the opening of the clinic has recently been approved by the Fire Department, the institution will again submit the documents to the Directorate of Soil Services and Urban Construction (DSSCU) for appreciation. After receiving “green light” from DSSCU, Caritas will ask for endorsement with health services, and simultaneously, will start hiring doctors.
Under these circumstances, there is not yet a concrete calendar for the entry into operation of this medical institution of philanthropic matrix. Still, the secretary general of Caritas believes he could start working later this year.
Regarding the consultation fee, Paul Pun said that, as it is a Caritas entity, the clinic “cannot charge 300 or 500 patacas” and should not allow the use of health valleys. “Services will require a certain cost, but will not aim to profit. In this sense, [a consultation fee] slightly more than 100 patacas will be our goal. We hope you will not reach 200 patacas, ”he said.
In this respect, Paul Pun also revealed that the institution will consider granting “coupons” to low income patients to cover part of the paid rates.
On the other hand, the clinic may also promote health education. “For example, doctors will be able to move to schools or provide TNR blood pressure and blood glucose services. The cost should not be very high, but you will need to request an authorization one to two months in advance. In one day, it is possible to perform blood glucose measurement to 100 to 200 people, ”he added.
Regarding the other Caritas project, the bakery, located in the São Lázaro neighborhood, Paul Pun clarified that the institution is dealing with commercial registration and requesting the license. The bakery, where people with disabilities will work, will be able to operate in April this year, awaits the institution.
On the current financial situation of Caritas, the same responsible said that “it is not facing many difficulties” with regard to the services funded by the government, however, he confessed that there are obstacles regarding unsubsidized services. For this reason, the institution “will have to find solutions”, including arrange donations and spaces that allow exemption or reduction of incomes. “The repair of facilities is also a little costly. For example, in our rehabilitation center for people with mental illness, located in Colaane, the kitchen repair will cost a lot of money, ”he said.
 
Aposes for more affection to the international community
On the other hand, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has decided to suspend its humanitarian aid and development programs worldwide, which led Caritas Internacional to “censor strongly” this decision, warning that “dramatically affects Caritas in Latin America and the Caribbean and threatens millions of people around the world”.
On this issue, Paul Pun explained that Caritas de Macao does not receive donations from USAID, so it will not be affected. However, he recalled that currently residents of Macao “do not usually donate much” to the international community, and Caritas de Macao manages to raise a maximum of hundreds of thousands of levels per year.
“I hope that, taking advantage of this opportunity, residents think more about international aid. USAID will cut substantially or completely suspend [help programs]. But worldwide crises, disasters and medical seizures can also affect us, especially medical seizures… If we can give some more affection, and if Caritas de Macao receives more donations from residents designed to demonstrate international charity, we can reinforce the degree of our support to the international community, ”he said, pointing out that another way of demonstrating support for organizing young people or architects to help victims to rebuild their homes.
According to Paul Pun, in addition to the annual initiative of raising donations for international aid, Caritas promotes charity sales to the same end. At Fai Chi Kei, a sales station of this nature is open whose raised funds are intended to help countries and regions in need due to disasters or other difficulties, including some Portuguese-speaking countries such as Timor-Leste, Sao Tome and Angola, shot the Secretary General of Caritas.</description><pubDate>2025-03-06 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Firefighters intensify gas leakage prevention</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/bombeiros-intensificam-prevencao-de-fugas-de-gas/</link><description>The case of the fire that occurred on Monday in a building in the Toi San zone, which caused five injuries, including two children with serious burns, led the Fire Department to reinforce the alerts to the population.

Gas leaks have been the cause of some fires in Macao, such as what happened Monday night at the Garden Cidade building, in the Tamagnini Barbosa neighborhood, in the Toi San area, which caused injuries to five people, including two children who suffered serious burns.
The fire, which also gave rise to an explosion, causing several objects to fall to the street, led the Fire Department (CB) to launch an appeal to the population, to pay “high attention” in the use of gas stove devices in housing kitchens or restaurants. "Citizens and sectors are expected to reinforce surveillance and prevention and do the safety matters related to the use and installation of gas stove appliances, in order to jointly ensure the safety of life and goods," he said in a statement.
The corporation points out that, since 2019, it has been inspectors to gas stove devices in households, along with residents' associations and organizations and community head security heads. Until February this year, he made 1,742 home inspections, checking the safety specifications, the installation site and the expiration date of the gas stove pipe.
The CB detected exhaled and damaged gas stove devices connecting accessories, incorrect bonds of piping from water drivers and poorly located liquefied oil gas, recommending that residents stop using them and proceed to their immediate renewal. However, due to privacy issues, many citizens “have a relatively negative attitude,” so “tasks on home inspections have not had satisfactory results,” he laments.
Even so, he underlines, "there has been an effort to maintain close cooperation with residents' associations and organizations and fire -security community heads, to constantly develop inspections, and disseminate information to the public through various channels and strengthen security awareness."
On Tuesday, the firefighters moved to the North, Manduco Beach and Taipa areas for awareness. Visits were made in conjunction with residents' associations and organizations and aimed to appeal to people to allow inspection to their gas stoves.
 
IAS provides support
to the victims of the fire
The Institute of Social Action (IAS) is following the situation of people affected by the fire in Jardim Cidade, providing help through a collaboration network with residents' associations and Caritas. Thirty employees made a port-sterove visits to 144 aggregates of the bloc affected by the claim. The aid will include medicines, hospital follow -up and support for patients with chronic diseases. At the same time, IAS will try to understand if there are residents affected by the damage of elevators, so it also prepares support for the elderly and people with disabilities with difficulty traveling. Regarding the family of the fraction burned down, IAS staff moved to the hospital to find out the situation and provide emotional support, temporary accommodation and economic aid.</description><pubDate>2025-03-06 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>China fixes growth target of “about 5%” in 2025</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/ultimas/china-fixa-meta-de-crescimento-de-cerca-de-5-em-2025/</link><description>China yesterday announced a “about 5%” growth target of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2025, ie identical to that fixed to 2024, despite the incipient trade war with the US and internal problems that affect the second largest economy worldwide. At the opening of the Popular National Assembly (ANP) session, Prime Minister Li Qiang also anticipated an increase in public deficit to 4% of GDP, up to a total of about 5.6 billion yuans.
Beijing has also set the target of 2% inflation and intends to create 12 million new urban jobs this year.
Beijing's goal “looks complicated but achievable,” said Dylan Loh, adjunct professor at Nanyang University of Technology in Singapore. But reduced levels of consumption point to “a problem of trust” of families that is “much harder to solve,” he added, quoted by the AFP agency.
Julian Evans-Pritchard, an analyst of the “capital Economics”, also expressed skepticism “about the ability to avoid growth in growth this year”, in particular in view of the “absence of a more pronounced reorientation of public spending to sustain consumption”. The growth goal “was closely achieved last year, thanks to stronger exports than expected and a last -minute stimulus plan,” he argued.
The government report includes a plan for the issuance of 1.3 billion Yuan in “Special Ultragelong Treasury Obligations” in 2025, over 300 billion last year, as well as 500 billion Special Treasury obligations to support major state commercial banks. Chinese financial squares reacted positively to ads, ending yesterday with widespread gains.
In addition to internal difficulties, the Chinese economy faces trade war with the US, which raised additional rates on imported products from the Asian country to 20%. Noting that "unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise in the world," Li Qiang acknowledged that "the basis of sustainable economic recovery and growth in China are not strong enough."
"The evolution of the global situation, with unprecedented changes in a long time and a tendency to greater complexity of the external environment, will have a greater impact on our country in areas such as trade, science and technology," Li said, who proposed to transform internal demand into the "main engine" of economic growth.
China immediately retaliated against Donald Trump's trade measures with 10% and 15% tariffs on American food imports such as soy, pork, wheat and corn, which will come into force on March 10. Still, Ing's economist Lynn Song, he described Beijing's reprisal as “a relatively moderate response” before Trump's tariffs, which affect all imported products from the products. China.
 
Defense budget rises 7.2%
China announced yesterday that it will increase defense spending by 7.2%in 2025. The climb is the same as last year and is far below the two -digit percentage values ​​of the previous decade, reflecting a general slowdown of the economy. Beijing plans to spend the equivalent of $ 245 billion in defense - about three times less than Washington. China's military expenses are the world's second largest, behind the US.

According to official data, Macao Gross Domestic Product grew 8.8% by 2024, driven by game service exports, which increased by 21.8%, benefiting from 23.8% of the number of visitors.
Fitch believes the game's revenues will rise to about 81% of the registered in 2019, after increasing 23.9% to 226.8 billion between 2023 and 2024. In the first two months of the year, casinos registered gross revenues of almost 38 billion patacas, more 0.5% than in the same period of 2024.
Fitch analysts underlined “favorable visas policies for [mainland china] visitors, unloss-related game and improved tourist infrastructure investments”. Since January 1, Zhuhai residents can visit Macau once a week and stay up to seven days.
The agency stressed that tourism and game numbers will have a “continuous but slower recovery” in 2025 compared to last year. "However, a sharp slowdown in the Chinese economy, such as the substantial increases in US tariffs, and a strong devaluation of Yuan [Chinese currency] pose negative risks to Macao perspectives," the Fitch said.
On the other hand, he expects “Macao dependence on the game sector Persist” because “the restrictions on labor” from abroad and the lack of qualified personnel “will remain the main challenges” for the diversification of the economy.
Macau employed nearly 183,000 migrant workers in late January, an increase of almost 30,000 since the end of the Zero Covid policy in January 2023, but still far from the maximum peak of 196,538, hit in late 2019.
Still, the agency has maintained Macau's rating in AA, the third level, noting that it is the only jurisdiction without any foreign debt and has a financial reserve worth 616.2 billion.
In a statement, Macao's monetary authority stressed that the city's rating "was mainly due to the highly stable situation of public finances and the balance of payments", as well as the government's commitment to "continuing to adopt prudent financial management, even in periods of economic adjustment."

"Many years ago we have taken art as a relaxation and entertainment therapy of our residents, also promoting their talents, sometimes hidden," the Jornal of Macau Augusto Nogueira, president of the ArtM, told whom "this is an opportunity for the people involved to highlight their abilities."
In an introductory text of the show, the organization states that the exhibition "celebrates resilience, creativity and healing." Since its implementation, the artm considers it to be "a symbol of hope for individuals in its journey of recovery of dependence."

In July, in the context of disciplinary proceedings, the Secretary for Security punished him with the penalty of suspension of functions of 240 days for severe violation of the duty of anopus.

The procession of Our Lord Bom Jesus dos Passos takes place on the first weekend of Lent, and this year the two processions will be held on March 8 and 9. The Jornal Tribuna de Macao, Carlos Anok, President of the Brotherhood of Our Lord Bom Jesus dos Passos, said that the legend of a miracle that put the image of return to the Church of St. Augustine led to the realization of the two processions. Father Daniel Ribeiro, who will give the sermon in Portuguese, stressed, in a first message, that this length presents “the meaning of showing that our life is a walk of direction to God”

Registered on the list of intangible cultural heritage, the procession of our Lord Bom Jesus dos Passos has a place annually on the first Saturday and Sunday of Lent and is part of the “Catholic novena and the feast in honor of the Lord Bom Jesus dos Passos”. This year, the manifestation of faith of the Catholic community of the territory will take place on March 8 and 9.
With a long history in Macao, dating back to 1708, being a characteristic and representative religious event of the city, the procession consists of two stages. The first is the trip to the Cathedral, and the second will return to your residence in the Church of St. Augustine.
Asked about the reason for both acts on the same weekend, Carlos Anok, substitute president of the Brotherhood of Our Lord Bom Jesus dos Passos, told the Jornal Tribuna de Macao that "there is a legend, with several versions," to justify this fact. “In times gone, the image was placed in the Cathedral, but miraculously always returned to St. Augustine, hence the return to his church is now assured,” says Carlos Anok.
The Sabbath procession then begins in the Church of St. Augustine, descends the sidewalk of the Old Trunk, passes through the loyal Senate atrium and climbs the Roquete Platter towards the Cathedral.
On the morning of that day, the five wound mass will be celebrated, which means the Lord's wounds, in both hands and feet and also the marks of the spear that was spotted on the body. The mass starts at 8 am in Chinese and Portuguese, being celebrated by the Bishop of Macau, D. Stephen Lee.
Later, at 16h00, the Via-Sacra will take place in Chinese and at 5 pm will be the turn of an early mass in Chinese and Portuguese, followed by Via-Sacra in Portuguese. At 6.30 pm the sermon of the garden in Chinese is held and at 7 pm the procession will come out, known as the “candle procession” or “procession of the cross”, which will take just over half a hour.
The next day, Sunday, at 4 pm, the Pretorio sermon is held in Chinese language, followed by 16:30, the second procession, which will have a reverse route to the first but longer.
At the sound of the Public Security Police Band, the image of Senhor dos Passos, transported by the brothers of the Brotherhood, will depart from the Church of the Cathedral and pass the door of the Consulate General of Portugal, before going down to Praia Grande and ending in the Church of St. Augustine.
In the middle, the seven seasons of the Way of the Way will be held, in each of which the chaplain prays for prayer, Veronica chants the responsibility, in Latin, and the faithful respond with a song. After arrival at the Church of St. Augustine, there will be the sermon of Calvary in Portuguese and the blessing of the Holy Cruz.
Preserve origins to reinforce heritage
Carlos Anok underlines that the choice of the person who interprets the figure of Veronica is mainly made according to the voice. The Veronica is dressed in white, also in a veil of the same color in the head and takes the so -called “sacred face”, which is a handkerchief that represents his gesture of when he cleaned the face of the Lord.
These are original characteristics of the procession “which we have to preserve almost totally from the time it started in 2017, the process of entry to Macao's intangible heritage list, published by the Cultural Institute”, stresses the Substitute President of the Brotherhood.
Carlos Anok points out that this image has been the third since the Diocese of Macao was created, about 450 years ago. Currently, only the heads, hands and feet, which are in the Museum of Sacred Art of the Church of St. Dominic.
"It was cut because the Lord was very heavy, hence the chaplain has given order to do so, and this new version is already over 150 years old," explains the brother of the Brotherhood, indicating that the procession is prepared in advance so that all details are fulfilled when the image of the Lord leaves the streets of the territory.
This religious manifestation of great significance has in recent years has counted on the faithful of various stops. “In addition to the local Catholic community, many Hong Kong faithful, inland China and even the Philippines come to participate in the procession,” notes the main responsible for the organization.
 
Penance period invites to reflection
Father Daniel Ribeiro, parish priest of the Diocese of Mand, who also participates in the procession, highlights the importance of the act of faith. "The meaning of the procession is to start Lent, that is, it is the 40 days that Jesus passed in the desert, which is a period of penance, a period of reflection, conversion," he says, adding that "through this procession it is intended to remember every Catholic, every Christian, of the importance of preparing well to celebrate Easter."
The priest recalls that the Hebrew people spent 40 years in the desert to prepare, to convert to entering the Promised Land. “Therefore, we want to live 40 days of conversion, reflection and life change,” he says.
The main message of the Calvary Sermon that the missionary will give points to the meaning of the suffering of our life. "Suffering is not a punishment of God, but to remember that our life here on earth is not our definitive address yet."
"Suffering and difficulties, all of this helps us strengthen, approach God and change our behavior to live what He expects from each of us," expresses the priest, considering in his message that faith, even though he is part of the daily life of Catholics, needs to be "always renewed."
For this, he argues, "we need to have mercy, have devotion, and to live life always as a novelty," because "God has not created the human being to finish his days here on earth in a cemetery, but to live forever with him."
The procession of the Lord of the Steps “also has this sense of showing that our life is a procession, a walk of direction to God,” he reinforces.
For Father Daniel Ribeiro, adherence to this manifestation of the Christian religion has grown mainly since 2023 and "as part of Macao culture is to grow more and more." Beyond those who purposely move to watch, “there are always many tourists from mainland China and these people always follow the procession with great taste and interest,” he concludes.
The procession of Our Lord Bom Jesus of the Passos was introduced into Macao by the priests of the Order of St. Augustine. When they reached the territory they founded the convent with the same name and the annexed church dedicated to Our Lady of Grace, now known only by the Church of St. Augustine.
Since the procession took place for the first time, that is, shortly after the arrival of the Augustinians in 1586, the cult of the Lord of the Steps has grown very specially among the inhabitants of Macao, and began to constitute the most significant public manifestation of piety and devotion.</description><pubDate>2025-03-05 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Salary freezing may be the option of non -tourism sectors</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/congelamento-salarial-podera-ser-opcao-de-sectores-nao-ligados-ao-turismo/</link><description>Based on the information gathered, the Macao Human Resources Association anticipated that there will be a “significant demand” by both local and non-resident labor in the “sectors directly linked to tourism”, such as the concerts, conventions and exhibitions industry, tourism, game and transport. In addition, the association's president provided for a salary of 2% to 3% in these sectors, while in areas not linked to tourism, salary freezes can be adopted.

The Macao Human Resources Association predicts that there is a “significant demand” for human resources, both places and non -residents, verified this year in the “sectors directly linked to tourism”. At stake are the industries of concerts, conventions and exhibitions, tourism, game and transport, Choi Chin Man, president of the association. The estimate is made based on the information gathered by the association.
Heard by the Jornal Tribuna de Macao, the associative leader anticipated the possibility of this year a salary increase of 2% to 3% in the above sectors. Under these circumstances, it estimated that the average monthly income in Macao, both local (20,500 patacas in the 4th quarter of 2024) as a global (18,000 patacas), will also register an increase ranging from 2% to 3%.
However, the president of the Human Resources Association noted that some sectors may have a relatively reduced labor demand, such as the financial. This is because, "in addition to having a decrease in profits last year, bank institutions will continue to deal with the expansion of electronic payment, which naturally weaken the demand for human resources," he said.
Regarding the remuneration, Choi Chin Man found that "there is still no intention to raise wages in other sectors [not related to tourism]." "The respective companies have not yet announced the salary freezing, but I believe they also do not intend to lower their remuneration," he noted. In this sense, the Association predicted that most companies operating in community neighborhoods will choose to freeze salaries, including keeping the salary of 60 to 70 patacas for part -time work scheme.
“Such a solution will be adopted in order to maintain the most basic operations. In this context, the revitalization of the community economy would be essential to counteract this scenario, ”he emphasized.
In addition, the associative leader added that sales workers whose compensation is based on commissions may also face salary freezes, which "is due to the phenomena of modification of the tourist structure, especially the weakening of the consumer power of tourists."
On the other hand, Choi Chin Man pointed to the emergence of bankruptcy in residential areas, which led to "many human resources to flow to the tourist areas."
 
“Hunting rivals talents”
Regarding the requirements adopted regarding job candidates, Choi Chin Man noted that, last year, "employers began to give greater importance to the work experience," a situation that "constituted a major challenge for candidates, especially for newcomers."
“Currently, many newcomers have two academic diplomas. However, they focus too much on the gym, but have little work experience. We think that, given the current panorama, college students should participate more in economic activities, which can be internships, part -time work or even voluntary activities, ”he said.
Regarding the remuneration, the president of the Human Resources Association said that, as in 2023 and at the end of 2022, a newly graduate can earn about 13,000 patacas monthly in the early stages of his career. For the associative leader, this value is likely to remain unchanged this year. “Companies do not want to raise compensation for newborns. For example, integrated tourism and leisure companies may give preference to the most experienced candidates, although this means a higher price, ”he continued.
In another aspect of this phenomenon, Choi Chin Man stated that the strategy of “hunting rivals talents” has been most often used in the Macao job market, particularly among tourism and integrated leisure companies. “For example, a game operator may want to 'hunt' experienced workers from other companies, because they have already left the worst scenario and stopped worrying about the issue of salaries… We just got into the year 2025 and consider that these companies could focus on this guidance on hiring,” he predicted.
In addition, Choi Chin Man described that, in general, Macao young people are still "not very interested in Hengqin." “We have found many situations where a Macao company opened a branch in Hengqin and naturally highlighted some local workers there. However, this does not mean the constitution of Macao Human Resources in that area and will only be beneficial to the economy of the short -term deepened cooperation zone, rather than being able to represent a great help to the long -term hengqin economy, ”he said.</description><pubDate>2025-03-05 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Xia Baolong installs vowels at CCPPC to accelerate economic diversification</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/xia-baolong-insta-vogais-na-ccppc-acelerar-diversificacao-economica/</link><description>Hong Kong and Macao's affairs office director Xia Baolong visited Rae vowels at CCPPC, installing them to scrupulously fulfill the functions to accelerate the proper diversification of Macau's economy

Born in 1956 in Chengdu, the son of a doctor, in a family linked to the practice of medicine, over four decades, Liu, along with his team, have designed more than 30 projects, from academic and cultural institutions to civic spaces, commercial buildings and urban planning throughout China, and was selected to project Serpentine Pavilion of Beijing (2018). Award organization.
“Writing novels and practicing architecture are distinct forms of art, and I have not deliberately seeking both. However, perhaps due to my double formation, there is an inherent connection between them in my work - such as narrative quality and pocket search for my 'designs', ”said Chinese architect quoted by the Pritzker Award website.
Jiakun, at age 17 he was part of the “Zhiqing da China”, a state program of “youth education”, having been designated for agriculture, but chose to study engineering with an emphasis on architecture in 1982, and was among the first generation of former students in charge of rebuilding China during a period of transformation to the country.
Working for the state's Chengdu Research and Architectural Design Institute at the beginning of his career, he offered temporarily to Nagqu, Tibeta (1984–1986), the tallest region on Earth. “My greatest strength at the time seemed to be my fear of nothing and, besides, my capabilities of painting and writing,” he said.
During these years he was architect during the day, but author at night, deeply involved in literary creation.
Liu Jiakun participated in international exhibitions inside and outside China. She is currently a guest professor at the School of Architecture of the Central Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing, having already taught at Cité de L'Architecture et du Patrimoine, Paris, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, USA, at the Royal Academy of Arts in London, among other institutions in China.

Liu Jiakun was almost abandoning architecture until an individual exhibition of architecture of Tang Hua, a former university colleague, in 1993, at the Shanghai Art Museum, "rekindling his passion for the profession and feeding a new mindset that he could also deviate from prescribed social aesthetics." The reward considers "this transformative perception - that the built environment can serve as a means of personal expression - such as the moment when its architectural career has really begun."
The list of reward includes the Portuguese Álvaro Siza Vieira (1992) and Eduardo de Souto Moura (2011).
