However, the biggest concern for the president, Leonel Alves, is that the principle of proportionality “is not always applied” by security forces - several cases described in the report consulted by the Jornal Tribuna de Macau. With the scenario of decreasing complaints to reverse, the body made 11 recommendations to services and corporations

There were more complaints against security forces last year, but the major concern of the Safety Forces and Services Surveillance Commission (CFD) is related to the observance of the principle of proportionality, "because it is an essential legal principle that is not always applied." The body's president, Leonel Alves, thus states that “there are spaces for improvements (…), namely at the level of the adequacy and rationality of the procedures” of the security forces.
The report for 2024, published yesterday and analyzed by the Jornal Tribuna de Macao, reveals that CFD received 110 complaints, which represents “a significant increase” of 22 cases, plus 25% in annual terms. For the body, the result indicates “a potential reversal of the tendency to decrease complaints in the previous six years”-between 2018 and 2023, there was a decrease from 139 to 88 complaints.
The commission stives that the increase should be contextualized, pointing out that between 2020 and 2024 the annual average was encrypted in 104.2 complaints, with the number of last year "only slightly above". It also justifies the situation with the “improvement of the economic environment and increasing the influx of tourists to pre-pound levels”. However, the truth is that in 2023 -Zero year of the postcovid period, when Macao opened the doors abroad -complaints continued to present a descent trajectory, something that only reversed last year.
In the opening note of the report, Leonel Alves recalls that in 2023 the commission had issued recommendations due to the application of the principle of proportionality. Considering that the question is “recurring”, the issue really gave the report: “enforce the law, also complying with proportionality”.
Given last year's scenario, the commission issued 11 recommendations aimed at the most of the adequacy and rationality of the procedures. The body presents, from the outset, the case of a taxi driver who was reported to have chosen a longer than normal route. He was attended in a room for the Public Security Police Department (CPSP), where he was left alone between 10:04.
"As the inquiries room has a security opening device, which can only be activated by CPSP agents, the citizen was deprived of freedom of movement during this period, and eventually panicked, having even called the emergency number," read it.
At issue was "a mere administrative offense", so the terms in which the matter was conducted were "manifestly inadequate." In this sense, the Commission recommends that the CPSP "reinforces the aspect of police formation in the part where it respects the indispensable and very important observance of the principle of proportionality in all its domains of action involving the relationship with citizens."
Another case described concerns a suspect in a criminal case that had to give testimony. Authorities detected their entry into the territory at 2:50 pm, by the Qingmao post, having remained there two hours, "because only at 4:50 pm was approached by PJ agents and led to the facilities on Friendship Avenue." After collected the testimony, he abandoned PJ facilities at 10 pm.
The CFD understands that "the two -hour period, which measured between the interpelation by CPSP and the comparison of the PJ agents, at the border post, was excessive." At that time, the report points out, the citizen “was deprived of freedom of movement”. In this case, the organism asks that, in the future, CPSP and PJ articulate “more effective” mechanisms of action, “so that situations of excessive deprivation of freedom of movement of people are avoided at border stations”.
Still in this field, it is exposed the case of an agent who challenged the complainant at the airport for identification, something that is "understandable," since he "wandered alone." Something that the commission no longer understands is that the agent considered that the interpellation of this person was no longer justified because he is a tourist and meets his family, including minors. Given the calculated, it is recommended that CPSP avoids similar situations and reinforces police formation regarding the principle of proportionality.
Another point well highlighted by CFD is related to the formalization of complaints. In one case, a taxi driver showed intent on complaining because he did not agree with the steps made by the CPSP, but the agents told him that he could not do it in the mud commissioner. For the inspection committee, "the refusal of agents to receive the complaint is not acceptable," so he recommended, "once again", that CPSP "gives effective sequence to the complaints that are filed."
In relation to the PJ action, the case of a citizen who filed a criminal complaint is addressed. After investigation, the CFD found that the attitude of the investigation official revealed "bad ways", such as "visible impatience and some harshness." In addition, "he used a noticeable insistence for the citizen to sign a document of withdrawal or annulment of the criminal complaint, although the interested party made it clear that it was not his desire to do so." For the commission, the employee's attitude “was incompatible with the ideal of good to serve the public”, considering also “inadequate insistence” to formalize an alleged withdrawal.
 
CPSP, the most viewed
Like previous years, CPSP continued to be the most targeted entity, totaling 89 times (79.5% of the total), followed by the Judiciary Police (PJ), which was the target of 13 complaints (11.6%). Regarding CPSP, “the notorious largest number of registered complaints is explained by the largest dimension of the entity and the amplitude of the intervention areas”.
Among the complaints against CPSP, the vast majority (56 complaints, 62.9% of the total) referred to police activity, including “inadequacy of execution procedures, improper conduct, bad attitude, lack of efficiency, denial of justice and improper use of force”, and the internal management procedures of inadequate services and execution occupied the highest percentage, with 18 and 17 cases, respectively.
The application of the traffic law motivated 24 complaints (27% of the total). Majority, people accused the agents due to "inappropriate procedures, lack of police supervision efficiency, attitude and denial of justice." The CFD also points out that seven complaints were accounted for in the area of ​​migration, "which meant a slight increase in the past year."
In the same line, PJ was also the subject of complaint for “inadequate procedures of execution, bad attitude, improper conduct, improper use of strength and internal management of services”.
Here are the customs services (SA), aimed at seven cases (6.2%), and the Fire Department, the direction of correctional services and the direction of the services of Macao security forces, which were complaints once each (0.9%).
Of the 110 complaints received over the past year, 90 were processed. The remaining 20 (18.2%) “are still in processing due to their complexity”, and it is necessary to present “more detailed data or supplementary clarifications” by the respective services. CFD needs “more time for its effective appreciation”. Part of them was admitted at the end of 2024, so the appreciation inevitably has to move to 2025.
Regarding disciplinary proceedings established by services in relation to cases reported to CFD, between 2020 and 2023, disciplinary sanctions were applied to 16 of the 24 proceedings. Regarding last year, it is not yet possible to detect if the standard ratio is maintained, because five sanctions have already occurred, but five cases are still in final decision. However, it is possible to verify since the number of processes instituted equaled that of 2022 (10), exceeding the average of 6.8 between 2020 and 2024.
Overall, and despite the increase in complaints and concerns, Leonel Alves believes that there are "reasons to believe that security forces and services have well replaced the increase in the demands with which they came across 2024."</description><pubDate>2025-04-10 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>“Fado at the window” project should have continuity</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/projecto-fado-a-janela-devera-ter-continuidade/</link><description>The fado was again released on the street, or rather, to the balcony, in an initiative of Casa de Portugal. For the second year in a row, “Fado at the window” surprised tourists who passed Pedro Nolasco da Silva Street. On the porch of the association's headquarters building, musicians of the house of Portugal sang songs from various authors, especially Amália Rodrigues, Carlos do Carmo or Ana Moura. The project could continue in the future, as it is “a Portuguese brand and people like to listen to this kind of music with uniqueness,” he told the Journal Tribuna de Macau Tomás Ramos de Deus, one of the group elements

Show in Macau what is done in charismatic and tourist neighborhoods of ancient Lisbon, such as Alfama, Mouraria, Castelo or Madragoa, was the objective of the second edition of “Fado à Window”, a musical event promoted by Casa de Portugal and put into practice by the resident band of the institution.
For four days, the heat of the fado, sung outdoors, on the porch of the association's headquarters building, overlapping the instability of time, with some cold, registered in late March, and provided a surprise audience of a few dozen tourists. Visitors who passed lunch time next to the colonial architecture building, located at Pedro Nolasco da Silva Street, stopped during the 20 minutes of each musical session to hear the voices of Tomás Ramos de Deus or Vânia Vieira, giving the place a different environment than usual.
Many of the tourists coming from the fortress of the Monte filled the hill of the side street to the building of the consulate of Portugal, to, surprised by the unexpected musical beats, listen to songs from Portuguese artists who were noted in the dissemination of fado, some belonging to the past, such as Amália Rodrigues or Carlos do Carmo, and others from the modern era, such as Ana Moura.
“Lisbon Girl and Girl”, “Dating da Rita”, “Portuguese House” or “Due” were some of the songs they could hear through the voices of the two fado singers, accompanied by Miguel Andrade's Portuguese guitar and Paulo Pereira's Fado guitar.
The “Fado at the Window” project, the idea of ​​the General Coordinator of the House of Portugal, Diana Soeiro, was successful in 2024, also in March, and therefore repeated this year, having also had “good public assistance”, between tourists and residents of the territory, as Tomás Ramos de Deus told the Jornal Tribuna de Macau.
The element of the group, which also touches, believes that the initiative will continue. "There are ideas to improve this type of events in the future, such as trying to hold them also at other sites of the city, with more exhibition times, more guest artists and different decorations," he said.
The initiative, which has the support of the Culture Development Fund, returned to use the Barcelos Rooster as a symbol, also placed on the initiative promotion poster, this year dressed in Minhoto, typically Portuguese.
According to Tomás Ramos de Deus, the initiative recreates some neighborhoods of Lisbon where one can hear the fado sing. "This was the idea that we wanted to implement, motivated by the street shows on the street that can be appreciated in Lisbon," says the musician, for whom "in Macao can also make this type of events, since there are many buildings with beautiful balconies and emblematic buildings, such as ours, at the house of Portugal, much visited by tourists who come frequently and take pictures."
Fado was chosen for this outdoor project, “because it is a Portuguese brand and people like to listen to this kind of music with uniqueness,” says the singer and guitarist.
"We could be there playing pop music, international, or jazz, which is a style that we also played and that certainly people would also hear, but I didn't have this uniqueness that has the fado," he says. “We belonged to Casa de Portugal in Macao, our mission is to publicize Portuguese culture, so nothing better than promoting fado,” he says.</description><pubDate>2025-04-10 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Government urged to accelerate chambers installation in day care centers</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/governo-instado-acelerar-instalacao-de-camaras-nas-creches/</link><description>Deputy Nick Lei urged the government to accelerate the installation of video surveillance chambers in day care centers, warning that the “slow progress” and the lack of calendar of this process are restricting some parents and guardians. "The executive should further reinforce the supervision of day care centers," said the deputy, in the same written interpelation
 
Recently, some parents of children complained about the “slow progress” of the work related to the idea of ​​installing video surveillance chambers in the Macao day care centers, following the death of a four-month baby at Taipa's Fong Chong day care center, according to Nick Law, parents also regretted the lack of a concrete calendar for the implementation of the measure.
In a written interpellation, the deputy recalled that, according to the Institute of Social Action (IAS), on the issue of chambers, a basic proposal of implementation had already been determined, and the body would later auscurate opinions of the parties involved in the matter.
"Has the government began to hear from stakeholders' opinions about their work? It has relevant content that can be publicized to the public? When it will be officially realized the work of installation of the video surveillance system in the day care centers?" He asked.
Nick Lei stressed that the introduction of day care centers' surveillance equipment meets the expectations of society and draws “high attention” from many parents of children, who “expect work to be realized as soon as possible” so that children's physical and mental safety will be guaranteed when they are in those spaces.
It is recalled that in November 2023, following the baby's death in the Fong Chong day care center, a group of Macao babies mothers launched a petition on social networks for the purpose of appealing to the cabinet for the protection of personal data to authorize the installation of video surveillance cameras in classes and in the nursery rooms.
On the other hand, at the interpeliance, the deputy stressed that this year will exhale the deadline of the day care center development plan from 2023 to 2025, thus appealing to the government to evaluate the results of personnel training under this program, to ensure that the quality of day care centers services meets social development requirements.
"The Executive should further reinforce the supervision of day care centers. In addition to performing annual evaluations and periodic monitoring, it should also, taking into account the opinions and suggestions of parents, in detail the quality of existing services, in order to constantly improve the content and standards of services, giving better guarantees for children's growth," said the deputy.
Specifically, Nick Lei questioned whether the target, provided for in the plan, has already been reached that at least 50% of subsidized day care centers have their own operating manual. In addition, I also wanted to know if day care centers with their own manual installing staff to meet certain hours of training per year, in accordance with the job requirements.
In addition, the deputy sought to know the point of situation of a plan mentioned by IAS to provide opportunities for training to day care centers to obtain the first aid certificate.</description><pubDate>2025-04-10 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Deputy wants more residents of the game operators</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/deputada-quer-mais-residentes-nas-operadoras-de-jogo/</link><description>Song Pek Kei considers that game dealers should have a higher percentage of local employees in basic or front line jobs. In written interpellation, the deputy calls for the revision of the human resource policies of the six game operators, and there is a maximum percentage for the TNR and minimal for residents
 
Human resource policies applied in the six game operators, specifically the percentages of resident workers and non -residents (TNR), led Song Pek Kei to present another written interpellation to the government. Considering that the jobs currently in those companies continue to be priority options for residents when looking for employment and focusing on the basic places, or from the front line, the deputy suggests the review of these policies, so that operators will obey a maximum percentage for TNR and a minimum for resident identity ticket holders.
This is because, stresses the member of the Legislative Assembly, "there is currently the percentage goal of local employees in average and high positions, not less than 85%, unlike there is no restriction on the basic or front line positions, which are the most sought after by the newborn."
On the other point of his questioning, Song Pek Kei states that there are many unemployed residents in the retail restoration and sale sector and recalls that the direction of services for labor issues promoted more than 530 vocational training courses, which attracted hands of 17,000 participants. This number “reflects a major break from 2023,” he notes.
In this context, the deputy urges the Executive to review the program of vocational training courses directed to different sectors and groups of workers, "in order to increase the effectiveness and correspondence of their programs and help residents to acquire more abilities and competitiveness in the labor market."
Finally, Song Pek Kei urges the government to pay more attention to residents who have graduated abroad and seek employment, "implementing more appropriate job conjugation actions."

The project, which involves 45 works, invites viewers to participate in a “exploration of psychogeography”

Titled “Dreamscape Macao”, Alice Im's solo exhibition will be inaugurated tomorrow at Parisian at 6.30 pm in an organization of “Art for All” (AFA). The project is part of the series “Ephemera-Women Narratives in Contemporary Images Exhibition”, AFA's annual program. The show will be evident from April 12 to June 28, between 12:00 and 19:00, daily.
"Dreamscape Macau" invites the public to an exploration of "psychogeography". In addition to the personal narrative of the photographer, when looking at these images, viewers can glimpse the "own shadows within urban spaces."
The artist's work recalls that “cities are not only physical environments that we live in, but domains that shape our psychological and emotional states,” says the statement.
The AFA states that the “brilliance” of the exhibition is due to the artist's decision to physically insert itself into the compositions, surrounded by hotel outcrafts and towels, symbolizing “a state of absence of name” and “sliding the boundaries between individual and collective, local and touristy”. The clothing allows it to become an observer and examine the city through a “detached perspective,” he adds.
“Dreamscape Macao” is a work that Alice Imba has created “meticulously over five years”, having started the project in 2018. The exhibition features a selection of 45 works in this collection, which has already been shown at “Contemporary Women’s Photography”, Pingya's International Photography Festival, and at the Dalí International Photography Festival.
Alice Im's project is sponsored by the Culture Development Fund and Sands China and has gained “significant recognition” of photography and renowned art critics in China.</description><pubDate>2025-04-10 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Brief</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/breves-2377/</link><description>10 more technological companies with certification

António Viseu also told the Jornal Tribuna de Macao that the rainy season, which usually occurs between April and September, can cause very intense precipitation periods this year. The Association recently participated in a seminar in Portugal, during which it became aware of the most advanced international experiences, “which will be brought to the Great Bay area as a model”

Despite all the means currently within the reach of meteorology, a science that focuses on the study of atmospheric processes and the weather forecast, it is difficult to predict situations such as those that happened last March in Macao. The atypical period, with sudden climbs and descents, uncommon at this time of year, may have been caused by the “polar ripple”, he told the Jornal Tribuna de Macao, António Viseu.
The president of the Macao Meteorological Society and ancient subdirector of Meteorological and Geophysical Services (SMG) said that what happened in the territory, especially in the second half of March, was a “natural phenomenon, the so -called polar wave at the North Pole”.
He gave the example of a top: "When it turns and is almost falling it causes a larger area, which in meteorology is the cold wave that sometimes hits the Asian continent and southern California." And "it is this influence that makes people feel cold and then heat."
According to António Viseu, they are nature phenomena that cannot be predicted, constituting cycles that advance or retreat. “When they advance, they feel cold when they retreat, they feel hot,” he explains.
The official, who has been for over 12 years in SMG emphasizes that "this usually happens for a week." In addition, he points out, "rain can cause the atmosphere, the surface of the globe, get more wet and, when it is more humid, the sensation of the cold is much larger, with a few degrees Celsius, a situation caused by such a deviation of that polar ripple."
António Viseu notes that "this is normally reflected on the continents, an extensive area where cold air mass can be cluster, because in the sea no one feels, there is no one at sea."
Asked if, in the future, this rapid difference of temperatures at unusual heights, as happened in March, may happen more often, the meteorologist argues that "this is random, it cannot be said to happen again or when." About Asia is more prone to this type of climate change, António Viseu says that the "globe is whole and, therefore, when here it appears, also happens in other areas".
It is recalled that in the last days of March, SMG issued a statement stating that a cold front hit the southern Chinese coast and originated a significant descent of temperatures in Macao. Under persistently clouded and rainy atmospheric conditions, which favored the intensification of cold air, the minimum temperature of approximately 10ºC to March 31 was recorded, and according to the body, “the temperature felt was below the actual temperature due to the water cooling factor or 'Wind-Chill' (in the English word), which combined with low temperatures, transmits a cold thermal sensation to the body. bigger".
According to records of the Taipa Grande weather station since 1952, temperatures below 10 ° C between late March and early April are rare. However, there is a record, with lower values, that is, at a minimum temperature of 9.8ºC in April 1969.
 
Seismos unresolved to climate change
Regarding global climate change, António Viseu notes that, according to the most recent report of the worldwide meteorological organization, the last decade (2015-2024) has been the hottest since there are records, and 2024 has been considered the hottest year since the beginning of systematic records in 1850.
Regarding a possible influence of climate change on the occurrence of earthquakes, the official states that “current scientific investigation has not yet found any direct relationship”, noting that, according to USGS (United States) and China's seismological service, an average of about 130 magnitude 6.0 or higher, about 12-14 of level 7.0 or higher, and about 1-2 magnitude 8.0 or above a year. "This year's seismic activity remains within normal frequency," he adds.
However, for Olavo Rasquinho, former director of the SMG, "there are studies that relate the defrost of polar hubcaps to the phenomenon designated by isostatic readjustment, or isostatic elevation." The phenomenon consists of the fact that the terrestrial crust, “disagreeing with the weight of large masses of ice, tends to rise, which may influence the movement of tectonic plates in the regions where the defrost or neighboring regions occurs,” he explains.
In principle, it asserts Olavo Rasquinho, "earthquakes in regions far from this phenomenon will not be related to the defrost, and therefore to climate change."
At a time when Macau prepares to face the rainy season, which usually runs between April and September, António Viseu confirms the information already made available on the SMG website that it is predictable that precipitation be intense, or even extreme during this year. “We will have heavy rains, but restricted to that period,” he says.
 
World experiences for the great bay
The Macao Meteorological Society, a non -profit organization, according to its statutes, aims to strengthen the knowledge of MSAR residents of disasters meteorology and prevention, science dissemination and academic research and promote interchange and cooperation with local and foreign weather entities. The association was officially registered on May 16, 2018, a year after the largest typhoon who plagued Macau, the hat.
The most frequent activities are the weather lectures in collaboration with the Science Center.
In the exchange area, he recently participated in Vila Real, Portugal, in a symposium promoted by the Portuguese Association of Meteorology and Geophysics where he presented work on the evolution of typhoon signs from 1861 to today.
The debate, entitled “The Role of Energy in the Meteorological and Geophysical Sciences” brought together dozens of experts and academics from Portugal, Spain, Germany, Cape Verde, Angola and Macao, discussing important issues such as climate change, energy transition and disasters' prevention.
The vice president of the Macao Meteorological Society, Tang Chi Kit, presented in Portuguese a work entitled “The Evolution of Tropical Cyclones in Macao since 1862”, systematizing the development of the Tuphin Alert System in Macao since the mid-nineteenth century. "Communication aroused wide interest among the specialists present, with the president of the Portuguese Society of Meteorology and Geophysics to praise especially the historical value and practice of Macao's Typhoon Sign System, used for over a century," a note from society.
At the seminar, Tang Chi Kit stated that this participation in the conference fully took advantage of Macao's unique advantages as “a center, a platform”, highlighting the role of the territory “as a bridge in the exchange of meteorological technology between China and Portuguese -speaking countries”.
With the participation in the meetings beyond borders, the Macao Meteorological Society ensures that "advanced international experiences will be brought to the area of ​​the great bay as a model."
Society promises to continue to “maintain a spirit of openness and collaboration, striving to promote the research and application of the weather sciences, improve the meteorological knowledge of the population and strengthen academic exchange and cooperation between masters and other regions, contributing to sustainable development and global efforts to respond to climate change and reduction of disasters”, he concludes.</description><pubDate>2025-04-09 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>DSEDJ plans “Dynamic School” to encourage sport</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/dsedj-planeia-escola-dinamica-para-incentivar-desporto/</link><description>The Directorate of Youth Education and Development Services plans to launch the “Dynamic School Program”, with a view to supporting teaching establishments in creating better conditions to increase interest in sports.

Sports in Macau schools deserved special attention at the first ordinary meeting of the Education Council, which with the presence of the Secretary for Social Affairs and Culture, Lam. During the session, the director of Youth Education and Development Services (DSEDJ), Kong Chi Meng, said that the launch of the “Dynamic School Program” is planned to support the schools in the creation of the students to increase students' interest in the creation of students Sport, “cultivating good habits of regular sports”.
At the same time, it was suggested that investment in sports resources be properly reinforced, in order to promote the coordinated physical and psychological development of young people through sports, cultivate a positive perspective of life and raise the level of local sports competitiveness.
In addition, at the same meeting, DSEDJ representatives reported that, for the creation and operation of schools for the students of the hengqin cooperation zone, it is necessary to review the laws on the general staff of teaching staff and the statutes of private schools of non -higher education. This is so that "they can be treated more consistently with the private schools of the local school of Macao in legal terms."
On the other hand, DSEDJ has asserted that it will be continued to optimize the education system and increase pedagogical quality, “in order to promote interdisciplinary collaboration and curriculum integration, closely monitor the needs of the current era and form excellent qualified frames that are equipped with an international view and innovative abilities”.
However, some body vowels have been concerned about how Macau may attract more high quality international qualified pictures, suggesting the reinforcement of international exchanges between teachers and students and deepening the connection with the large bay.
On the other hand, this year is the 80th anniversary of the victory of the Chinese people in the war against Japan and the world victory against fascism, so the DSEDJ will launch a series of commemorative activities and organize visits and exchanges, "in order to deepen knowledge about historical facts."</description><pubDate>2025-04-09 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>White Lotus billionaires try to capitalize on Koh Samui's success</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/lazer/bilionarios-da-white-lotus-tentam-capitalizar-sucesso-de-koh-samui/</link><description>HBO's successful series, The White Lotus, could have chosen any tropical scenario for its third season, but the fact that he chose Koh Samui island, with a population of about 68,000, to be seen by an average of 15 million spectators, left Thailand preparing for a tourist boom.
And few will benefit more than two local tycoons, who believe tourists will continue to arrive and that visitors will remember their lush forests and stunning beaches instead of the dark plot of the series, which ended on 6 April.
One of them, Puttipong Prasarttong-osoth, CEO of Bangkok Airways, and his family's wealth are closely linked to Samui, dating back to the 1980s, when his father bet on an airport to enjoy the island's tourist potential. The clan has a fortune of about $ 3.5 billion, according to Bloomberg's billionaires.
The fact that HBO chooses the local Four Seasons hotel as the main scenario was also a blessing for William “Bill” Heinecke, US -born Thai businessman who founded Minor International, owner of the property. His personal fortune is valued at $ 1.2 billion, according to the index, which estimated its liquid heritage for the first time.
Prasarttong-osoth airline is ordering up to 30 new aircraft and will start expanding the local airport in the second half, predicting a record of 2.7 million tourists landing by 2025 on the island, which is about four times the size of Manhattan and is the second largest island in Thailand. Flight capacity for the island is expected to increase from about 50 to 73 round trip flights as demand increases, the executive chairman said.
Heinecke is also advancing quickly as The White Lotus attracts those who from Europe and the US never thought of spending a vacation in Thailand.
Its luxury hotel mark Anantara - launched in 2001 and inspired by the traditional Thai elements - plans to open its first Hotel in the US in early 2026. Minor's four hotels that were used as main filming places to portray the fictional resort in Thailand were fully rented for filming.
Even before The White Lotus arrived in Thailand, both the PrasartTong-osoth and Heinecke family built their empires far beyond Koh Samui. Puttipong's father, 92-year-old doctor Prasarttong-osoth bet on aviation industry in the 1960s and opened an airport in Samui in 1989.
However, Heinecke moved to Thailand with his parents as a teenager, refusing the opportunity to go to university in the US at 17 because he already had an ad sale business in a local newspaper. In honor of his youth, he called his first Minor business.
His hospitality projects began in 1978 with a seaside resort in the coastal town of Pattaya, 144 km southeast of Bangkok, and became one of the largest hospitality groups in Asia, with 560 hotels in over 50 countries. Minor took a big step in its global expansion after buying the NH Hotel Group S Spain in 2018.
The billionaire's favorite character in the series is the employee played by Thai celebrity Lalisa Manehal, who is a member of the K-Pop Blackpink phenomenon and has over 105 million followers on Instagram. She is "opening a new generation of young luxury search engines because she has a large number of global followers," he said, stressing that "this is really driving the series and boom a lot."
