The Chief Executive called on the population to actively present opinions during the debate on the planning of the Light Rail, taking into consideration the general and “long-term” development of Macau. According to him, these opinions will serve as an “important reference” for improving Metro planning.
After a visit to the flower and product fair celebrating the Chinese New Year at Tap Seac Square on the eve of the Lunar New Year, Sam Hou Fai also highlighted that the route of the Metro lines suggested by the Government is based “on the needs of the future sustainable development of Macau”. In this context, he indicated that the consultancy company's proposal, after having carried out research and investigation into the reality of Macau, was used as a preliminary proposal for the public consultation.
Sam Hou Fai pointed out that the Government is aware that society has different views on any large-scale infrastructure project, with a large surrounding area and a long construction period. Therefore, it is important to collect more opinions through public consultation, he highlighted.
On the other hand, Lam Wai Hou, director of Public Works Services, revealed that around 60% of the construction works on the Metro East Line have already been completed, which corresponds to forecasts.
Furthermore, speaking to “Ou Mun Tin Toi”, this year he predicted the completion of the construction of economic housing on five lots in Zone A of the New Landfills and social housing on two lots in the same area.
During the same visit, the Chief Executive also stated that, regarding complaints about problems with exposed steel nails in economic housing in Zone A, “it was found that this was a situation before the fraction was occupied”. In this sense, he guaranteed that they were removed and the walls repaired after the works were completed.
As he added, in addition, it was found that some cables in the building had excessive fiber optic attenuation, “thus affecting the stability of the fiber optic broadband service for some residents, and, after the public works department monitored the situation, the reconnection of the cables was practically completed”, states the press release.
Furthermore, the Chief Executive exchanged views with the sellers, and encouraged young people to persist in an entrepreneurial spirit and to have the courage to try new things.
On the 17th, Sam Hou Fai visited the Conde de S. Januário Hospital Center, public service entities, Security facilities and the Hengqin Border Post, to find out about the services provided, police operations and the situation at the border crossing on the first day of Chinese New Year.
On the fourth day of the lunar calendar, Friday, he traveled to the city's neighborhoods, to see the flow of people and the businesses of the merchants. During the visit, the Macao SAR leader reiterated that the Government is committed to supporting small and medium-sized companies to improve quality and modernize, jointly boosting the stable growth of the community economy.
He also instructed the services to continue to carry out various support services, helping traders to improve quality and competitiveness, to promote sustainable development. As he promised, the Government will continue to create conditions so that traders operate in a “good business environment”. At the same time, he expects traders to proactively increase the quality of products and services, adapt to new times, have the courage to change, take advantage of new technologies and reinforce advertising on new platforms, “to create a brand with unique characteristics”.</description><pubDate>2026-02-23 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Procession of Senhor dos Passos fulfilled centuries-old tradition</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/procissao-senhor-dos-passos-cumpriu-tradicao-multissecular/</link><description>Thousands of people attended the Procession of Our Lord Bom Jesus dos Passos, a Catholic religious ceremony with centuries-old traditions, presided over by Bishop D.

VÍTOR REBELO
 
The Procession of Our Lord Bom Jesus dos Passos once again livened up the central area of ​​Macau with two ceremonies held over the weekend, which attracted thousands of people, including the faithful and the curious, the majority of whom were tourists enjoying the Chinese New Year festivities. Perhaps for this reason, there was a greater influx of participants, who gathered at the side of the streets where the procession passed.
After the Cross Procession, on Saturday, which started at the Church of Saint Augustine and ended at the Cathedral, yesterday the route was reversed, but longer than the day before, as happens annually.
The largest gathering of people took place in front of the Cathedral, with people waiting a long time to see the platform carrying the image of the Lord come out. There was some anxiety to witness the special moment, which is the image's first visual contact with the population.
The procession left slowly, and at the same time as the Cathedral bell rang, the Public Security Police Corps Band, which has been accompanying the procession for around 70 years, could be heard.
The walker with the image of the Lord was decorated with flowers and was carried by the Brothers of the Confraria do Senhor Bom Jesus dos Passos, as required by centuries-old tradition. Soon after, the Bishop of Macau, D. Stephen Lee, could be seen, flanked by Father Daniel Ribeiro, parish priest of the Diocese, and other priests.
The procession left Largo da Sé and passed, among others, through Travessa do Roquete, Rua de São Domingos, Consulate General of Portugal in Macau and Hong Kong, where one of the seven stations of the “via sacra” was located. At each stop, Verónica, wearing her white dress and sporting a photographic image of the Senhor dos Passos, sang the responsory, in Latin, and the faithful responded with a song.
Senhor dos Passos then continued along Rua do Campo, observing a large number of people in that iconic artery of the city. After Praia Grande, the parade continued to its final destination, the Church of Santo Agostinho, where the Calvary Sermon in Portuguese and the Blessing of the Holy Cross took place.
Activities include the Novena, which ends on the first Friday of Lent, and the two processions. On Saturday morning, the ceremony was preceded by the Mass of the Five Wounds, in Cantonese, presided over by the Bishop, and in the afternoon another mass, bilingual, Portuguese and Chinese, followed by the Way of the Cross, in Portuguese, and a liturgy of the procession with the Horto Sermon. Yesterday, before the procession left, there was the Calvary Sermon in Portuguese and the Blessing of the Holy Cross.
Speaking to the TRIBUNA DE MACAU newspaper, Father Daniel Ribeiro said that “this is a celebration that is already rooted in popular culture and is of great value to all who participate in it”.
The priest adds that it is “a cultural tradition, a religious moment that has its roots in the Portuguese Catholic faith, and that, being present in Macau, it is a great sign of communion, between different cultures, mainly Chinese, Portuguese and Filipino”, adding that the procession is the beginning of Lent, “a time of recollection, meditation and preparation to then celebrate the resurrection of Christ, at Easter”.
For Father Daniel Ribeiro, the Procession of Senhor dos Passos is a symbolic sign of what the life of a Christian is. “Our life is a great procession here on earth, not towards death, but towards Christ, towards eternal life”, since “it reminds us that we are here on earth for a great procession and a great journey, which will end in our encounter with God”.
After the pandemic, he concludes, “the procession returned to its external form in the streets, with the grace of God, and has been attended by a large number of people”.</description><pubDate>2026-02-23 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>More than 1.37 million visitors during Golden Week</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/mais-de-137-milhoes-de-visitantes-durante-semana-dourada/</link><description>Between February 15th and 5pm yesterday, more than 1.37 million people entered Macau, according to provisional data from the Tourism Services Bureau and the Public Security Police Corps, representing an annual increase of 5%.

As of 5pm yesterday, 1,375,478 visitors entered Macau during the Chinese New Year Golden Week, according to provisional data from the Tourism Services Bureau (DST) and the Public Security Police Corps (CPSP). According to data analyzed by the TRIBUNA DE MACAU newspaper, this value corresponds to an increase of 5% in relation to tourists registered in the general count for the same festive period in 2025.
On the third day of the Lunar New Year, more than 227,000 people entered the Macao SAR, surpassing the record of 221,968 visitors registered on May 2 last year, the highest daily number of arrivals since 2019. The number recorded on Thursday also corresponds to an annual increase of 4%, compared to the fifth day of the Golden Week of the Lunar New Year in 2025.
Analyzing the first seven days, it appears that Saturday registered the biggest increase, in year-on-year terms, taking into account that the 214 thousand visitors represented an increase of 13.3%. This was followed by the first day of the Lunar New Year, with 147,000 entries corresponding to an annual increase of 11.5%. In addition, more than 932,000 visitors arrived from Mainland China and around 200,000 came from Hong Kong.
From 3 pm to 5 pm on February 22, 529 thousand people entered through the Portas do Cerco Border Post, representing 39% of the total. Furthermore, 296 thousand visitors arrived in the Macao SAR via the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge (22%), while 262 thousand crossed the Hengqin Border Post (19%).
On Friday, overcrowding on Rua de São Paulo forced the CPSP to implement crowd control measures at 12:25 pm, reported Rádio Macau. According to a joint statement from several government bodies, the operation of pedestrian zones during Chinese New Year, in the old quarter of Taipa and Rua de Nossa Senhora do Amparo de Macau, took place “without problems and in good order”, between the 17th and 21st.
 
SPU recorded 21 incidents of injuries with panchãos
The Unitary Police Services (SPU) stated that, since the opening of the two areas for the launch of panchons, 21 cases of injuries have been recorded, mostly involving “slight burns”. The Public Security Police Corps revealed that, between the 15th and 20th of February, charges were issued for three infractions committed by taxi drivers, including one case of refusing transport and two of “driving in a taxi at inappropriate or illegal speed”. On the other hand, four cases were forwarded to the Directorate of Services for Traffic Affairs in which taxi drivers allegedly violated the contract with the Radio Taxi Company and treated passengers “in a rude manner”. Authorities also detected eight cases of taxi services being provided without a license. On the other hand, they received 164 noise-related complaints, of which 65 were treated with warnings while two incurred charges. The remaining cases did not involve noise, police said. Between the 16th and 21st of this month, the Waste System Company collected around 23 tons of waste, a decrease of nine tons compared to the same period last year.
 
Chinese New Year's Eve was the hottest since 1952
The thermometers at the Porto Exterior station reached 29 degrees Celsius, according to data from the Meteorological and Geophysical Services (SMG), on the eve of the Lunar New Year, above the organization's predictions and breaking the record set in 1952, when the temperature reached 26.2ºC. The rise in temperatures was due to “the influence of a current of hot and humid air caused by a weak ridge of high pressure”, explained the SMG. The HKSAR also recorded temperatures exceeding 28ºC in several places in the region, marking the hottest Chinese New Year's Eve recorded by the Hong Kong meteorological agency.</description><pubDate>2026-02-23 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Santa Casa donated 300 thousand euros to the Portuguese Misericórdias</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/santa-casa-doou-300-mil-euros-as-misericordias-portuguesas/</link><description>People cross a flooded area after the effects of the Kristin depression, in Alcácer do Sal, January 29, 2026.

Following the storms that devastated Portugal, Santa Casa de Macau donated 300 thousand euros to the União das Misericórdias Portuguesas. A “solidarity gesture”, said António José de Freitas to the TRIBUNA DE MACAU newspaper, which “represents another chapter in the long history of solidarity and fraternity that has united the Misericórdias of Macau and Portugal for more than four centuries”. Meanwhile, several Portuguese-based entities launched a fundraiser to help victims of the floods in Portugal

The Santa Casa da Misericórdia de Macau (SCMM) granted a donation of 300 thousand euros to the União das Misericórdias Portuguesas (UMP) “to support the Santas Casas and their facilities that were severely affected by the recent storms that hit Portugal”. The decision was unanimously decided by the Board of Directors.
Speaking to the newspaper TRIBUNA DE MACAU, the Ombudsman, António José de Freitas, stated that “the Santa Casa da Misericórdia de Macau and all the others around the world are united in spirit, history and culture, hence this gesture of solidarity”, also highlighting the existing “umbilical cord”. The support thus represents “another chapter in the long history of solidarity and fraternity that has united the Misericórdias of Macau and Portugal for more than four centuries”.
The local institution learned, through the president of the UMP, Manuel de Lemos, of the “damage caused to Misericórdias and its facilities by the storms” that hit Portugal, as well as “the immediate needs that are felt on the ground”. According to information from the UMP sent to Lusa, the survey of the number of Santas Casas with losses is still being carried out, however, for now, “there are more than 40 misericados with significant damage”.
“The damage affects equipment in the social and health areas (long-term care units), classified monuments (churches and others) and buildings in general”, said a UMP source. Since the “significant structural and operational damage to several institutions” compromises “the Misericórdias’ ability to respond to the most vulnerable populations”, according to a statement from the local institution, SCMM decided to act.
The distribution of the donation will be carried out in accordance with a regulation to be drawn up by the National Secretariat of the Union of Portuguese Misericórdias, in conjunction with a group of Misericórdia Providers from regions not affected by the storms. “This management model ensures the transparency of the process and guarantees that resources will reach the institutions that most need support in an effective and careful way”, highlights the SCMM.
The statement points out that “this gesture of solidarity is not unprecedented in the history of the Santa Casa da Misericórdia de Macau”, and the president of the UMP also noted this. “This act of solidarity deeply touched both the national secretariat of the UMP and the Misericórdias Portuguesas which, faced with structural and operational damage, face demanding challenges in restoring social support activities among the population”, said Manuel de Lemos, quoted in a statement sent to Lusa.
According to the director, “at a particularly difficult time for several institutions, this aid represents not only vital financial support, but also a profound sign of unity, fraternity and commitment to the mission of mercy”.
The UMP added that the Misericórdia de Macau has “maintained a relationship of great proximity and mutual assistance with the Misericórdias of Portugal”. In 2017, it contributed “a donation of 200 thousand euros to support the victims of the fires in the Central region and, during the covid-19 pandemic, by sending one million protective masks to help the Santas Casas”.
 
Portuguese-based entities launch fundraising
Meanwhile, several Portuguese-based institutions in Macau and Hong Kong launched a fundraiser to support flood victims in Portugal. “In view of the serious situation that is plaguing Portugal, where strong storms and floods have caused widespread destruction, resulting in the loss of lives, homes, goods and livelihoods of hundreds of families”, they launched a public appeal for the mobilization of the Portuguese-speaking community in Macau and the Greater Bay Area.
The institutions include the Casa de Portugal in Macau, the Club Lusitano in Hong Kong, the Council of Portuguese Communities of the Circuit of China, the Lusophone Scout Group of Macau and the Banco Nacional Ultramarino (BNU), which have the institutional support of the Consulate General of Portugal in Macau.
“The catastrophe, which has already caused displacement and significant damage to essential infrastructure, requires a quick, coordinated and effective response”, reads a statement, which calls on “all Portuguese citizens, Portuguese descendants, friends of Portugal and civil society institutions to join this chain of solidarity”.
The contribution, through monetary donations, can be made to two accounts at BNU, one in patacas (9021818628) and the other in Hong Kong dollars (9021818645), whose holder is “Fund to Support Flood Victims in Portugal”.
According to the press release, “the funds will subsequently be redirected, by agreement between the promoting institutions, to one or more Portuguese social solidarity institutions operating on the ground (to be designated at an appropriate time), ensuring transparency and traceability of the entire process”.
It is recalled that Caritas Macau launched, on February 10th, a three-month fundraising campaign for those affected by the storms in the Iberian Peninsula.
Following the Kristin, Leonardo and Marta depressions, 18 people died in Portugal, in addition to many hundreds of injured and homeless people.</description><pubDate>2026-02-23 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Sam Hou Fai calls for “reform” and “innovation” to “achieve success”</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/sam-hou-fai-pede-reforma-inovacao-para-alcancar-exitos/</link><description>In this new Year of the Horse, Sam Hou Fai called for “innovation” to “achieve successes” in the territory, “opening new horizons of development”. The Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Bian Lixin, highlighted the role of the MSAR in promoting harmonious coexistence between different civilizations, while the director of the Liaison Office, Zheng Xincong, said he believes that Macau “will maintain its tireless momentum and push all its causes to new heights”
 
Looking ahead to the Year of the Horse, the Chief Executive stated that “we must, with a spirit of leadership, courage and perseverance, promote the development of Macau in all aspects in the best possible way”. He also asked for “persistence and dedication” to “continue to adequately carry out the work to improve the lives of the population for their well-being”.
In his Chinese New Year message, Sam Hou Fai began by wishing a happy year to all residents and friends, “inside and outside the country, who are paying attention to the development of Macau”. Noting that, in traditional Chinese culture, “the horse symbolizes loyalty, courage, exploratory spirit and freedom”, the Macao SAR leader argued that these are “qualities” that “must be promoted to face the future”.
Stating that the “success story” of the “one country, two systems” principle in the Macao SAR “is written generation after generation by the people of Macau”, Sam Hou Fai said he is convinced that, under the leadership of President Xi Jinping and the Central Government, it will be possible to “better” enhance “the institutional advantages of the ‘one country, two systems’ principle”. To achieve this, he said, it is necessary to have “courage for reform and innovation” – if this is the case, Macau will be able to “achieve successes, opening new horizons of development and creating new splendid successes”.
“I wish peace and prosperity to the great country; to the Macao SAR, wishes of stability and prosperous development; to all Macau residents, wishes of happiness and good health”, added the Chief Executive. To Public Administration workers and all workers from different sectors who are at their jobs serving the population during the festive season, and to their families, Sam Hou Fai addressed his “highest tribute and most sincere thanks”.
 
“Significant progress in external engagement”
The Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China in the Macao SAR, Bian Lixin, in turn, highlighted the region's unique ability to promote harmonious coexistence between diverse civilizations.
Pointing out that, last year, Macau constantly deepened cooperation with Portuguese-speaking and Hispanic countries and with Southeast Asia, reinforced its role as a “precise connector” in collaboration between China and Portugal and fully participated and contributed to “high-quality partnerships” within the scope of the “One Belt, One Road” initiative, the new Commissioner argued that “significant progress in Macau’s external engagement” had been observed.
In this regard, he highlighted, for example, that, for the third consecutive year, Macau was distinguished as “Best City for Business Meetings” and “Best Asian Destination for Meetings”, further raising the global profile of the “Macau, from China” brand.
“These achievements were achieved with a lot of effort, as a result of the joint work of the Government and all Macau residents”, he emphasized, describing them as a demonstration of the institutional advantages and the “successful implementation” of “one country, two systems” with “Macau characteristics”.
Bian Lixin also stated that the Macao SAR will continue to “have high ambitions, embrace diversity and move forward”, reinforcing its position as a vital bridge for China's high-level opening up and an important window for dialogue and mutual learning between civilizations of the East and West.
On the other hand, he promised to continue to be guided by “Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy”. Among the priorities are safeguarding national security, helping the region to expand international exchanges and cooperation and implementing measures to facilitate cross-border interactions between people.
Furthermore, it pledged to increase support for attracting international business investment in the Hengqin Deep Cooperation Zone and to encourage young people in Macau to get involved on broader global stages to “tell the stories of Macau and China well”.
The director of the Central Government Liaison Office in the Macao SAR, Zheng Xincong, said he believes that Macau “will maintain its tireless momentum and push all its causes to new heights”. It also considers that the territory “will promote new advances in the adequate diversification of the economy, achieve new achievements in the construction of the Deep Cooperation Zone in Hengqin, improve the efficiency of governance and obtain new achievements in safeguarding national security and social stability”.
“In the new year, I believe that Macau will certainly demonstrate its pioneering spirit and make new contributions to the overall national development situation,” added Zheng Xincong.

In a message broadcast by public broadcaster TDM – Teledifusao de Macau, regarding the Lunar Year of the Fire Horse, Maria Helena de Senna Fernandes pointed out among the targets for this year “European markets, such as Portugal and Spain”.
The director also mentioned Southeast Asia, Northeast Asia – a region that includes Japan, Mongolia and the Far East of Russia – and “the emerging tourist markets in the Middle East and Central Asia”.
Maria Helena de Senna Fernandes predicted that Macau will receive 41 million visitors in 2026, after having reached close to 40.1 million visitors last year, a new historic high. The majority (90.6%) of tourists came from Mainland China or Hong Kong.
The territory received 2.76 million visitors from abroad, an increase of 13.7% compared to 2024, but below the target, more than three million, which had been set in August by Maria Helena de Senna Fernandes.
The Director of Tourism Services recalled the extension of the transit visa exemption policy for 10 days to the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge and Hengqin. The leader promised to “make the most of” this change to create tourist packages, together with Hong Kong and other cities in Mainland China, to attract more international visitors.
On January 28th, DST announced that the region will once again be present on the Lisbon Tourism Exchange (BTL), between February 25th and March 1st, after a year of absence. He also mentioned that he would participate, in February, in Portugal, in a promotion campaign for travel agencies. According to the portal of the tour operator group “Os Especialistas”, the campaign passed through Viseu, Porto, Braga, Coimbra and Lisbon, between the 9th and 13th of February.
Macau was not present at the previous edition of BTL, which took place in March 2025, but at the time DST assured, in a written response to Lusa, that Portugal continued to be “a priority market”.
At the beginning of December, the 50th congress of the Portuguese Association of Travel and Tourism Agencies (APAVT) brought together more than a thousand professionals from the sector in the Macao SAR, a record number. During the congress, the city was chosen for the fourth time as APAVT's Preferred Destination in 2026, after 2012, 2019 and 2024, “to direct the attention of European operators to Macau”, recalled DST.
DST participated in January at the Spanish International Tourism Fair (FITUR), where it installed a Macau pavilion, to “attract more long-haul international visitors, including from Europe”. It also launched a partnership with the tour operator Ávoris, with a presence in Spain and Portugal, which began launching a series of promotions, from before the start of FITUR until April.
Ávoris will also “create more tourist products that integrate the interior of China and Macau for the Spanish and Portuguese markets”, said DST.

The deputy director of Centro Hospitalar Conde de São Januário predicted that Macau should register more than three thousand births in 2026, which would represent an annual increase of at least 4.5%, in the region with the lowest birth rate in the world. According to TDM's Chinese-language channel, Tai Wa Hou said he is confident that the territory's young couples will have more children.
After visiting the first babies born in the Lunar Year of the Fire Horse, Tai Wa Hou argued that the Government launched “high-quality services” to promote birth rates, including the provision of free non-invasive prenatal testing to all pregnant residents and the launch of a digital platform to monitor the health of pregnant women during the pregnancy period.
In July, the Legislative Assembly approved a budget review to reinforce social support, including the creation of a subsidy, worth a total of MOP54,000, for children up to three years old. The Government also launched a public consultation on the increase, in the private sector, of maternity leave, from 70 to 90 days, and annual leave, from six to 12 days to “obtain a better balance between work and family life”.
The mother of the first baby of the year, born at 00:11 in the public hospital, surnamed Fung, told TDM that she plans to have more children and hopes that the newborn will grow up with “many siblings”. At Kiang Wu Hospital, the first baby of the Lunar New Year was a boy born at 01:23.
The estimate made now by Tai Wa Hou still represents a drop compared to the estimate made almost a year ago, also on the first day of the Lunar New Year. On January 29, 2025, the deputy director of Macau Health Services, Kuok Cheong U, predicted that the year would end with fewer than 3,500 births.
However, on January 1st of this year, Tai Wa Hou revealed that Macau registered 2,871 newborns in 2025, reflecting an annual drop of 20.4% and the lowest number in almost 50 years, since 1978, when the city registered 2,407 newborns. The number of births thus fell for the sixth consecutive year and is increasingly far from the historic maximum of 7,913, set in 1988.
Macau recorded just 0.58 births per woman in 2024, far from the value needed to replace generations (2.1), the lowest fertility rate ever in the region and the lowest in the world, according to official data. This value is even lower than the estimate made in a report released in July by the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA): 0.68 births per woman.
Although more optimistic, the UNDESA estimate already indicated that Macau would have the lowest birth rate in the world in 2024, a long way from the second jurisdiction on the list, Singapore, with 0.95 births per woman.

In evaluating the first three years of the implementation of the technical regulation on fire safety in buildings and premises, the Fire Department states that in the initial phase, testing the fire behavior of materials and construction elements “took too long”, causing “restrictions” in the supply of products such as doors or fire valves, for example. However, “the supply situation has been gradually improving”. Overall, it is said that the regulation “was successfully assimilated” and that the various procedures have, in general, “been working at a good pace”. According to the data available, between August 2022 and August 2025, administrative sanctioning procedures were completed in relation to 150 cases.

Consulted by the newspaper TRIBUNA DE MACAU on the occasion of the Chinese New Year, Mickey Hung also described, through Chinese nomenology, the luck at work and the health of the Chief Executive and the five Secretaries of the MSAR

The year 2026 is the “Year of Bing Wu”, generally marked by an “extremely strong Fire energy”, since both the Celestial Trunk and the Earthly Branch of the Pillar of the Year are of Fire (one of the “Five Elements”), begins by analyzing Mickey Hung, local master of “Feng Shui”, who once again made predictions to the TRIBUNA DE MACAU newspaper at the time of the Lunar New Year, about the luck and misfortune of the MSAR in another cycle of the Chinese zodiac.
"It is called 'Year of the Red Horse'. Fire has a dry and hot nature, symbolizing splendor and ostentation. However, without the Wood element to generate it, Fire becomes unstable and is accompanied by a state of impatience and change", describes the master. Still, it rules out a significant impact of this phenomenon on “Water element industries”, such as the entertainment and tourism sectors, because “Macau is located in southern China, supported by Mainland China, with the Pearl River Delta on three sides”.
Still, Mickey Hung warns that “attention should be paid to industries with the Wood element, such as those linked to tea and furniture, which may face greater obstacles”.
Specifically, the soothsayer predicts that, in the Year of the Horse, the economic performance of the gaming industry “may be relatively modest compared to other sectors”.
"Macau entered the 9th Cycle of 'Feng Shui' in 2024, a cycle lasting 20 years. The 9th Cycle is a cycle of Fire. The gaming industry belongs to the Water element in the 'Five Elements'. Fire and Water (entertainment and gaming) are incompatible. Furthermore, as 2026 is the Year of the Horse (Yang Fire), there is a compound effect, that is, of adding more fire to the fire. Therefore, the Macau gaming sector may not perform very well this year”, he projects.
"With increased competition in the sector and variables in the international tourism market, the attractiveness of gaming offers may be affected. In particular, high-end gaming establishments and facilities will face stiff competition from other regions and countries. The industry needs to seek innovation, explore new gaming models and improve customers' travel experiences, to face market challenges", suggests Mickey Hung.
Regarding the economy in general, the “Feng Shui” expert points out that the “Horse” will bring “a year with a strong influence of the Wood and Fire elements”, which “will be unfavorable for economic activities”. “In other words, the economy, finances, among others, may be relatively stagnant”, he warns.
"Those involved in industries related to the Fire element need to redouble their efforts. On the other hand, for industries not related to Fire, such as retail sales, it is advisable to integrate technological elements into various aspects of business. For example, opening online stores and using artificial intelligence elements", he advises.
According to his analysis, in the first half of 2026, Macau's economy will be “really affected by the strong fire”, which “will lead to stagnation or even a downward trend”. “Significant growth in the economy and the real estate market is expected to gradually emerge in the second half of the year”, he anticipates.
Conversely, the “Feng Shui” expert believes that the “Horse” will offer “new opportunities” to the local real estate market. "'Real estate' belongs to the Earth element in the 'Five Elements', and the Year of the Horse belongs to Fire. However, this nature of Fire is quite empty, that is, without roots. Empty Fire needs Wood to generate it and Earth to protect it. Earth acts as the furnace for Fire", he explains.
In his opinion, with the Macao SAR Executive implementing, since January 1st of this year, policies that aim to boost the real estate market, these government actions “will help to increase the desire of residents to buy houses and attract the attention of investors from other regions, further increasing the potential for appreciation of real estate in Macau and the promising returns on investment”.
As for the education sector, Mickey Hung also makes positive predictions. "In the theory of the 'Five Elements', education is considered 'Earth', mainly because the Earth nurtures talents, just as the soil cultivates human resources. This year is a year of Fire, the element that generates the Earth", he observes.
In this logic, the soothsayer understands that, during the Year of the Horse, the Macao SAR Government must introduce new reforms in education. At the same time, schools and educational institutions must also adopt new teaching philosophies and methods, improve teacher training and optimize the allocation of educational resources, in order to increase the competitiveness of talents.
“As Macau does not have a unified entrance examination system throughout the territory, and this is a year of Fire generating the Earth, education services will have new plans”, he further predicts.
 
Warning about “frequent” scams
On the other hand, Mickey Hung highlights the area of ​​public security, warning that cases of fraud “will likely remain frequent” in the Year of the Horse, as “the energy of Bing Wu (Fire Horse) is strong in the Year of the Horse, and the Internet (belonging to Fire) will see a growing ‘empty fire’”.
"Old alcohol in new bottles is a particularly effective strategy for deceiving mentally vulnerable citizens. This phenomenon also warns the Government and law enforcement authorities to intensify actions to combat fraudulent activities and improve public safety awareness," it continues.
Generally speaking, the “Feng Shui” expert also used the “Ba Zi” (the Four Pillars of Destiny) of the establishment of the Macao SAR to predict the opportunities and crises that the territory will face in the Year of the Horse. In this theory, the Macao SAR's “Ba Zi” is composed of “Ji Mao” (year), “Bing Zi” (month), “Bing Wu” (day) and “Wu Zi” (hour).
According to reports, the Beginning of Spring (Lichun) for this year is February 4, 2026, at 4:03 am. In this context, “according to the ‘Ba Zi’ of the Macao SAR establishment, the Master of the Day is Bing Fogo, born in the month Zi (Rat)”.
"Zi is the official month, but unfortunately, the 'Official Star' lacks a 'Star of Wealth' to generate it. Furthermore, it suffers the impact of 'Wu' (Horse) and a penalty from 'Mao' (Rabbit). The gaming industry belongs to Water, while the Horse corresponds to Fire. Water and Fire clash, so the challenges that the gaming industry will face should not be underestimated", he emphasizes.
"The clash pattern between Water and Fire could make the gaming sector weak, with the stability of capital chains worrying. Especially under intensified market competition, the risk of a financial crisis will increase significantly", he emphasizes in the same forecasts, but in another form of analysis.
Also based on “Ba Zi”, the real estate sector could see improvements, predicts the soothsayer, adding that “market demand for properties could increase, which will lead to higher transaction volumes and bring impetus to economic prosperity”.
“At the same time, the development of the health industry will benefit from technological advances, with the fruits of scientific research gradually gaining recognition, which will further drive market expansion in traditional Chinese medicine, medical services and healthcare”, he highlights.
 
Cooperation with the PLP requires “active measures”
On the other hand, this time, Mickey Hung also made specific projections regarding the Macao SAR's fortunes and misfortunes as a Sino-Lusophone platform and in cooperation with Portuguese Speaking Countries (PLP).
"According to 'Feng Shui' analysis, Portugal is located north of Macau. In the Year of the Horse, the corresponding direction is associated with the 'White Star Six', symbolizing controversies and disputes. Therefore, in the Year of the Horse, Portuguese politics may see many disputes. This may not only affect Sino-Portuguese cooperative relations, but also cause conflicts of interest, hindering friendly development", warns Mickey Hung.
To “mitigate these potential conflicts”, the “Feng Shui” master suggests that the Macao SAR Government take “active measures”, such as “organizing cultural forums or study trips” to “increase cultural exchange between the two parties”. “Initiatives of this kind can promote intellectual exchange, deepen mutual understanding, help build more stable cooperative relationships and effectively reduce misunderstandings and conflicts”, he maintains.
In this area, Mickey Hung also mentions that the current President of the Portuguese Republic, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, whose term is coming to an end, is a Head of State “oriented towards people with very good relations with China”. “From his ‘Ba Zi’, he has positive energy”, he highlights, stressing the conviction that Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa “can maintain good Sino-Portuguese commercial relations”.
 
Pressure, challenges and overcoming for Macao SAR leaders
Mickey Hung also once again analyzed the work luck of the Chief Executive and the five Secretaries of the Macao SAR, but this time using “Chinese esoteric nomenology”.
In relation to the Chief Executive, Sam Hou Fai (岑浩輝), whose Chinese zodiac sign is the Tiger, the master begins by describing, “from a naming perspective, the character ‘Sam’ (岑) belongs to Earth, ‘Hou’ (浩) to Water and ‘Fai’ (輝) to Fire”.
“The ‘Five Elements’ of this name form a pattern of Earth restricting Water and Water restricting Fire, that is, a configuration of consumption, implying significant work pressure that requires personal involvement”, highlights the diviner.
Specifically, it indicates that, in the Year of the Horse, the energy of Fire will be “extremely strong” for people born in the Year of the Tiger. "The clash between Water and Fire will intensify. Therefore, [the Chief Executive] needs to pay attention to cardiovascular and eye health", he advises.
"Strong Fire generates Earth, while Earth is the 'Official Astro', beneficial for exercising authority. However, excessive Fire can lead to impulsive decision-making. It is advisable to face challenges firmly", he highlights. Furthermore, he predicts, in terms of “luck at work”, that Sam Hou Fai's leadership capacity will “increase”, but warns that his subordinates “will be likely to get involved in problems”. In this sense, he recommends “more coordination and communication”.
In turn, the Secretary for Administration and Justice, Wong Sio Chak (黃少澤), has the Monkey as his sign. According to Mickey Hung, from a naming perspective, the character “Wong” (黃) belongs to Earth, “Sio” (少) to Gold and “Chak” (澤) to Water. "This is a very ideal flow pattern. The 'Five Elements' of this name follow a productive sequence, indicating intelligence, flexibility and good adaptability", he analyzes.
Regarding health, Mickey Hung suggests the Secretary for Administration and Justice to “pay attention to lung and respiratory health”. As for work, he considers that “excessive Fire and Earth can result in an increase in the workload”. However, he predicts that “the Earth-Gold-Water productive sequence can dissolve the pressure, allowing overcoming through professional skills”.
In general, he considers that, for Wong Sio Chak, judicial and legal matters are areas in which work results “will be easily achieved” in 2026. However, he anticipates that “details may provoke disputes”, recommending the Secretary to be careful with “lapses in documentation”.
Regarding the Secretary for Economy and Finance, Tai Kin Ip (戴建業), whose zodiac sign is the Monkey, according to Chinese nomenology, “Tai” (戴) corresponds to Fire, and both “Kin” (建) and “Ip” (業) belong to Wood. For Mickey Hung, this combination “forms a bright pattern between Wood and Fire, indicating a strong career motivation and pioneering ability”.
"The Fire of the year is strong. The Wood and Fire of this name become excessively flaming, easily causing problems with liver fire and sleep problems", he points out. On the other hand, the soothsayer suggests to Tai Kin Ip that he “take advantage of the strength of the team and avoid autocratic decisions”. “Decisions during this summer require special caution”, he highlights.
In his analysis of the Secretary for Economy and Finance, the “Feng Shui” master also points out that “Fire is the ‘Star of Wealth’, beneficial for promoting economic policies”. However, as “strong Fire restricts Gold, with Gold being the element of the Monkey sign”, the diviner argues that this ruler needs to “prevent the impact of international financial fluctuations on the local economy”.
Regarding Chan Tsz King (陳子勁), Secretary for Security, whose sign is the Dog, from a naming perspective, “Chan” (陳) belongs to Fire, “Tsz” (子) to Water and “King” to Wood, a combination that “forms a pattern of simultaneous production and restriction”, says Mickey Hung.
"The Fire of the year is strong, intensifying the clash between Water and Fire within this name. It is necessary to pay attention to kidney and urinary system health. On the other hand, as strong Fire generates Earth (Earth Xu) and Earth generates Gold (Geng Gold), the area of ​​security may encounter sudden incidents, but can overcome dangers through discipline", he notes, considering that teamwork is "fundamental" for Chan Tsz King this year. For the master of “Feng Shui”, the Secretary for Security must “avoid internal conflicts” and will see his luck become “softer” in the Autumn, “when Gold is strong”.
For her part, the Secretary for Social Affairs and Culture, O Lam (柯嵐), has the Tiger sign. Mickey Hung also made an analysis based on Chinese nomenology, according to which “O” (柯) belongs to Madeira and “Lam” (嵐) to Earth, constituting “a pattern of Madeira restricting Earth, indicating overcoming in the midst of competition”.
"But, it is necessary to prevent interpersonal friction. Furthermore, the strong Fire of the year drains Wood (Jia Yin) and generates Earth, slightly alleviating the conflict between Wood and Earth, which will be beneficial for the implementation of cultural and educational policies. On the other hand, Fire is the 'Star of Talent', full of inspiration. However, excessive Fire can result in excessively rapid execution of plans. It is advisable to advance in stages", he proposes.
In the health chapter, the master states that the Secretary must “pay attention to problems of the spleen, stomach and digestion”. “As the Wood restricting the Earth is moderated by the Fire of the year, the general health is stable” for O Lam, he predicts.
As he describes, also in the Year of the Horse, the Secretary for Transport and Public Works, Raymond Tam – Tam Vai Man (譚偉文), whose zodiac sign is the Rat, will see the “moment of the ‘Five Elements’” in his “not soft” name. This requires the Secretary to prevent “communication barriers”, points out the diviner, explaining that “Tam” (譚) is associated with Fire, “Vai” (偉) with Earth and “Man” (文) with Water.
For the “Feng Shui” master, Raymond Tam should “pay attention to blood circulation and kidney health”, since “the strong Fire of the year generates Earth, while Earth will seriously restrict Water”.
"The year Geng Zi meets Bing Wu, constituting a clash between Zi and Wu and conflicts between the Pillars of the Year and Destiny. Consequently, the areas of works and transport will be likely to experience delays or sudden situations, requiring advance contingency plans. Furthermore, the pressure will multiply, but Fire and Earth generate Gold (Geng Gold), thus allowing crises to be resolved through experience", projects Mickey Hung, when analyzing the luck of the Secretary for Transport and Public Works in the Year of the Horse.</description><pubDate>2026-02-16 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Retail sector “optimistic” for the holiday period</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/sector-retalho-optimista-para-periodo-de-feriados/</link><description>The tourism sector believes that both the flow of customers and the volume of business “will be higher than in the previous Chinese New Year”, said Yeong Keng Hoi, president of the Industrial and Commercial Federation of the Islands of Macau, to the TRIBUNA DE MACAU newspaper. Although consumption in the retail sector may be “modest”, as noted by Penny Wan, from the University of Tourism, the truth is that Yeong Keng Hoi said he is “optimistic”, especially because the number of visitors has been increasing. In his opinion, the tourist segment from Mainland China “will not save on costs”. Economist Henry Lei does not go that far, pointing out that in general tourists remain “cautious”, but believes that there are three factors that “could bring a slight increase in ‘per capita’ expenditure”

The tourism sector expects greater spending power from visitors during the Chinese New Year festive period, which began yesterday and runs until February 23, said the president of the Industrial and Commercial Federation of the Islands of Macau, Yeong Keng Hoi, to the TRIBUNA DE MACAU newspaper. Economist Henry Lei also believes that during the Lunar New Year there will be greater demand for consumption. However, the retail sector is expected to be the least strong, pointed out Penny Wan, professor at the Macau Tourism University (UTM), something with which Yeong Keng Hoi agrees.
“I believe that the spending power of visitors will be better during Chinese New Year, taking into account the current economic situation in Mainland China,” said Yeong Keng Hoi in statements to this newspaper. As Macau “continues to be very attractive” for visitors from Mainland China, he continued, “I believe that this group of visitors will not save on costs”.
The association leader predicted that the visitors' consumption model will continue, pointing out, for example, that in the restaurant sector they will continue to prefer “light food and street cuisine”. On the other hand, he noted, some restaurants will choose to close their doors during the festive season. “As for the restaurants that will keep their doors open, business will be very good,” predicted Yeong Keng Hoi.
“However, compared to the restaurant sector, retail establishments may suffer more significantly from the impacts caused by various internal and external factors”, noted the president of the Industrial and Commercial Federation of the Islands of Macau.
It should be noted that per capita spending by visitors to Macau fell by more than 7% between 2024 and 2025, suffering the third consecutive annual drop. In absolute terms, excluding gambling, total expenditure exceeded 80 billion patacas, an increase of around 6% resulting from the increase in the number of visitors.
Henry Lei noted that in the fourth quarter of last year, “per capita tourism expenditure stabilized.” “Therefore, I expect the value to remain stable in the first quarter of 2026, or with a slight increase due to the Chinese New Year and the consequent greater demand for consumption”, he added.
“Overall, tourists remain cautious, but the appreciation of the RMB, together with the festive atmosphere and the expected increase in prices, may bring a slight increase in tourists’ per capita expenditure,” said the economist.
Listing a series of reasons for more conservative consumption, Henry Lei spoke of the negative effects on wealth faced by property owners in China, given the huge adjustment in property prices. Furthermore, “despite achieving real GDP growth of 5% in 2025 in China, this value is still lower than the level of 6.8% and 6.1% in 2018 and 2019”, which, together with “geopolitical uncertainties” leads to people being “reluctant to spend as they did a few years ago”.
“Last but not least, as it has become much more convenient to travel to Macau and multiple entry is also allowed for tourists from Hengqin, expenses per trip will decrease,” he added.
Still, Henry Lei says that “recently, many tourists visit Macau to do their shopping and prepare for Chinese New Year, for example, they buy items needed for the festivities and gifts for friends and family”. Furthermore, during the Lunar New Year, “they tend to spend money on fireworks for good luck, before going to the casinos”.
Penny Wan, for her part, pointed out that “hotel occupancy rates will certainly increase, restaurants in tourist areas will be full, especially since many of them are not open during the holidays, but non-tourist areas will not benefit much”. As for integrated resorts, “they will benefit most”, while “retail could benefit, but modest consumption is expected”.
In Yeong Keng Hoi's view, however, the retail sector is confident. "I think that, compared to the same period last year, both the flow of customers and the turnover [in general] will be higher than in the previous Chinese New Year. This is because, recently, the number of visitors has increased compared to last year, and the volume is on an increasing trend. Therefore, the retail sector is optimistic about this period," he explained.
Looking at the last weekends in the territory, the association leader recalled that there has been “a high number of visitors”. As for the Lunar New Year, he stressed that, both on the Peninsula and on the Islands, there will be pedestrian areas, which, “will certainly attract a large flow of visitors”. It is recalled that the director of Tourism Services, Helena de Senna Fernandes, predicted that Macau should receive between 1.4 and 1.5 million visitors during the Chinese New Year period. On Saturday, 146,964 visitors entered the territory.
The possibility of the weather being cold at this time of year “may make the willingness of residents of Mainland China to visit uncertain”, said Yeong Keng Hoi. For now, the days have been hot, but according to forecasts from the Meteorological and Geophysical Services, from Tuesday onwards, the minimum will drop from 19º Celsius to 17º Celsius, while the maximum will drop from 26º Celsius to 22º Celsius.
In the luxury segment, however, Yeong Keng Hoi noted that “Macau faces competition from Hainan Province”, which is why this sector “takes a relatively cautious attitude” towards the Chinese New Year. “In this segment, I think it would be satisfactory if the stores were able to maintain the same turnover recorded in the same period last year”, he stated.
 
Customers need “more” incentives to buy
Stressing that “during Chinese New Year, integrated resorts are certainly the ‘must-see’ destinations for visitors, while casinos are the most visited points of interest”, economist Henry Lei noted that “the market expects a good record of gross gaming revenues and, perhaps, another new record after Covid”.
“This tends to bring linking effects and benefits for restaurants, retail stores and luxury brands, especially when tourists are able to win at casinos, as they tend to have an even greater incentive to buy”, he continued.
In Lei's opinion, retail establishments must differentiate themselves, establishing “strong points of sale” and offering something “unique” to attract visitors. “Meanwhile, unlike in the past, purchasing power is not very strong and retailers must set reasonable prices for their products, taking into account the price level of similar products in China, otherwise it will be difficult to attract spending from tourists,” he concluded.
Penny Wan agrees. Admitting that “it is quite difficult” for the retail sector to attract more consumption, since many things can be purchased online, the UTM professor emphasizes that “customers need more incentives to buy here, such as bigger discounts, shopping at outlets, fast courier and delivery services”.
"Retail companies can do more partnerships, such as collaborating with Macau's old shops - for example, a partnership between an ice cream shop and a branded clothing store to encourage cross-spending. Instead of just encouraging spending, this will help strengthen the city's cultural heritage resources, allowing our customers to get to know Macao's old shops, history and culture," he proposed.
In this way, he stressed, “another type of experience is offered to customers”. In Penny Wan's opinion, businesspeople and the Government need to join forces when it comes to “innovation”. “Government support for small businesses – especially those in non-tourist areas – is essential”, he argued.
The professor noted that “nowadays, tourists who come to Macau want to get ‘experiences’”. “Many young people dress up in traditional costumes to enjoy street food, explore local alleys, streets and neighborhoods, take photos and post them on social media,” he added.
In this sense, he considers that the retail sector should pay attention to the younger generation, especially from mainland China, to understand what type of experiences they are looking for. “For example, it is necessary to understand young people dressed in traditional costumes, whether they come to attend concerts, what their itineraries are, behaviors and consumption patterns, etc., to design services and products that attract this younger segment that is looking for different and new experiences”, he further argued.
 
Occupancy rate in hotels must exceed 90%
The director of Tourism Services (DST) said that, “according to previous experience”, the hotel sector estimated that “the final occupancy rate will exceed 90%” during the festive period. Helena de Senna Fernandes, who spoke on the sidelines of the Chinese New Year Parade blessing ceremony, said, on the other hand, that “until now, hotel room prices are at the equivalent of the level seen in the same period of previous years”. He also stated that the authorities have already warned the sector to pay attention to situations on social media, pointing out that, “if abnormal situations are discovered, or drastic increases in hotel room prices, DST will monitor the situation on developed platforms”.</description><pubDate>2026-02-16 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Storms in Portugal damaged more than 120 museums and monuments</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/lazer/tempestades-em-portugal-danificaram-mais-de-120-museus-monumentos/</link><description>In Portugal, more than 120 museums and monuments suffered damage caused by storms in the last two weeks, with five pieces of equipment from the Portuguese Museum Network and four from classified heritage sites, such as the Convent of Christ, in Tomar, showing “serious damage”.
