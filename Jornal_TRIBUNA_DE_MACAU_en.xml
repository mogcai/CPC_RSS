The government announced yesterday the reinforcement of the budget for 2025, a change that articulates with the lines of government action that will allow the “payment of essential expenses” for the current year. Following the budgetary amendment, the total amount of MSAR expense becomes 116.2 billion patacas, an increase of about 2.5% compared to the initially planned (113.38 billion). Already the revenue of the ordinary budget decreases about 3.8% -from 121.09 to 116.5 billion -, driven by the low revision of the game's gross revenues, according to Ho in Mui, the subdirect of finance services at the Executive Council press conference.
The spokesman for the Executive Council, in turn, indicated that a cut in the forecast of gross casinos revenues were made, "after studying and analyzing the current global economic conjuncture and the effective situation of exploitation of the game sector since the beginning of this year." In particular, André Cheong has revealed that the estimate is now that gross revenues from the game for the year 2025 are reduced from 240 billion to 228 billion patacas, a break of 12 billion or 5%.
The low review arrives a day after it was known that the game hit a postpandeia record in May, with revenues to be cheered at 21.19 billion, although it is traditionally one of the strong months, as it is associated with the golden week of Labor Day. The subdirector of the DSF explained, however, that the cut in the forecast was based on the results verified between January and April, which were lower in the annual comparison. “In the second half of the year, there will be uncertainties, but in this budget we intended to have a balance in expense and revenue, and I think we got it,” said Ho in Ma.
According to data from the Game Inspection and Coordination Directorate, in the general five months of 2025, the game's revenues totaled about 97.71 billion of patacas, translating an annual increase of 1.7% and equivalent to 77.7% of the amount accounted for between January and May 2019.
The scrambles now made in the budget aimed at the outset “the effective implementation of the government's various policies and measures” for this year, and an increase in the budget in relation to subsidies attributed to vulnerable groups, ”said André Cheong. But there are other expenses to note: for example, the construction of the University of Macau campus (one) in Hengqin and investment in research and scientific and technological development.
According to the authorities, there is therefore a reduction in budgetary expenses under the Administration Investment and Development Plan (PIDDA), which are magazines for 19.5 billion, marking a slight breakage.
 
UM CAMPUS will cost 8.4 billion Patacas
Regarding the UM campus, the budget registration for this year is 1.75 billion patacas, according to the subdirector of the DSF. "According to the information provided by UM, the expense is six years, goes until 2030. The total cost is about 8.4 billion patacas," said Ho In Ma.
It is recalled that the government intends to create in Hengqin a university campus of international level, and one will be the first local university to settle, then followed others, such as the University of Tourism. This was one of the integrated measures in the SAM Hou Fai Executive's government lines, along with the highest investment in research and high technology.
Regarding scientific and technological investment, 340 million were registered for this year, said Ho in Ma. "In particular for the acquisition of laboratory devices, etc. Thus, we can satisfy the policy of the Government of MSAR," he added.
The DSF subdirector also revealed that the authorities are already conducting the budget for 2026. "All services need to consider more expenses, especially in the face of the current conjuncture. We have to have a more saving mindset and prudent using the public purse," he said, recalling that it has been in recent years.
 
Pecuniary check “is an important policy”
The Secretary for Administration and Justice did not answer yesterday directly to the question of whether the pecuniary reimbursement plan may be extinguished in the future, stressing that it is a provisional measure, however, pointed to the importance of the measure. "Although it is not a permanent measure, (…) is an important policy for the population, which can increase the happiness rate and improve well-being," André Cheong said, on the fringes of an Executive Council press conference, adding that "the Government of MSAR will surely listen to public opinions in order to improve the plan." Last week, changes were announced to the attribution of the pecuniary check, and a requirement of permanence of at least 183 days was introduced. The check will be granted in July, with permanent residents receiving 10,000 patacas and non -permanent 6,000.</description><pubDate>2025-06-04 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Microplastics on the most abundant macao beaches in autumn than in spring</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/microplasticos-nas-praias-de-macau-mais-abundantes-outono-na-primavera/</link><description>A recent study on the distribution of microplastics on the beaches of Macau highlighted significant seasonal variations between areas of wind (wind exposed) and leeward (protected): in concrete, this type of pollution was found in greater abundance in HAC-Sá beach than in Cheoc van.

The beaches have been recognized as “critical points” of microplastics pollution, representing a threat to the environment and human health. In Macao, three academics from the Institute of Haião at the normal university of East China investigated the seasonal presence of microplastics on the beaches of HAC-Sá and Cheoc Van, at the request of the direction of environmental protection services. They concluded, from the outset, that pollution is more visible on HAC-Sá beach and that it is in the fall that it is more likely to appear.
In total, nine samples were collected during a specific month of both stations, specifically in October 2020 (fall) and April 2021 (spring). In each beach studied, three sections -water edge, Costa Alta line and coastline were selected -and the samples were raised at intervals of 50 meters between each zone.
“Microplastics were found in abundance on the beaches of Macao”, read on the study entitled “Seasonal Variations in the Distribution of Microplastics on Macao Waters and Fevent: weak spatial autocorrelation”, by Changxing Zong, Khalida Jabeen and Lixin Zhu. "In our study, both beaches were affected by the Northeast monsoon in the fall. Thus, Hac-Sá beach (The Well) has an abundance of significantly larger microplastics than Cheoc Van Beach (the levent)," they observe.
They explain, "this can also occur because the debris already floating in the sea, such as those released by the ships, can usually reach the coast of Macau due to the predominant winds." The authors in this sense, the wind plays an "important role." They also add that the size of the sediment grains is much smaller in HAC-Sá, which may be one of the reasons for which this beach has “a greater density of microplastics”.
Another highlighted aspect has to do with the type of plastics found: "Polystyrene foam represents more than 85% of the total microplastics in both stations." Polystyrene foam is a light and rigid foam material, widely used in disposable products such as glasses, dishes and packaging, as well as toys, construction, among others.
In addition, “the abundance of microplastics was significantly higher in autumn than in spring, mainly due to the large amount of polystyrene foam brought by tides,” says the trio, and this happened in both analyzed places.
The average of 36.56 ± 38.05 particles per kilogram found in spring indicates a “relatively low” level of microplastics compared to an average of 628.63 ± 1462.31 verified in the fall. "Globally, microplastic pollution on the macao beaches in spring was (…) significantly lower than in strongly impacted regions, such as the tourist beaches of the Mediterranean," they observe.
During the fall, the levels verified in HAC-Sá were “globally high”, comparing “some severely polluted beaches in Italy (1,512 particles per kilogram) and Turkey (1,154)”. However, “the study area is less polluted than some extremely polluted areas, such as the Daebu Island in Korea, where large foam plastic accumulations resulted in an abundance of 46,334 ± 71,291 microplastics per cubic sand meter”.
 
Polystyrene foam “raises worries”
The distribution of microplastics on the macao beaches is characterized, according to the study, by lanes of polystyrene foam dominated, interspersed with fragments, fibers and pellets or plastic granules, which are microplastics with up to 5 mm of diameter, used as raw material for the production of plastics.
On the beach of HAC-Sá, during spring, 196 microplastic particles were identified, most of which polystyrene foam (79.59%), followed by fragments (16.33%), plastic (3.06%) and fiber (1.02%). In the fall samples, 5,285 particles were categorized, with the foam representing 98.35% of the total; In smaller proportions were the fragments (1.29%) and pellets (0.36%).
The morphological distribution of microplastics during spring “showed a remarkable pattern” on Cheoc Van beach, where polystyrene foam represented the highest proportion (95.49%) among the 133 identified particles. In the fall, of the 173 registered particles, the foam represented 82.08% of the total, followed by fragments (10.98%) and fibers, with less expression.
The study suggests that, in the case of Macao, the distribution of microplastics "is widely influenced by stochastic (random) processes such as tidal dynamics, wave action and wind patterns." In addition, the physical properties of tiny plastic, such as size, density, shape and color, can also play a significant role in determining spatial distribution.
“In this study, a format that remained absolutely dominant was polystyrene foam, which originates mainly in aquaculture, packaging and disposable 'slap' boxes,” says Changxing Zong, Khalida Jaben and Lixin Zhu. The document states that white foam microplastics, in particular, "dominate the high tide line due to lightness and high floatability, which facilitates their transportation by coastal winds and their imprisonment in the upper beach sediments." Consequently, “the high proportion of observed white foam particles raises concerns about their potential impact on the health of marine animals along the coast of Macao,” the researchers warn.
The findings, they say, are in line with an investigation on Hong Kong beaches, according to which 92% of the identified microplastics were precisely white foam.
According to the study, "most microplastics originated in nearby areas." “The investigation suggests that large plastics do not correlate with the microplastics collected nearby, but some microplastics on macau beaches can be produced by the decomposition of plastic fragments on site, as plastics such as basins, bottles of mineral water, plastic bags, bottle caps and a variety of other color plastic products consistent with the identified microplastics were found in place, ”they observe.
In Cheoc Van, for example, researchers say that in spring, a small amount of versatile and resistant “ABS” - used mainly in the automotive, electronic and construction and construction industries was found. “Buildings, parked cars and small discarded boats near the beach are possible sources” of these microplastics, they explain. In the fall, a small amount of nylon was found; In this case, it was possibly coming from small boat strings nearby.
 
Tuft wind causes accumulation of microplastics
Regarding the fact that microplastics appear in greater numbers during the fall, academics write that seasonal variations appear to be influenced by several factors: they may depend on the location of the beach, the type of tide, estuary, climate and extreme weather conditions.
It should be noted that most studies usually take into account summer and winter, but in the case of Macao, spring and fall were the seasons chosen because, at these times, the territory “presents great climate similarities with monsoons and rain, allowing a clearer demonstration of the factors that influence the seasonal variations of microplastics in this region”.
“Our analysis has revealed statistically significant differences in the abundance of microplastics between spring and autumn within the same beach orientation, suggesting that seasonal variations in hydrodynamic conditions and anthropogenic activities have a stronger influence than orientation itself. In addition, a heterogeneity pronounced inside the beach was observed with microplastic concentrations, with concentrations of microplastics, with concentrations of microplastics. Of several higher orders of quantity in the high water areas of HAC-Sá beach than in the low water zones, ”says the study.
Changxing Zong, Khalida Jabeen and Lixin Zhu explain that predominant winds during both seasons can help accumulate microplastics on HAC-Sá beach due to their orientation, thus justifying the high abundance of microplastics. In addition, extreme weather conditions can also change the deposition state of microplastics in the sediments.
In the case of Macao, it is said that "summer is the peak of the tuffles' era, during which large amounts of microplastics can accumulate in the areas near the coast and are transported to the beaches by the tidal action or southwest monsoons." Thus, these tiny plastic remain on the beaches, gradually accumulating to the fall-which is precisely the season in which they were found in larger quantities.
The study was supported by scholarships from the Hainan Key Research and Development Program, China National Science Foundation.</description><pubDate>2025-06-04 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>APPLICATION OF THE CHILDHYHIP SUBSIDY AT 16 JULY</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/pedido-subsidio-de-infancia-arranca-16-de-julho/</link><description>The childhood assistance allowance will be implemented at least between 2025 and 2027, also covering children who have been born in previous years. Executive Council spokesman André Cheong stressed that the idea is not to cut the plan to the end of three years, but to realize if it is necessary to make adjustments. The request for financial support can be made from July 16

The request for the childhood assistance subsidy - a new measure integrated in the government lines for this year and which provides for encouraging birth, as well as helping with the expenses arising from children - will be made from July 16, yesterday indicated the president of the Institute of Social Action (IAS). In the first year of support implementation, the government provides for a total of 270 million Patacas, Hon Wai revealed at a press conference of the Executive Board, which has already given green light to the administrative regulation. The measure will benefit 15 thousand children.
To babies born between 2025 and 2027 and who hold valid permanent BIR, a subsidy regarding the year of birth and the next two years will be assigned. The support, paid in a single installment, has a value of 18,000 patacas, which means that in the three years they will receive a total of 54,000 patacas.
As for the other children, they are equally beneficiary those born between 2022 and 2024. But in this case, the assignment of the support is done differently. "For babies born in 2022 it is an installment, in 2023 there are two installments and in 2024 there are three installments," explained Hon Wai. Thus, children born in 2022 will receive 18,000 patacas, while 36,000 will be granted to those born in 2023 and 54,000 to those born in 2024.
As explained yesterday the spokesman for the executive board, André Cheong, any of the child's parents may present the candidacy, through the single account, and may not exceed June 30 of the year following the birth of the child. The president of IAS clarified that it is only necessary to present the candidacy the first time, and in the following years an analysis will be made to comply with the requirements (being permanent resident and “being alive”) and the value will be automatically assigned.
According to the administrative regulation, the allowance will be assigned by bank transfer, within a maximum of 60 days from the day following approval. In the case of maintaining the satisfaction of the requirements for the benefit, the payment will take place in the second quarter of the year of assignment. “Every month we will receive new applications, so we will try to accelerate the whole process,” said Hon Wai.
The regulation, which comes into force on the 15th of next month, also establishes that support is not assigned to children entrusted, by court judgment, to institutions or equipment subsidized by the government, or whose tutor is the guardian or worker of this institution or equipment.
The plan, which aims to “provide some economic support to families with children”, is provisional in nature. Asked if he will continue after 2027, the president of IAS said only that, being a new plan, it is necessary to “collect more data” and do an analysis and then make a decision. Already André Cheong added that the intention is not to "cut" the measure after three years, reiterating that it is necessary to do an analysis and to understand if the plan is necessary to be optimized or, for example, create a different measure.
On the other hand, the government announced the update of school subsidies for class for the school year 2025/2026. According to the order published yesterday in an official bulletin, the amount rose at various levels of education. For example, in kindergarten rose from 1,063,800 to 1,095,700 patacas, while in the complementary secondary from 1,584,300 to 1,631,800 patacas. The updating of the values ​​comes into force on September 1st.</description><pubDate>2025-06-04 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>New Hope List appeals to “clean and full” elections</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/lista-nova-esperanca-apela-eleicoes-limpas-integras/</link><description>"The fact that being critical does not mean that I am not a patriot," said José Pereira Coutinho, on the fringes of the delivery of the request for recognition of the Constitution of the candidacy committee, which included 500 signatures.

The agent of the Nova Esperança list, José Pereira Coutinho, yesterday afternoon, in the Public Administration building, the presentation of the request for recognition of the Constitution of the Legislative Assembly (AL), with 500 signatures, when two days to finish the respective deadline.
On the way out, the deputy showed confidence that no element of his list will be disqualified. "The fact that being critical does not mean that I am not a patriot, because I am also patriot," he told reporters, adding that he has worked "always for the good of the citizens of Macao."
Coutinho, who turns 68 in July and who has been in the position of deputy in AL since 2005, spoke in “unfair competition”, which caused “some difficulty” in the collection of signatures. It assigns the system that was implemented to renew the consumer cards of the elderly.
"At the same time, on March 6, the Electoral Commission of Electoral Affairs (Caeal) also decided to authorize the collection of signatures, so many of our friends and associates, for ignorance, thought they were signing a document for formalities to exchange the cards," he said.
Arriving at the conclusion that “many of those who signed four years ago on our list had already signed by other people, I repeat, for ignorance”, Coutinho produced a short video to alert other people to make their statements reach. "This appeal was well accepted and we managed to complete all this in the end," he said.
Regarding the electoral program, he said that “it is being used and will be disclosed in due time”, furthermore, among other topics, the policy of attribution of pecuniary compensation will be mentioned. "We are trying to get more information to introduce to our electoral program," he said.
Regarding the ordination of the list, the deputy has not yet disclosed what will be the disposition of the candidate elements, not even if he will be number one. “I confirm that I'm on the list, Rita Santos too, but I have to respect my colleagues,” he said, indicating that the candidates' planning.
The objective, he says, "is having a voice of New Hope, which will already be a very satisfactory result, because that is what we intend to have a person who can speak with all freedom, with the whole margin of maneuver, intervening in all matters and that no matter is taboo."
Considering that the election of a deputy on his list would be a good result, Coutinho justified the caution that there could be more lists and stronger. "Nowadays, and I speak of those traditional, the lists have a very important weight because they have a great financial capacity to be able to move within two weeks."
It admits, therefore, that it will be "a very close fight" and hopes that "people will be aware and know that vote is a very important act." Also, you want the elections to be "cleaner, more whole, that there is not so much comzina, so many gifts, so many carriages to lead people to vote."
What is done, he says, will serve as an example for young people of the future. "If they begin to imitate what we with any age and experience of society we do, this is not good for Macao or anyone," he said, as he appeal to the competent authorities to "do their work and that we lists also have the shame to do what the rules are."
On the other hand, he argued that Caeal should develop more dissemination actions throughout the year, "not just during this period of elections." "This is why many young people do not know what an electoral act is, what a deputy does, what their responsibilities are, what their duties are, what it is for al," he stresses, adding that "just see that they are rare sometimes that young people go to al or watch the plenary of the assembly."
In this sense, “we have to do a lot of education work with universities and secondary schools,” he insisted.
 
Several associations formalize entry into the electoral race
The Macao Synergy Association presented yesterday the request for recognition of the Constitution of the Candidacy Commission, having paid 400 signatures for the elections of the Legislative Assembly. According to TDM, citing “or Mun Tin Toi”, Deputy Ron Lam, representative of the association, stressed that his team is concerned above all about issues such as the use of young people, non -resident workers and the promotion of the economy. Also the Good Home Alliance has fulfilled the presentation procedures, with 500 voter signatures. The agent, Iong Weng Ian, told reporters that education, health, support for families and the community economy are the topics to which they have given special attention. Another competitor will be the “Macau Creating People’s Heart Force”, which said he had taken half a thousand subscribers. The association's representative, Tim Wong, linked to the Myanmar community, was aware of the situation of the vulnerable communities of Macao, the social welfare and the management of small and medium enterprises. In turn, the request of the Promoting Union list for Progress, linked to the residents' association, was accompanied by 500 signatures. Ng Siu Lai, an agent, stressed to the Chinese radio that housing, transportation and security policies are important issues of his electoral program.</description><pubDate>2025-06-04 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>European Confederation wants easier visas for Chinese</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/ultimas/confederacao-europeia-quer-vistos-mais-faceis-para-chineses/</link><description>The president of the European Confederation of Travel Agency Associations and Tour Operators (ECTAA) argued yesterday that the European Union (EU) facilitates the entry into Chinese, after China has extended the exemption of visas to more than 30 European countries. "We will continue to knock on the European Commission's door to lower the threshold for visitors from outside Europe," Frank Oostdam said at a press conference in Macao when asked about the European response to China's visa exemption policy, which since October 15 covers Portugal.
In late March, the Chinese ambassador in Lisbon Zhao Bentang said in an interview with Lusa that "China has already asked Europe, Portugal, that facilitates the entry to Chinese citizens."
But Dutchman Frank Oostdam admitted that “the political climate is not encouraging” and that the current tendency is for greater restrictions on entering the European Union, giving as an example the Netherlands.
“We would like to have the most people traveling the world as much as possible, but I'm not that confident,” said Oostdam. "We are very in favor of freedom of circulation, because if people know each other, we will have a better world," he said.
Before the press conference, also the president of the Portuguese Association of Travel and Tourism Agencies (APAVT) lamented “there was no same solution from Europe's point of view regarding Chinese tourists”. “We would really like to happen, this is the opinion of ECTAA, this is the position of APAVT. The visas are harmful to mobility and mobility is good for the world,” said Pedro Costa Ferreira.
In the case of Portugal, the visa exemption for entry to China is in force until December 31, but Oostdam has shown hope that it will be “prolonged for many years”. "From what we hear, the situation seems optimistic. Hopefully yes, because the visa issue is really essential to explore the potential of tourism from Europe to China," he said.
"If we do not have [visa exemption], the potential is there, but it will not result in much more tourists," he warned.
Ectaa vice president, Heli Maki-Franti, lamented that the closing of Russia airspace led the airlines to “dramatically reduce” the number of flights to China.
The EU closed airspace to Russian aircraft after the invasion of Ukraine, and Moscow retaliated with similar prohibitions, making the links between Asia and Europe more expensive. "Many customers are not willing to pay," said Maki-Fanti.
Macau's director of tourism services, Maria Helena de Senna Fernandes, said this represents "a clear opportunity" for Chinese carriers, "because they can fly over Russian territory."
The problem, said Heli Maki-Fanti, is that European travelers "do not yet know Chinese airlines." "There is a lot of [promotion work] that these companies could do in the European market," added the Finnish.

The International Forum on 'Big Health' in the initiative "One Range, a Route" 2025 brought together several representatives of the sector, in an organization of the Foundation of the University of Science and Technology (UCTM), aiming to promote the exchange between Macao and the international community in that industry. Participating in the event as a speaker, the Secretary for Economics and Finance said that, "through collaborative efforts between various parts, the development of the" Big Health "industry may progress with greater stability and sustainability."
Tai Kin Yip said he hoped this forum "affirms himself as a comprehensive cooperation platform, allowing all illustrious participants to perform deep exchanges and establish close collaboration relationships, in order to promote, together, a prosperous development of the" Big Health "industry."
According to the ruler, Macao "has taken advantage of his unique advantages" as a bridge between China and Lusophone countries, as well as countries throughout the initiative "a track, a route". In this context, Macau has participated “proactively in the country's development strategies and injected new dynamism in technological innovation and industrial development of China”.

Illustrator Nuno Saraiva defended the creation of a “New Zé Povinho, to move the masses”, stating that Bordalo Pinheiro (1846-1905) created a “subservient” character that represents the most unfortunate figure of Portuguese politics: the people.
Zé Povinho “today is different, there are two cars, is angry with everything and anything, and vote for the arrival,” said the illustrator.
Already the cartoonist António Antunes considers that Zé Povinho continues to represent the Portuguese people: "We are not that different."
For the cartoonist, Zé Povinho “still occupies a space in the collective imagination, which managed to resist the time and regimes”, an opinion shared by illustrator and cartoonist Cristina Sampaio.
To Lusa, Cristina Sampaio stated that Bordalo Pinheiro "found a figure that synthesized, at the time, the spirit of the Portuguese ordinary man, and its use by various cartoonists throughout these 150 years makes him a perennial figure."
The cartoonist also referred to the assiduous presence “in Tascas and Restaurants of Zé Povinho to make the cuff”, eventually part of the national imagination.
António Antunes even argued that "there is no other alternative, regardless of the style" of each cartoonist, when one wants to represent the Portuguese people, something that Cristina Sampaio submits: "When we want to represent the ordinary citizen, the Portuguese people, we turn to him."
Nuno Saraiva, in turn, stated that "The Mastery" of Bordalo Pinheiro, "the way he drew that bonacheirea, round figure, eventually attracted the readers."
For Saraiva, “Bordalo Pinheiro's graphic work must have created enthusiasm on the part of the other designers, who thought that, finally, [there was] a Portuguese figure in which Zé Povinho fits into the imagination of Portuguese man of height”.
Cristina Sampaio-like Nuno Saraiva-established parallels between Zé Povinho and the characters John Bull, representative of the English, and Uncle Sam, of the Americans.
The character Zé Povinho first appeared on June 12, 1875, on the central pages of Rafael Bordalo Pinheiro's newspaper A Lantern.
Saraiva has remembered the different wanders over the years, since “Zé Povinho of the I Republic [1910-1926], almost a homeland hero with the national flag in hand, to the Estado Novo [1926-1974], completely passed out, and [which] returns after April 25, 1974, with another color and other nervous, more fresh, more fresher load”.
For Cristina Sampaio, Zé Povinho was "the contestation and irony of the instituted powers, and in this sense, of the protest, of Zanga, remains a way of provoking citizenship as a voice contrary to the instituted powers."
The three authors acknowledged had already designed Zé Povinho.
Nuno Saraiva drew him “always in honor of his father”, but sought to draw him differently, “not that kind bonacheirão”, while António Antunes did not want to forget “the original”.
Under the 150th anniversary of Zé Povinho, the Bordalo Pinheiro Museum in Lisbon inaugurates, on July 21, its new permanent exhibition, which will include a room dedicated exclusively to Zé Povinho. In November a temporary exhibition consisted of Zés Povinhos, from the nineteenth century to the present, curated by the 'designer' Jorge Silva is inaugurated.
It is also foreseen, the placement on the Bordalo Museum's website, on June 12, of a page dedicated at 150, exposing the results of an investigation, and with several image galleries with Zés Povinhos, from the nineteenth century, passing the 1st Republic, April 25, until today.
The museum's online collection will host 150 new entrances to Zé Povinho.
