But there is discord: the bosses do not welcome a possible salary climb, arguing that the economic situation in the MSAR is not yet stable and that the measure may affect "some sectors." If the decision is advancing with the increase, the employer considers that there must be a period of transition and tax benefits. The Director of Services for Labor Affairs, in turn, did not want to compromise with a date for the completion of the report

In what was the first plenary meeting of this year's Permanent Social Concertation (CPCs) Council, it was very clear that there is discord with regard to the eventual increase in the minimum wage. If, on the one hand, for workers it is a point that should be advanced with the climb, for the bosses the ideal is not to happen. The government will reassess this year the amount of the minimum wage, but the director of services for labor affairs (DSAL), Wong Chi Hong, did not want to compromise yesterday with a date for the report to be finalized.
“Regarding the minimum wage and also the compensation resulting from occupational accidents and occupational diseases, they are guarantees to workers. We suggest increases and that these increases may, for example, be indexed to the value of inflation, ”said Fong Ka Fai, representative of the work side at the CPCS after the meeting. Also vice president of the Workers' Federation of Associations reiterated that it would be "optimal" to have a minimum wage indexing mechanism to the value of inflation, but stressed "dialogue and reach a consensus."
Fong Ka Fai continued, saying that "the important thing is how we can improve and develop our economy." Then he added: "We, as workers, of course we will support the government and make our efforts to promote the economy of Macao because we have the pandemic and now efforts are needed from all over."
On the other hand, Vong Kuok Seng, representative of the patronage and subdirector of the Macao Commercial Association, argued that "the median of salaries should not be identical to the minimum wage." “The minimum wage is the minimum. If it's the minimum, it's not the most, ”he said.
According to argued, "there will be an overload for some sectors, namely those in which the worker earns according to what he does," if "a very high minimum wage" is fixed. By way of example spoke in the areas of retail and restoration sale.
"These workers urge what they do and [the minimum wage increase] can affect these workers," he said, adding: "Those who in the old days do more to be able to earn more, they won't want to do so much because those who do less do not need to do so much to earn more ”. Vong Kuok Seng noticed then that in Macao there is “great competitiveness”, namely in the tourist sector. “In our view, we should not change the minimum wage,” he reiterated.
But if the decision is this, the associative leader argues that "there has to be a period of transition and should provide the employer some tax benefits." In addition, it will be necessary to take into account some long -term service contracts. “But if the minimum wage is increased, we have to take into account if these contracts are still valid, and are not completed or labeled, the service provider can earn this difference from the amount or is according to what is foreseen In the initial contract? ”He asked.
For Vong Kuok Seng, "the economic situation in Macau is not very stable yet." “There are more tourists, but the number of tourists has no direct correspondence on consumption or a stabilization of the economy. Macau is small, but there are many areas where trade is not yet well. We believe that the government should do more, build a more balanced, stable economy, a community economy, ”he said.
On the sidelines of the Plenary Meeting, the DSAL Director indicated that “there is a lot of information and data” that is still being collected. Without committing to a date for the completion of the report on the minimum wage revision, Wong Chi Hong has ensured that the government will “try to speed up” work and then forward the document to CPCs and discuss the issue.
Regarding the limits of compensation, the boss representative, Vong Kuok Seng, recalled that last year were reviewed and that the decision was to maintain the values. In this context, he appealed that there may be a flexibility in relation to the annual review. “We reviewed last year, we have to review this year, but the economic and social situation is basically identical. Therefore, I ask if it is necessary to review these amounts annually, ”he said, considering that if there is a review of the legislation this should be an aspect to change.
“For review work it is necessary to obtain a lot of data, a lot of information, to study it, to examine it and it is a job that we have to do every year. In an economic conjuncture where there are no major changes, we question why to do it annually, ”he reiterated.
On the other hand, the labor part, represented by Fong Ka Fai, understands that the government must consider "more training for workers, so that they can raise their abilities and competences." In addition, it will continue to insist on increasing maternity leave to 98 days and vacation days.</description><pubDate>2025-02-05 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>CREDIT OVERED IN BANKS Overcomes 56 billion</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/credito-vencido-nos-bancos-supera-56-mil-milhoes/</link><description>Macao banks raised credit has increased 20 times in the last five years, exceeding 56 billion patacas at the end of 2024, more than 30% than in 2023.

António Monteiro was the only macanese of the organ created by the government and also the only one to speak Portuguese during the meetings. The former member states that, since this concept of approximation was created, "many aspects have been improved"
 
Victor Rebelo
 
At the end of two terms as a member of the Government's Advisory Board, created by the government, António Monteiro left this function and makes a positive balance of his passage through the body that aims to collect the opinions and concerns of the population.
In his specific case, the approach to people focused on the central area of ​​the city. “I went to the places, the old neighborhoods, to know the problems that most affect people and this was obviously a very good experience,” he began to reveal to the Jornal Tribuna de Macao.
António Monteiro, who had already held a similar position, as a member of the advisory board of the then Institute for Civic and Municipal Affairs, then moved to this concept of community services, said that the function “allows you to be closer to people, to talk to inhabitants of Neighborhoods, with local associations, which can comment in the background all the aspect of civic problems. ” With the observation on site by the counselors, distributed in the various areas of the city, “we are a great help to people, also functioning as inspectors, in order to assist the government,” he says.
At a time when the golden week is coming to an end, having brought thousands of tourists to the territory, António Monteiro spoke of the pedestrian zones created in certain places. "These measures allowed, in a way, to encourage supply, as tourists are more concentrated in certain places, that is, gave some diversification, taking visitors to other parts of the city to do tourism."
Implement areas without automotive traffic, that is, dedicating some spaces only to pedestrians, not only in festive periods, but at other times of the year, it is an issue that deserves some reflection to António Monteiro. “I think this may be possible in strategic sites, in the mud for example,” adding that “with the change of bus and taxis routes, stopping at certain points, allows tourists to go to the village and traders do Business, making a little of the areas of the ruins of São Paulo and Senate Largo ”.
However, he says, "All this must be conjugated with the Macao festivities, adding to trade the cultural component through associations." On the other hand, the former member of the community advisory body, but still a member of the Cultural Heritage Council, recalls that some of the accesses “are not made for so much concentration of people, which may make it difficult to bring tourists to other places from the city ”.
 
Protect interests from populations
Regarding the improvements produced in the city and specifically in the central area of ​​Macao, which was its area of ​​action during the period in which it was part of the advisory board, António Monteiro considers that “there are many positive aspects”, since, because, because of the fact of There is an “on -site” action, this allows you to “protect some interests from the population”.
However, it reinforces, "it is more in the sense of helping in the general aspect of the territory, for things to be better prepared, from the gardens, the treadmills, among other aspects."
For Macaense, traffic remains a problem, "unfortunately", but still "many aspects have been improved since there is this concept of community services", approaching populations.
For what he was listening to the travels to the neighborhoods of the central Macao, António Monteiro acknowledges that people have had some difficulties, "also the result of the pandemic period." At the same time, he points out, "some stores also had to change the mindset to adapt to the current circumstances of Macao and so they suffered a lot in their business."
The old element of that advisory body has given some suggestions over the years of his term, specifically at the level of structures. One of them was the idea of ​​the extension to the New Marginal Macao Tower. "I think it will be the plea of ​​the population," he anticipates, considering that in this regard of the embellishment of the city, in the creation of green spaces and gardens, the institute for the municipal affairs "has reinforced this work."
António Monteiro was the only Macaense on the board, so also the only one to speak in Portuguese at meetings, but also discussed the issues in Cantonese, "which facilitated my interconnection."
 
Changes in the councils of community services
The departure, at the end of the term, of António Monteiro of the Central Zone Community Services Advisory Board, is included in a series of changes promoted by the Chief Executive. For the positions of assistant coordinators, Chang Ka Wa was chosen, linked to the residents of Macau, and Pui Seng In, which is part of the Macao Volunteer Association, both of which were already part of this organ. The two promoted join Wu Hang Sang, from the Macao workers, who remains as a deputy coordinator.
The government leader chose to maintain Lam Wai Hou, Mok Chio Kuan, Lam Cheok Kai, Choi Tong, Kuan Imba, Carlos Kun Kim Hong, Leong Chon Kit, Ieong Chon, Tam Chan Lam, Ian Kit and Yp Weng Keong.

The member of the Chan U Long Association will comply with the second term, which joins Chan Ian Ian of the same Association, which was already element of the Advisory Board, but is thus promoted to the assistant coordinator. Wong Chio U, connecting to the Macao Volunteer Association and Macao Youth Federation, is also promoted to that position.
Regarding the Community Advisory Board of the Islands, the changes are more significant, with the promotion to Assistants of Leong Chon Kit, leadership of the General Association of the Overseas Macao, Li Yongjian, associate of the residents of Macao, and Un SU Kei, leader of the General Association of Macao Chong Wa Students.

Lai Weng Leong also said that, for now, there is not yet a plan to enjoy the 363,000 square meters, which was from the Jockey Club

The government has already “began planning work on the land land recovered, located between Rua da Ponte Negra and Olympic Avenue,” said the director of soil services and urban construction (DSSCU), Lai Weng Leong. As for the Jockey Club ground, the leader said there is no plan for his use yet.
The information emerged in response to an interpellation of Ella Law, who had observed that there are still “some lots of large terrain in the mud, whose planning has not yet been completed, for example, the terrain by Rua do Cunha and the terrain of Jockey Club ”. The deputy also recalled that the chief executive, Sam Hou Fai, said that he was going to "enjoy" the land near Rua do Cunha, hoping that society can present opinions.
In addition, Ella Lei pointed out that development in that area of ​​the city is "increasingly prosperous", attracting many tourists, so "traffic gets even more intense." In this sense, he argued that the executive must take advantage of the land in the vicinity of the Panchões IEC Long factory, to serve as a passenger and taxi passenger and taxi start space, as well as optimizing pedestrian crossings.
Now, in the answer, Lai Weng Leong does not come into detail about what will be the fate of those land. It only states, citing the Directorate of Services for Traffic Affairs (DSAT), that opinions will be issued in the context of traffic management, with a view to “optimizing” the “development project and complementary transit facilities of the surrounding roads”.
In addition, it is said that DSAT concluded, in 2024, the works of road reordering on Rua da Ponte Negra and Rua do Regidor, as well as the works of optimization of the bus shelters of Rua Correia da Silva, “which contributed to Improve pedonal crossing equipment and complementary traffic facilities in the old neighborhood of Taipa ”.
 
Jockey's lot still with no future in sight
Regarding the ground of the Hippodrome, Lai Weng Leong said that "there is no concrete plan for its use at the moment", stressing that DSSCU will "proceed to its proper planning and use" according to the Planning Law Urbanistic and the Director Plan (2020-2040), and in articulation with the detail plan.
"If the competent services or entities submit requests for provisional land use, the Government of the MSAR will make a comprehensive appreciation and study, and if it is considered that there are reasons of public interest that justify it, a provisional purpose will be attributed to the part of the land." , he explained.
It is recalled that the government recovered the terrain where horse races took place in May last year. Since then, deputies and associations have argued, for example, that there, in that land of 363,000 square meters, near Governador Albano de Oliveira road, leisure facilities and sports zones are built.
On the other hand, the director of the body said that, as regards the requests for provisional use of other land, “will be considered by the DSSCU in the light of the Land Law, the Urban Planning Law and the other applicable legal rules, and having Based on the government's government lines, in favor of the proper management and use of mashed land resources. ”</description><pubDate>2025-02-05 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>China investigates Google and imposes tariffs on US products</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/ultimas/china-investiga-google-impoe-tarifas-produtos-dos-eua/</link><description>China yesterday announced the opening of an investigation on Google and imposed new rates on a series of US products, hours after President Donald Trump has applied a 10% rate to Chinese products. China will investigate the US technological giant for alleged violation of Chinese antitrust laws, according to a state administration statement to regulating the country's market.
Google search and internet services for consumers have been unavailable in China since 2010, although the company has maintained operations in the country, especially around its advertising business.
Beijing also announced the application of 15% rates on coal and liquefied natural gas (LNG) and 10% over oil and agricultural equipment from the US. The US supplied about 6% of China's LNG imports last year, according to ships location data.
"The unilateral imposition of customs rights by the US seriously violates the rules of the World Trade Organization," the Chinese Ministry of Finance said in a statement announced the imposition of retaliatory tariffs. "Not only is it useless to solve your own problems, but also undermines normal economic and commercial economic cooperation between China and the US," the Chinese government added.
China's measurements arise in response to the application of US tariffs. Washington's decision against China contrasts with the situations of Mexico and Canada, in which both nations obtained a postponement from the imposition of 25% per month, after reaching separated deals with Donald Trump.
Last Saturday, Trump appealed through an executive order to the Communist Party of China to prevent criminal organizations from facilitating the flow of illicit drugs into the US.
The reopening of the trade war between the US and China reverberated in the performance of the Chinese currency in the offshore markets, where Yuan fell 0.3% to $ 7,3340 following the announcement of retaliation. Yuan negotiations in the 'ONShore' market are closed due to the holidays of the Lunar New Year.
If the US dollar has recovered from the Chinese currency, while Australian and New Zealand coins, which have strong commercial connections with China, fell almost 1%. Other Asian currencies, such as Thai Baht and Indonesia Rupia, reduced gains.
Over the weekend, the US Administration leader ordered the application of a general rate on Chinese imports, which came into force at midnight yesterday in the United States, due to what Trump justified as Beijing's failure to prevent the flow of illegal drugs. Executive orders included retaliation clauses that would increase customs rights if countries responded the same way.

The sons “is prepared for greater economic recovery, driven by sustainable tourism and increased game -related investment”, maintains the monetary authority of Macao (AMCM), convinced that external demand will remain “strong” in a context of “enrichment” of tourist facilities as a way of responding to “changes in consumer preferences”. "In addition, with the stimulus policies introduced by the central government last September, it is expected that consumer feeling gradually improve in mainland China, which will be conducive to the Macao tourist sector," he says, highlighting the positive impact of the Measures that, since January 1, facilitate the visits of residents of Zhuhai.
The combination of these factors will “support the impetus of external demand and consolidate the territory's economic recovery”, anticipates the AMCM Department of Studies and Statistics in the first “Monetary and Financial Stability Review” report of 2025, also reiterating that “OS Solid Fundamentals of Macao in terms of budgetary and external balances will protect against adverse repercussions from global economic uncertainties. ” "Since the base effect will normalize after rapid recovery in the last two years, Macau's economy is expected to advance a moderate pace in 2025," says the body, without risking numerical projections on the annual increase of the product Gross internal (GDP).
The latest official data indicate that the Macau GDP grew 4.7% in the third quarter of 2024 and 11.5% in the first nine months last year, in real homologous terms, illustrating new sequential slowdown, partially imputable to higher comparative bases , but also to the slowdown in the recipes of the game between July and September. In the first nine months of 2024, GDP was on about 301 billion patacas, corresponding to a resum of 86.3%, compared to 2019. In October, reviewing the previous projections, the international monetary fund estimated that the economy of Macao could grow 10.6% by 2024 and 7.3% in 2025.
On the other hand, AMCM believes the consumer price index will “slightly” this year “slightly”, after the inflation rate retreated from 0.94% by 2023 to 0.74% by 2024. “ Internal inflation pressures in 2025 grow modestly in conjunction with increased aggregate demand, while external pressures will remain moderate, ”read the report.
At the same time, it expects the labor market to demonstrate "continuous resilience in the midst of favorable economic conditions." In this domain, the body insists that "imported workers, which aim to supplement local labor, will provide sufficient protection for policy adjustments."
It is recalled that the Global Employment Rate in MSAR set up at 1.8% in the 2024 general calculation, noting an annual decrease of 0.9 points and the lower percentage since the 1.7% recorded in 2019. The unemployment rate of the residents dropped a percentage point to 2.4% compared to 2023.
Generally speaking, AMCM stresses that "with the lasting support of the central government, Macau's economy is well positioned for sustainable growth." With the Executive of MSA committed to promote the strategy “1+4” to diversify the economy and stimulate the transformation of traditional industries, “a synergistic development” is provided with the deepened cooperation zone to “optimize resource allocation for both The regions ”, while the“ vast industrial space ”in Hengqin will be able to foster“ entrepreneurial activities, creating more high -value jobs and generating a new momentum for growth ”.
At the same time, the monetary authority understands that “the greatest interconnection with the continent” will allow to “broaden the business field of the financial industry of Macau, especially in the areas of the obligation, heritage management and business in Renminbis, thus consolidating the role of Macao as a platform financial services between China and Portuguese -speaking countries ”. “With a wider range of growth engines and continuous optimization of the industrial structure, these efforts will not only anchor macroeconomic stability against external shocks, but will also conduct Macao to a more sustainable development trajectory,” says the report.
 
Financial system reveals “continuous resilience”
AMCM also emphasizes that the monetary stability of the MSAR has been sustained by a “credible” currency stabilization background system and the “strong budget position”. “Macao currency reserves have been consistently maintained at a enough level to fully cover monetary responsibilities in Patacas,” he says, also noting that “the budget position has been reinforced along with the continuous expansion of the financial reserve, providing the government of MSAR a Ample political space to anchor macroeconomic stability and at the same time keep your status free of debt. ”
In this context, “Macau's financial system has shown continuous resilience, supported by solid positions of capital and liquidity”. Although the US federal reserve has made three interest rates since September last year, AMCM warns, however, that financing costs are still “high” and, if they remain, “may remain a one Burn the rendibility of Macao benches ”.
For now, it asserts the body, “the capitalization and liquidity position of the bank sector remains solid, providing robust support to financial stability and sufficient resources to respond to future credit demand”. However, it is stated that “the uncertainties of the pace of future cuts of rates by FOMC [US Federal Reserve Federal Reserve Committee] require vigilant credit risk management by Macao banks and an agile response to changes in macrophinance conditions ”.
Last week, the US Central Bank decided to keep interest rates unchanged, thus stagnuting a cycle of three consecutive reductions and resisting the pressure by US President Donald Trump, who wanted a new cut to boost economic activity. According to AMCM, the FOMC "aims to relieve the containment of monetary policy over time, but the rhythm will remain uncertain, as it needs to find a balance between the promotion of growth and the containment of risks of rising inflation."
On the other hand, in Macao, the AMCM -compiled financial indicator of financial stability, reached 0.54 in the third quarter of 2024, below 0.61 of the same period of 2023. This fall is associated with the decline of income Local banks, whose operational profits fell 38.8% to 5.6 billion patacas in the first 11 months of 2024, in homologous terms, as a result of the 21.5% reduction in interest margin and increased operating costs. In particular, banks' provisions for credit impairment, which accounted for 39.5% of operating costs, rose 11.1%.</description><pubDate>2025-02-04 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Analysts foresee slight climb of the game in February</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/analistas-preveem-ligeira-subida-jogo-em-fevereiro/</link><description>After the game's recipes suffered a 5.6% annual break in January, JP Morgan analysts, Deutsche Bank and Seaport Research Partners expect improvements in February, although with distinct optimism levels, ranging from a residual homologous rise to one increase of 11%. In common, the conviction that the joint results of the first two months will give more clues about the performance of casinos in 2025
 
Consultants and investment houses that regularly follow the game sector in Macau reacted with caution to the announcement of the results of the first month of 2025, taking into account the pre-Anan Chinese seasonality factor and the differences in the calendar of the festive season face to 2024. Although January revenues have been below the initial expectations, the general feeling points to the sense of improvements in February and the belief that homologous comparisons will be more enlightening when data from the first two months of the year are gathered.
It is recalled that the current “golden week” extends from January 28 to February 4, while the 2024 Lunar New Year began to be celebrated in the second week of February.
According to the Game Inspection and Coordination Directorate, Casinos gross revenues ciphed at 18.25 billion patacas in January, translating an annual decrease of 5.6% and equivalent to 73.2% of the same month 2019, the pre-pound year. On the other hand, they increased 0.3% in monthly terms.
For February, forecasts already released by several analysts have an ascending curves in annual terms, although with significant differences, based on values ​​that oscillate between 18.5 billion and 20.7 billion patacas. These estimates represent up between 0.1% and 11.4% compared to February 2024.
The JP Morgan Investment Bank, which expected an annual break between 3% and 4% in January, after initially anticipated a 5% decline, classified last month's result as “weak”. “According to our checks, there was a very remarkable slowdown before the holidays this year, with a trailer in traffic since the past weekend, particularly affecting the large enterprises,” which led “to the deficit of gross revenues from I play, despite the strong performance in the first half of the month, ”said DS Kim, Mufan Shi and Selina Li, JP Morgan.
In a more positive record, the investment bank stresses that mass market revenues will have grown more than 10% in January, compared to the same month of 2019, offering the slow resume of the VIP segment, estimated at about 20%. The two percentages of recovery are “similar” to those recorded in the fourth quarter of 2024, the same report says, also stressing that the visitors' entries in Macao “recovered sharply” from January 31, the fourth day of the “golden week”, and the hotel reserves “look solid”.
DS Kim, Mufan Shi and Selina Li stress that it is now important to realize "if the January error was a temporary setback or indicative of a lasting trend."
“We believe that the maximum value for billing is set at about 800 million to 850 million patacas per day for gross game revenues between February 1 and 9, which implies a daily rate of over a billion during peak Of the holidays, ”he added, predicting that this month's accounting could close with about 19 billion or more, which would mean an annual increase between 3% and 5%. In this scenario, the revenues of the first two months of 2025 "will remain stable," despite the "relatively difficult comparison."
JP Morgan experts continue to believe that game's revenues can rise 5% by 2025, "probably accelerating growth rates in the second half of the year," benefiting from "easier comparisons."
Seaport Research Partners' Vitaly Umansky analyst, on the other hand, predicts February to be “slightly better” than last month, with revenues of 18.5 billion patacas, signaling increases of 0.1% and 1.3% in annual and monthly terms, respectively. "If our estimates are confirmed, the agreed period from January to February will fall 2.8% over the previous year," he said.
Carlo Santarelli, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, also reduced estimates for the first two months of 2025, but remains the most optimistic when betting on an annual increase of 11.4% in February, to about 20.69 billion Patacas. Initially, Santarelli had risked a growth of 3.9% in the first two months of this year, but now it foresees a homologous rise of 2.7%.

Hon Wai also made it clear that, for now, the government will not change the requirements for the request for support

Since the Subsidy for Caregivers was implemented in November 2020, the Institute of Social Action (IAS) has received 111 requests related to people with an unconnected intellectual disabilities, of severe or deep degree. Of these, "80 gathered the assignment requirements, and the rest was rejected," said the body's president.
It means that 31 of these requirements or 28% of the total have been denied. Hon Wai explains the main reasons: the people in question did not have the corresponding degree of deficiency, were not approved in economic assessment or self-care capacity, among others. The information arises in response to an interpellation of Deputy Song Pek Kei, who called for the flexibility of the caregivers' allowance requirements.
The support, which has become permanent in December 2023, is directed to people who need continuing and intensive care of third parties in their daily lives. Thus, we include permanent beds unable to perform sitting and lifting actions without help, people with intellectual disabilities, with autism and motor disability, "all of a severe or deep degree (including those without grade assigned)." This allowance covers families of low performance caregivers.
“Currently the subsidy for caregivers can basically cover their respective low -performance caregivers families, thus allowing them to benefit from another economic support to live in the community. Moreover, it refers that families of caregivers who do not have enough economic resources to face the basic needs of life can still require IAS subsidies, ”says Hon Wai, dismissing the hypothesis of extending the requirements for the request.
It also recalls that, since this initiative was implemented, the range of recipients has been gradually extended, having become a permanent measure not long ago. “At this time, the Government of MSAR maintains the current regime of assignment of the subsidy for caregivers, continually paying attention to the execution regarding this allowance, as well as support people with disabilities and families of caregivers through different types of services to meet the needs felt by them, ”he added.
 
Sufficient vacancies
On the other hand, the deputy questioned the government about vacancies in the integrated rehabilitation facilities for people with intellectual disabilities and also for these people who are already in the elderly. In this context, IAS indicated that “currently, there is a total of 13 social equipment in Macao with the host service to the disabled people, which can provide about 1,060 vacancies, which basically can meet the needs of the services concerned ”.
According to data referring until November 2024, a total accumulated of 44 people with intellectual disabilities who requested the reception service in care molds for rehabilitation. “Once the requests were considered, it was found that the majority of the applicants do not have the immediate need to enter the rehabilitation homes with the receiving service, and that these people and families receive the daytime rehabilitation and temporary reception service that It is data in the community can effectively maintain and balance the relationship of dependence among family members, ”said Hon Wai.
Regarding the needs of families of two elderly people with intellectual disabilities, IAS states that in 2019, coordinated the elderly home and the rehabilitation home of the Pai Van Seac Zone to organize, with priority, cases of parents and children to receive the corresponding home care service. Through the coordination of both homes "there was an increase in the number of times of visits that leads to a better maintenance of the relationship of parents and children of families of two elderly."
Already last year, “it was deepened” the coordination at the rehabilitation home of the Mong-Há zone, so that the same-sex parents and children can receive services within the home. Through the program, and at January this year, “there was only the entry of a pair of mother and daughter at the Elderly Home and the rehabilitation home of the Pai Van Seac Zone, which enjoyed the ease of visiting and visits and live close to each other ”.
Hon Wai also points out that the government plans to create a home that can make available for elderly and people with disabilities in Zone A to respond to demand. “Currently, home planning is still in a preliminary phase,” he says, pointing out details for later.</description><pubDate>2025-02-04 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Subsidies propel births in a Chinese city. Is it enough?</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/lazer/subsidios-impulsionam-nascimentos-numa-cidade-chinesa-sera-suficiente/</link><description>When Mrs. Zhou Xiaoying shared in Douyin a cash capture of a cash reward of 6,500 yuans deposited in his local government bank account in October 2024, he caused envious comments from other Chinese mothers.
"I'm also from the province of Hubei, but in our city, we received almost nothing?" He wrote a commentator at Douyin, the Tiktok of China. “So good? “I received only 200 to 300 yuans,” read in another comment.
Mrs. Zhou, 37, who is a native of Tianmen, in the central province of Hubei, received the money to have a second child, born in September 2024.
The 6,500 yuans are the first installment of the 35,300 yuans in cash rewards they will receive over three years, in addition to the 60,000 yuans in local government housing subsidies.
Incentives for fertility, such as cash rewards, tax cuts and maternity leave extensions, are determined by local governments and vary from place to place.
The amount is "enough to cover the baby's daily expenses, but not enough to raise a child," Zhou told agencies.
“For example, the kindergarten costs about 5,000 yuans per semester, which is equivalent to about 30,000 yuans for three years. And this is just school bribes, excluding other expenses, ”said Zhou, who recently fired from his job at the factory to become a full time mother.
"For me, it was a coincidence of luck that my second child was born a few months after the beginning of Tianmen subsidies in April 2024, but I will not have a third child," he confessed.
Regardless of this, generous cash rewards designed to encourage families to have a second and third child were praised by many as the main reason Tianmen, a city with a million people, welcomed 1.050 newborns in 2024, 2024, compared to 2023 - an increase of 17%.
The little known Chinese fifth -category city has recently had an impact on local media because it was the first to reverse its fall in the birth rate in eight years, in the midst of a national trend of falling birth and aging rates.
In Tianmen, families who have a third child can receive up to 165,100 yuans in cash incentives - more than the current average of 20,000 yuans in other Chinese regions. There are no incentives for the first child.
Mr. He Yafu, an independent demographer in China, recently said that "Tianmen's case proves that incentives make a difference." “If maternity subsidies do not have an effect, it is because they are very few and the subsidy has to be increased,” he argues.
On January 17, the China National Statistics Office reported that 9.54 million babies were born in 2024, a welcome increase over 9.02 million of 2023-the lowest number as long as the registers of numbers of Births began in 1949. However, the slight increase in new births was exceeded by 10.93 million deaths, which meant that, for the third consecutive year, China's population shrink.
Analysts say that the modest increase in births in 2024, although encouraging, is a temporary recovery, largely driven by exceptionally favorable social conditions, and it is unlikely to reverse the course of an aged and declining population.
Professor Ren Yuan, from the Fudan University's Population Research Institute, said that fluctuations in population numbers and annual birth numbers are normal, as much depends on factors such as annual wedding numbers, divorce, migration, employment, recovery Postpandey, cultural influences and other variables.
The increase in first marriages in 2023 had already foreseen the increase of newborns in 2024, the teacher said, and the auspicious year of the Chinese zodiac dragon was also important. From now on, the situation tends to normalize.
