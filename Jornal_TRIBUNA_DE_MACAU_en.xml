The economist anticipated the Jornal Tribuna de Macao that "adverse economic effects will be fundamentally the significant destruction of thousands of jobs, the reduction of operational capacity and the offer of companies linked to the game." In short, it admits that the economy, in the short term, “will pay a price too high and disproportionate to achieve objectives of greater regulatory control and transformation of the game model of the game in Macao”

The reflexes of the closure, by the end of the year, of the 11 satellite casinos in the territory may affect several sectors of the local economy, according to the opinion of António Félix Pontes. The economist told the Jornal Tribuna de Macao that, in general terms, the closure “causes material and immediate costs”, with a special prominence in employment, the recipes of the game and the small and medium-sized sector, “whose life has been deteriorating since the time of the pandemic, without being unveiled actions of effective and realistic support to them”.
"In the short term, the economy will pay a price too high and disproportionate to achieve objectives of greater regulatory control and transformation of the game model of the game in Macao, which, we are pragmatic, it is only possible to realize in the medium and long deadlines," he argues.
The issue of casinos-satellite workers is another of the concerns. "In fact, of these 11 satellite casinos, two have already been integrated into the casino-prince of one of the concessionaires, assuming that all its workers have moved to the latter." However, he says, "this may not mean that it will be the general rule, nor is it imposed by law, and why" why "for such omission."
Regarding the remaining nine satellite casinos, whose labor force should be around 5,000 workers, points out that "the situation may be full of uncertainties," even admitting that "if the decision of these entities is different from what happened with the above integration, the path of workers involved will almost inevitably be unemployment."
The problem of labor force may not be exhausted in the workers of these casinos, as Félix bridges indicates, “insofar as it constitutes only direct labor. It should be remembered that,“ in the orbit of satellite casinos, it gravitates huge small and medium-sized companies in and outside the spaces where the satellite casinos-cleaning companies, diverse stores, hospitality, hospitality are operating, operating, hospitality operating. Restaurants…-whose workers represent the indirect labor, which should not forget, ”he warns.
Considering that families will also be affected, the economist speaks of "mystery", since "no one has dared to present any feasible solution" to get employment to thousands of workers, from various sectors, from cleaning employees to those serving in restaurants. "
António Félix Pontes notes that the "negative effects" are not limited to the labor market. "Companies that depend on the activity of the satellite casinos have made financial commitments of diverse order they will have to honor -such as bank loans, salary and rent payment of places where they work -but, of course, they will only be able to do so if they have revenues," he says. Therefore, it admits that the future for these companies is "very dark."
In short, the short-term adverse economic effects will be fundamentally “the significant destruction of thousands of jobs, the reduction of operational capacity and the offer of game-related companies, the loss of certain market niches (VIP players), the difficulties that are very dependent on the activity of casinos satellites, the negative economic impact on the zones where they are They operate and the reduction in the revenues of concessionaires and government (game tax) ”.
With regard to reflexes in the bank sector, the economist considers it to be “natural” that the “domino effect” makes it feel. With unemployment, workers “will be coar of their salary” and the affected entrepreneurs “will no longer earn revenues due to the closure of their companies, so they will have a hard time repaying loans”.
In this scenario, he says, "banks will have to be provisions for evil credit, whose current level is already worrying, in particular, for certain financial institutions."
 
Transition period was “short”
Analyzing the reasons that were the basis of the decision of closing the satellite casinos, it recalls the legal basis that derives from the law that alters the 'legal regime of the exploration of fortune or unlucky casino', in which a period of transition of three years to the satellites, which ends on December 31, 2025. Flexibility, meeting the behavior of the local economy, which grows, but little and to various rhythms, depending on economic sectors, ”he said.
As for reasons of another order, long -term realization, they believe that they radiate aspects such as “reinforcement of supervision and control plus the game sector, by the imposition of the central government, and the concentration of activity by operators of greater magnitude”.
It also lists “decreased financial risks related to the activity of satellite casinos and their possible contagion to the financial sector and promoting a more-oriented business model of family tourism and leisure, thus contributing to the long-awaited economic diversification of masters”.
In his opinion, there should have been a "greater weighting and common sense" in order to have sought "a balance between social costs, in the short term, that the measure implies with the intended purpose, in the medium and long term."
Assuming that decision making previously “a cost-effective study must have been done, or in other words, about the advantages and inconvenience of this measure, in the economic, financial and social aspects (employment)”, Felix Pontes understands that if it happened, “in the name of transparency”, it should be of public knowledge, “even to avoid any incorrections in analysis”.
In conclusion, it speaks of the challenge that dealers will face in the future, stressing that the main concern will be to recover and, “eventually, to overcome” the recipes that their satellite casinos have been providing them. "Will they, or not, have a capacity of it?"</description><pubDate>2025-07-11 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>UNESCO calls for impact studies on viaduct and east line of the metro</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/unesco-pede-estudos-de-impacto-sobre-viaduto-linha-leste-metro/</link><description>Despite the viaduct between the A and B zones of the new landfills following the “Hill-Seal” principle, a part of the project can violate the tall restrictions in the guide headlight zone, considers the UNESCO World Heritage Committee, installing the “comprehensive environmental impact assessment” and submitting “detailed documentation”.

China's state administration of cultural heritage will have to send to the center of the World Heritage, until December 1, 2026, an updated report on the state of conservation of the Macao Historic Center and the implementation of various measures for the purposes of revision by UNESCO advisory bodies. The respective resolution proposal was made up of the 47th session of the World Herit Committee, which is taking place at UNESCO headquarters in Paris, after the last report of China - submitted to November 16, 2024 - not enough to dispel questions about some projects with negative potential impact on the historic center.
Based on analyzes from the World Heritage Center, International Council of Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) and International Center for Studies for the Conservation and Restoration of Cultural Goods (ICCOM), the UNESCO body responsible for the supervision of the World Heritage Convention praises the commitment of the governments of China and MSAR, however, also addresses critical and more safeguard measures. In the document consulted by the Jornal Tribuna de Macao, the notes of concern are concentrated on projects such as the East Line of Metro Ligeiro and, above all, the controversial viaduct between zones A and B of new landfills, whose work was recorded in October 2024 and entered the conception phase.
“Although it should be noted that the planning of the viaduct project ('A-B' bridge) takes into account the landscape scenario 'choline-marklit' (…), as a project section may violate the height control specified in 'Zone 1' in the order of Executive Chief No. 83/2008, the state part must also perform a comprehensive environmental impact assessment and submit detailed documentation of the project to the center of the center World Heritage Site for analysis by advisory bodies, even if height control only applies to buildings ”, underlines the text of the resolution. Thus, the center of world heritage wants to be able to review the project, "before any irreversible decisions are made."
The viaduct has awakened numerous criticism in Macao, including deputy Ron Lam and urban planner Lam Iek Chit, who have defended the project's suspension and replacement with a underwater tunnel to protect the guide's headlight landscape. It is recalled that this order of Edmund Ho, then chief executive, set the maximum altimetric quotas allowed for building buildings in the vicinity of the Lighthouse.
Classifying as "unacceptable" the fact that the government faces the viaduct as a "corridor", rather than a "construction", Ron Lam warned that the project "ignores global planning and long -term effects, and may cause residents to lose confidence in the executive regarding world heritage protection."
 
Authorities guarantee “open attitude”
In a letter dated October 17, 2024, the Center of World Heritage requested China to verify third party information on the “A-B Bridge” and the state of buildings of buildings in the “Historic Center Protection Zone”. A month later, in the report that Beijing to UNESCO, the authorities asserted that the planning and construction of the viaduct will take into account “the protective needs of the 'hill-sea' landscape of the historic center”, promise to analyze “exhaustively all aspects” and “evaluate all eventual impacts of the project”.
In February this year, public works services, soil services and urban construction and the Cultural Institute guaranteed, in a joint statement, which maintain “an open attitude” about the process, “listening to opinions in society and optimizing the project”. "Regarding the way to build access in zones A and B of new urban landfills to which citizens pay attention in recent days, the government of Ream will collect their opinions and proceed to the organization and integrated analysis," the note adds.
About 3.2 kilometers long, the project is part of a viaduct, road networks connecting to its two ends, a superior passage to pedestrians and one underground. The main structure of the viaduct will be about 1,550 meters in length, and the segment of the maritime area will be 900 meters, four navigable spans with a maximum extension of about 130 meters and a maximum altimetric quota of 25.8 meters.
Regarding the East Line of the Metro, between zones A and and the new landfills, the World Heritage Committee begins by recognizing that the project “was designed to avoid potential impacts on the 'choline-tile' visual connections, most of the underground work except inputs/exits of some seasons in the area A”. However, it understands that it is “appropriate to ask the state to present detailed documentation, including the project's environmental impact assessment”, as well as the “main management and planning documents” of new urban landfills.
In addition, it also asks for more information about unfinished buildings on Calçada do Gaio, as it only received “a summary” regarding licensing for the restoration of construction. Identical appeal extends to the studies of patrimonial impact and urbanism of the surrounding area to the avenue of Dr. Rodrigo Rodrigues.
 
“Effective” management plan despite “unfortunate” failure
Generally speaking, the UNESCO agency “appreciates” “commitments” and “continuous efforts” of China and “continuous efforts” and to implement previous committee requests and the technical opinions of Icomos, as well as the various initiatives reported to improve conservation, monitoring, interpretation and presentation of heritage ”. Still, it does not hide any displeasure by the way the process of the safeguard and management plan of the Historic Center was conducted, which entered into force on 1 June 2024.
“It is unfortunate that the final version of the management plan has not been shared with the center of the world heritage for review by the advisory bodies before its adoption and implementation, as requested by the Committee (…), it is positive that the management plan has been completed in accordance with the technical opinion of Icomos, providing an effective structure and an effective tool for the conservation and management of goods”, can also be read in resolution, The entry into operation of the Macao World Heritage Monitoring Center praises in November 2022.
The Management Plan provides “a legal basis for the holding of assets of heritage impact,” says the committee, asking China to “continue to inform the center of the world heritage on any proposed actions” to the Historic Center, “the tampon zones and their widest surroundings that can have a negative impact on the attributes that support the universal exceptional value” of classified real estate. Insisting again on the need to avoid “irreversible decisions”, it also stresses that “detailed information on systematic and integrated monitoring” of heritage is welcome.</description><pubDate>2025-07-11 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>History of the “magic box” celebrates Disney Legacy</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/historia-da-caixa-magica-celebra-legado-da-disney/</link><description>This Saturday, the first of 10 shows of Disney's “The Magic Box” production at the Venetian Theater is held. To the Jornal Tribuna de Macao, the authors of the musical, Felipe Paredes and Thaddeus Phillips, spoke of the challenge that was reproducing Disney's extensive catalog of figures and songs in a single project

Pedro Milheirão
Debuts tomorrow at the Venetian Theater, the show “The Magic Box” of Disney, one of the highlights of the 2nd International Children's Arts Festival. The Jornal Tribuna de Macau spoke to the creators of the musical, which will be presented for the first time in China. Organized by Sands China, the production will have 10 shows in Macau, between this weekend and from July 18 to 20.
In the genesis of the musical “The Magic Box” was “the need to create something that was more understandable to the Disney catalog and that represented much more the content of the stories, rather than just a story,” said Felipe Paredes, creative producer. “I wanted to do it in an original and theatrical way that was not literal. Something that was more abstract and that triggered the emotions of the movies without retelling them,” as he explained to the Jornal Tribuna de Macao.
For Thaddeus Phillips, the director, including all Disney in a musical was a "crazy" idea. "When we talk about Disney, we don't just talk about theatrical production, we talk about all movies, cartoon." In this sense, Phillips imagined a studio, "which is a place where things are done," essentially "a magic box of creation," but "is also a metaphor for the whole public relationship with Disney."
The director confessed that one of the challenges was to realize how to get the show to work with different audiences, at different levels and simultaneously. "In one family, parents see one thing, the other children and the other grandparents, and it's the same moment. While the latest projects are great, and the music is wonderful, in some of the older things, such as Snow White, Pinocchio and Bambi, music is a little forgotten and is just amazing. It's like an opera."
"Without having to be literal for the character," Phillips continued, "we can take the words of music and, through [Mara], put them on the spectators." "Each member of the public, in a way, is going through their own journey, because it is a very open presentation," he said.
During the process of selecting the songs, from the extensive Disney catalog, Paredes said they sought to form a "rich tapestry without being historical." "The fact that we have an original story, instead of reproducing a story of movies, frees us from chronology," he explained.
The balance between classic and contemporary themes also allows you to involve a “wider audience”. "With a family of grandparents, parents and children, in a two -minute scene, each will find an entry point. Grandparents can respond to a 1964 Mary Poppins song, parents can respond to one from Aladdin, 1992, and the children to one from Moana. We were very careful to choose the moments, the music, which helped our story," said the producer.
 
A mirror for the “internal child”
Mara, the main character, works as a guide. According to the authors, the idea is that it is “a mirror of the public, any viewer. It represents us all. It is an adult when entering the box and its mission is to reconnect with your internal child. I think for all of us, we have worked on this project in recent years, was a portal to reconnect with our own childhood. I think this is the best celebration of the power of Disney history. inner voice again. ”
About Macao's choice, for the debut of the production "The Magic Box" in China, Paredes justified by having a "very rich" multicultural story. "It's a place that improves cultures. Our creative team is made of people from many different countries. The show itself is already very multicultural. So it seemed very suitable to present it to an audience that is, by definition, multicultural."
“The second reason is that Macau is an amazing place for entertainment and quality experiences,” continued Felipe Paredes. "It has an incredible set of resorts, restaurants and entertainment. It seemed the right place to debut [the show] in China."
Asked what she wants viewers to take from the experience, Phillips stated that "I would like them to have a resurgence of all Disney's memories, wherever they bring them. As what happened to me, after entering the material. I started thinking about that very scary clown face in Pinocchio, in 'Pleasure Island'.
"It's also a way of looking at the material, away from its original source," added Phillips. "It's a very sophisticated show, but it's not of high technology. For younger people, it's very important to me that they come back with a feeling of the possibilities of theater."
In turn, Paredes also highlighted the fact that it is "the first time these characters, Mickey and friends, are represented through puppets. What the viewer perceives from puppet is the human who is manipulating the character. Increases the level of humanism. It's more real. Even seeing the trick to be done."
The musical follows Mara, who enters a magic box and discovers "a world of wonders with the beloved characters and excerpts from over 75 classic Disney movies." Themes such as King Lion's “Circle of Life”, “Whole New World of Aladdin and“ Let It Go ”from“ Frozen ”, among others, will be interpreted by a live orchestra.
The hour and a half show includes puppets, a “magnificent” choreography, innovative and “impressive” visual techniques. The show premiered last year in Buenos Aires and “Maravilho audiences in Cape Town, Johannesburg, and more recently, Abu Dhabi and Doha,” according to a Sands statement.
Felipe Paredes, born in Colombia, began his career on stage and on television with only seven years. He later formed a theater company and, as an independent producer, supported international festivals, contemporary artists and performance arts organizations around the world. For about 15 years, he worked for Disney Theatical Group, for the division of the Broadway of the Walt Disney Studios and as a producer in acclaimed shows such as "King Lion" and "Aladdin", among others.
Thaddeus Phillips, is a theater artist and theater director who creates theater productions, cinema and songs “that extend the boundaries of what is possible on stage”. His work was presented in cities such as Shanghai, Bogota, London and Los Angeles. He collaborated with names like Geoff Sobelle, Steven Dufala, The Wilhelm Bros, Robert Lepage and Teller.</description><pubDate>2025-07-11 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Authors Association Visit Lisboa with Literary Translation on Agenda</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/associacao-dos-autores-visita-lisboa-traducao-literaria-na-agenda/</link><description>Literary translation is one of the topics that the Macao Authors Association brings in the luggage of the trip to Portugal for discussion with various entities, including the Camões Institute. The courtesy visit of a week is part of a dozen members, being Miguel de Senna Fernandes the only one who dominates the Portuguese language. “From the point of view of the Chinese authors it was important to find roads to disseminate their work through literary translation, and this will be one of the important points of this trip to Portugal,” the Journal of Macao was the vice president of the association founded almost decade and a half ago

The difficulty that the Portuguese and Chinese authors have to translate their works, given the specificity of the respective languages, will be one of the points of the Macao Authors' Association, on a trip to Lisbon, which begins on Sunday. The one -week courtesy visit, which takes place for the first time in these molds of delegation, will serve to maintain diverse contacts with institutions linked to the literary field, with special emphasis on the Camões Institute.
The delegation of 12 elements is led by the president, Scarlett MA, who repeats the presence in Portugal, after last year was invited to participate in the celebrations of the 500th anniversary of the birth of Luís Vaz de Camões. On this occasion, the association's leader signed with that institute a protocol of cooperation and exchange of information on literary activities.
Scarlett Ma is not exactly writer, but a composer. His songs are composed for each poem, having edited a book with verses from Camões translated into Chinese, which is why he received the invitation to the celebrations in the Portuguese capital in 2024.
This year's visit is broader, not only in number of members, but in contacts that will be kept with various entities, namely the Macao Scientific and Cultural Center, the Jorge Álvares Foundation, the Macao House, the Embassy of the Popular Republic of China in Lisbon, among others, besides the Camões Institute itself. The purpose of the trip is to establish and deepen relationships with cultural institutions in Portugal, as well as “enjoy to better know Portuguese life and feel its culture under variety of ways”, as you can read in a note released by the association.
The delegation includes a overwhelming majority of Chinese writers, being Miguel de Senna Fernandes the only one who dominates the Portuguese language. To the Jornal Tribuna de Macao, the vice president, a position he has held since last year, says he will be, “with great taste”, the Cicerone of the visit, in a trip that aims to “express a deeper interest, not just mere courtesy, in contacts of this literary activity between writers of Macau and Portugal”.
From the point of view of the Chinese authors “it was interesting to find roads of dissemination of their work, which will have to happen through a translation process,” says Miguel de Senna Fernandes, recognizing, however, the difficulties that continue to arise in this domain because of the lack of literary translators in the territory.
"This is the big problem," he says. “I always hit my improvement in literary translation, not a normal translation, and we don't have it,” he lamented.
Macaense, son of the late writer Henrique de Senna Fernandes, whose literature portrays Macao of the twentieth century, understands that, “for the Portuguese, or Portuguese language authors, as is my case, who want to be known in the Chinese world, literary translation is fundamental, the same happening to the side of the Chinese”. He considers, however, that the Chinese to Portuguese translation is more difficult than the other way around.
"Those who write in Portuguese are very interested in seeing their works launched in the Chinese market, while the Chinese authors will naturally want to see their works in the non -Chinese market, in this Portuguese case, being different contexts, and at least it is necessary to give a starting point," he says.
"I myself tried several times to put my tales to be translated, without great results. But, I understand, it is not easy, because the very way of expressing literary in Portuguese is different," he says. These translation issues will be on the table “In the conversations we will keep with the entities in Lisbon,” he says, adding to his dream to help solve this difficulty.
About the little influx of Portuguese writers to the Association, Miguel de Senna Fernandes states that “it was for this reason that I was invited to integrate it, understanding the president that it was important to take the first step to call more people Portuguese language”.</description><pubDate>2025-07-11 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>More than half of MSAR adults use social networks</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/mais-de-metade-dos-adultos-da-raem-utiliza-redes-sociais/</link><description>Most adults from Macau used social networks earlier this year.

Internet penetration stabilizes 93%
In the latest study on Internet use trends in Macao, Mair researchers observed that the internet penetration rate remains at 93%, similar to 2023 and 2024. In addition, the Digital Division Index (DDI) “decreases to almost 0”.

The Cultural Institute (IC) called on to the companies of the Performative Arts sector to rent the “outdoor spectacle site”. The space, located at Cotai, along with the Grand Lisboa Palace resort, is still available for July and August.
Interested companies and artistic groups can deliver the proposals personally to the IC building or send them by email or mail. Proposals should include the names of organizers and sponsors, an estimate of the number of viewers, as well as details about the artist or the group they will act.
In addition, candidates should also describe the content and dates of the event, as well as the number of days needed to assemble the stage.
With 94,000 square meters, the outdoor space has “basic installations” and “complementary equipment for large -scale shows”. Last month, “successfully” was the first concert operated by companies in the sector, which attracted 11,000 residents and tourists, says the body's statement.
In order to test aspects such as security, transport, multitudes control and public order, as well as promote the planning of the shows, the body is studying and organizing work with various government departments.
“Since the beginning of the experimental period of the site, several works to optimize space and event negotiation have been carried out,” says the Cultural Institute.</description><pubDate>2025-07-11 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>MP consolidates judicial bonds with guangdong</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/mp-consolida-lacos-judiciarios-guangdong/</link><description>Under the Development of the Great Bay, “there is a greater need to reinforce the exchange” regarding “legal integration”, “judicial management” and “coordination in process investigations”, among other areas, considers the MP, in the balance of a visit to Guangdong
 
A delegation from the prosecutor's (MP), headed by the prosecutor, Chan Tsz King, has moved to four cities in Guangdong Province, expecting to “improve cooperation mechanisms in the judicial area and deepen the exchange and cooperation with the prosecutors of the interior of China through the consolidation of judicial ties between the two places”. According to a press release, the entourage was received by the Attorney General of the neighboring province, Feng Jian.
At the meeting, Chan Tsz King stressed that, with the impetus of national strategy in the Great Bay, “fruit results were achieved in the various aspects” between Guangdong province prosecutors and the Macau MP. It appointed, among others, the combat of transfronical crime, judicial cooperation and personnel formation.
"The advanced experiences obtained by the province of Guangdong province about the promotion of the construction of the rule of law and the safeguarding of justice and impartiality of society deserve to serve as learning objects and exemplary models for the MP MP," said the prosecutor.
However, given the new trend of integration of people, goods and capital flows in the Great Bay, “there is a greater need to reinforce exchange and cooperation” regarding legal integration, judicial management, coordination in process investigations, digital services, among other areas. The expectation is to “promote innovative regimes based on the concept of 'judicial activism', to establish a new platform to promote the construction of the rule of law of the great bay, giving its judicial contribution to erecting a ground -based bay with international weight,” said Chan Tsz King, quoted in a statement.

Ron Lam and Pereira Coutinho appealed to meet the meetings of the commissions of the alter to take place at the open door. On the contrary, several deputies, including the president of AL, Kou Hoi In, defended the current functioning of the committees
 
The Legislative Assembly (AL) approved yesterday, in general and specialty, the project of resolution “amendment to the regiment of the Legislative Assembly”. Still, a new stipulation introduced in Article 93 of the diploma - according to which, except for the President and the Secretary of the Commission, the deputies cannot reveal, anyway, the content of the meetings that take place at the closed door - caused broad discussion in the hemiciclo.
This article was the subject of independent voting, following a request made by Deputy Ron Lam, and was eventually approved, with votes against Ron Lam and José Pereira Coutinho. The remaining 30 deputies voted in favor, including Che Sai Wang, Coutinho's partner.
In the discussion, Ron Lam began by pointing out that, in terms of execution, it is difficult not to reveal the content of the commission meetings. He questioned namely whether the deputies are allowed to comment on the questions raised by journalists and the answers given by the presidents and secretaries of the commissions at the press conferences held after the meetings.
In general, both Ron Lam and Coutinho argued that the meetings of the Al commissions should take place at the open door, as in Hong Kong. In this respect, Coutinho maintained that the opening of the meetings corresponds to the demands of society, even questioning whether Al aims to perform an inquiry to perceive public opinion regarding this subject. Moreover, he stressed, the opinions of the proposals of law "may not be prepared broadly."
In turn, Al, Kou Hoi In, stressed that the alteration to the regiment of the alma does not virtually not alter the original arrangements regarding the committees' meetings, which can be opened if a deliberation is approved. According to explained, even if they are opened, the meetings of the commissions should be attended by journalists, but not other citizens. At this point, he said that each commission can, according to the R regiment, define the procedures themselves.
Kou Hoi In argued: “Since in the discussion phase the content is not yet mature, it is not appropriate to disclose it to the public. And about what the deputies have said, we think it should be kept secret. We hope that the deputies and government services can speak freely and prepare proposals corresponding to the real needs of society. Commissions] ”, he added.
In the same vein, Ho Ion Sang, chairman of the AL Regiment and Mandates Commission, described the current model of disclosure of the content discussed in the meetings by the presidents and the secretaries of the commissions as "effective". As for the constant content of the opinions, it defined it as “very detailed”, considering it includes the different opinions of the deputies and the attitude of the government.
Iau Teng Pio also warned that if the contents of the meetings are disclosed when there is no final decision yet, it will have “great impact” on society. Song Pek Kei, in turn, pointed out that Al “has struggled a lot” to increase the transparency of commission meetings, praising the new stipulation by clarifying the responsibility of the presidents and secretaries of the commissions and bringing a balance between the need for work of deputies and the right to know the public.
Chui Sai Peng said that the addition of this stipulation is “important, essential and appropriate,” while Pang Chuan recalled that “there was an old colleague who published the contents of Facebook meetings almost while the meetings took place”, advocating the importance of the new rule to prevent these situations.
The diploma also adds the duty of the deputies to attend the plenary meetings of the committees to which they belong and committed opinions and suggestions. Coutinho and Ron Lam mentioned the question of deputies' participation in the meetings of the committees to which they do not belong. Ron Lam suggested to the commissions that they provide clear channels through which deputies can have access to meetings information.
According to the president of AL, this duty is already a common practice in the hemicycle. In addition, Kou Hoi in promised that he will take more detailed measures, especially in relation to complex law proposals, so that legal advisors can explain to all deputies the complex diplomas.
 
Approved amendment to the Deputies Statute
Also in AL, in an urgent process, the project “Amendment to the Law - of the Legislature and the Statute of Deputies to AL” was approved in the urgent process. Ho Ion Sang explained that the review is concerned with the approval of several laws by AL with an impact on regimes regulating its operation, including changes to the law on the defense of state security, the electoral law for the AL and the oath law at the time of the possession.
The amendment to the Statute of Deputies advocates that, in addition to the procedures contained in the Oath Law, the deputies must also sign the term of the oath provided for in an annex of the law. In addition, the mandate may be suspended by criminal proceedings or serious violation of the duties of the deputies. The plenary will decide whether or not to suspend the mandate and how many days of suspension should be applied to the deputy, suggesting a period of suspension between seven to 30 days.
Both diplomas come into force on 16 October.
 
Budget Law approved in the specialty
The proposal to change the 2025 Budget Law was approved yesterday in the Specialty by AL. After the amendment, the amount of the Balance of the Ordinary Budget of the MSAR Economic for the 2025 economic year was changed to nearly 287 million patacas, representing a drastic reduction of 7.4 billion, and the total budgeted revenue has dropped to 116.5 billion and the expense increased to 116.2 billion. Four public services and funds registered increases in the budget value of more than 100 million patacas. According to the government, the budget for the University of Macao increased by 1.88 million, to prepare the construction of the campus in Hengqin and support scientific research projects of the state's reference laboratories. The industrial and marketing development fund has a reinforcement of 650 million patacas, with a view to providing support services to digitize small and medium enterprises, and promoting typical and exquisite stores. In addition, the Institute of Social Action and the Fund for the Development of Science and Technology saw its budget up 460 million and 350 million, respectively. Ron Lam voted against an article regarding the cash checks, advocating legislation for this measure and that, in the future, changes to cash reimbursement must always be the subject of public consultation.
 
“Green Light” for diplomas on civil servants
The AL approved in the specialty a proposal to change the Statute of Public Administration Workers and another that reviews the fundamental provisions of the Statute of Board and Head. According to the amendment to the Statute of Employees, doctors of non -profit medical institutions that have entered into agreements with health services will also be able to pass medical certificate to civil servants. According to the Secretary for Administration and Justice, the new article will facilitate employees in medical treatment and avoid, as much as possible, fake medical certificates. Underlining that the government does not discriminate or disapprove of the professional capacity of doctors and private clinics, André Cheong stated that the executive has confidence in, under the premise of effective inspection, to gradually allow all qualified doctors to pass medical certificates to civil servants. This possibility, however, is not yet subject to a calendar.</description><pubDate>2025-07-10 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Case Epstein infuriates the foundations of Trump's Maga Movement</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/lazer/caso-epstein-enfurece-bases-movimento-maga-de-trump/</link><description>The basis of Donald Trump's Maga Movement is standing up after the government tried to discredit the dozens of conspiracy theories around Jeffrey Epstein, one of the most fervent followers of the US President.
Trump's Department of Justice and the FBI concluded, in a report published Monday by the American website Axios, which Epstein had no “customer list” and ruled out that the former financial financially accused of running a minor sex trafficking network, has blackmailed powerful figures. They also confirmed that Epstein committed suicide in a prison in New York, which dismantles one of the theories he maintains that he was murdered.
This report is the first done by the Trump administration about the case and the first that rejects the main conspiracy theories around the figure and death of the former financial, promoted by figures from the American right. The two highest -ranked FBI employees endorsed these theories before being appointed by Trump for the current positions.
The reaction was rapid and brutal by the foundations of his movement “Make America Great Again” (Maga, “Making America Big”), which promotes the theory that the “deep state” would be protecting prominent figures from all sectors - especially from the Democratic and Hollywood party - which would have bonds with Epstein.
"The next department of justice will say is," In fact, Jeffrey Epstein didn't even exist, "Alex Jones, Trump's faithful follower. “This is extremely unhealthy,” he continued.
Trump managed to channel part of the fury of his own base against FBI director Kash Patel and his deputy Dan Bongino.
Another quite affected figure was the Attorney General Pam Bondi, who had stated before the publication of the report that had the list of Epstein customers on his table and would publish the whole truth about the case. Statements that had the support of the White House.
Bondi was already in the sights of the Maga Movement after distributing tagged folders like “Epstein files” to influencers in the White House - folders that contained mostly public information and no new revelation.
"Trump should fire [Bondi] for lying to his base and being a dead weight for his administration," he published in X the influencer of far-right Laura Lomer. "She is a shame and does nothing to help Trump."
"This is what happens when you and the people around you become the same 'deep state' that they have been attacking," wrote CNN analyst Chris Cillizza in his bulletin in "Substack."
Epstein committed suicide in a prison of New York in 2019 after being accused of sexual trafficking.
Trump, who denies being in the mansion of the American virgin islands where, according to prosecutors, Epstein prostituted minors, said during the campaign that he would have no "problem" in making public the files related to the case public.
The president closed his face on Tuesday when a journalist asked him about the Epstein case during a meeting of his office. "Are you still talking about Jeffrey Epstein?… People still talk about this kind, disgusting? It's unbelievable," said Trump.
This is just one of the schisms that in recent hours seem to divide Trump's support base. Another is the republican's decision to resume the supply of weapons to Ukraine.
Maga's most isolation wing was already disappointed since the president's order to attack Iran and the announcement of softening operations against immigrants.
This new scam to the principles of the magician endangers some supports to Trump and feeds the path of the newly created party by billionaire Elon Musk, who from faithful squire began to rival the Republican because of federal spending.
At the height of the attack of attacks last month, Musk stated that Trump appears in the Epstein archives. "What time is it? Ah, see, it's time for no one to be arrested once again!," Musk wrote on Monday, accompanied by the image of a scoring scoring with the title "The Official Placard of Jeffrey Epstein pedophilia prisons."
