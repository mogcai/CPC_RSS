On the last day of 2025, the Government released the list of personalities and entities that will receive medals and honorary titles for having distinguished themselves through personal achievements, contributions to society or services provided to Macau. The distinctions, totaling 28, will be awarded at a ceremony to be held on January 30th, in the Grand Auditorium of the Cultural Center.
Among those awarded, suggested by the Appointment Committee, highlight is the highest decoration awarded by the Macao SAR, the Great Lotus Medal of Honor, which will be awarded to Ho Iat Seng, former Chief Executive, and to Kou Hoi In, former president of the Legislative Assembly (AL).
Through his Office, Ho Iat Seng thanked him for the important medal awarded to him and stated that the development of the Macao SAR “continuously advances on the foundations that are the achievements of the past”. Ho Iat Seng, who was also a member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Assembly and president of the AL, highlighted that the fifth Macao SAR Government “brought together all sectors of society to overcome challenges and achieve tangible results through pragmatic efforts”.
These results, he highlighted, “depend not only on the dedication and hard work of the government action team and all Public Administration employees, but also on the strong support and joint efforts of the community and all residents”.
The former head of the government team during a five-year term considered that this Medal of Honor is “a collective victory, which demonstrates the commitment of the entire society to promoting greater and better development for the Macao SAR”.
In the same note, he also expressed the firm conviction that the territory, “under the firm support of the great motherland”, will continue to “actively integrate itself into the context of national development, taking advantage of the significant opportunities arising from the construction of the Greater Bay Area and the Cooperation Zone in Hengqin”. In addition, he emphasized the commitment to continue upholding the fundamental values ​​of patriotism and love for Macau, promote the stable and lasting implementation of the principle of “one country, two systems” and contribute to the long-term prosperity and stability of the nation and the Macao SAR.
For his part, Kou Hoi In said he felt “deeply honored”, promised to continue doing his best for Macau and the country and recognized that the medal is the result not only of his work, but also “of everyone who contributed to the development of Macau”.
The former deputy recalls having been elected in 1991, before the transfer of sovereignty, having served the Macao SAR for 34 years and witnessing the main historical changes and the success of the practice of the “one country, two systems” principle in Macau.
Finally, the current chairman of the TDM Board of Directors assured that, in the future, he will continue to “promote the values ​​of love for the country and Macau, defend the stable and lasting implementation of ‘one country, two systems’ and contribute to the long-term prosperity and stability of the country and the Macao SAR”.
 
Raimundo do Rosário receives “Golden Lotus”
The Golden Lotus Medal will be awarded to the former Secretary for Transport and Public Works, Raimundo Arrais do Rosário, as well as to Ho Veng On, former Commissioner of Audit, and Vong Man Chong, former director general of the Customs Services.
Raimundo do Rosário, born in Macau, was also a member of the Drafting Committee of the Basic Law and the Preparatory Committee for the Establishment of Macau, deputy to AL and member of the supervisory board of Banco Comercial de Macau. Between 1999 and 2014, he headed the Macau Economic and Commercial Delegation, in Lisbon, and was also responsible for the economic and commercial delegations to the European Union, in Brussels, and the World Trade Organization, in Geneva.
As for Ho Veng On, who left his position as Audit Commissioner in 2024, after more than 20 years, in what was his longest tenure, he reacted to the decoration, remembering that in the past he also participated in the organization's work on awarding medals and helped the Chief Executive to move forward with the respective proposals. “I know, therefore, that this medal has great meaning”, he stressed.
Vong Man Chong, in turn, expressed that the medal also belongs to the long-term work carried out by the Customs Services. “I would not be able to achieve this honor without the solid foundation left by all the previous directors-general of the Customs Services, who always persisted in the governance guidelines and development guidelines of the Customs”, he asserted.
Looking to the future, he said he was “deeply convinced” that all Customs personnel will continue to defend Macau’s “core values” to “overcome difficulties and complete the tasks given by the Government”.
Closing the Medals of Honor, the Government awarded the “Silver Lotus” to the Macau Banks Association. Speaking to the newspaper Ou Mun, the entity's president, Fan Yaosheng, pointed out that there has been, over 40 years of existence, “an effort to maintain financial stability, promote the development of modern finance, and boost economic development and integration in the construction of the Greater Bay Area”.
The Medals of Honor, with the degrees of Great Lotus, Golden Lotus and Silver Lotus, aim to “distinguish individuals or entities for their notable contribution to the image and good name of the Macao SAR, both within and abroad, or for their contribution, in any field, of great relevance to the development of the Macao SAR”, can be read in a statement from the Social Communication Office (GCS).
 
“Dancing Water” distinguished with Tourist Medal
As for the Merit medals, they will be awarded to the Macau University of Science and Technology, Keang Peng School and Kao Yip School, in the educational sector, and to the team of the show “House of Dancing Water”, by Melco Resorts &amp; Entertainment, in this case in the Tourism sector.
These Merit distinctions comprise seven categories and are intended “to reward individuals or entities that stand out in the exercise of any professional activity, for their prominence and notoriety in the industrial and commercial domains, as well as for the contribution made to development in these areas”, highlights the GCS.
Sport was also distinguished, with the Nomination Committee nominating the Karate Team of the Macao SAR Sports Delegation to the 15th Edition of the National Games and the table tennis athlete Zhu Yuling. The list of merit badges also includes Chan Iok Lin (professional), Nam Kwong and Li Amber Jiaming Logistics Company (industrial and commercial), Macau Barra Maritime and Land Residents Chinese Opera Association, Lam Fat Iam and Chan Iu Pui (cultural) and the China-SAR International Medical Emergency Team (altruistic).
The Macao SAR Government also awarded Distinguished Service Medals to Tai Kam Un (Dedication) and the Macau Peng On Tung Tele-Assistance Service Center (Community Services), which highlight the performance of duties, participation in responses to incidents of a public nature or the provision of community services.
In addition, the list also includes honorary titles of Valor and Prestige, three of which are awarded to educational establishments (Salesian Institute of the Immaculate Conception, Pui Ching Secondary School and Lou Hau Secondary School) and another three to the teams present in the “Asian Elite Dance Competition 2024-2025”, in the 2nd Asian 3×3 Basketball Championship for Secondary Schools and in the 2025 Bowling World Cup, as well as Li In Iat.</description><pubDate>2026-01-05 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Tourism on the rise at the end of 2025 and the beginning of 2026</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/turismo-em-alta-fim-de-2025-inicio-de-2026/</link><description>Macau registered 180,000 visitors in farewell to 2025, with December 31st still being marked by the concentration of 65,000 people in the countdown area on the “Cotai Strip”, according to police estimates. Macau tourism also started 2026 with robust results, registering more than 188 thousand visitors both on January 1st and the following day



















On the last day of 2025, 180,502 visitors entered Macau, reported the Public Security Police Corps (CPSP), revealing that the territory registered 188,036 visitors on January 1st, a number that set a daily record on the occasion of the Universal Brotherhood holiday.
According to the CPSP, also on January 1st, the volume of entries and exits across local borders reached 866 thousand, also setting a new daily record. On that day, residents accounted for 33% of border movements, while visitors and non-resident workers (TNR) accounted for 49.6% and 16.2% of entries and exits, respectively.
With a total of 147 thousand entries and exits, the Hengqin Border Post also registered, on January 1st, a new daily record for border crossings.
On January 2nd, the number of visitors to the Macao SAR reached 188,561. On the 3rd, it dropped to 109,510, which means that the three-day Universal Brotherhood holidays in Mainland China brought more than 486,000 visitors to Macau.
On the other hand, also according to CPSP data, until 5pm yesterday, the Macao SAR recorded 80,394 visitors.
 
65 thousand filled “Cotai Strip”
On December 31st, several areas of the city hosted New Year's Eve activities. At COTAI, Sands once again organized a special New Year celebration program, with outdoor music and a fireworks show, which attracted thousands of people.
On the other hand, at Lake Sai Van Square, a countdown concert organized by the Cultural Institute also brought together many people. Casas da Taipa were also the scene of celebrations marking the departure of 2025 and the entry into 2026, in a celebration dedicated to the theme of multicultural integration. The performances of singers, bands and different communities in Macau fascinated many spectators who almost occupied the entire audience.
However, according to the Chinese-language press, after the pyrotechnic display on the “Cotai Strip”, numerous groups of people were stranded in that location, which led to negative comments on social media about the traffic measures taken at the location and the “lack of clarity” in the instructions regarding the flow of people.
According to the Unitary Police Services, police authorities estimated that, at the countdown location on the “Cotai Strip”, there were around 65 thousand people at peak height, with the flow of passengers waiting for buses being basically completed by 04:00 in the morning.
Police consider that traffic order was generally normal and safe that night. Even so, he assured that he will review and analyze the relevant measures, including improving plans for dispersing the flow of people and traffic.
In turn, the Directorate of Services for Traffic Affairs revealed that, from midnight on New Year's Eve until the end of public transport services, the Light Metro made more than 170 departures, serving more than 12 thousand passengers, and there were almost 570 departures of public daytime buses, which means an annual increase of 18%.
 
Macau with annual record of 40.06 million visitors
The MSAR welcomed 40.06 million visitors in 2025, setting a new annual record that reflects an increase of around 14.7% compared to 2024. According to the CPSP, the annual record for border crossings was also broken in 2025, which reached 235 million, an increase of 9.8% compared to 2024. Among all border crossings, those for residents represented 36.4%, while 26.1% and 33.9% involved TNR and visitors, respectively. The most used borders in 2025 were Portas do Cerco (52.7% of the total), Qingmao (15.4%) and Hengqin (12.9%). Furthermore, according to the Zhuhai customs inspection authorities, during one year of implementation, the “one-entry visa per week” policy for Zhuhai residents and the “one visa, multiple entry” policy for Hengqin residents led 5.5 million holders of these documents to visit the Macao SAR.</description><pubDate>2026-01-05 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Casinos fuel rising projections for 2026</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/casinos-alimentam-projeccoes-em-alta-para-2026/</link><description>After having increased by 9.1% in 2025, reaching 84.6% of the pre-pandemic level, gaming revenues are expected to grow again this year, according to the first projections from analysts at JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank. Between October and December, Macau's casinos had their best quarterly performance in the last six years
 
SERGIO TERRA
 
Macau's casinos closed their 2025 accounts with total gross revenues of 247.40 billion patacas, an amount that represents an annual increase of 9.1% or 20.62 billion and corresponds to 84.6% of the mark reached in 2019, the pre-pandemic year, according to data published by the Gaming Inspection and Coordination Department (DICJ) on its website. Historical records show that 2025 was the eighth best year ever for the gaming sector, whose record dates back to 2013 (with 360.7 billion), and the most productive since the covid-19 pandemic.
The performance of the casinos exceeded the forecasts of the Macao SAR Government, whose budget for 2025 initially pointed to 240 billion patacas in gross gaming revenue, later dropping to 228 billion, in the proposal approved by the Legislative Assembly in July.
According to the DICJ, gross revenue amounted to around 20.89 billion patacas in December alone, reflecting an annual increase of 14.8% and a monthly decrease of 0.9%. Last month, the sector's recovery was more pronounced than the annual average, reaching 91.5% of the level recorded in December 2019.
Between October and December, casinos achieved the best quarterly result in the last six years, vastly exceeding analysts' general forecasts, with revenues of 66.06 billion patacas, 15% more than in the same period of 2024. Data from the fourth quarter of 2025 also represents a growth of 5.6% compared to the previous three months and is equivalent to 91.5% of the same period in 2019.
The good momentum in the gaming sector is expected to continue in 2026 and 2027, according to the first projections from investment banks Deutsche Bank and JP Morgan, based on the solidity of the mass market. The evolution of the VIP segment leads to discrepancies.
For JP Morgan analysts, total gross revenues could increase between 5% and 6% in 2026, in annual terms, with “a stronger performance in the mass and slot machine segments”, translated into growth of 7% to 8%, compensating for “weaker results” in rooms aimed at high rollers. In the VIP segment, revenues could even fall by 5%, given “a high betting base” in 2025.
In turn, Steve Pizzella, from Deutsche Bank, anticipates a general increase of 5.8% to 32.77 billion US dollars (around 263 billion patacas at the current exchange rate) between 2025 and 2026, with growth accelerating in the second half of the year, and exceeding the forecast of 236 billion patacas included in the Macao SAR Budget. On the other hand, 2027 could be marked by an annual increase of 5%, to 34.41 billion dollars (276.16 billion patacas).
The same analyst's estimate for 2026 encompasses around US$23.42 billion (187.93 billion patacas) from the mass market and US$9.36 billion (75.08 billion patacas) from the VIP segment, illustrating year-on-year increases of 4.3% and 10%, respectively. Pizzella's forecast for this month is a year-on-year increase of 10.9%, “compared to consensus expectations of 9.3%”.</description><pubDate>2026-01-05 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Seguro and Mendes with campaign in Macau</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/seguro-mendes-campanha-em-macau/</link><description>Lawyer Jorge Neto Valente will be the representative in Macau of António José Seguro, candidate for the Portuguese presidential elections supported by the PS, with Jorge Fão as campaign director. António Bessa Almeida, a member of the local PSD, will be Luís Marques Mendes' campaign director. The remaining candidates for the January 18 elections have not yet revealed the names of those responsible for possible campaign actions in the territory
 
VÍTOR REBELO
 
About two weeks before the election of the new President of the Portuguese Republic, who will succeed Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, in Macau there are also some movements regarding the names of candidates' representatives. António José Seguro, an “independent” candidate, but supported by the Socialist Party, will have Jorge Neto Valente as his representative, thus repeating the functions already assumed during the candidacies of Mário Soares and Jorge Sampaio. Alongside the lawyer will be Jorge Fão, as campaign director.
Em carta enviada ao Jornal TRIBUNA DE MACAU, Jorge Fão manifestou o seu apoio a António José Seguro e referiu que, embora à distância, tem acompanhado a actual situação política em Portugal, “na medida em que se trata de um assunto” que merecedor da “nossa preocupação e atenção, por sermos todos portugueses, ainda que nascidos longe do País”.
In the letter of support, the president of the general assembly of the Association of Retirees, Retirees and Pensioners of Macau says that he attended, out of “curiosity” and “self-interest”, some debates, getting to know more closely the ideology of each person and the “intellectual and political capacity of those who believe themselves capable of occupying the highest position in the Portuguese nation”.
The leader believes that all the candidates, “or almost all”, made their political philosophy known and proposed what should be corrected, in the case of election to exercise those functions. “We know that Portugal is at a crossroads, and this is largely due to the schemes and skills of successive rulers in knowing how to get around their weak system or procedures that work poorly and that they profited from,” he says. Hence, he observes, “we are presented with news all the time about irregularities, influence peddling, corruption, abuse of power and much more”.
All of this causes “a lot of concern” to Jorge Fão, who considers that the President of the Republic “must be required, above all, to have integrity, empathy and an unquestionable moral structure, in addition to the capacity for aggregation and not for division and much less for inciting hatred”.
From this perspective, he points to António José Seguro as the “only candidate” who brings together those attributes, as he represents a candidacy of “maturity, responsibility and historical vision, and is therefore not an ornamental, confrontational or spectacular presidency”. He is, in essence, “One of Us”, he emphasizes in the letter.
The Macanese leader understands that “it will never be healthy to concentrate all the centers of political power in the same ideological field, given that in a democratic society, such as the one that exists in Portugal, where the system in force is semi-presidential, there must necessarily be a balance of forces and the existence of good checks and balances, under penalty of slipping into an autocratic society”. He concludes by stressing that Portuguese residents in Macau and Hong Kong “should not fail to exercise their right to vote”.
JTM also tried to speak to Jorge Neto Valente, but without success until the end of this edition.
Regarding possible representatives of other candidates in Macau, we were only able to ascertain that António Bessa Almeida will assume the role of campaign director for Luís Marques Mendes, who is supported by the PSD and CDS. Contacted by TRIBUNA DE MACAU newspaper, the local PSD member said he did not intend to make any statements at this time. Regarding the representative, “he has yet to be appointed”, he indicated.
Furthermore, until the end of this edition, it was not possible to know the names of the representatives or campaign directors in Macau of the other candidates for the elections scheduled for January 18th.
In Portugal, the campaign for the presidential election officially kicked off yesterday, with a record 11 candidates, seven of which were supported by political parties. In addition to Seguro and Mendes, Henrique Gouveia e Melo, António Filipe (supported by the PCP), Catarina Martins (Bloco de Esquerda), the painter Humberto Correia, the trade unionist André Pestana, Jorge Pinto (supported by Livre), Cotrim Figueiredo (supported by the Liberal Initiative), André Ventura (supported by Chega) and the musician Manuel João Vieira are running for president.</description><pubDate>2026-01-05 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>US captures Maduro and wants to “govern” Venezuela</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/ultimas/eua-capturam-maduro-querem-governar-venezuela/</link><description>Donald Trump announced that the US will “govern” Venezuela and exploit its oil wealth until there is a “peaceful transition”, following the capture of Nicolás Maduro by American forces on Saturday. Surrounded by FBI agents, the Venezuelan President arrived by plane at a military base on the outskirts of New York – where he faces accusations of drug trafficking and terrorism – hours after being taken in the middle of bombings in Caracas and other parts of the country.

epa12624339 A handout picture made available by the White House Press Office shows US President Donald Trump (R), alongside US Secretary of War Pete Hegseth (L) and CIA Director John Ratcliffe (C), watching ‘Operation Absolute Resolve’, the US raid that captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, USA, 03 January 2026. President Trump previously announced that US forces have successfully captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife during a series of large-scale overnight strikes on Caracas on 03 January 2026. EPA/WHITE HOUSE PRESS OFFICE HANDOUT –BEST QUALITY AVAILABLE– HANDOUT EDITORIAL USE ONLY/NO SALES

“We will govern the country until we can carry out a peaceful, adequate and judicious transition”, said the North American President at a press conference, after publishing a photo of Maduro handcuffed and with his eyes covered by sunglasses on the military ship “USS Iwo Jima”. As he indicated, without giving details, the process will be led by members of his cabinet “in collaboration” with the Venezuelan opposition.
Furthermore, he warned that, if necessary, the US is ready to carry out a new, “much larger” attack to prevent Maduro’s close circle from remaining in power.
On the other hand, he said that the Venezuelan vice-president, Delcy Rodríguez, is “willing” to cooperate with Washington, as he expressed to the head of American diplomacy, Marco Rubio.
“We are willing to have respectful relations”, said the vice-president afterwards, calling for the “immediate release” of Maduro and his wife. Maduro is the “only president” of Venezuela, Rodríguez maintained, guaranteeing that the government is prepared “to defend Venezuela”, where the “state of commotion” was declared.
This exchange of statements raised doubts about the future role of Venezuelan opponents, who faced harsh repression during the Maduro government. In fact, Trump removed the opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner, María Corina Machado, from the process that began this Saturday. "It would be very difficult for her to be at the head of the country. She has no support or respect within her country," said Trump, to whom Machado dedicated the Nobel Prize.
Previously, Machado considered that Edmundo González, who accuses Maduro of having stolen the presidency from him in the July 28, 2024 elections, “must immediately assume” power.
In turn, Trump made very clear the objective of encouraging American oil companies to return to Venezuela, to “invest billions of dollars, repair the seriously deteriorated infrastructure” and “start generating money for the country”.
 
Attacks followed as a TV “program”
The UN Security Council will today discuss the American operation, the legality of which is questioned inside and outside the USA.
The air raids, carried out at dawn, lasted more than an hour. Trump told Fox broadcaster that he followed the operation “as if he were watching a television program”, hours after announcing the arrest of Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, who, according to Washington, did not offer resistance.
No Americans died, he added, highlighting that Maduro was in a fortress. He later told the “New York Post” that “many” Cubans who protected him lost their lives. According to the “New York Times”, at least 40 people died during the attacks in Caracas, including members of the Venezuelan Armed Forces and civilians.
After “months of planning and testing”, around 150 aircraft were used, said the Chief of Staff, General Dan Caine. Explosions and overflights shook Caracas at around 2 am local time, at the climax of four months of military pressure against Maduro, 63 years old. The attacks targeted Fuerte Tiuna, Venezuela's largest military complex, and an air base, among other locations, according to AFP.
Trump considered his Venezuelan counterpart, a former bus driver and former trade unionist who came to power in 2013 after the death of President Hugo Chávez, to be illegitimate and was facing fraud charges. In 2020, Maduro was formally accused of drug trafficking by the US, which offered 50 million dollars for his capture.
The US also attacked in the neighboring states of La Guaira, where Caracas airport is located, Miranda and Aragua.
According to the AFP agency, Caracas dawned deserted and with the smell of gunpowder in several areas. To avoid looting, merchants sold through bars. Hooded and heavily armed police officers roamed the city and guarded public buildings, while around 500 people expressed support for Maduro in front of the Miraflores Palace.
The bombings occurred after a series of American attacks on speedboats allegedly transporting drugs in the Caribbean, with more than a hundred dead.
Trump took the opportunity to warn the left-wing governments of Colombia and Cuba, close to Maduro. Pressure from Washington also resulted in the closure of Venezuelan airspace, new sanctions against Caracas and the seizure of ships carrying Venezuelan oil.
In several capitals around the world, thousands of Venezuelans expressed joy at the fall of Maduro, although they also expressed doubts and fear. On the other hand, allied countries such as Russia, China, Iran and Cuba rejected the attacks, as did the governments of Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Mexico.
The international community has been divided between condemning the United States and welcoming the fall of Venezuela's leader. UN Secretary-General António Guterres expressed “deep concern” about the recent “escalation of tension in Venezuela”, warning that US military action could have “worrying implications” for the region.
 
China calls for “immediate release” of Venezuelan President
China yesterday asked the US to “guarantee the personal safety of President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, to release them immediately and to cease their efforts to overthrow the Venezuelan Government”. In a statement, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs classified the operation as a “blatant violation of international law” and the “brazen use of force” against a sovereign country. For Beijing, these actions seriously violate international law, infringe on Venezuela's sovereignty and threaten peace and security in Latin America and the Caribbean. China, which maintained a close diplomatic and economic relationship with Venezuela, reiterated its opposition to military interventions and defended the principles of state sovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries.

The five Government Secretaries also assured that they will work to correspond to the messages of support from Xi Jinping and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
 
The traditional New Year's message from the Macao SAR Chief Executive ended up being met with new expressions of support from Beijing, through President Xi Jinping and the Hong Kong and Macau Work Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CCP). In his message to the country, Xi Jinping called for “solid steps” to write a “new chapter” in the history of China’s miracle and, in the case of Hong Kong and Macau, he stressed that the “one country, two systems” policy must be “implemented unswervingly” and that the two regions “must be supported to better integrate into the country’s overall development and maintain long-term prosperity and stability”.
In turn, that PCC office released an article highlighting the “excellent results” achieved by Hong Kong and Macau in 2025 and urging the SARs to “continue to move forward from strength to strength” and to better integrate into the general development of the country. For Sam Hou Fai, this is a “huge compliment” to the development of Hong Kong and Macau, which further illustrates the attention that Xi Jinping has always paid to the two regions.
“The Macao SAR Government will further implement the principle of ‘one country, two systems’ in an unshakable, full and precise manner, actively articulating it with the 15th National Five-Year Plan, as well as adequately preparing the 3rd Five-Year Plan of the Macao SAR, without defrauding the expectations and support of President Xi Jinping and the Central Government”, assured Sam Hou Fai, quoted in an official note, reinforcing the guarantees he had already left in his own New Year message.
The official also highlighted that Xi's expectations present “guidance and confidence aimed at a pragmatic drive for Macau in favor of its current and future development”. In this context, the Macao SAR Government is “committed to its reform, to assuming responsibilities, uniting the different sectors of society, making good use of opportunities, promoting adequate diversification of the economy, improving the well-being of the population”, contributing to the national development situation, he said.
In a retrospective on 2025, Sam Hou Fai once again made a very positive assessment, speaking of an “extraordinary year for the development of the Macao SAR”, convinced that “we have strengthened our resilience in facing challenges, accumulating strength through unwavering dedication and joint commitment”. Looking ahead to 2026, he reiterated that “we will strengthen the national security barrier, consolidate the foundations of patriotism and love for Macau and guarantee general social harmony and stability”, without losing sight of the improvement of the “structure with a predominance of executive power”, the deepening of public administration reforms and the development of the Deep Cooperation Zone, among other strategic lines.
Xi Jinping's message and the article from the Hong Kong and Macau Works Office of the CPC Central Committee were also widely praised by the five Secretaries of the Macao SAR Government, the president of the Legislative Assembly and other holders of the main public positions. In general, everyone saw Beijing's support as another sign of confidence and encouragement and promised to work to meet Xi's expectations, within the scope of their respective competencies.
 
All employees have already sworn loyalty
All public servants, including those of Portuguese nationality, have already taken the oath of loyalty to China and the territory, revealed the Chief Executive. In a statement released by the Social Communication Office, Sam Hou Fai highlighted that the administration “has finalized the oath process for all current and newly entered public service workers”. The oath is part of a review of the statutes of management and leadership staff and public administration workers, which came into force on 1 November. The two revised laws gave workers already in office 90 days to take the oath, with refusal automatically implying the annulment of the appointment to the position or dismissal. On November 1st, 264 directors of public entities and services took an oath in a ceremony, declaring that they will defend and enforce the Basic Law, as well as dedicate themselves “with all loyalty” to the Macao SAR.</description><pubDate>2026-01-05 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>CCAC wants to promote “honest business culture”</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/ccac-quer-promover-cultura-empresarial-honesta/</link><description>The review of the anti-corruption law in the private sector, which should guarantee fair access to the labor market, and the promotion of an “honest business culture” were priorities outlined by the Commissariat Against Corruption (CCAC).
This year, the CCAC will begin “promoting studies around the 2009 law on the prevention and repression of corruption in the private sector”, to respond, “in a pragmatic way, to society's requests on fair employment”, reads a note from Commissioner Ao Ieong Seong's office.
The CCAC wants to ensure that “the rights and interests of residents in accessing employment are not harmed by acts of corruption”.
In a reaction to Chinese President Xi Jinping's New Year's message, the commissioner also noted the importance of “proceeding, in a timely manner, to the investigation and treatment of various types of commercial infractions”, in addition to promoting the “consolidation of an honest business culture and fair competition”.
Ao Ieong Seong had already indicated, in December, on the sidelines of the celebrations of the 26th anniversary of the Macao SAR that the law in question, in force for more than 15 years, is out of step with international conventions. “Recently, the CCAC managed to uncover several cases of corruption in the private sector, society has been paying attention”, he said at the time.
In his New Year's message, Xi Jinping highlighted the importance of "unswervingly implementing the 'one country, two systems' policy and supporting Hong Kong and Macau to better integrate into the overall development" of China, maintaining "long-term prosperity and stability."
In addition to Xi's message, the head of the anti-corruption authority also cited an article published by the Hong Kong and Macau Work Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, which highlights “the success” of the elections for the 8th Legislative Assembly (LA) of the Macao SAR. Ao Ieong Seong noted that the CCAC and the Government services “cooperated committedly” so that the elections took place “fairly, impartially and with integrity, contributing to the reinforcement of the principle of ‘Macau governed by patriots’ and the effective implementation of the principle of ‘one country, two systems’”.
Two months before the legislative elections, the State Security Defense Commission excluded 12 candidates from two lists competing for the AL, considering them “not defenders of the Basic Law or not faithful” to the Macao SAR. One of them was the list of former deputy Ron Lam U Tou, one of the most critical voices of the Government in the AL.

CATARINA DOMINGUES*
Hundreds of people said goodbye early on Wednesday to Landmark, the last 'satellite casino' in Macau to close its doors and a chapter in the history of gambling in the territory.
Samuel Lei and the Landmark casino are portraits of an era about to disappear. Lei is the image of a generation that, at the beginning of the century, transitioned from secondary school to work as a 'croupier' in the Macau casinos that emerged after the liberalization of gambling.
Landmark, then called Pharaoh’s Palace, was the first ‘satellite casino’ in the territory, a management model adopted by Stanley Ho Hung-sun (1921-2020) – who held the gambling monopoly until 2002 – to face competition.
Landmark, under the supervision of the Macau Gaming Society (SJM), was also the last to close its doors, after the new law that regulates gambling, approved in 2022, established December 31st as the deadline for ending the activity of these 'satellites'.
It's 10pm on Tuesday. Samuel, accompanied by three former colleagues, pays a final tribute to the place where he worked between 2003 and 2006. He started by earning 11 thousand patacas.
"At the time, the average salary in Macau was five or six thousand patacas and if you graduated from university you would earn maybe eight thousand. It was an attraction for teenagers", he tells Lusa.
Two decades later, notes Samuel, the option of playing at the gaming table to the detriment of entering higher education is less prominent, with a meager increase in the salaries of ‘croupiers’, which “are around 18 thousand patacas”.
Samuel and his friends are on the third floor of the casino, where the only room in Pharaoh’s Palace once operated. Facing the four figures, a giant sphinx, a representation of the Egyptian footprint designed by local businessman David Chow Kam Fai – “the first themed casino in Macau”, reads the project page.
In the cloakroom, nothing is left. With no more suitcases or coats to look after, Yu, one of the more than a thousand employees at the space, counts the minutes to “this important moment”. “I want to go down there, I would like to film”, notes the employee, who will be transferred to the Lisbon casino, owned by SJM. The company, which this year alone closed eight 'satellite casinos', committed to ensuring workers' jobs.
At 10:30 pm, there is only activity on the ground floor. In one of the wings, employees, wearing a red vest, count chips from a table for the 'big and small' dice game, which has just been vacated.
More than a hundred people lean over six baccarat tables, the game that generates the most money in local casinos. Bet until the last minute. The Egyptian civilization, printed on the walls of this hall, and employees from the Macau Government's Gaming Inspection and Coordination Department, bear witness to the moment.
“I came on purpose to watch the closing,” says Xiao Xiao, from Hubei province, central China. “So many people from Hubei are here”, he adds.
At an opposite table, Gaia, from Macau, plays for symbolism. In his hand he holds a token worth 500 Hong Kong dollars. “My mother has worked here for over 20 years, it’s a very special moment,” he says.
‘Satellite casinos’ appeared in Macau at the turn of the century as a consequence of the liberalization of gambling, although they were based on a model that existed during the Portuguese administration: private casinos, but managed by Stanley Ho’s company. According to this model, known as “4+4+2”, 40% of the revenues went to the Government, 40% to Ho and 20% to the owners, gaming expert Ben Lee explains to Lusa.
With the liberalization of the sector, notes Lee, a new arrangement evolved, maintaining 40% from the Government, “around 4% to 5% – pure franchise fee – for SJM” and the rest for the owners, with full management being given to them.
"The expansion of 'satellite casinos' was also one of Stanley Ho's strategies to counter the entry of new large casino resorts. The old saying: quantity has its own quality, and for some time they were very effective", further analyzes the founder of gaming consultancy IGamix.
After the transfer of Macau, notes the expert, Ho “found a gap that allowed the proliferation” of these casinos. “And the Government, somehow, accepted this as a ‘fait accompli’, without really investigating the legality,” he added.
Lee, who managed the Diamond satellite casino at the Holiday Inn hotel, recalls how Beijing was taken “by surprise” with the distribution of gaming licenses. In 2002, contracts were signed between the Government of Macau, SJM, Galaxy Casino and Wynn Resorts Macau for the award of three concessions.
At the end of that year, an amendment was made to the Galaxy Casino concession contract, which allowed Las Vegas Sands to enter the game, through a subconcession. SJM and Wynn also signed subconcession contracts, with MGM and Melco Resorts, respectively.
About a decade ago, Lee adds, “it started to be said” that representatives from Beijing were in contact with people linked to the sector. "And the questions they asked: How did three concessions become six? And how did three North American operators end up controlling 50% of the concessions and sub-concessions, when initially there was only talk of one? And the satellite casinos appeared without prior notice. (…) And then, I think the message became very clear: 'clean everything up'", he explains.
At 23:35, the order was given to leave. Outside, more than two hundred people wait for the countdown, until, at 11:59 pm, the curtain, placed there to cover the name of the casino, blocks and threatens to fall. Only two men perched on a lifting platform can complete the ultimate task. And Egypt finally breathes its last in Macau.

Non-gaming tourism revenues increased by just 1.1%, reflecting the impact of the decline in retail trade, according to data from the Tourism Satellite Account. The gross value added of tourist activities in the economy was estimated at 50.9%
 
Tourist revenue in the Macao SAR reached 293.82 billion patacas in 2024, representing an annual increase of 13.3% and corresponding to 88.8% of the amount recorded in 2019, according to data from the Tourism Satellite Account (CST) released by the Statistics and Census Services Directorate (DSEC). The total value includes visitors' consumption expenses and the cost of cross-border transport.
Official data show that the signs of reduced economic dependence on gambling, evidenced in 2023, ended up disappearing in the following year. The weight of tourist revenue from gambling rose from 56.5% in 2023 to 61.2% in 2024, while that of non-gaming branches fell from 43.5% to 38.8%.
According to DSEC, the total value of exports of gaming services, which measures gaming tourism revenues, increased by 22.7% to 179.84 billion patacas, in the space of one year, equivalent to 75.8% of the 2019 level. In turn, non-gaming tourism revenues grew only 1.1% to 113.99 billion, representing, on the other hand, an increase of 21.8% compared to to the pre-pandemic year.
The volume of non-gaming tourist revenue was affected by the 12.0% annual drop in retail services (58.69 billion). Conversely, the highlights were increases of 27.0% in food (23.80 billion), 13.4% in accommodation (21.18 billion), 10.3% in passenger transport (6.96 billion), 39.6% in culture and entertainment (2.21 billion) and 58.6% in travel agencies (1.14 billion).
After deducting the cost of goods to reflect the real value corresponding to the services provided by retailers to visitors, tourist consumption amounted to 258.20 billion patacas in 2024, an increase of 17.6% in annual variation.
CST also evaluates the tourist offer, which can be measured through the value of the global production of goods and services. In 2024, the value of the supply of tourist goods and services totaled 284.30 billion, marking an annual increase of 14.6%.
On the other hand, the tourist ratio (proportion of demand in relation to supply of goods and services) increased by 2.3 percentage points to 90.8%, between 2023 and 2024. The ratios of gaming services (97.8%) and non-gaming tourist goods and services (78.1%) increased by 0.2 and 3.7 percentage points, respectively.
 
Tourism's contribution to the economy rose 18%
In the year under review, the direct gross value added of tourism (VABDGT) to the Macau economy grew again. In general, VABDGT was estimated at 195.69 billion patacas, an increase of 18.0% year-on-year, representing 50.9% of the gross value added of all economic sectors.
In the case of gaming, VABDGT grew 22.7% compared to 2023, equivalent to 81.6% of the total, while that of non-gaming sectors increased 0.7%.
In accordance with the recommendations of the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) on the compilation of the CST and based on the characteristics of the MSAR, DSEC selected seven categories of tourism goods and services to evaluate their respective direct economic contribution to Macau: gaming; retail trade; food; accommodation; passenger transport; culture and entertainment; and travel agencies. It also estimated the direct contribution of visitors' tourist consumption of goods and services to the local economy, through the accounting framework recommended by the WTO.

This is the conclusion of a review study on the matter, which states that, in general, the current system has worked well and that society agrees with the concept of the mandatory central pension scheme.
 
VÍTOR REBELO
 
The Social Security Fund (FSS) published the report of the “Study on the review of the current situation of the Non-Mandatory Central Pension Scheme and its development”, indicating that Macau's economy recovered “in an orderly manner”, although the pace of recovery in each sector is different.
The research, commissioned by the Department of Public and Government Administration of the Faculty of Social Sciences of the University of Macau and the Center for Studies on the Greater Bay Area of the same institution, states that Macau's real Gross Domestic Product for the third quarter of 2024 reached 86.3% of the level of the year 2019. “The recovery of sectors related to large-scale integrated leisure activity is relatively better, while the recovery of others is unbalanced”, says the published report by the FSS.
Furthermore, “micro, small and medium-sized companies find themselves in a relatively uncertain situation, therefore, it is more appropriate to maintain, for the time being, the non-mandatory central pension regime”, points out the document.
As a result of the interviews carried out, society in general expressed a positive attitude towards the implementation of the mandatory central pension scheme, agreeing with the idea that contribution plans can offer better retirement protection and expressing satisfaction with the electronic services relating to the central pension scheme. However, it is necessary to “prudently assess the moment at which the regime becomes mandatory”.
The report notes that “there are voices that are concerned about the risks and returns of investment products, considering that they can increase the flexibility of the scheme, introduce more investment options, strengthen electronic services and create, as quickly as possible, full-function electronic services of the central pension scheme, in order to contribute to its mandatory implementation”.
After comprehensive consideration of the results of the consultation, as well as the estimates and analyses, the study team presented the necessary assumptions for starting the mandatory regime, in order to, under the principle of “gathering consensus and gradually implementing it”, promote the work related to the transition from the non-mandatory central pension regime to a mandatory regime.
Taking into account that the recovery steps of the different sectors are different, that is, there is still inequality in this field, the balance of the study considers that, for now, it is appropriate to continue maintaining non-mandatory participation. It suggests, even so, the creation of conditions for the indicators, in accordance with the real situation of Macau's social and economic development, orderly promoting the work related to the mandatory implementation of the central pension scheme.
It also proposes that some of these conditions include maintaining the participation rate of local residents in the professional retirement guarantee plan at around 50%, and achieving high electronization of central pension scheme services.
On the other hand, it points out that the Government must carry out mandatory implementation in a phased manner, in accordance with the principle “first the easiest and then the most difficult”.
The “Review Report” indicates that since the implementation of the non-mandatory central pension scheme in 2018, the number of participants has continuously increased, electronic services have become increasingly convenient, and the scheme has had preliminary effects.
According to estimates, contributions to the mandatory central pension scheme “should not cause too much pressure on employers”, and workers can obtain better protection in retirement through continuous payment of contributions in the long term.
The FSS highlighted that it takes the suggestions presented in the report as “one of the references for the continuous improvement and optimization of the regime in the future”, and at the same time, “closely observes changes in the economic situation”, such as the business environment and the income level of Macau workers.
The intention is to “launch more policies and measures in a timely manner, continually optimizing electronic services and encouraging sectors to increase investment options, among others”.
With a view to deepening society's knowledge of the scheme, the FSS has carried out several visits to different companies, associations and institutions, presenting the benefits and content of the scheme to employers, workers and residents. Until October 2024, around 520 information sessions were held, with the participation of around 22,000 people.</description><pubDate>2026-01-05 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Number of births was the lowest since 1978</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/numero-de-nascimentos-foi-mais-baixo-desde-1978/</link><description>The birth crisis in the Macao SAR worsened in 2025, with the number of births falling by a fifth in annual terms and reaching the lowest level in the last 47 years, according to data provided by the deputy director of the public hospital, Tai Wa Hou. The Health Services have already extended free non-invasive prenatal testing to all pregnant residents
 
Last year Macau recorded the lowest number of births in almost half a century. According to preliminary data, 2,871 newborns were registered, said the deputy director of Centro Hospitalar Conde de São Januário, Tai Wa Hou, quoted by TDM's Chinese channel, on the sidelines of visits to the first babies born in 2026 at the public hospital and at Kiang Wu, both male.
This number represents a drop of 20.4% compared to the 3,607 born in 2024, and falls far short of the authorities' expectations. In January 2025, the deputy director of Health Services (SSM), Kuok Cheong U, had predicted fewer than 3,500 births during that year, a number that would already be the lowest since 2004.
The number revealed by Tai Wa Hou means that 2025 was the least fertile year since 1978, when the city registered 2,407 newborns. However, while in 1978 Macau had less than 249 thousand inhabitants, at the end of September 2025 it already had a population of almost 687 thousand.
The number of births thus fell for the sixth consecutive year and is increasingly far from the historic maximum of 7,913 set in 1988, which was a Lunar Year of the Dragon. Considered a symbol of royalty, fortune and power and the only mythical figure among the 12 signs of the ancient Chinese zodiac, the Dragon has a set of characteristics that traditionally leads couples to plan to have children during this period.
Macau recorded just 0.58 births per woman in 2024, far from the value needed to replace generations (2.1), the lowest fertility rate ever in the region and the lowest in the world, according to official data. This value is even lower than the estimate made in a report released in July by the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA): 0.68 births per woman.
Although more optimistic, the UNDESA estimate already indicated that Macau will have the lowest birth rate in the world in 2024, a long way from the second jurisdiction on the list, Singapore, with 0.95 births per woman.
The Macao SAR Chief Executive admitted that it was necessary to “create conditions in terms of education and employment” to increase the low birth rate, which he pointed out as one of the city’s biggest challenges in the long term. At the beginning of July, the Legislative Assembly approved a budget review to reinforce social support, including the creation of a subsidy, worth a total of MOP54,000, for children up to three years old.
During the election campaign, Sam Hou Fai also promised to study the extension of maternity leave, currently set at 70 days, and the creation of a mandatory central provident fund.
 
Free prenatal testing for all pregnant residents
In the presentation of the Government Action Lines for 2026, the leader of the Macao SAR also announced the expansion of free access to non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT), extending it to pregnant residents of all age groups, instead of just those aged 35 or over. According to the SSM, this measure was already implemented on the first day of this year to “further promote measures to promote births and favor child development, pursuing the principle of ‘effective treatment that prioritizes prevention’”.
These services will be made available through the existing prenatal healthcare network in Macau, that is, at Health Centers, Centro Hospitalar Conde de São Januário or Kiang Wu Hospital.
According to the SSM, the NIPT test is a non-invasive chromosomal screening tool that requires only a blood sample from the pregnant woman to identify fetal deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), as well as accurately detect whether the fetus has certain chromosomal abnormalities, such as Down, Edwards or Patau syndromes. “Compared to traditional invasive diagnostic methods, such as amniocentesis, this test has the advantages of high precision, safety and no risk of miscarriage”, guarantees the organization.

The Macau Athletics Association arranged the fourth round of the long-distance championship to coincide with the traditional São Silvestre race, held on the last day of the year. More than 650 athletes, distributed across various categories, with emphasis on the Open class, men and women, ended 2025 running, in a race that started and finished next to the East Asian Games Sports Hall (Macau Dome).
On the 8.4 km course, the fastest in the men's sector of the main category, Open, was Wong Chin Wa, with a time of 28 minutes and 47 seconds, ahead of Nepal's Gurung Lil Bahadur (29.09). In the women's sector, the victory belonged to Chao Kin I, with a mark of 33.56. Hoi long finished in second place (34.40) overall.
Regarding the senior categories, João Telo Mexia was eighth in the age group over 55. He told the newspaper TRIBUNA DE MACAU that participating in São Silvestre is “a ritual of renewal and a unique way of celebrating the sporting identity of the city of Macau”, constituting the “last breath” before the New Year celebration.
It is a proof “of resilience and tradition that deserves to be preserved for those looking to enter the new year with energy, health and optimism for future competitions”, highlighted João Telo Mexia.
Running through the streets of COTAI in December “offers a distinct atmosphere and creates a sense of community, allowing you to meet friends again”, added the Portuguese, who plans to be present this year at the Boston and London marathons.
Another Portuguese participant, Sérgio Real, was part of the under 44 age group, where he was 15th. “São Silvestre has become an unmissable social event for those who stay in Macau these days”, he stressed, highlighting that this is a race with a special character “because it takes place at night” and ends up being much less competitive than the other three in the championship. Therefore, he states, “the joy here is participating in this party and meeting friends”.
The athlete, who will run in the Hong Kong 100 km this January, admitted that the route between Wynn Palace and MGM “made the experience even more interesting and visually striking”.</description><pubDate>2026-01-05 00:00:00</pubDate></item><item><title>High temperatures will be “increasingly frequent” in the Macao SAR</title><link>https://jtm.com.mo/local/altas-temperaturas-serao-cada-vez-mais-frequentes-na-raem/</link><description>With the average temperature reaching 23.2ºC, 2025 will have been the fifth hottest year since 1952 in Macau, according to preliminary data from the Meteorological and Geophysical Services, which point to 37 hot days and 27 cold days. Taking into account the increase in hot days and the decrease in cold days, given the average climate values ​​of 30 years, the organization predicts that “high temperature events in Macau will become increasingly frequent”, in line with global warming
 
Weather conditions in Macau once again revealed a general warming trend in 2025, informed the Meteorological and Geophysical Services (SMG) based on preliminary data collected at Taipa Grande Station until 29 December. The average annual temperature was “relatively high” reaching 23.2ºC, slightly below the 23.3ºC recorded in 2024, but 0.4 degrees above the average climate values, which cover a period of three decades, between 1991 and 2020.
According to the SMG, it is “probable” that 2025 will have been the fifth hottest year since 1952 in the territory. The annual record dates back to 2019, with 23.6ºC.
Macau experienced 37 “hot” days last year, 5.7 days more than the climate average (31.3), and 11 “hot” nights, a number similar to the average values ​​(11.5). Days and nights are classified as “hot” when the minimum temperature equals or exceeds 33ºC and 28ºC at the main meteorological station, respectively.
On the other hand, there were 27 days of “cold” weather, a decrease of 12.1 in relation to the average values ​​(39.1 days). Days are considered “cold” when the minimum temperature is equal to or lower than 12ºC in the main meteorological station.
In 2024, the SMG had recorded 32 “hot” days, 15 “hot” nights and 26 “cold” days.
“The increase in the number of hot days in Macau clearly contrasts with the decrease in cold days, reflecting that, in the context of global warming, high temperature events in Macau will become increasingly frequent”, anticipates the organization, in a summary of the weather in 2025 published on its website.
The minimum temperature was recorded on January 27th, with 9.4ºC, and the maximum on July 5th, with 35.3ºC. In the general calculation of 2024, thermometers had fluctuated between 6.4ºC (22 December) and 36.6ºC (15 July).
Total annual precipitation was 1891.0 millimeters in 2025, a value considered “normal”, with August 14th being the rainiest day (265.4 millimeters). In total, the Macao SAR faced 139 days of rain.
Total insolation encompassed 2551.4 hours, being “relatively high” compared to the climate average. Evaporation was “normal”, resulting in a total of 861.3 millimeters.
Although rainfall was normal in 2025, extreme precipitation occurred frequently. The intense rain signal was issued 37 times, “black” on two occasions and “red” on four occasions.
It was the second year with the highest number of signs of intense rain since the current system came into force, only surpassed by the records of 2021. During the period in which the “black” intense rain signal was in force, on August 14, the maximum hourly rainfall reached 110.0 millimeters at the Ká-Hó Meteorological Station, causing serious flooding in COTAI. The water level monitoring station on Caminho das Hortas recorded a maximum flood level of 0.92 meters.
In general, 2025 was “a year marked by extreme phenomena, setting several records”, emphasize the SMG, remembering that Macau faced 14 tropical storms, the highest number since records began in 1968, beating the record set in 1974, with 12. For the first time, tropical storm signal No. 10 was raised twice in the same year, due to the passage of Typhoon “Wipha” and Super Typhoon “Ragasa.” At the same time, signal No. 10 motivated by “Ragasa”, which passed 90 km from Macau, was in effect for a record period of 10 hours and 30 minutes.
Last year also equaled 1993, 2008 and 2022 as having the highest number of No. 8 signals, issued due to typhoon “Wipha”, severe tropical cyclone “Tapah”, super typhoon “Ragasa” and typhoon “Matmo”.
Typhoon “Ragasa” caused the tide to reach 4.67 meters, causing severe flooding in the territory. In some areas of Porto Interior, the maximum flood height reached 1.51 meters, the fourth highest level since 1967.
In a global analysis, the SMG highlight that meteorological disasters, such as extreme heat waves, floods and tropical cyclones are “causing serious loss of life and economic damage throughout the world”. The continuous increase in global temperatures, the heat in the oceans, the rise in sea levels and the accelerated melting of glaciers “are further amplifying the risk of meteorological disasters”, they warn, ensuring that, as part of the implementation of the United Nations “Early Warning for All” initiative, they have been promoting the development of meteorological technologies, adopting artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to improve the ability to predict extreme meteorological phenomena.

Crouched among mountains of discarded plastic, Lanh removes the labels from bottles of Coca-Cola, Evian and local Vietnamese teas so they can be melted down and turned into small granules for reuse. More rubbish arrives daily, piling up like multicolored snowdrifts along the roads and rivers of Xa Cau, one of hundreds of “artisanal” recycling villages surrounding Hanoi, Vietnam’s capital, where trash is sorted, shredded and melted.
 
The villages present a paradox: they allow the reuse of part of the 1.8 million tons of plastic waste that Vietnam produces annually and enable workers to obtain much-needed wages. But recycling is carried out with little regulation, pollutes the environment and threatens the health of those involved, workers and experts told AFP.
"This work is extremely dirty. The environmental pollution is really serious," said Lanh, 64, asking to be identified only by her first name for fear of losing her job.
It's a dilemma faced by many fast-growing economies, where the use and disposal of plastic has outpaced the government's ability to collect, separate and recycle. Even in rich countries, recycling rates are often very low because reusing plastic products can be expensive and sorting rates are low.
However, the rudimentary methods used in Vietnam's artisanal villages produce dangerous emissions and expose workers to toxic chemicals, experts warn.
“Air pollution control is zero at these facilities,” said Hoang Thanh Vinh, an analyst at the United Nations Development Program focusing on waste recycling. Untreated sewage is often dumped directly into waterways, he added.
The true scale of the problem is difficult to assess, and there are few comprehensive studies.
In the village of Minh Khai, according to Vinh, a sediment analysis detected “very high lead contamination and the presence of dioxins”, as well as furan – all associated with cancer. In 2008, it was found that the life expectancy of village residents was a decade lower than the national average, according to the Ministry of the Environment.
Local authorities and the ministry did not respond to AFP's requests for comment.
Lanha believes that the toxic waste in Xa Cau caused her husband's blood cancer, but she still spends her days sorting the waste to pay for her medical expenses. “This village is full of cancer cases, people just waiting to die,” she said.
There is no data on cancer rates in villages, but AFP spoke to more than half a dozen workers in Xa Cau and Minh Khai who reported cases of colleagues or family members with cancer.
Vietnam Zero Waste Alliance coordinator Xuan Quach said continued exposure to the “toxic environment” makes it inevitable that residents will face “health risks that are obviously greater.”
A 60-year-old resident known as Dat has been sorting plastic in Xa Cau for a decade and said the work “definitely affects health”. “There is no shortage of cancer cases in this village”, he points out.
But there is also no shortage of workers, eager for the economic lifeline that recycling provides.
In Xa Cau, plastic accumulates around multi-story houses, some with ornate facades indicating the years in which they were built.
“We became rich thanks to this business,” said Nguyen Thi Tuyen, 58, who lives in a two-story house. "Now all the houses are made of brick. In the past we were just an agricultural village."
Most of the trash residents recycle is locally produced, researchers and residents say.
Although Vietnam only recycles about a third of its own plastic waste, it imports thousands of tons annually from Europe, the US and Asia. Imports soared after China stopped accepting plastic waste in 2018, although Vietnam recently tightened regulations and announced plans to phase out imports as well.
For now, trade statistics from the USA and the European Union show that shipments to Vietnam from these two economies will reach more than 200 thousand tons in 2024.
In Minh Khai, the owner of a plastic granule factory said domestic supply was “not enough”. “I need to import from abroad,” explained Dinh, 23, amid the hum of heavy machinery.
Most household waste is not separated and cannot be easily reused.
There have been efforts to improve the sector, including banning the burning of non-recyclable waste and building modern facilities. But burning continues and unusable waste is often discarded on vacant land, Vinh said, arguing that the government should help recycling companies move to industrial parks with better environmental protection measures, formalizing a sector that processes a quarter of the country's recycling.
“The current method of recycling in recycling villages… is not good for the environment.”
