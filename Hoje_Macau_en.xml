The High employee corruption investigation office (CIO) has announced that it has transferred the case to the prosecutor, which has the power to formally accuse a South Korean head of state.
Cio considers that Yoon conspired with then-National Defense Minister Kim Yong-Hyun and other military officers to start a riot, declaring martial law on the night of December 3. It argues, moreover, that Yoon has abused power by sending troops to the National Assembly (Parliament) to prevent deputies from revoking martial law.
The Public Prosecution Service now has 11 days to decide whether or not to start the requested process. If Yoon is considered guilty of leading an insurrection, a crime for which a president has no immunity in the country, he may be sentenced to life imprisonment or the death penalty.
Yoon is in custody at the Seoul Detention Center in Uiwang, south of Seoul, since January 15. The Constitutional Court is simultaneously made a judgment to determine whether or not to ratify the dismissal approved by parliamentarians on December 14.
If the highest court in South Korea confirms the impeachment, early presidential elections have to be called within 60 days after the court decision. Yoon refuses to witness in the investigation into the alleged crime of rebellion.
Yoon Suk-Youol surprised the country on December 3 by declaring martial law, a measure reminiscent of black days of the South Korean military dictatorship and that justified with the intention of protecting the country from “North Korean Communist forces” and “Eliminate elements hostile to the state”.
Pressured by the deputies and thousands of protesters, Yoon was forced to revoke the decision hours later.</description><pubDate>2025-01-24 02:30:38</pubDate></item><item><title>Contests | Deputies discussed “competitive negotiation”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/24/concursos-deputados-discutiram-negociacao-competitiva/</link><description>The possibility of representatives of the Public Administration to negotiate directly the proposals of public tenders with the candidates was discussed yesterday in the 1st Permanent Commission of the Legislative Assembly.

The recovery of real estate and consumer confidence levels in the interior of China will be determining factors
 
Casinos' revenues can grow up to 7 percent in the lunar year of the serpent, depending on the recovery of the Chinese real estate and confidence, but they will be away from the pre-pound peak, analysts told Lusa.
"The biggest positive factor for Macao would be if the Chinese economy grew and consumer confidence levels improve," said Vitaly Umnsky, analyst at the Seaport Research Partners consultancy company.
More than 70 percent of the people who visited the territory in 2024 came from mainland China, whose economic growth reached in 2024 the goal of 5 percent fixed by Beijing.
But Nicholas Chenist, Creditsights analyst, said the company of the Financial Notation Agency group Fitch expects a 4.7 percent slowdown this year, in part due to weak private consumption.
The consumer confidence index in China fell in September to the lowest level of the last 34 years, stressed Jeffrey Kiang, analyst at Consultant CLSA. That is, "if the prospects for Chinese consumers are not good, they will be able to tighten their belt, reduce travel and consumption," including Macao, Nicholas Chen explained.
 
Stimulus policies
The Chinese Communist Party has launched a series of stimulus measures, including the reduction of interest rates and mandatory bank reserves and the anticipation of thousands of millions of its budget in 2025 to fund construction projects.
Beijing also widened a consumer goods exchange system and increased the salaries of millions of civil servants to revive internal demand. "The [Chinese] government has said it will launch more measures to stimulate the economy," said Vitaly Umansky, who expects mainly a recovery of the middle class confidence: "I think it will happen, it's just a matter of time."
Creditsights expects Chinese consumer confidence to rise in the second half of 2025, along with real estate price stabilization, which have been falling for 19 consecutive months.
The issue concerns a lot of Beijing, due to the implications for social stability, since housing is one of the main investment vehicles of families and the real estate sector - adding indirect factors - represents about 30 percent of the Chinese economy.
"There will certainly be some side effect, because part of the measures that are adopted to boost domestic consumption may flow to the Macao game sector," said Nicholas Chen.
The analyst believes that China will still widen the list of cities whose residents can ask for 'individual visas' to visit Hong Kong and Macau, a method used by 35.2 percent of tourists who passed by Macao in 2024.
 
Different views
Vitaly Umansky has no opinion and recalls that since January 1 residents of the neighboring city of Zhuhai can visit Macau once a week and stay up to seven days.
On the other hand, analysts agree that casino revenues will be next year away from the maximum historical 303 billion patacas recorded in 2018.
"One thing is clear: the government aims to moderately growth in revenues in the future," said Jeffrey Kiang, recalling authorities predict gaming revenues of 240 billion in 2025, which would be a 5.8 percent increase. .
“When the Macao government publishes a forecast, it is usually very conservative and is based on a prior discussion with the Chinese central government's connection case in the city, Vitaly Umnsky said.
The analyst does not believe that Beijing has some measure to control the resuming of casinos, similar to the campaign that began with the arrest of the leader of the world's largest VIP betting company in November 2021.
Former Suncity Executive Director Alvin Chau Cheok wa, was convicted in January 2023 to 18 years in prison for illicit exploitation of play and secret society, in a case that dropped from 85 to 18 the number of licenses for game promoters, known as 'junkets'. “Much of the reprehensible behavior in Macau has disappeared with the junkets. As long as things like that don't happen again, I don't expect any kind of short -term campaign, ”said Umansky.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Traffic | Lawyer appeals to the end of “moral judgments” with images</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/27/transito-advogado-apela-ao-fim-de-julgamentos-morais-com-imagens/</link><description>The causal Luís Ho Ka considers that the use of traffic chambers can lead to cases in court, and that the images captured must be sent to the authorities, rather than shared on social networks
 
Lawyer Luís Ho Ka has defends the use of traffic surveillance chambers by drivers, but appeals to the government to take steps to avoid the use of images for “moral judgments”. The opinion of the causal was shared to the newspaper or Mun, following an incident at the head of the Portuguese School of Macao, in which images of a lawyer of Portuguese nationality were shared.
Heard by the newspaper or Mun, the lawyer considered that recording videos by chambers installed on vehicles may be important, namely when there are accidents and the need to activate the automobile insurance. However, Ho Ka has pointed out that the vehicle cameras cannot be transformed into a mobile surveillance system used to make “moral judgments” on social networks.
Ho also explained that the images captured by the vehicles must be delivered to the authorities, instead of being published online, and that those responsible for recording should only refer them to the authorities, following the legal proceedings provided. If the images have public interest, they can be used. However, if the use of images exceeds the scope of the process and investigations of the authorities, as is the case with publications on social networks, and if there are elements that can be considered as insulting or defamatory, then the person responsible for capturing and disclosure may face Criminal liability.
 
Legal problems
Luís Ho Ka Hou also indicated that, according to the judicial perspective, the appropriate use of recorded images in traffic is captured the accidents, to hold it and cooperate with the authorities, in case it is necessary to collect evidence.
If there is no consent of the recorded people, and if the content is published on social networks for moral judgments, then we are facing cases that are hardly under the appropriate recording, which may lead to violation of the law of personal data protection or other image rights.
Ho ka has also warned that “judgments” on social networks can cause damage to the rights to privacy and the good name of the parties involved.
About two weeks ago a driver was captured in traffic, after passing a red light, parking in a forbidden place and making an obscene gesture with children. The images, which allowed the driver to identify, were shared online, which held a campaign against the visa, including with dismissal requests from the employer, as well as several hate comments with xenophobic expressions.</description><pubDate>2025-01-27 10:51:34</pubDate></item><item><title>Portugal | Rocha Vieira “decisive” for democracy</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/27/portugal-rocha-vieira-decisivo-para-a-democracia/</link><description>The Assembly of the Republic unanimously approved a vote of regret proposed by José Pedro Aguiar-Branco, in which Rocha Vieira is considered a relevant personality in the construction of Portuguese democracy

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said yesterday at a press conference that Beijing is “deeply shocked” with the attack. "China is against all forms of terrorism," said the spokesman, appealing to the "repression of the Islamic State and other terrorist organizations listed by the UN Security Council."
"China will continue to pay close attention to the security situation in Afghanistan and to support Afghan authorities in combating all forms of terrorist violence and maintaining security and stability in the country," Mao added, urging the Afghan government to Take the necessary measures "to ensure the safety of citizens and Chinese organizations in the country."
According to local police, the victim worked in a gold mine in the region, which borders Tajiquistan. A local branch of the Islamic State Islamic Group claimed the authorship of the attack. China is one of the few international actors that has maintained diplomatic relations with Afghanistan since the Taliban reached power in August 2021.
The two countries share a small international border of just 76 kilometers in the eastern part of the so -called Wajan corridor, a remote passage in the Pamir Range.
Chinese companies, with the support of Beijing, have sought to take advantage of opportunities to explore the vast deposits of non -developed resources from Afghanistan, especially Mes Aynak Mine, which is believed to contain the largest copper deposit in the world.</description><pubDate>2025-01-24 02:18:39</pubDate></item><item><title>ICBC | Bank tries to charge Alvin Chau's debt</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/24/icbc-banco-tenta-cobrar-divida-de-alvin-chau/</link><description>The China Industrial and Commercial Bank (ICBC) is executing a housing of businessman Alvin Chau, who is currently detained at Coloane's prison establishment.

Goethe, who has always been in love with Chinese civilization, glossed the old principle of Socrates, Greek, “the more I know, the more I know nothing” and wrote “man only knows when he knows little knows. With knowledge the doubt grows. ” And Confucius 孔夫子, who also knew much of the things of life and his people, said, six centuries before Christ: “If you know yourself, it acts as a man he knows. If you do not know, you recognize that you do not know; This is knowing! ”
The old Chinese, a wisdom based on five thousand years of history and stories are wise. The old Chinese, an intelligence acquired over many and many centuries hard and intensely lived, are intelligent.
Lao Zi, 老子 (600 a.
Under the sky, [1] we all see that the beautiful is beautiful
Because the ugly exists.
We all know that the good is good
because the bad exists.
Coexist being and non-being,
complete the difficult and the easy
the top and bass approach,
the voice and sound are harmonized,
the front and the back followed.
Therefore, the sage advances and does nothing, [2]
teaches without saying anything
And the ten thousand beings develop without ceasing.
He works and has nothing,
He creates and appropriates nothing.
Everything done, everything forgets,
Thus, forever, the work remains. [3]
The amazing Lie Zi 列子 (450 BC-376 A. C.) who, according to Taoist tradition was able to ride winds and clouds, says in his book, chap. II, 11:
“Two boys lived by the sea and loved the seagulls. Every morning they played in the middle of the birds and many other seagulls, to the hundreds, poisted with them. One day the father told them:
‘I know they play with the seagulls. They get some and bring them. I also want to have fun. '
The next day, the boys arrived on the edge of the sea, the seagulls hovered in the air and not left on the beach.
In conclusion, the best of all discourses is the one that does not use words, the perfect action is to act without acting, the wisdom of the wisest of the wise is always unknown ”
Another story of the book of Lie Zi, in Chapter VII, 32:
“A peasant didn't know where his ax was. He then suspected that his neighbor's son had stolen and began to watch the boy carefully. He had exactly the modes of a thief of axes, the words he pronounced sounded the thief with axes, all his behavior and attitudes were those of someone who had stolen an ax.
But suddenly, digging the earth, the peasant found his ax.
The next day the man looked again at the neighbor's son. He then noticed that the modes, words, behavior, and attitudes of the boy were by no means of those of a thief with axes. ”
Chinese wisdom has almost always escaped Western intelligence. West and East hardly interpenetrate, they look at the Sobrency, sometimes with distrust, and above all ignore.
I will mention a curious recent example:
In 1970, in his “final will,” Russian Nikita Kruchtchev wrote, about Mao Zedong: “I was never sure to understand what he meant. He thought at that time that this was related to certain aspects of the Chinese mindset and the way of thinking of the Chinese. Some statements of Mao shocked me for its simplicity, others for its complexity. I never knew safely what Mao's position. It is impossible, with the Chinese, to know in which law. ”
It is true that Russian thinking and Chinese thinking are not understood, always. The Sino-Soviet conflict, which began in the late fifty years, was, beyond political differences, a confrontation of cultures and, strange to appear in two communist countries, a conflict between various, different conceptions of the world.
A few years ago, in Beijing, my friend Li Shunbao, a fellow in Beijing's editions in foreign languages, told me a small dialogue that was locked in 1961, between Kruchtchev and Zhou Enlai, then first- Minister of China. Relations between the two countries were already quite bad and, after a sour discussion of political issues, Kruchtchev decided to be "nice" to Zhou Enlai and said to him:
“Despite the divergences, we have a lot in common. We both believe in Marxism, you are a prime minister, me too, and you and I are responsible for the government of two of the largest nations in the world. But there is a big difference between us, I am a child of peasants and you are a child of mandarins. ”
Zhou Enlai, who, in fact, was not a son but grandson of a mandarin, smiled and replied, “Sorry, this is not a difference, it is another resemblance. It means that we are both traitors. ” “TRAINORS?!… How?…” Asked Kruchtchev. "Well, both traitors because the Lord betrayed the peasants and I betrayed the mandarins."
By the way of politics and politicians, philosopher Han Fezi 韓非子 wrote 240 years before the birth of Christ:
“You can generally expect about ten honest men in each kingdom, which is an excellent average. But the state must count a hundred positions. Hence there is more official than good men to occupy them, which gives ten honest men and ninety rascals to fill all these places. It can therefore be betting that the result will be widespread disorder, more than an organized government. This is why the sensible sovereign believes in a system and not in individual abilities, has faith in a method and suspects personal probity. ”
Han Fezi was the greatest theorist of the Fa Jia 法 家 法 家, known in the West as the legislation. He would die poisoned in a prison, perhaps because he forgot one of the exemplary quotes of Confucius "The honest man tells the truth, the fool tells the whole truth." In any case, its principles would have great influence on modern China and Mao Zedong itself.
Zhuang Zi 庄 子 子 (369-286 A. C.), the greatest of the Taoist thinkers, one of the great poets of freedom, tells us this story:
“It was Zhuang Zi fishing on the river bank when two mandarins arrived by the Prince of Zhou.
-Our prince wants to see you and appoint you Prime Minister of Kingdom of Zhou.
Zhuang Zi continued to fish and, without going back to his head, replied:
"I heard that in the kingdom of Zhou there is a sacred turtle that was killed many, many years ago." The prince retains this closed turtle in the temple of the ancestors and worships his carapace. Would the turtle be like to be dead and have its remains venerated, or would you rather be alive, shaking the tail in the mud of the swamps?
“I would rather be alive, shaking the tail in the mud of the swamps, answered the mandarins.
"You can leave," said Zhuang Zi. I also prefer to shake the tail in the mud of the swamps. ”
In China, more than any other country in the world, we see how it manifests, century after century, the continuity of ideas, traditions, uses and customs.
Mao Zedong, who knew well the cultural foundation of his homeland, sometimes cited the old philosophers and the stories of popular tradition, for the benefit of the ideology he defended. This is how, in 1945, Mao speaks of one of these stories:
“In ancient China there was a fable titled 'How Yukong removed the mountains'. This fable says that in times that go there, he lived in northern China an old man named Yukong. On the south side, in front of his house, were two large mountains, Taihang and Wangwu, which prevented his passage. Driving his children, Yukong decided to rock the mountains to pick -up blows. Seeing them in such a work, another old man named Chezzou, untied to laugh and said to them, ‘What a foolishness! Alone, you will never be able to rock these two mountains. ' Yukong replied:
‘When I die will be my children; When, in turn, they die, my grandchildren will be, and thus succeeding the generations uninterrupted. As for these two mountains, however high, they can no longer grow and, with each pick of pick, they become smaller. Why can't we drag them? 'And Yukong continued, unshakable, to cut the stone, day after day, which moved the God of heaven who sent two angels to the earth who carried and took the two mountains. Today there are also two mountains that weigh on the Chinese people: imperialism and feudalism. The Communist Party of China has long decided to draft them. We must be persevering and work without rest, for we can also move the God from heaven. For us, the God of heaven is nothing but the mass of the Chinese people. ”
One of the characteristics of Chinese thinking is the unity of opposites, the complementarity and permanent transformation of opposites, movement and dialectic, the nullity of contradictions and the immediate appearance of renewed contradictions always insoluble because, when solved, they give rise to other new contradictions.
In the twenty years of the twentieth century, the philosopher Chen Lifu 陳立夫 wrote things like these:
“As men do not look like, their analogies are characterized by seven periods. In the first, the strong tolerates the weak; In the second, the strong despises the weak; In the third, the strong enslaves the weak; In the room, the strong has piety of the weak; In the fifth, the fort becomes weak; In the sixth, the weak protects the fort; In the seventh, the weak and the strong are confused. ”
Returning to Zhuang Zi and his building of Taoist wisdom, old twenty -three centuries, we read:
“The universe with this is not an expression of the absolute. Everything changes, over time, during the course of evolution, according to what begins and what ends. Science teaches that things change its appearance and that the absolute becomes relative. Therefore, the distance between large and small, between what comes before and what comes later in a chain that has no end. ”
And later, in his book by Zhuang Zi, the master says:
“Those who claim to exist the right and the righteous without their correlative, the incorrect and the unfair, or the good government without their correlative, the bad government, do not understand the great principles of the universe or the essence of all creation. How can we speak of the existence of heaven without referring to the existence of the earth, or the negative principle without referring to the positive principle?
However, there are still people who continue these endless discussions. These people are either crazy or they are naive. ”
The apparent statism of oriental civilizations has much to do with the cyclical character of their thinking. Also with his wisdom, quite different from our Western, so linked to the old Greek logic and the apparent Judeo-Christian dynamism.
Here's another antique history of Chinese Taoism, now taken from Huainanzi 淮南子, a classic of Chinese philosophy dating from the second century BC:
“An old man poor had a horse and the animal fled. At night the neighbors came to manifest their grief, telling him that he had very little luck. The peasant simply answered: 'Maybe'. The next day, the horse returned accompanied by six wild mares. At night, the neighbors came to congratulate the peasant, telling him that after all he had been very lucky. The man simply answered: 'Maybe'. The next day, the peasant son set up one of the wild mares, but fell and broke a leg. At night, the neighbors came to mourn the low luck of the peasant that simply answered: 'Maybe'. The next day, the government officials responsible for the recruitment of young people to the Army arrived at the village, finding the Empire in war time. The peasant son did not go to the battlefields because he had a leg. At night the neighbors came to congratulate him once again for his good luck and the old man simply answered: 'Maybe.'
Now an old apologist, by Pe Yu King, that no one knows who it is but has been written for fourteen centuries:
“Once a monk, a bandit, a painter, a miser, and a wise man traveled together. He fell at night and housed in a cave.
"There would be no better place for an hermitage," the monk exclaimed.
"What a great refuge for robbers," said the bad guy.
- The light of the dock, these shadow games, which extraordinary motives for the brush!, The painter murmured in turn.
"But what a great place to hide a treasure!"
The sage heard in silence and finally said:
- What a wonderful cave! ”
In China never is nothing exactly what it seems. It may be, it may not be, it all depends on subtles or cancellations of each person, perspective, look. In the sixteenth century, in the middle of Ming Dynasty, the literate Yuan Jing 袁 晶 told the interesting story of a cat. Like this:
A mandarin of the court, named Ji, had a magnificent cat. He was so proud of the feline that he decided to call him tiger. One day, they will not be in their home with several friends, everyone started talking about the cat. One of them said:
"It is true that the tiger is a powerful animal, but the dragon has even more power." Why not call Dragon to the cat?
Another intervened:
"IDmit the dragon is more powerful than the tiger, but he has to rise in the air to reach the clouds." It seems to me therefore evident that the clouds are stronger than the dragon. Why not call cloud to the cat?
A third said then:
"The clouds can cover the whole earth, but they can't resist the wind that disperses them quickly." Why not call the cat wind?
A bedroom coexistence added:
- What can the wind before a stone wall. Why not call a wall to the cat?
A fifth friend argued later:
- A wall can resist the wind, but rats know how to bump a wall. Why not call a rat to the cat?
An old man from Dongli's village heard the whole conversation in silence. Finally, he asked:
- What is the name the animal that hunts rats?
Our João de Barros (1496-1570), excellent 16th century chronicler, in its Asia, third decade, where more than one hundred pages that dedicated to China and the Chinese world enter, wrote around 1550:
"The Chins say they have two eyes of understanding the casters of all the things, we, the ones in Europe, after communicating us, have an eye, and all the other nations are blind."

In Dantu, one of the three districts of Zhenjiang (Jiangsu) where he lived more than four decades, his memory is celebrated in a unique park in the country where one can observe a thousand and three hundred copies of stone -caligrah recordings. By alluding to its source of inspiration, it was properly conceived in the hill of the ten LI, with its own aspects of the painting of landscapes.
The admirable novelty of his art was praised by Emperor Huizong (R.1100-1125), who knew him and which in his vertical roll of the awakening of clouds (silk ink, 150 x 78.8 cm in Smithonian) transcribed the Confucius phrase that underlines what will be noted in so -called Shanshui paintings, "rivers and the mountains" in continuous mutation: "Before the sky sends the rains of the season, mountains and rivers presented the clouds."
In the paintings of Mi Fu, this look is noted to the mutant fluid forms where the spirit could be revealed, unlike the design of animals or people who have stabilized forms.
Its legacy was also and above all cultivated by painters over time. Pan Sim (1756-1839) Already in the last dynasty seven hundred years later was one of those who used the horizontal points applied with brush on paper, figuring successive mountains backwards that characterized the method of Mi Fu.
Pan sim like Zhang Yin or Pan Gongshou, painters of the city of Zhenjiang, sought to establish a 'school' (father) based on the tradition of the city. In this memory inquiry, Pan sim realized his affinity with Mi Fu. It made it, for example, in two vertical rollers: the grou forest (helin) enevoid to rain (ink on paper, 128.9 x 31.4 cm, at the Minneapolis Art Institute); and in rain and fog in Helin (ink on paper, 109.9 x 31.8 cm, in the metmuseum).
In the latter, he says a visit to the temple where Mi fu's tomb was on the mountain of yellow grrou (Huanghe Shan) writing a poem in which the expression "old fool", Laodian, is a characteristic manifestation of affective familiarity a little harsh with which They treated the adherents of the DAO; «The great reputation of the grou forest extends for years and years,/ There I stayed overnight once in the spring and there I did this painting reminding old fool. coming to steal my meditation on Chan? »</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>ANA CRISTINA ALVES</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/autor/ana-cristina-alves/</link><description>Ana Cristina Alves,

The year 2025 will be commanded by the wooden serpent yin (乙巳蛇 yǐ sì shé), that is, from the sixth terrestrial branch, from the wood element linked to the female principle, therefore to lunar, mysterious and intuitive force. It begins, in official terms of the Lunissolar calendar, on January 29, 2025 and ends on February 16, 2026, but for Geomancia or Fengshui (风水 Fēngshuǐ) The year only opens February 3 in the first spring, Lichun (立春 Lìchūn ). This year, from the point of view of the telluric blessings, it will be particularly awarded because it will have two spring, with a second Lichun on February 4, 2026.
And as for the descendants of the dragon “good things come to peers” (好事成双 hǎo shì chéng shuāng), promises good agriculture and fertility, being equally conducive to meditation and contact with nature, but also social contacts, because The wooden serpent, given its element, is the most communicative, creative, friendly and favorable to relationships between these reptiles. Moreover, this type of wood is defined by being a hardworking, honest and popular, it is not always recognized, so it brings the virtue of perseverance, which gives it the recognition of its efforts over time.
She is “the snake that leaves the hole” (KWOK, 1997, 67). It belongs to you the time period between 9am and 11am. Although its fixed element is fire, such as wood is of the tiger, and its constant color is, according to the element, red, in 2025 will predominate green, associated with wood.
The serpent is the strongest sex symbol and, therefore, in Indian Yoly philosophies of the Tantric line, which extend throughout Asia and, in particular by Southeast Asia, it is Kundalini, as it well caught the attention C.G. Jung in The Psychology of Kundalini Yoga. Notes to a seminar Given in 1932.
How do Chinese related to the serpent's life force? At first they were quite spontaneous, they had an animist philosophy that evolved into popular Taoism, but it must not be forgotten that also from an early age, from Confucius and the establishment of Confucianism, and in a systematic way since Han, has had In this culture a great determination to control the natural energies. This trend has redoubled the acceptance of Buddhist philosophy, initially far from the natural and tantric experiences.
During the time of the last Qing dynasty, religious experiences linked to Buddhism intensified and, as such, the conflict between natural and spiritual forces became manifest, opening a war similar to what we assist in Christianity, with Eve and Adam to be expelled from paradise because of a supposedly infamous serpent.
The open war between natural forces and formal religion would still be recorded in Chinese literature, in one of the most poignant love stories, entitled to White Serpent (Bai Shé Zhuàn), also known by the names of its protagonists Xu Xian (许仙 xǔ Xiān) and bai niangzi (白娘子 Bai niángzi), which reached the heyday during the Qing dynasty.
In it lovers are hopelessly persecuted by a Buddhist Bonzo, who destroys their happiness by insisting that Xu Xian (许仙) move away from Bai Niangzi (白娘子), as she was an enchanted serpent.
Omitted by Bonzo would be the meditation effort that led the serpent to transfigure itself in human form.
What Bonzo Buddhist has not seen, as many Christian religious cannot see, is that on the outside of what seems to be transgression if it hides a natural and spontaneous force closely linked to the minds of those who deal with it. For a pure mind, the natural force has nothing impure, to a blurred mind, the force is, in the western version, sin, and in the eastern negative and demonic power.
The strength of the serpent is complete in itself. There is nothing to add to you. Attesting to its perfect completeness, there is a very told proverbial story, drawing feet to the serpent (畫/画蛇添足 huà shiān zú), often shortened in the expression the serpent feet (shé zú 蛇足).
古时候 ， 楚国有一家人 ， 祭完祖之后 ， 准备将祭祀用的一壶酒 ， 赏给帮忙办事的人喝。帮忙办事的人很多 ， ， 若是让一个 若是让一个人喝 ， 那能喝得有余。这一壶酒到底怎么分呢？大家都安静下来 ， 这时有人建议：每个人在地上画一条蛇 ， 谁画得快 ， 这壶酒就归他喝。大家都认为这个方法好 ， 都同意这样做。于是 ， 在地上画起蛇来。
有个人画得很快 ， 一转眼最先画好了 ， 他就端起酒壶要喝酒。但是他回头看看别人 ， 还都没有画好呢。心里想：他们画得真慢。他洋洋得意地说： “你们画得好慢啊！我再给蛇画几只脚也不算晚呢！” 于是 ， 他便左手提着酒壶 ， 右手给蛇画起脚来。正在他一边给蛇画脚 ， 一边说话的时候 ， ， ， 另外一个人已经画好了。那个人马上把酒壶从他手里夺过去 “你见过蛇吗？蛇是没有脚的 ， 你为什么要给它添上脚呢？所以第一个画好蛇的人不是你 ， 而是我了！ ”那个人说罢就仰起头来 ， 咕咚咕咚把酒喝下去了。
Here's my translation:
In ancient times, in the Kingdom Chu (楚國/国 Chǔ Guó), there was a feudal gentleman who, after giving the appropriate ritual libations to the ancestors, still left a jar of wine, which he thought to distribute to his employees. But since these were many, the wine didn't come to everyone, but for one it would be more than enough. After all, how did it be shared? To calm down one of them suggested, "Each one will draw a snake on the floor, which end first, will get the jar of wine." Everyone agreed with the idea and so began to draw. There was one who was full of desire to drink him, so he dispatched the drawing in an open and close eye.
Looking at others, he saw that they were not over yet, so he thought they were very slow and said triumphly, "You are so slow that I even have time to add feet to the serpent!" Then, as he clung to his left hand in the jar, with his right added his feet to the reptile. By the time he was drawing his feet and speaking, another ended his drawing; Ranking the jar of his hand, he said, “Have you ever seen a snake? If you have no feet why you added ?! So the first to draw a snake is not you, but me. ” Upon finishing speaking, he raised his head and gluglu rubbed the wine.
In a stylistic equivalent to Portuguese, the first winner had blurred the painting. In an ontological reading, there is nothing to add to a complete force in itself. Therefore, this said is used to show someone to do something superfluous.
When the serpent intends to be different, it has opened the path of metamorphosis, similar to that of the silk bug and butterfly.
The Chinese are well aware of the power of the serpent (shé 蛇), whose etymological reading is the worm radically another, the animal, the antithetical force of the civilized. This immense natural energy was renamed as a little dragon (小龙 Xiǎo Lóng) to make room for the reptile to cultivate and exercise on the spiritual way, in an inner body to mind, without, however, losing its telluric roots. The serpent crawls on Earth, if he can rise to heaven as a flying dragon, united the two primordial forces of the universe, that of heaven and that of the earth, within the human body and outside the cosmic body.

The building in the middle of the square, although it seems like a government site, is the city's exhibition room. In the west, two large shopping centers, one with cinema, extend the street where we are taken to the great canal's anchorage. In a small guard at the entrance of the boarding pier, the boat tickets are sold to Suzhou [we are in the late 90s] and every day a boat in the evening, on a trip made night in the night Jiangnan Channel [Jiangnan Yunhe (江南运河)]. Once, the route went to Wuxi, but this service was disconnected for two years.
The Jiangnan channel begins in Zhenjiang, on the south bank of Changjiang (Yangzi or Yangtzé), after the Great Channel crosses the third largest river in the world, and to south follows its course by Danyang (丹阳), Changzhou (常州), Wuxi (无锡), Suzhou (苏州), Pingwang (平望), arriving in Hangzhou where he connects to the Qianantang River.
In the window, which seemed to keep the alley to take to the boarding door, we bought for the next day by 98 yuan the small [which of the city bus] ticket in a bed, in a bunk compartment, as the two -bed cabins to cost 115 Yuan are exhausted. They ask to arrive at five in the afternoon, half an hour before the match.
He looked at the pier from where two years before he had left by boat to Suzhou and returned now prepared to repeat the trip, but when he arrived at the pier I find it being demolished. The boats of these trips are still anchored, but these have now been suspended indefinitely. By chance, we realize the movement registered at the bottom of the pier, with people waiting next to a triangle sign indicating the boat stop. Asking, we found no trip to the former Nanxingqiao (南星桥) boarding pier, situated shortly before reaching the Sanlang Temple, near the Southern Bus Terminal.
Now a boat career was open, which on a short ten -minute trip to downstream, touched by brief moments at Baziqiao Zhan (坝子桥站), next to the Bazi Bridge (坝子桥), then returning to the pier where we had party. By five yuan we can look at one of the city's channels, which although closed lets down water to the large channel and looking like an attractive place, a bridge with three arches covered by a wooden roof is the door of a branch of channel.
Also by five Yuan, we are taken to the old gongchen bridge, next to the square of the Great Channel Museum Beijing-Hangzhou. And so we came back to visit this excellent museum, which came to create a new tourist hub in the city of Hangzhou.
There are exposed thumbnails of boats, and you can see the paths of maritime travel over the centuries and the centuries of construction of the Great Channel, its sponsors and the way the obstacles presented to make this route a direct connection were resolved between the northern capital and the rest of China.
On the big channel
Only with the new opening of the country to tourism held in 1978 came the interest to take a new benefit from this great engineering work. By the great channel the goods were still transported, although parts of the route were interrupted, as navigation had been abandoned since the late nineteenth century. In response, in 1981 Wuxi's tourist entities opened a trip between Suzhou and Yangzhou and another, from Tai Lake to Hangzhou.
The boat made available to tourism was a faithful replica of Emperor Sui's dragon boat, Yangdi. In the late 1990s, the trips are between Hangzhou and Suzhou and then to Wuxi the boats are normal two-story passenger boats. Then, in the second or third year after the beginning of the III Millennium, the trip ceased to be made for Wuxi and was only made between Hangzhou and Suzhou and in the year 2007 it was interrupted. We believe, to restructure and prepare new boats for tourists to enjoy the beauties of the landscapes and the history of the great channel.
At five in the afternoon we arrived at the pier, half an hour before the match. Fifteen minutes after the hour, at six minus a quarter we are navigating the waters of the Great Channel. The delay should have to get the bicycle bikes of the cycling group on the boat, arrived at the time of the match.
The boat where we travel has two floors and approximately twenty cabin, with ordinary bathrooms, the kitchen and a small hall, where meals, dinner and breakfast are taken.
The trip will be made at night by the region known as Jiangnan [southern Rio], which crosses the lands south of Changjiang (Yangzi River), in the provinces of Zhejiang and Jiangsu, where it comes from the channel built in the qin dynasty with 85 km long and extended in 605. From Hangzhou passes the lands of Huzhou and Jiaxing and leaving Zhejiang's province enters Jiangsu's and surrounding the Tai lake to Suzhou, where by boat will end our trip.
From Hangzhou we would leave to Suzhou, comparing the Venetian traveler Marco Polo, twin cities at the level of beauty, paradise on Earth.
The night falls into Hangzhou when we crossed the Gongzhen Bridge, built in 1631 all of the stone with three arches and that brings us awakened on the deck, despite raining, for starting the non -navigated route. A passenger boat passes by transporting only one person, not being strange because the fog and drizzle all afternoon removes the pleasure of the trip.
Choupos lined along the stoned banks are suddenly lit by the red lanterns of a restaurant on the edge of old -style water waiting for customers. The beauty of the landscape may only be due to the shadows of the night.
The traffic of boats is intense and all are loaded, some large, where containers, others carrying sand, coal or wooden blasts. The boat with the flat hull and the bow in U, sails the water edge. At the stern of the vessel, at the top of the hinge cabin are the signaling lights, with the green on the right and left side, the red. It leads a focus of intense white light to illuminate the front channel and cross with other vessels deflect it, or go out. The darkness is gaining. Before crossing with other boats, some in the opposite direction, others to be exceeded again, will turn back to seconds the spotlight to warn and view the size of the vessels.
Next to a deviation from the channel, a diesel pump on the margin waits to replenish fuel those who pass by. The waters carry chips of spherovitis and branches of tree. From when instead, a factory on the banks has its pier benefiting from this privileged transportation road to receive raw material to send production.
The width size of the channel varies and sometimes allows the passage at the same time of four boats, but in other places for three is tight.
We crossed with a track of boats pulled by a tugger, where the workers' cabins are located, taking tinning ten long container boats. A slight tap our boat makes you feel.
If in the first two hours of travel the honk is constant, then it only releases a shrill a whistle sound as it passes a set of houses and when it intersects in reverse with the company's boat.
We fall asleep, not without first feeling another touch between vessels and this time the blow is stronger.
We arrived early in the morning, after more than nine hours of travel navigating the Great Channel. At 5:30, the boat contributed by the Ponte of the Precious Belt (Baodai Qiao, 宝带桥) in the southeast of Suzhou, in the Wuzhong district, but only from him we left at six thirty. Two buses wait on Changqiao Street (长桥街道) to take the passengers to the city center, six kilometers.
Baodai qiao is considered one of China's most representative bridges and is named because it was built between 816 and 819 at the expense of selling the valuable belt of Wang Zhongshu, governor of Suzhou in the Tang dynasty. With an extension of 317 meters and 4.1 meters wide, it has 53 arches, with three openings is sufficient to allow the boats to continue through the large channel and also cross the River Daidai and Lake Tantai. The rest of the bridge makes pier, being at the level of the vessels that used and easily discharged the goods.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Death | Died Rocha Vieira at 85</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/23/obito-morreu-rocha-vieira-aos-85-anos/</link><description>Vasco Rocha Vieira, the last Portuguese governor of Macau, died yesterday at the age of 85. The general had been sick for a long time. Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa recalled him as “one of the most illustrious officers” of the army, but to Macau, Rocha Vieira is for history as the great worker of the measures decided in the 1987 joint statement
 
It has long been sick, even failing some recent events in Lisbon about Macau and the transition. Vasco Rocha Vieira, General, former Chief of Staff of the Army, and the last Portuguese governor of Macau, died yesterday morning at 85 years old.
Born on August 16, 1939, he held the position of Governor of Macao between 1991 and 1999, when the transfer of the territory to China was processed. However, Rocha Vieira already had a connection to Macau, as he was in the territory after April 25. In addition, he was also Minister of the Republic of the Azores between 1986 and 1991.
One of the first personalities to react to his death in Portugal was the President of the Republic, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, who expressed, in a official note, the “deep regret” for the death of Vasco Rocha Vieira, recalling him as “one of the more distinguished army officials and praising its “marked patriotism”.
In a note published on the official website of the Presidency of the Republic on the Internet, the head of state recalls Rocha Vieira as "one of the most illustrious officers of the Portuguese army in the transition to democracy and in the first decades of his statement." “Always closely linked to commands, it has also performed political functions such as Minister of the Republic for the Autonomous Region of the Azores,” is remembered in the note.
Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa also points out that Rocha Vieira was “very close to President António Ramalho Eanes”, having been “designated chancellor of the old military orders”.
“The symbolism of the moment of transferring the Portuguese administration to the Chinese will remain in the memory of many Portuguese as an example of meaning, meaning of the public cause and marked patriotism,” reads the note of regret.
The President of the Republic, who claims to have followed “closely the last months” of Rocha Vieira's life, “presents to his family, and, much in particular, to his widow and children, the testimony of gratitude of Portugal, with very longing friendship".
In his biography, entitled “To all the ports I arrived”, the moment Mário Soares, then President of the Republic, said to Rocha Vieira: “I need yourself. Go to Macau and see if it puts that in order ”, in reference to the case of Macau fax, related to the construction of Macao International Airport, which so many headaches gave its predecessor, Carlos Watermelon, also deceased.
The general will then replied that nothing demanded to go to Macau. “I didn't ask you anything, nor did I put it in conditions. I went to Macau with the same spirit with which I went to the Azores. It was not a political position inherent in a career. It was, in fact, a mission, ”he describes.
Then it was Rocha Vieira and his team to achieve all objectives and ideal for the future of Macao present in the joint statement that had been signed between Portugal and China in 1987. The government led by Rocha Vieira saw the airport was born, built The entire bilingual legislative framework that is still in place today and raised the Macao Cultural Center, inaugurated by Jorge Sampaio on March 19, 1999, among many other initiatives, including in the area of ​​urbanism.
A "GREAT FRIEND"
Rocha Vieira came, by the way, to make the place available to the Macau Executive when Jorge Sampaio was elected President of the Republic, at the turn from 1995 to 1996. “When I went to Macau I didn't know how things were going to run and how long I was going There stayed there, ”he recalled in his biography. However, and despite Sampaio's initial hesitation in change, the truth is that Rocha Vieira turned out to be, because “her replacement would affect the regular sequence of the process” at a time when “the passage was already in sight was already in sight From territory administration to China, ”it is described in“ all the ports I arrived ”.
Speaking to RTP, Chito Rodrigues, a general governor of Macao in office, left words of regret for the death of the one who was a friend.
“I remember him as a great friend and honorary partner of the Combatants League. He has always related to us and is our reference. We knew it was bad and we were not, in a way, surprised [with the news of death], but it is always an unpleasant surprise. ”
Chito Rodrigues recalls him in the exercise of his duties in Macau as someone who contributed "so that Macao was a quiet place for decolonization to be done in a" exemplary "way." “I was with him at the opening of the airport and had close relations with him as governor. It was someone who replaced his predecessors successfully and humble, replacing the tradition of military governors in Macao, ”he added.
In Fernando Lima and Eduardo Cintra Torres, the former Hong Kong governor, Chris Patten, recalled Rocha Vieira as "a brave and judicious man, with enormous integrity and an excellent server of his country." "I think Portugal was very lucky to have such a good man as the last governor, such a difficult place," he said.
The controversy
The name of Rocha Vieira was, however, wrapped in some controversies, namely with the creation of the Jorge Álvares Foundation and the Oriente Foundation, especially regarding the funds allocated to these two entities. "The bulk of public opinion of the territory and the authorities of Beijing contested the legitimacy of a contract under which an entity based in Lisbon was fueled with resources generated in Macao," reads the biography of Rocha Vieira. This only intended the Foundation to “play a payroll role for Macao, and the controversy has been diluted over time.
On social networks, the journalist and former director of Macau today, João Severino said “mourn a lot” the disappearance of Rocha Vieira. “General Vasco Rocha Vieira left us after several weeks hospitalized at the hospital. Macao's last governor was a good man for many people and discriminatory for many. In any case his military career was exemplary and left marks in the administration of Macao. I kept with the illustrious governor some controversial moments, always within the greatest cordiality and consideration by the maximum representative of my country in Macau. I present to your wife Dr. Leonor and his children my condolences and rest in peace, ”he wrote.
An entity that reacted to the disappearance of Rocha Vieira was the Luso-Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry (CCILC), which on social networks issued a note of regret about the death of the 138th Portuguese Governor of Macao and presided at the CCILC Strategic Council.
“General Rocha Vieira played a striking and exemplary role throughout his life, standing out for his commitment to service to the nation, dedication to relations between Portugal and China, and the historical role in closing the administration cycle Portuguese in Macau. ”
The same note also states that "in the leadership of the CCILC Strategic Council, his strategic vision, wisdom and human values ​​have always been a source of inspiration for the entire direction and executive team."
Also the Lisbon City Council officially reacted to its disappearance. “Rocha Vieira dedicated her life to the defense of the national interest, notably serving Portugal as the army's head of the army and as the last governor of Macao. Vision statesman assured a peaceful transfer from Macao sovereignty to China. Man of courage, contributed to the consolidation of the democratic process, being a fundamental piece of November 25, 1975. It was an honor to count on his testimony in the first evocation ceremony of November 25 in the Paços do County in 2023. ”
Goodbye to Macau
The images of Rocha Vieira to hold the Portuguese flag to her chest are celebrated on December 19, 1999, with a visibly thrilled face, as well as goodbye to the “mission” he agreed to perform in Macao.
After his role as governor, Rocha Vieira was maintaining narrow ties with the territory, and the last time he was in Macau was in 2023, to receive the distinction of Honoris Causal Doctorate from the Macao University of Science and Technology.
Then he stressed that the "good historical relationships" with China are "a trump card for Portugal" and that today the country is "a superpower in affirmation". The general said that “another great asset” for Portugal is interest in China in the Portuguese language, underlining the growing number of Chinese universities that teach Portuguese. At the end of 2020, the coordinator of the Portuguese Language Pedagogical and Scientific Center of the Macao Polytechnic University, Gaspar Zhang Yunfeng, said there were about 50 higher education institutions with Portuguese courses in mainland China.
“China is interested in that Portuguese develops (…) also to be able to have, through Portugal, a narrower relationship with Portuguese -speaking countries,” said Rocha Vieira.
In a last interview with Lusa agency in 2019, Rocha Vieira recalled the times in Macau and her vicissitudes, especially regarding the transition process.
“I had more problems with the Portuguese part than with the Chinese part (…) often, for lack of perception. Normally, people are far away in Lisbon - this is a historical thing, which is not just now - and think they know the solutions better than those in Macao, ”he said.
Rocha Vieira assured that when it was necessary to define “the course, the fundamental objectives of Macao policies, were discussed by the Macao government in Lisbon, with whom they should be discussed, with the President of the Republic and the Prime Minister”, there is “always” about this “a great understanding on the part of the Portuguese sovereignty organs and a great proof of confidence in those in the territory”.</description><pubDate>2025-01-23 00:26:24</pubDate></item><item><title>USA | Trump says tariffs are "the only form" in the country being "treated as it should"</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/22/eua-trump-diz-que-tarifas-sao-a-unica-forma-do-pais-ser-tratado-como-deve/</link><description>European countries will be subject to customs tariffs, "the only form" of the United States "to be treated as they should be," US President Donald Trump said Tuesday.

China reacted yesterday, claiming to be "firmly determined" to "defend their national interests."
"We have always believed that there are no winners in a trade war or a tariff war," said Mao Ning, spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry at a press conference.
The president of the European Commission (EC), Ursula Von der Leyen, who participated in the Davos Economic Forum, Switzerland, on Tuesday, ensured that Europe is ready to talk to the United States government, remembering that Washington is a important commercial partner.
Our first priority is to quickly start conversations about our common interests and be ready to negotiate, ”he said:“ We will be pragmatic, but we will keep firm in our principles: to defend our interests and respect our values, ”he said the European leader.
"Europe will continue to defend cooperation, not only with our longtime friends (…) but also with all the countries with which we have common interests," added von der Leyen.
“Our message to the rest of the world is simple: we are ready to dialogue with you if this can lead to mutual benefits,” he added, ensuring that he intends to “deepen” relations between Brussels and Beijing.

During his presidential campaign, Trump had already denounced the US commercial deficit of the EU, comparing block to “a small China” and accusing him of taking advantage of the world's first economic power.
"We have a commercial deficit with the EU of $ 350 billion," he insisted on Tuesday, noting that "China is aggressive, but it is not only China, other countries are also big aggressors."
The US commercial deficit with the EU will rise to $ 131 billion in 2023, according to data from the White House Commercial Representative (USTR), and is mainly concentrated in four countries: Germany, France, Ireland and Italy.
Before being reelected, Donald Trump had already threatened the EU with the imposition of customs rights on European products unless the block increased their US oil and gas purchases.
The European Commissioner for the Economy, Valdis Dombrovskis, guaranteed on Monday, after Trump's inauguration, that the EU is “ready to defend its economic interests,” as it has done “during the first Trump administration when it introduced tariffs on steel and aluminum ”.</description><pubDate>2025-01-22 23:45:06</pubDate></item><item><title>Death / Rocha Vieira: Macau recalls last Portuguese governor</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/22/obito-rocha-vieira-macau-recorda-ultimo-governador-portugues/</link><description>Macao's last governor, Vasco Rocha Vieira, who died at age 85, launched the foundations of the success of the Chinese region and defended the rights of civil servants, although with "some mismatches," local leaders told Lusa.

The foundations of the Special Administrative Region of Macau have a lot to do with the work of Lieutenant General Rocha Vieira ”, defended Sales Marques.
Rocha Vieira held the position of governor of Macau between 1991 and 1999, when the transfer of the territory to China was processed. It was in his mandate that the construction of the city's airport was completed.
The Macao that Rocha Vieira found and the one that left “does not compare. What has been done in those years is all anything that history has already recorded, ”said Sales Marques. also a member of the then Advisory Board of Rocha Vieira.
Former Deputy António NG Kuok Cheong told Lusa that, despite the distrust of the Chinese, the administration "tried to do something to encourage the city's economic growth, which was very poor at that time, before returning Macao."
António NG, elected to the Legislative Assembly five months after the appointment of Rocha Vieira, stressed that the main obstacle was China's resistance to the liberalization of the game sector, which would only be released in 2002.
Something that forced the Portuguese administration to sell land to finance infrastructure projects, inadvertently planting the roots of the housing problem that Macau currently faces, he said.
“They tried to sell the land openly, but the Chinese government prevented them. Thus, most land was sold to powerful people in China for a very low price, because Macau's economy was very weak, ”said NG. A class of landlords was created who, after Macao became the world capital of casinos, enriched by controlling the offer and maintaining the housing prices high, lamented the former deputy.
Work in civil servants
Jorge Fão, one of the founders of the Macao Public Function Workers Association (ATFMP) in 1987, noted that Rocha Vieira “fulfilled the mission as governor” and “dignified her country”.
The former president of ATFPM, ahead of the association "for over ten years", told Lusa that he was "unionist before being a politician" and "had some mismatches" with the lieutenant general.
Fão explained that it was “one of the protagonists” who worked so that, after the transition from Macau to China, “civil servants [of the Portuguese Administration] were entitled to a pension” paid for Portugal.
“No employees of the other colonies were entitled (…) when we started talking about discussing the delivery of Macau to China, we were very worried. We ended our trade union struggles and had several meetings with the governance of Portugal and Macau (…). We had some meetings and also in these meetings we had mismatches, ”he recalled.
In the end, summarized the current president of the General Assembly of the Association of Retirees, Reformed and Pensioners of Macao, "the outcome was not bad." "Everyone must be satisfied, too, I who had part of this fight and live in this pension for over 30 years," he said.
In the passage of administration, there were about 3,600 retirees with pensions transferred to Portugal, he concluded. In 2022, Jorge Fão told Lusa to believe that about two thousand renovated from the former Portuguese administration of Macau were in the Chinese region.

In Hong Kong, only six percent of respondents are committed to their jobs
 
Realizing how workers from around the world feel, and regarding their employment, it is the objective of the Gallup International Association report, entitled “State of the Global Workplace 2024”. If in the worldwide and regional scene, East Asia does well in some indicators, the scenario is not favorable with regard to the commitment or commitment that workers have for the company they are linked to or the functions they perform.
Inside East Asia includes countries and regions such as China, Hong Kong, Japan, Mongolia, South Korea and Taiwan. This area of ​​the globe has “the lowest percentage, at regional level, of employees who feel daily sadness”, but has “the third highest, regional percentage of employees who say they are looking, and actively, of a new job. ” In addition, East Asia has “the third lower percentage at regional level of committed employees” with the work they have (18 percent, which still represents a rise of 1 percent compared to the corresponding period between 2022 and 2023) .
On the contrary, 67 percent of respondents are not at all committed or committed to work, plus five percent compared to the same period. In addition, 14 percent says it is totally uncompromising with the company where they work, minus six percent.
As for negative emotions lived daily, and more often, the stress factor leads, with 46 percent response, six percent from the period between 2022 and 2023. percent answers, which did not generate any answers in the last investigation. “Sadness” was a feeling revealed by 12 percent of respondents, 1 more percent compared to the previous inquiry, and “loneliness”, which also has direct entry into this list of less good feelings lived at work, 18 percent.
If dissatisfaction with work is demonstrated in the preceding paragraphs, certainties climb from tone in the category “work environment - good height to find a job”, with 51 percent to respond affirmatively, 11 percent of answers to the previous inquiry . In addition, the category “intention to leave - looking actively for a new work” was chosen for 54 percent of respondents, two percent less from 2022 to 2023.
In the “Life Assessment” category, those who claim to have a prosperous life are 32 percent, seven percent, in contrast to the 62 percent of respondents who claim to be suffering some kind of difficulties, another seven percent in relation to to the last inquiry. The “suffering” category related to the job was chosen for six percent of participants in the inquiry, a direct entry in this study.
Sadness below
For the study of Gallup, 40,428 people were interviewed in 41 countries, and the sample per country contains about 1,000 men and women. The margin of error of the survey “is between +3-5 percent with a confidence level of 95 percent”, is referred to.
The study also compares the data recorded by eastern Asia workers with the other countries. And once again is the lack of commitment and the feeling of “dressing the nightgown” that persists in many companies. In worldwide terms, 62 percent of the answers point to the absence of commitment, when in East Asia this percentage over 67 percent.
Regarding the “life evaluation”, if at the world level 58 percent of respondents says it is having difficulties, the percentage of East Asia is 62 percent. However, suffering meaning is only six percent of the answers, while in the world the bar is eight percent. Regarding this factor, the low percentage of the feeling of “daily sadness”, with 12 percent answers, when the world level rises to the 22 percent.
The feeling of stress is also higher, with 46 percent answers, when at global level is 41 percent.
China: anger and difficulties
Looking at the criteria in each country, 19 percent of China workers said they were committed to work, two more percent annually, while in Hong Kong only six percent of people are committed and who like what they do, the which is a break of one percent.
In the “life assessment”, 36 percent of China workers say they are facing difficulties, plus 1 percent, while in Taiwan 41 percent says they face less good times, representing a direct entry into the classification, with no previous score to compare. In the case of Hong Kong, 17 percent of respondents assume to cross difficulties, plus 1 percent compared to the previous inquiry.
As for the feeling of “daily stress”, China rises to the first place in the ranking with 53 percent answers, yet 2 percent in annual terms, with Hong Kong following the footsteps, with 49 percent answers . Japan is third with 41 percent people to feel stress daily.
In response to the question if it felt angry the day before, China leads again with 18 percent answers, despite the annual breakdown of 2 percent; Following South Korea, with 17 percent affirmative answers, and then Hong Kong with 16 percent. In China only 12 percent of workers said they felt sadness, thus putting the country in third place. In relation to Hong Kong there were 11 percent affirmative responses in this domain.
Jon Clufton, CEO of Gallup, leaves an alert about increasing mental health problems worldwide, especially related to the work environment and the form of relationship in the business environment. About 20 percent of workers from around the world “experience daily loneliness”, and this feeling “is greater among total teleworking workers”.
“In this year's report, 41 percent of workers claim to feel 'very stress'. However, stress varies significantly as a function of how organizations are managed. Those who work in companies with bad management practices (actively unmotivated) have almost 60 percent more likely to be stressed than people who work in environments with good management practices (committed). In fact, the experience of 'very stress' is referred to about 30 percent more often by employees who work under mismanagement than by the unemployed, ”said Gallup CEO.
For the official, "leaders know that stress at the workplace is a problem-they saw the data, heard colleagues and felt themselves themselves." “A quarter of the leaders are frequently exhausted or always, and two thirds feel it at least a few times. Many are trying to solve the problem, but often ineffective, ”he concludes.</description><pubDate>2025-01-24 01:41:16</pubDate></item><item><title>Toponymy | Study relates streets with Portuguese names with colonialism</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/21/toponimia-estudo-relaciona-ruas-com-nomes-lusos-com-colonialismo/</link><description>In the master's dissertation “Sino-Portuguese Culture in Macau-History on the Streets”, Zhao Zhen argues that the Portuguese administration diluted “the national identity” of the Chinese population, by putting names with reference to Portugal on the streets, namely writers, navigators, governors and civil servants
 
Zhao Zhen, author of the master's dissertation “Sino-Portuguese Culture in Macao-Street History and Sino-Portuguese Culture from the perspective of the names of the streets of Macau)”, argues that the choice of street names with reference to Portugal during Portugal The years of the Portuguese administration was an effective form of colonization and the creation of the feeling of belonging to the colonizing nation, especially with regard to the Chinese community.
In the dissertation, defended at the University of Trás-os-Montes and Alto Douro (UTAD), it is concluded that “before the return of Macau to China the Portuguese government carried out a political and cultural practice through the attribution of street names to Portuguese way ”.
Thus, the names of the streets of Macao served “as a means of transmitting a collective memory, starting with the construction of the Portuguese government's image in Macau and the guidance of its main values”, using “iconic historical figures and events to reinforce the identification of the colonized with their colonizing identity ”.
Zhao Zhen also added that “during the 400 years of the colonization of Macau by the Portuguese state, linguistic symbols were applied to the inhabitants of Macao by appointing the streets, diluting the traditional national identity of the Chinese and implanting that of the colonizers, thus reaching the objective of remodeling the national identity of local inhabitants ”.
For the author of the study, the issue of very particular toponymy of the territory brought consequences with regard to national identity. “The names of the streets of Macao are different from those of other Chinese cities, and this has impacted the cultural identity of the local population, which grew up with Chinese and Portuguese history and culture and has no strong sense of cultural identity. Thus dilutes its mission to convey its national culture. ”
A form of domain
Admittedly, Zhao Zhen's academic work in the area of ​​Culture Sciences draws attention to the fact that Macau's toponymy reflects a mixture of cultures. However, the author goes further, analyzing how many streets there are in Portuguese and Chinese with names of important personalities, highlighting the fact that Portuguese culture is dominant.
The fact that they exist in Macau streets with names of military, former governors or Portuguese politicians, such as Mario Soares, Sidónio Pais or Ramalho Eanes, is pointed out as synonymous that the Portuguese bet “in an effective process” of transmitting “a materialized vision” of the world that influences and transmits social relations between people and different social classes ”. Thus, what happened was “an act that does not use violence as a form of forced control of minds and population awareness”, in which “a means of coercion” was not applied.
Zhao Zhen states that "in total there are 26 streets named after Portuguese government officials in Macao who were distinguished by the contribution they made to the city, with no street with the name of a Chinese employee in Macao."
This shows “the distinction made by the Portuguese colonizers as a ruling class and the Chinese as a dominated class” is indicated. However, the author points out that “the Portuguese colonization of Macau was not an absolute aggression or rule”, because “the colonizers tried to achieve leadership from a variety of perspectives, including ideological”, in which “the process of achieving this leadership It was interspersed with a more complex racial and cultural existence. ”
According to the author, “the first systematic delimitation of streets and the establishment of names by the Portuguese government of Macao was in 1869”, and were used enough names with connection to the discoveries and the former Portuguese empire.
Zhao Zhen sets the example of João de Almeida Street, which "is named after a general who stood out in the affirmation campaigns of colonial power in Angola, Africa, in the early twentieth century."
In total, there are 26 streets with references to the discoveries and former Portuguese navigators, showing that “the colonial administration [Portuguese] used external political forces to indoctrinate the inhabitants of Macao with the intention of achieving leadership, guiding society through manipulation spiritual, moral and cultural ”. In addition, the author considers that it was used "a colonial vocabulary to create a sense of identity and subordination among the inhabitants, in order to achieve permanent colonization."
Highlight for the existence of nine streets in Macau under the name of Macaenses, as is the case of Francisco H. Fernandes Street, who was born in the territory on February 13, 1863, son of Portuguese parents, and was close friend of Sun Yat -The father of the Republican Revolution in China in 1911.
The place of the Chinese
In the same dissertation it is read that, in contrast to the primacy of references to Portuguese culture and history, there are only 12 streets in Macau “with the name of Chinese”, most of which were “were the peninsula merchants and all had connections with the Portuguese government of the region ”. In turn, "Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Avenue is the only street with the name of a Chinese political figure."
Citing another academic, nicknamed Kuan, Zhao Zhen states that "in the case of names with names of Chinese celebrities, besides being inferior in number, they were non -political figures." "The Portuguese government of Macao, when it baptized the public roads, was intentionally into account political factors, wanting to convey the message that Macau was under Portuguese rule and that, politically speaking, was a Portuguese colony," said this same academic.
Highlight for two streets appointed after the return of Macao to China, namely Doctor Henry Fok Avenue and Doctor Ma Man Kei Avenue. “These personalities were distinguished by the remarkable contributions to the reunification of Hong Kong and Macau and to the development of China, so the attribution of the street name to these personalities reflects the influence of political factors after the end of Macau's long colonial history and soft reunification with China. The addition of the word 'doctor' to their names shows even more respect for them, ”reads.
Also noteworthy is 140 streets in Macao whose names are phonetically translated from Chinese, highlighting the Avenida de IP Heng, Avenida de Lok Koi, Patio de Iong Loc, Patio Fu Van or Rua de San Lei. “All these words Chinese express the desire of the people in a better life and the demand for quality of life. Other nominations are related to the Chinese religion, such as the Largo de Pao Cong Mio, Rua de Kun Iam Tong, ”is referred to, not forgetting the 69 streets with paraphrased names in Chinese -connected Chinese beliefs.
“In order to live a better life and to forward it in the expected direction, the naming of the streets reflects geographical elements, as well as people's hopes for their future lives. The names of the streets are mentioned and used so often that people tend to give them good meanings to satisfy their own intentions of a better life. Influenced by traditional Chinese cultural concepts, many of the street names in Macau have auspicious and lucky meanings, with the words 'harmony, tranquility, friendship, benevolence, concordia'. ”
There are also streets whose names "show traders' desire to have a prosperous business and to get all the profits that come from business."
In general terms, Zhao Zhen concludes that “Macau's experience proves the possibility of harmonious coexistence of various communities and cultures”, and the toponymy “reflects the coexistence and mix of the East and the West, the harmony and difference between them, which Today is a mirror of culture and fundamental values ​​of society. ”</description><pubDate>2025-01-21 23:56:42</pubDate></item><item><title>USA | Trump takes office and throws barbs to China on Panama Canal</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/21/eua-trump-toma-posse-e-lanca-farpas-a-china-sobre-canal-do-panama/</link><description>The new US President Donald Trump promised Monday to take control of the Panama Canal, renamed the Gulf of Mexico and reinforce the taxation of foreign countries, confirming intentions already expressed for the second term in the White House.

The non -governmental organization suggests measures that favor equality and alert to the risks of the concentration of wealth and power
 
It's called “Takers Not Makers-The Unjust Poverty and Unearned Wealth of Coloniaism” [those who receive and don't create-unfair poverty and unmeasured richness of colonialism] and is the latest Oxfam report, non-governmental organization (NGO ) which brings together 19 countries. The document draws attention to poverty in the world and inequalities in the distribution of wealth.
The report released yesterday concludes that inequality gives no signs of slowing down. This is because, last year, the combined wealth of global multimillionaires increased two billion dollars, equivalent to $ 5.7 billion a day, according to Oxfam.
This means that it grew at a pace three times higher than the previous year, according to the NGO.
This was the main conclusion of the report released yesterday at the beginning of the Davos World Economic Forum, which each year brings together the world's leading political and economic leaders in the Alpina city.
In the last year alone, the report reports, an average of almost four new multimillionaires a week came, as Oxfam puts in contrast to the World Bank poverty data, which estimates that the number of people living with less than 6.85 Dollars a day has almost not changed since 1990.
In 2024, there were 2,769 multimillionaires worldwide, instead of 2,565 the previous year, and its combined wealth increased from 13 to 15 billions of dollars in just 12 months. It is the second largest increase in the combined wealth of multimillionaires in a single year since there is a record.
100 million plus 100 million
The joint wealth of the ten richest men in the world increased, on average, almost $ 100 million a day, the study indicates. Even if they lost 99 percent of their richness overnight, "they would remain multimillionaires."
The NGO predicts that, in less than a decade, the first "billionaire" of the planet arises and does not exclude the possibility that there are at least five. Worldwide, the report reveals that 36 percent of the wealth of the richest is inherited and 61 percent is also marked by clientelism and/or linked to monopolistic power.
Oxfam is based on Forbes magazine's 'wealth ranking' data, which show that all multimillionaires under 30 inherited their wealth and, according to Swiss bank UBS data, in the next 20 to 30 years, a thousand dos Current multimillionaires will leave their heirs more than $ 5.2 billion.
Southern money
For Oxfam, the system "makes large flows of money from the global south to the north, benefit the richest population," in a kind of "modern colonialism."
In 2023 alone, through the Financial System, $ 30 million will be removed per hour from the global southern countries to the richest 1 percent of the global northern countries, such as the United Kingdom, the United States and France.
Thus, the “super rich” of the global northern countries control 69 percent of world wealth, concentrate 77 percent of the joint richness of all multimillionaires and represent about 68 percent of the total, although they constitute only 21 percent of World population. To contextualize this inequality, Oxfam refers to the problem of housing in Spain and estimates that "the five future billionaires on the planet will have so much money that they can buy all the country's houses."
In contrast, attention is drawn to the fact that the “working class fights to survive.” "Those who live in poverty around the world continue to face multiple crises, as pandemic scars are still with us in the form of priceless debt, lower salaries, and much higher food prices."
In addition, “conflicts are also increasing, which contributes to poverty, hunger and inequality”, without forgetting “the enormous human impact of climate degradation that increases every year, with deaths caused by excessive heat, extreme weather conditions and hunger".
Oxfam even says that Donald Trump's reelection as president of the United States last November "has given a huge momentum to the billionaires' fortunes, while his policies are prepared to further stir the flames of inequality."
The NGO also highlights the World Bank data in its latest poverty report, where it is said that "if the current growth rates remain and inequality does not decrease, it will take more than a century to end poverty." The document shows that "if we reduce inequality, poverty could be eliminated three times faster."
One of the highlights goes to the contribution of women to the wealth of the few. “Racialized women living in poverty, especially those in the 'global south', continue to subsidize the global economy. It is estimated that every day women contribute 12.5 billion of unpaid work hours, adding at least 10.8 trilions of dollars in the global economy. ” In this context, “the economic contribution of its care work is three times higher than the financial value of the world technological industry”.
A new colonialism
Admittedly, the decolonization of regions colonized by European powers began to occur more strongly from the Bandung Conference in 1955, but signs of power imbalance between peoples and countries that explain, partly, the inequality of wealth that occurs in part explain today.
The idea of ​​new colonialism, in the sense that regions such as Europe or North America continue to explore southern countries, especially the least developed, is well patent in the Oxfam report. “The rise of a new oligarchy in which inheritance, clientelism and monopoly power generate extreme wealth. Without control, we are about to see the greatest transfer of the greatest generational wealth in human history, hardly earned, hardly taxed. ”
What happens today is an overview of "billionaire colonialism," describes Oxfam, with the "transfer of wealth not only to ultra-rich but disproportionately to global northern ultrascourse." There is a "reckoning with colonialism not only as a history of brutal extraction of wealth, but also as a powerful force that leads to extreme levels of inequality today."
Oxfam also draws attention to a new wave of colonialism evidence in the actions of the major economic and financial institutions that decide the direction of the global economy, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the United Nations (UN) and the World Bank. "Global institutions, financial markets, and multinational companies, all shaped by colonialism and mastery of rich countries, continue to facilitate the south-north transfer of dollar trillion every year."
For Oxfam, the UN, IMF and World Bank "were created 80 years ago, near the end of the historical colonial period, and its unequal governance has had little changed since then."
“G7 countries continue to stop 41 percent of the vows in the World Bank and are less than ten percent of the world's population. World Bank and IMF leaders continue to be decided by the United States and Europe, respectively. Likewise, European countries and other global nations have 47 percent of the total seats on the UN Security Council, although they represent only 17 percent of the world's population. ”
It should be noted that "the IMF and the World Bank continue to have a huge influence on the global economic system and, in particular, on the economic policies of low and medium-low countries." These entities, according to Oxfam, "systematically insist on the implementation of cuts in critical expenses."
One of the examples presented is from the IMF, which "requires debtor countries to prioritize the payment of debts to creditors above all and implement policies that include privatization, liberalization of trade and reduction of public deficits to obtain new loans." "These policies impair access to quality education and affordable prices and health care, with a negative impact on public health," he adds.
What to do?

The Continental Council of Affairs (MAC) of Taiwan recalled that the travel alert to both territories remains at the “orange level”, the second highest level.
The agency responsible for relations with China justifies the warning "taking into account the changes to the situation in Hong Kong and Macau and in response to local laws and regulations and methods of application of laws." "Citizens are advised to avoid non -essential trips" to both cities, including in transit, due to "possible risks to safety and individual rights," added the MAC in a statement.
The Lunar New Year is the main party of Chinese families, equivalent to Christmas in Western countries, and this year in Taiwan includes a period of nine days of holidays between January 25 and February 2.
MAC advised the population in advance in a database created for Taiwanese inland, Hong Kong or Macao and recalled that there are direct telephone lines to support citizens.
Registers to rise
Although not mandatory, the number of Taiwanese who registered travel to Chinese territory between January and October 2024 increased about 14 times compared to the previous year, according to data released by the body in December.
The records for Hong Kong and Macao “exceeded five times the total of the same period last year,” said the MAC.
China "continued to adopt and change national security laws, which led to several incidents, involving arbitrary detention, arrest and interrogation of Taiwanese citizens in mainland China, Hong Kong and Macao," said the body.
In September, MAC said a Taiwanese conglomerate leader Formosa Plastics had been under "border control" for 18 days, a type of measure that prevents him from leaving the country.
Taiwan raised in mid -June the travel alert level and advised the population to avoid China, Hong Kong and Macau, after Beijing threatened to execute people considered “defendant turns” of Taiwanese independence.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Watch out for the bags</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/27/cuidado-com-as-malas/</link><description>“Look at the suitcase…” was a song by fadista Celeste Rodrigues. It became immensely popular. I remembered the song because last week the bags were the main theme of the media. We all have a suitcase. Most people traveling by plane have a basement suitcase where you introduce the most varied belongings. Usually we put the clothes, shoes, hygiene products and memories to family and friends inside. There are many ladies who do not realize the risk put some of their valuable jewelry in their travels. There are people who risk transporting amounts of money curled on silver paper. And there is drug trafficking in many of the basement bags with the most diverse disguises. The suitcase is fundamental as something very intimate and accompanying us. Many times the suitcase does not reach the destination and we have to expect several days that appear and there are also cases where some of the bags never see each other again. Airlines are required, in these cases, to compensate passengers who have run out of bags. However, the products that belonged to us and that we liked a lot never see them again. This happens around the world and almost every day in the most different airports.
The suitcase in the airport carpet is completely identified by itself, due to its color and even the accessory linked to the handle with our name and our phone.
By the way, I remembered a text by writer Yvette Vieira, who said: “I recently read news about an English tourist who threw herself to the sea on Madeira Island, allegedly to go after a cruise ship where she would be The husband, the wife was rescued from the sea waters by three young people who decided to go to fishing that same night and one of the details that caught my attention throughout this Rocambolesque story was that the lady in question was able to maintain the surface in cold waters of the Atlantic, thanks to its suitcase. And that last fact did not surprise me, because it is under what circumstances is a woman never drops her suitcase. Which leads me to the theme I want to explore, women and their bags. In this world there are two types of portfolios, those who use large bags and women who prefer small sizes.
I belong to the first group, because my whole life is concentrated in my suitcase. I am that kind of woman who in an emergency can get out of her suitcase, as if it was a magician's top hat, all kinds of things, from fast stakes, ointments, paper to write, water, headache, etc, etc. , think about what is and probably this object is contained in the content of my suitcase. Moreover, I have a friend who owned among her personal belongings a screwdriver that had been forgotten in the suitcase and accompanied her for almost a year. And I'm not playing! Not to mention the bags of moms that are true warehouses of paraphernalia that would leave you dropped. But why does a woman feel need to have everything in her wallet? I don't know. I would like to have a logical explanation for such an almost insane behavior, which implies pounds of belongings transported daily with long -term consequences for our bone structure, in my case I can only say that I do not like being caught off guard. ”
For the case is really, not being caught off guard. We don't run out of a suitcase where we are like that we like very much and that we are particularly disliked if we lose them. It turned out that the news fell like a bomb about the theft allegedly practiced by a party deputy arrives. The same party that does not stop talking about crime and that criminals must all be arrested. For, the Azorian deputy of the arrival was under the eye of the authorities since November last year, due to an anonymous complaint, that he stole bags that did not belong to him from the rugs of the airports of Lisbon and Ponta Delgada. Authorities this time confirmed through video-vigilance images that the deputy took bags that allegedly did not belong to him. Searches were searched for their Lisbon and Azores homes, resulting in suspicion of even stealing bags from other passengers. It sounds like a caricature case, but it is not. According to the television commentator and lawyer Rogério Alves, if proving the robbery of suitcases will be a serious crime that can go to a sentence of eight years in prison. However, the deputy concerned Miguel Arruda, after being removed from arrival, shamefully decided to continue in Parliament as an unregistered deputy.
Just imagine the disappearance of your plane holding suitcase. The loss of your belongings, the consequent disgust, and even the damage caused by a mental tare of someone who got used to pants from others and enjoying everything good that these bags would have inside. Now, the act is committed by a deputy of the Assembly of the Republic is that even the devil would not imagine being possible. Final investigations are awaited and the last court decision on the alleged robberies of the arrival of the arrival. Most importantly, reader friends be careful with your bags…
 
P.S. - Kung Hei Fat Choi</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>What way to go?</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/24/que-caminho-seguir/</link><description>At the end of last year, during the visit to Macau, to chair the inauguration of the new Chief Executive and to inspect Rae, President XI Jinping gave two speeches, highlighting the "three expectations" and the "four hopes" to Macao's future development.
This month, several meetings were held to analyze the speeches of the president, being the most significant the thematic seminar that took place in Beijing on the 9th, where Xia Baolong, the director of the Hong Kong and Macao work cabinet of the committee Communist Party Center of China and the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office with the Council of State has passed important messages. But regardless of the activities and seminars performed, the key to improving the development of Macau is the performance of the RAE government.
Although the integration of Macao and Hengqin is the goal to reach in the next 25 years, the Macao Peninsula, Taipa and Coloane are currently the areas under the direct jurisdiction of Rae de Macao. Hengqin, being an area for “improving the new trading, construction and joint management system and sharing results” between Guangdong and Macau, remains a cooperation zone in China that aims to facilitate the economic diversification of Macao to its official integration in the MSAR . In late October 2024, more than 16,000 Macao residents lived in the deepened cooperation zone between Guangdong and Macao in Hengqin, but the vast majority still live in Macao.
Since the “big consumption award in Macao” ended in December last year, there were continuous requests from residents to resume the benefit plan for electronic consumption to compensate for increased cost of living.
However, local stores, affected by increased consumption of residents in mainland China and the increase in rents of rentals, seek way to try to survive. Although tourists from the interior of China arrive in groups, and do young visitors flood the tourist attractions to take photos, what tangible benefits bring to small and medium -sized local companies? In addition to increasing close contact between residents and compatriots of China in public transport, which other economic benefits come from these tourists?
The expectations and hopes for Macao of the national leader, President XI, are genuine. If Macao performs well, it can become an exemplary model of the principle “a country, two systems”, valuing the city and allowing it to be highlighted. As for the “three expectations” and the “four hopes” underlined by President XI, I have a personal opinion.
Macao, is a bridge that connects today Chinese culture and western culture and has established its position in the national development framework as "a center, a platform and a base." To contribute to the construction of the Great Bay, Macau's main task should be the safeguarding of its characteristics. Only this way can you have the opportunity to make a difference in the international scene. Being patriot and loving Macau are certainly the basic requirements for Macau recruit trained people. Those who grew up in the city would not want to see their resources exhausted.
However, ideas range from person to person, but as long as they do not endanger the interests of Macau or pose a danger to the country, they should be seen as patriots. There are dictated as “the greatness comes from an open mind”, “the one who listens to all parts gets a clear view of the situation” and “only when each drop of water is retained if a river and the confluence of the rivers an ocean can form ”.
In the Chinese classic “I Ching”, you can read “just as celestial bodies never lose energy while describing their orbits, we must also fight constantly for our improvement”, which means that nothing in the world is unchanging. To drive Macau towards the future, we need capable individuals and entrepreneurs.
As for the proper diversification of Macao's economy, the deepened cooperation zone between Guangdong and Macau in Hengqin will undoubtedly be an excellent platform. In the present economic structure of Macao, with the diversification of “1 + 4” industries, the game sector plays a crucial role. In the future, it will be more important to redouble efforts to achieve the progressive development of other sectors than to reduce the scale of game sector operations to achieve and proper diversification of Macao's economy.
Regarding the improvement of the level of governance, it is essential to avoid “nepotism”, widen “the circles of friends” of the governance team and to encourage and support public monitoring of government performance, so that effective and effective governance.
The reforms are the previous condition for opening and opening is the result of the reforms. Taking advantage of Macao's experience on internationalization allows the Government of Masters to help transform the great bay into a “open platform”. If the Government of the MSAR can protect the way of life of citizens they will not naturally have reasons for complaints. If the Government of the MSAR ensures employment, society will not fall into chaos. A fair and equitable society will certainly be peaceful!</description><pubDate>2025-01-24 02:28:13</pubDate></item><item><title>Geogogogosronomy and Macau Creative City in UNESCO Gastronomy</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/22/a-geogastronomia-e-macau-cidade-criativa-em-gastronomia-da-unesco/</link><description>“Geogostronomy Offers an Innovative Lens Through The Exploration of the Deep-Rooted Cultural Connections Between Food, Landscape and People. The Synergy of the Mix and Match From Different Areas Creates A Magical Creativity to Outstand the Taste of Memories Which Seated as the Greatest Piece of a Region. As part of the UNESCO Creative City of Gastronomy in Macao, Lisbon Macau Aim to Bring Together the Tradition and Innovation of Food and Fun Places to Foster the Global Appreciation of Macao. ”
Dr. Christine Hong Barbosa.
Vice President of Marketing &amp; Retail Development of Lisboeta
Geogostronomy is a term that fuses geography and gastronomy, emphasizing the relationship between food culture and its geographical roots. This concept highlights the way local ingredients, cooking methods and cultural influences converge to shape regional kitchens. By examining local gastronomy, researchers and enthusiasts can get information about the history, culture and identity of a community. Geogostronomy thus serves as a bridge that connects culinary practices to environmental and sociopolitical contexts.
Macao, located on the southern coast of China, is a distinct example of geogostronomy in action. Its position as a Historical Trade Port and Culture Cauldron provides a unique scenario for its culinary evolution. The intricate mix of Portuguese and Chinese influences in Macanese cuisine shows how geography can influence food culture, leading to a diversified range of flavors, ingredients and cooking techniques. Macau's gastronomic scene is a vibrant tapestry woven from various cultural wires, particularly those of Chinese and Portuguese origin. The city has iconic dishes such as the Macaense curry, cod and the authentic cream pastels (which are not confused with the eggs that ask for the streets and that we will reveal how such a phenomenon), each reflecting its influences arose. unique historicals.
The fusion of spices, aromatic herbs and kitchen styles creates a distinct gastronomic identity. The use of seasonal and local ingredients enhances Macau's connection to its geographical environment, reinforcing the principles of geogostronomy. The historical context of Macau's gastronomy is remarkable. Portuguese colonization introduced new ingredients and culinary techniques that were part of Chinese food traditions. This cultural exchange has resulted in a rich variety of dishes that combine the best of both worlds. For example, the use of cumin, curry powder and coconut milk reflects Portuguese culinary practices, while techniques such as WOK frying means traditional Chinese cuisine methods.
As a result, Macao's cuisine developed in a sophisticated mixture rather than a mere amalgam of the influences that influence it. Several influential personalities play a crucial role in the formation of Macau's culinary scene. Notable chefs and restorers devoted their efforts to the preservation and innovation of Macanese cuisine. The renowned heads António Neves Coelho and José Avillez are known to modernize the traditional Portuguese dishes, maintaining their authenticity. Your approach serves as an example of how bosses can honor their culinary inheritance, adapting to contemporary trends. They emphasize the use of local ingredients and the appreciation of traditional recipes. Through their initiatives, they promote the concept of geogostronomy as a method for preserving culinary heritage.
His work exemplifies the vital role that cooking chiefs and cooking professionals play in the creative city. The designation of “Macau as a Creative City in Gastronomy of UNESCO” in 2017 further enhances the importance of culinary innovation and heritage. This recognition emphasizes the city's commitment to maintain and promote its rich culinary history, while promoting a sustainable future. The program encourages collaboration between local chiefs, artisans and academics, promoting a culture of gastronomy that reflects Macao's mixed identity. The designation of “Macao as UNESCO's Creative City” had a great impact on various facets of the Macanese society, namely in tourism and the local economies that slowed during the time of the Covid-19 pandemic and begins to be reborn.
Lisbon Macao, for example, has contributed remarkablely being its official view of “being an macao thematic tourist destination, which combines iconic milestones of its collective memory, with unique sino-Portuguese culture to promote its unique cultural identity . Lisbon Macao is proudly aligns with Macau's vision as a creative city of UNESCO's cuisine. The rich cultural history of Macau, which combines Portuguese and Chinese influences, creates a unique and dynamic gastronomic landscape. Lisbon Macau believes that this recognition as a creative city of UNESCO's gastronomy not only celebrates the fusion of flavors and traditions, but also highlights the importance of preserving and innovating local food heritage. With a strong commitment to preserving the Macaense heritage and the promotion of innovative culinary experiences, Lisboeta Macau takes advantage of the company's strengths to promote Macaense-Portuguese culture, supporting the transf by “tourism+gastronomy” through collaboration with the famous boss Portuguese António Coelho in “Angela's Café and Lounge”, highlighting the fusion of Macau's Luso-Chinese heritage with Portuguese traditional cuisine, combining Portuguese classic culinary techniques with innovative creations to offer citizens and visitors a memorable gastronomic experience and contributing to the growing Macao reputation as a vibrant gastronomic center, aligned with its economic development, attracting food enthusiasts, tourists and industry professionals. ”
“Lisbon Macao is committed to supporting the Mashely Government strategy to promote the tourism industry, consistently boosting local economic growth through innovation and transionic integration. Lisbon Line Friends Themed Restaurant Macau “Brown &amp; Friends Cafe &amp; Bistro” and the famous “Cejerdy” crab brand joined the 24th Macao Gastronomic Festival, presenting the various local flavors to global tourists and highlighting them Macao dynamic strengths as a vibrant platform as a creative city of gastronomy from UNESCO. In addition, Lisbon Macau aims to take advantage of the synergies of the “Macao Outdoor Show Space” to present the “Lisbon Night-The Night Market with Macaenses”, encouraging the economic development of the community and immersing visitors in a distinct mixture of Traditional culture and modern innovation, showing the essence of the culture of macaense and Portuguese inspiration, further reinforcing the night economy of Macao. These collaborations help reinforce Macau's position as a creative city that values ​​both culinary tradition and innovation, ensuring long -term sustainability of its gastronomic scene, while promoting economic growth and cultural exchange. ”
Such a distinction, he positioned Macau as a global gastronomic destination, attracting gastronomy enthusiasts and tourists eager for experiencing his unique culinary offers. The tourism sector benefited significantly with this designation. With the increase in international interest in the gastronomy of Macao, several festivals and gastronomic events were organized to present local dishes. These events not only celebrate gastronomic culture, but also offer entrepreneurs and platform companies to show their products. This increase in tourism translates into an increase in economic opportunities for local inhabitants, including the creation of employment in the sectors of hospitality, restoration and homemade food production or almost, weigh the crisis that Macau lives with the low purchasing power of residents that It decreased to the detriment of the continent and the tourist from there that it has reduced equally for the same reasons.
In addition, UNESCO's designation leads the government to sponsor initiatives designed to support sustainable practices in the gastronomy sector. Programs that encourage cuisine without waste demonstrate a commitment to sustainability and community involvement. This paradigm change reflects a growing awareness of the interconnections between gastronomy, environmental management and social responsibility. Culinary education is another critical aspect of Macau's gastronomic narrative. Teaching institutions and cooking schools that should be created urgently not only reserved for the University of Tourism will play a key role in the formation of the next generation of bosses and cooking professionals. As they integrate the traditional Macanese cuisine in their curricula, these institutions foster the appreciation of the local gastronomic culture among students.
This educational approach also encourages innovation, as young bosses experiment with their heritage, giving new life to traditional recipes. Cultural preservation is critical to maintaining the rich culinary history of Macau. Initiatives designed to document traditional recipes and cooking techniques through oral stories and publications ensure the safeguarding of these culinary traditions for future generations. The role of grassroots organizations and community projects centered on culinary heritage reflects the collaborative spirit of geogostronomy, in which local communities actively strive to preserve their unique food crops.
Despite the positive impacts of its designation by UNESCO, Macau's gastronomic sector faces challenges that deserve attention. A significant concern is the potential dilution of traditional practices due to globalization and mass tourism. With the proliferation of international restaurants and fast food chains, there is a risk that local culinary traditions are overshadowed, leading to a loss of cultural identity. In addition, Covid-19 pandemic had a serious impact on the sectors of hotel and tourism. Travel and restoration restrictions have forced many local companies to adapt quickly or risk closing.
Although some establishments have adopted innovative approaches, such as delivery services and virtual cooking classes, others have struggled to survive in a difficult economic scenario. Another challenge lies in the balance between modernization and culinary authenticity. As heads experience melting kitchens and modern kitchen techniques, concerns may arise regarding the integrity of traditional dishes. Finding a balance between innovation and preservation will be essential to maintain the authenticity of Macanese cuisine. Looking to the future, several developments may emerge in the macao gastronomy sector. One of the predictable trends is the growing emphasis on sustainable practices.
As consumers become increasingly aware of the environmental impact of their eating choices, Macao's restaurants and the likes can give priority to local and organic supply. This change promotes a sense of community and responsibility to the environment. In addition, technology is likely to remodel the culinary landscape. Advances in food production, preservation and distribution can provide growth and innovation opportunities. For example, using digital platforms can improve marketing efforts and reinforce connections between consumers and local producers. Innovations such as vertical agriculture and aquaponia can also offer sustainable solutions to supply ingredients in a densely populated city.
Collaboration between cooking professionals, tourist authorities, and macao governments and the provinces of the continent will play a crucial role in defining the evolution of Macao's gastronomic identity. Joint initiatives to promote food culture, organize workshops and present local ingredients can raise the profile of Macanese cuisine on the global stage. These collaboration efforts promote community involvement and can mitigate the risks placed by globalization and pandemic. The future of Macao's cuisine seems promising, with an increasing emphasis on sustainability and innovation. The spirit of collaboration of geogogogosronomy can guide the city in the navigation of these challenges, ensuring that its rich culinary heritage lasts as it adapts to a change world.</description><pubDate>2025-01-22 23:52:06</pubDate></item><item><title>Dom Dinis's face</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/21/o-rosto-de-dom-dinis/</link><description>He has now made seven hundred years to January Seven that died the most emblematic king of a country absent from features and shapes, that in aesthetic and anatomical terms we can consider it emblematically representative, or even dreaming the physical form of certain other representatives, but with it , it happened. We saw him like a reborn Janus in time (but leaving behind what could have been his young face) and it was with some commotion that we looked at him, and this will not go out of the collective memory that was never oblivious to his charm .
Dom Dinis is a bit like legends and having a face fills us with excitement and strange enthusiasm, that, on the exact day of his serious hour, we had it. The region that crowned him is full of those faces, that Atlantic coast of Pinhal and Coastal is emblematic in physiognomic opinion, and these things are aspects to add to the very impact of the moment- he came from a bruh that Avalon's might still complain- they would still complain- and had the undeniable serenity of a poet.
A monarch may be, or not, serene, from a political, state perspective, therefore, but in him we feel something else that does not come in the maps of the references of his own status. Legend has it that it was red, but what came to us was that thirteenth -century being who had died at sixty -three, an age considered of great longevity for the time, which his buried body did not represent as clear the other man who It was, and it was the possible image taken from his sepulcher from Odivelas that came to us as a strange appearance that has silenced us and forced us to a feeling Vénia.
His blue eyes, who say they had greenish reflexes, his forgotten white hair, was what remained and dazzled us: and if we retracted his grandfather Afonso x the wise man, we will seek the same subtle characteristics they made of grandfather and grandson the harp where even today our hearts are aligning. The songs of Santa Maria must also have these blue eyes, which Aragon in his funeral insignia was still his grave, and all this makes us, of course, quite thoughtful. He was the sixth Portuguese king, and never the corners can exercise such order in the demand of his numerical. Perhaps it had been our David star without the recent aspects that define it, when yet, and lovingly, called "his Jews". He also called the Moors, Templars, and all those who fit in his heart.
Let us address Him with the intact respect of seven hundred years, that our matrix does not stop in the roses, nor are our dreams freer than the profound nature of its meaning of mission, where he fulfilled and was Lord, loving for all The lands of his kingdom the women who inspired him: where a Afonso Sanches, a bastard son who followed the footsteps of a father who cultivated his tongue and first imposed it as an official language, followed. Then he had a grandson named Pedro to whom he had been gone at birth with gold coins and other recitals so that his voice was clear as a monarch, but the boy would later be very Gago, a lover of his grandfather, and The most beautiful prince in the world.
From his excrementary son, Afonso IV, had tears and blood battles, but Dom Dinis did not escape the clashes as a man of his time, and his gesture nature must have suffered from the rudeness and blows of these things. He was born on October 9, 1261, was acclaimed king in 1279, and died in 1325 on January 7 so full of bad memories. We must read it to know how to sing, know the green, smell the pins, and know how to build the new vessels. It also had a truculent profile, big nose and tender and tenacious countenance. But the spark that emblees beings no science still knows how to reproduce, identify, and show as a pragmatic domain.

The recovery of real estate and consumer confidence levels in the interior of China will be determining factors
 
Casinos' revenues can grow up to 7 percent in the lunar year of the serpent, depending on the recovery of the Chinese real estate and confidence, but they will be away from the pre-pound peak, analysts told Lusa.
"The biggest positive factor for Macao would be if the Chinese economy grew and consumer confidence levels improve," said Vitaly Umnsky, analyst at the Seaport Research Partners consultancy company.
More than 70 percent of the people who visited the territory in 2024 came from mainland China, whose economic growth reached in 2024 the goal of 5 percent fixed by Beijing.
But Nicholas Chenist, Creditsights analyst, said the company of the Financial Notation Agency group Fitch expects a 4.7 percent slowdown this year, in part due to weak private consumption.
The consumer confidence index in China fell in September to the lowest level of the last 34 years, stressed Jeffrey Kiang, analyst at Consultant CLSA. That is, "if the prospects for Chinese consumers are not good, they will be able to tighten their belt, reduce travel and consumption," including Macao, Nicholas Chen explained.
 
Stimulus policies
The Chinese Communist Party has launched a series of stimulus measures, including the reduction of interest rates and mandatory bank reserves and the anticipation of thousands of millions of its budget in 2025 to fund construction projects.
Beijing also widened a consumer goods exchange system and increased the salaries of millions of civil servants to revive internal demand. "The [Chinese] government has said it will launch more measures to stimulate the economy," said Vitaly Umansky, who expects mainly a recovery of the middle class confidence: "I think it will happen, it's just a matter of time."
Creditsights expects Chinese consumer confidence to rise in the second half of 2025, along with real estate price stabilization, which have been falling for 19 consecutive months.
The issue concerns a lot of Beijing, due to the implications for social stability, since housing is one of the main investment vehicles of families and the real estate sector - adding indirect factors - represents about 30 percent of the Chinese economy.
"There will certainly be some side effect, because part of the measures that are adopted to boost domestic consumption may flow to the Macao game sector," said Nicholas Chen.
The analyst believes that China will still widen the list of cities whose residents can ask for 'individual visas' to visit Hong Kong and Macau, a method used by 35.2 percent of tourists who passed by Macao in 2024.
 
Different views
Vitaly Umansky has no opinion and recalls that since January 1 residents of the neighboring city of Zhuhai can visit Macau once a week and stay up to seven days.
On the other hand, analysts agree that casino revenues will be next year away from the maximum historical 303 billion patacas recorded in 2018.
"One thing is clear: the government aims to moderately growth in revenues in the future," said Jeffrey Kiang, recalling authorities predict gaming revenues of 240 billion in 2025, which would be a 5.8 percent increase. .
“When the Macao government publishes a forecast, it is usually very conservative and is based on a prior discussion with the Chinese central government's connection case in the city, Vitaly Umnsky said.
The analyst does not believe that Beijing has some measure to control the resuming of casinos, similar to the campaign that began with the arrest of the leader of the world's largest VIP betting company in November 2021.
Former Suncity Executive Director Alvin Chau Cheok wa, was convicted in January 2023 to 18 years in prison for illicit exploitation of play and secret society, in a case that dropped from 85 to 18 the number of licenses for game promoters, known as 'junkets'. “Much of the reprehensible behavior in Macau has disappeared with the junkets. As long as things like that don't happen again, I don't expect any kind of short -term campaign, ”said Umansky.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Traffic | Lawyer appeals to the end of “moral judgments” with images</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/27/transito-advogado-apela-ao-fim-de-julgamentos-morais-com-imagens/</link><description>The causal Luís Ho Ka considers that the use of traffic chambers can lead to cases in court, and that the images captured must be sent to the authorities, rather than shared on social networks
 
Lawyer Luís Ho Ka has defends the use of traffic surveillance chambers by drivers, but appeals to the government to take steps to avoid the use of images for “moral judgments”. The opinion of the causal was shared to the newspaper or Mun, following an incident at the head of the Portuguese School of Macao, in which images of a lawyer of Portuguese nationality were shared.
Heard by the newspaper or Mun, the lawyer considered that recording videos by chambers installed on vehicles may be important, namely when there are accidents and the need to activate the automobile insurance. However, Ho Ka has pointed out that the vehicle cameras cannot be transformed into a mobile surveillance system used to make “moral judgments” on social networks.
Ho also explained that the images captured by the vehicles must be delivered to the authorities, instead of being published online, and that those responsible for recording should only refer them to the authorities, following the legal proceedings provided. If the images have public interest, they can be used. However, if the use of images exceeds the scope of the process and investigations of the authorities, as is the case with publications on social networks, and if there are elements that can be considered as insulting or defamatory, then the person responsible for capturing and disclosure may face Criminal liability.
 
Legal problems
Luís Ho Ka Hou also indicated that, according to the judicial perspective, the appropriate use of recorded images in traffic is captured the accidents, to hold it and cooperate with the authorities, in case it is necessary to collect evidence.
If there is no consent of the recorded people, and if the content is published on social networks for moral judgments, then we are facing cases that are hardly under the appropriate recording, which may lead to violation of the law of personal data protection or other image rights.
Ho ka has also warned that “judgments” on social networks can cause damage to the rights to privacy and the good name of the parties involved.
About two weeks ago a driver was captured in traffic, after passing a red light, parking in a forbidden place and making an obscene gesture with children. The images, which allowed the driver to identify, were shared online, which held a campaign against the visa, including with dismissal requests from the employer, as well as several hate comments with xenophobic expressions.</description><pubDate>2025-01-27 10:51:34</pubDate></item><item><title>STD | Dismantled six illegal pensions in 12 days</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/24/dst-desmanteladas-seis-pensoes-ilegais-em-12-dias/</link><description>The Directorate of Tourism Services (STD) set up an illegal pensions operation, between January 1 and 12, in the way of preparation for the Lunar New Year's holidays, in which six pensions that were illegally operated were dismantled .

The year 2024 was also a period when the amount of fines added almost 16 million patacas compared to the previous year. Last year, the total amount of the fines was almost 189.8 million patacas, a 9.12 percent increase compared to the same period. Despite the increase in the amount ease by the authorities, the infractions to the road traffic law and the road code kept practically the same level, with a slight rise of 0.4 percent to 703.8 thousand occurrences.
In the chapter of fines, the parking lot continued to dominate, with 618,260 fines, the very broad majority for illegal parking on public roads. Still, parking fines decreased by 2.38 percent compared to 2023. However, the number of blocked vehicles increased by 24.5 percent by 2024 for a total of 2,226.
At the opposite pole, CPSP's 2024 data reveal the return of a classic, with the climb almost 48 percent of taxi drivers' irregularities for a total of 870 cases.
Regarding drivers caught driving under the influence of alcohol, the authorities accounted for 170 drunk people, an annual climb of almost 7 percent. Of these 170 people, 155 were male.
One of the statistics that has been increasing in recent times in the chapter of fines is the pedestrians that cross the road without complying with traffic rules. Last year, the authorities fined 7,460 pawns, totaling a 58.5 percent increase.</description><pubDate>2025-01-24 01:59:22</pubDate></item><item><title>Zelensky vs Zelensky</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/31/zelensky-vs-zelensky/</link><description>10/27/22
A renovated Ukrainian, with the same name of the president, guilty Zelensky about the extension of the conflict that destroyed his village. Zelensky, the village, who has never left his land, now lives mortified because his favorite gravedigger died in the bomber.
This Zelensky, the village, represents half the world that reproves the other Zelensky, the villain, for not wanting to negotiate with Putin.
Negotiate what? The invader enters us around the house, pies us the wife and daughter (cf. recent UN report on Ukraine violations in this “special operation”), an act that forced us to watch, and then we tell him: High There we are for peace, but we have to negotiate: You haven't said the name you want to give to children!
A peace that is not worthy is but a cessation of rights. As severe as Russophobia that Putin inflicts his people.

In a lunch with several guests I hear a friend, who declares himself a spiritist, explaining about the particularities of his belief, in a serene and balanced way, would even say, without "irrationalism". He discussed long and serenely, devoid of any fanatical proselytizing. “Here is someone to whom belief brought weighting!” I thought, a rare alliance.
However, at one point a phrase that horrify me. He says, “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!” And I enter the voracious fauces of holism. Because holismo has a pathological aspect like all good things, a side of shadow.
Two examples: In Hinduism there is less sensitivity to existential dramas, if that child suffers in this life this is only an expression of the strict karmic symmetry, an effect of the acts she committed in her previous life. In Africa it is not accepted that death may have been accidental, and many women are accused by the dead family of having caused her husband's death, in an act of manifest dementia, and, in the blatant majority of cases, in a huge injustice to his wife - Madness that spreads and infiltrates the social fabric.
Buddhism has introduced compassion and Christianity to Caritas, trying to break with this logic, but in many other beliefs and religions the cage of causalities prevails over sensitivity to experience, the need to respond to the now.
It is a tremendous logic that transforms the world into a platonic stage, where we are just the shadows of something -an inextricable law -in a determinism that calcines all singularities, but strangely fascinates many.
The conquest of modernity has anchored in the conquest of chance and random, subtracting the incidences of a life to this fierce determinism that closed the world in a web. When the Renaissance freed the body from the influence of the stars, at this moment sexuality was relieved of guilt and individualism and their volition could emerge.
There is an unambiguous moral implication in the phrase “there is no chance, nothing happens by chance!”, Which should function as a key to self-knowledge and self-judgment, however, this phrase is managed to seek a reason for Things abroad to us in the other. It is an alibi.
There is a holistic temptation in the world today, as in the Middle Ages there was a satanic temptation, without great reflection on its consequences. Because it is not enough we want to connect everything in a resonant chain of affection. Even the most unexpected: affection itself can kill.
I realize, thanks to this cultured, balanced, intelligent woman, that “the combat” moved at the beginning of this century. One of the great misconceptions of the twentieth century was the false dichotomy between "rationalism and irrationalism", a debate that extended to all fields, including art. First, rationality was confused (the positive side of reason) with rationalism (the pathological feature of reason), and articulated in this lack of discernment was confused irrationalism with freedom. Almost all the art of the twentieth century, with surrealism to the head, worked in this error. The fallacy still exists despite having consolidated the emergence of 'irrationalism' and the consequent relativist currents that followed it. Essentially much of what happened in the twentieth century, it turned around this shock between two paradigms: rationalism versus irrationalism.
Now, I see, the indetermination, chance, the random of the terrible temptation of the causal cage. Holism, in its pathological feature, can be the reductionism that is the way it puts the way as a new 'eschatological narrative'.
Is it "by chance" that holism emerges at the moment when neo-liberalism and its cynical contempt for the human person besides all freedoms, all acquired rights?
Holistic consciousness has brought positively a greater ecological awareness but followed by scholastic rigor drifting reality under the blanket of a determinism that is much more than inconvenience: all great authoritarian ideologies are holistic.
My friend will know how to combine her holistic and transpersonal belief with the freedom and responsibility that every moment asks us - but how many will make the destruction, under a law that explains and encompasses?
How many will not be abandoned to what it is?
The awareness of the indeterminate brings tragic conscience, as the Greeks knew, but also brings the will and the courage of the decision. And of this we cannot abdicate.
In addition, as Drummond shows in Carlos Drummond de Andrade's poem “Quadrilha”:
«João loved Teresa who loved Raimundo/ who loved Maria who loved Joaquim who loved Lili/ who did not love anyone./ John went to the United States, Teresa to the convent,/ Raimundo died of disaster, Maria stayed to aunt,/ Joaquim suicidou -If and Lili married J. Pinto Fernandes/ that had not entered the story. »
Real always runs outside the track, in full exteriority to our concepts. This is what is worth a J. Pinto Fernandes at the exact moment we thought we had everything under control.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Nobel and others</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/17/do-nobel-e-outros/</link><description>9/10/22
Reading many people's reactions when you announced the Nobel Prize in this year's literature, I couldn't help but remember this repair of Jean-Pierre Siméon, compared to another Nobel Prize: «An editor of a large newspaper Daily National Wrote wrote Five lines of indignation because the Nobel Prize of Literature was awarded to Thomas Traströmer, a complete unknown. But unknown to whom? How did not occur to this patented and paid literary columnist to do his work, that his apparent ignorance was a matter of incorrect professional conduct? Tranströmer was translated into many languages, it was available in French. »
There is always the choir of those waiting for the announcement of the prize to complain about not being invited to the jury of it, there is a subgroup of Irados that professes “I never read and I will not bother to read”; It is an uncommon fauna, which inhabits social networks.
I don't always know all the winners - I was unaware of the existence of Louise Glück, who I find a great poet, or the Olga Tokarczuk, for example - but that only brings me the comfort of knowing that the world is not a soap opera where everyone is He knows and the joy of recognizing that the gauge of the world is not measured with my short measure and that on the contrary it gives me a new opportunity to face the unknown and learn from him.
And perhaps the most cretin of reactions was the smart one who wrote, but there are still those who read French? Confirming only that today there is a new kind of ignorance that fires with a displeasure: the one who only read English.
I also preferred that in French, Pascal Quignard, Linda reads, or even Sollers, or, among the new ones, Mathias Énard, but that does not take dignity to the work of Annie Ernaux (and it would be enough to have been awarded. Les années ”). There are books of her that I like less, like the vulgar "a simple passion," but this happens with almost every authors, they have a channel books and others that are like intervals in their itinerary. I advise reading a beautiful book of interviews with her, "L'Ecriture Comme un couteau".

Yesterday came an article in Maputo's morning “News”, realizing that the Pen Club Narrative Prize was assigned to my wife, Teresa Noronha, for her soap opera “Tornado”, which had already had the Maria Velho Award Coast.
The summary they made of the book does not even deserve comments, by pathetic, but what matters to highlight is the note of disqualification about their "Mozambicanity" by calling it Luso-Mozambican. It is not inaccurate, but for those who know the context, it is a dirty touch.
Because finally, following the same logic, Adelino Timothy should be called Tsonga-Mozambican, to Álvaro Taruma Ronga-Mozambican, and Macua-Mozambican to writers who are from the north, etc., etc. Which is not reported to happen.
At the beyond moment, in the soap opera, she writes:
«Our color has never been dominant. In colonial time we were not white, we were ripped from monories, gone mugs, the pejorative term to speak of a son of Goes and Portuguese. In the postcolonial period, I was not black and if, in Lisbon, they took me by Brazilian or Cape Verdean, already in France were lost in cogitations of where they would be and amazed when they found out it was African. There I had to explain my DNA's wanderings before relying on moorms. It took me a long time to accept that it was so because yes, and that it was no curse that were so; On the contrary, I could even discover intense patterns of fantasy and freedom in this shrewd cloak that is our genealogy… »
In the current Mozambique it is white… and this is overlapping it soon to what it does or what it is.
It is sad, but as Naipaul warned, through these stops the race is everything and is soaked in it as deeply as, elsewhere, in religion.

Bruno Latour, an anthropologist who studied the sciences and their procedures and legitimations, law, technique and religions died and entertained themselves to turn the guts to the dogmas of the “modern”. For him the place, the expert's function, was more defined by the perplexity he embodied than for the supposed truth he would support him.
He proposed, as an alternative to the kinds of multiculturalism and his mistaken password "all different all the same", the return to "diplomacy", given precisely, not from the presupposition that "we are unified because participants of the same nature" but to be highlighted simply that we "we do not yet share an ordinary world"; It is necessary to deal frontally with the "abyss of disagreement" that separates us, rather than wanting to delude it.
And about politics said, disassessedly:
«If transparency is required from the politician, we kill him; If one requires fidelity to what the other was or he says, kills him; If a mimetic relationship is required between what the crowd wants and what its representative says, the representation is killed. These must, therefore, by definition, betray, deceive, modify, distort the word. Without this ability to double the word and betray, political language would not exist. I put the perfectly plausible hypothesis that political vocabulary will become as inaccessible as the religious language of the last twenty, three or fifty years. (in “UN Monde Pluriel plus Commun”). I believe it will be missed to decipher this frantically complex world that fit us.</description><pubDate>2022-10-17 02:18:03</pubDate></item><item><title>The yo -yo</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/30/o-fuxi/</link><description>O my friends, companions of these funeral trips for countries as old as the stars and the moon, and as strange as the profound interior of our disgraceful souls, - which starts still awaits us, that secret spells we will still have to overcome, what horrors will be erected before our dilated pupils of amazement and terror?
Increasingly close to our precarious existences, howling the war monster, which threatens to merge humanity with the earth, incessantly traveled by the squalid spectrum of hunger and the invisible evil of ten thousand pests.
O human human, who cries superior to his own nature, but then reveals to you, once and again, unable to simply order your existence and do not understand that you are possessed by the fickle wrath and are slave to your own ambition! Do not be content with the white jade or the light gold, there is no treasure that gives you your inextinguishable thirst for other men, animals and things; for in you an eternal anguish in you; in you crawl the expelled snakes; For you grows, powerful and impossible, the very fertile ivy of evil!
This is perhaps why on the mound they call the white deer, where one of the eight immortals in sacred mount was evolved through the skies to Penglai, inhabits the fuxa, a bird whose form resembles that of the rooster, although topped by a human head. What strange copulas, what monstrous amplexes, what terrible procedures will have occurred to make the existence of this animal sinister possible? We do not know, but it is enough for our exhausted mind to dare to raise an answer, so we soon feel the skin traveled by horrendous goose bumps and the heart trigger in paraded, which wild horse beaten by the night whip of fear, oblivious to reins and containment.

«Every man morally is one and absolute; But you have to live with your personality to mitigate. (…) Coexistence is only possible among people reduced to a negative or hollow presence, which is constantly giving in. Hence, the emptiness of society, a huge ghost composed of numerous deceased. An upper man is antisocial or criminal. Its destination is jail and desert.
He is in thinking about whether she reflects here about the political-social conditioning that gagging, and worse, in a sad country as Portugal was in the midst of Estado Novo (and the book is from 1931) where any possibilities of spontaneousness and frankness were coarcet in relationships in relations Human, or only lends the behavior of men (oppressed) a metaphysical frame, a "essence", therefore declared in the presumption of each being, in isolation, "one and absolute". Sometimes, to an excess of spirituality (or longing), it adds to Pascoaes to lack the world. He is a great poet, but he is a poet who takes gray-Jewish ampoules and is therefore written amiiude on a programmatic furor, ceasing to have pores; There is often a glass between him and the real, the same one who made him wring the Ballet, 1921: “Everything is ghost. There are only clouds, clouds of voices, clouds of souls, afflictions and tragedies! Clouds and more clouds, appearances and more appearances! It is a divine lightning that pierces them, the instant appearance that arises and throws us to the ground, dazzled! »
Sometimes I would like to remind him, as António Sérgio did in the article “Regeneration and Tradition, Moral and Economy”, which dedicated to Easter: “Easter, Easter My Dear Friend: You are a pure, excellent and very noble poet, but one Also victim of this social environment, like us all: this horrible isolation that you praise and I malice.
"As a child, he stole two melos," says Jacinto do Prado Coelho, stole him from a nest, and throb his lifetime remorse for it. The person, few more mischief is known to him. Only in Álvaro de Campos sprouts a twinge of evil and obscenity: “Oh, and ordinary and dirty people, who always seems the same,/ who employs profanity as usual words,/ whose children steal at the grocery door/ and whose daughters At eight years-and I think this is beautiful and I love him! -/ masturbate decent -looking men on the stairs. » (Ode triumphal).
Both poets beaten by a certain idea of ​​holiness, they were identical to the inability of breaking the siege of the skin with the overflow of the dike, the same curse of sublimating Eros's concrete ferocity with the mansuity of the verses.
Evidently, they are the two 'Bigger Than Life', but sometimes unnerves to watch, from my rank of hatter at the Procrastinators Club, to the tantrums between them, just to see who occupies, in the internal organization, the place of president and Treasurer.
Although a person has guessed more, for example, this he wrote in the least known martial ode and that is declining in the situation we live today, differently, with the heart in his hands:

The High employee corruption investigation office (CIO) has announced that it has transferred the case to the prosecutor, which has the power to formally accuse a South Korean head of state.
Cio considers that Yoon conspired with then-National Defense Minister Kim Yong-Hyun and other military officers to start a riot, declaring martial law on the night of December 3. It argues, moreover, that Yoon has abused power by sending troops to the National Assembly (Parliament) to prevent deputies from revoking martial law.
The Public Prosecution Service now has 11 days to decide whether or not to start the requested process. If Yoon is considered guilty of leading an insurrection, a crime for which a president has no immunity in the country, he may be sentenced to life imprisonment or the death penalty.
Yoon is in custody at the Seoul Detention Center in Uiwang, south of Seoul, since January 15. The Constitutional Court is simultaneously made a judgment to determine whether or not to ratify the dismissal approved by parliamentarians on December 14.
If the highest court in South Korea confirms the impeachment, early presidential elections have to be called within 60 days after the court decision. Yoon refuses to witness in the investigation into the alleged crime of rebellion.
Yoon Suk-Youol surprised the country on December 3 by declaring martial law, a measure reminiscent of black days of the South Korean military dictatorship and that justified with the intention of protecting the country from “North Korean Communist forces” and “Eliminate elements hostile to the state”.
Pressured by the deputies and thousands of protesters, Yoon was forced to revoke the decision hours later.</description><pubDate>2025-01-24 02:30:38</pubDate></item><item><title>Afghanistan | Beijing calls for severe punishment for authors of the murder of Chinese citizen</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/24/afeganistao-pequim-pede-punicao-severa-para-autores-do-assassinio-de-cidadao-chines/</link><description>China yesterday appealed to the Afghan authorities to do an "exhaustive investigation" and "severely punish" those responsible for the murder on Wednesday of a Chinese citizen who worked on a gold mine in Takhar's Afghan province.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said yesterday at a press conference that Beijing is “deeply shocked” with the attack. "China is against all forms of terrorism," said the spokesman, appealing to the "repression of the Islamic State and other terrorist organizations listed by the UN Security Council."
"China will continue to pay close attention to the security situation in Afghanistan and to support Afghan authorities in combating all forms of terrorist violence and maintaining security and stability in the country," Mao added, urging the Afghan government to Take the necessary measures "to ensure the safety of citizens and Chinese organizations in the country."
According to local police, the victim worked in a gold mine in the region, which borders Tajiquistan. A local branch of the Islamic State Islamic Group claimed the authorship of the attack. China is one of the few international actors that has maintained diplomatic relations with Afghanistan since the Taliban reached power in August 2021.
The two countries share a small international border of just 76 kilometers in the eastern part of the so -called Wajan corridor, a remote passage in the Pamir Range.

Folder spokesman He Yadong said at a press conference that his country "always maintained a consistent position" about increased rates. "China is willing to work with the US to put economic and commercial relations between the two countries in a stable, healthy and sustainable direction," he said.
Asked whether his ministry has already reported with the new US administration team, he said China "always maintains contact with competent authorities" in the United States.
Chinese diplomacy assured on Wednesday that "there are no winners in a trade war," after Trump advanced that he is considering imposing 10 percent rates on Chinese imports in retaliation for the flow of Fentanil.
"We are talking about a 10 percent rate based on the fact that they are sending Fentanil to Mexico and Canada," Trump told journalists at the White House on Tuesday.

Authorities said that, from this year, mutual funds should increase their participation in national actions, called Actions A, at least 10 percent per year, over the next three years.
Commercial insurance funds will have to invest 30 percent of their new annual awards in the actions of action starting this year, they added.
"This means that at least several hundred thousand long -term yuan millions of yuan will be added [to the shareholder market] every year," said Wu Qing, chairman of China's Securities Regulatory Committee.
“The implementation of the various measures of the plan will further increase the capital's capital funds' capital affectation capacity, constantly expand the scale of investment, improve the supply and structure of funds in the capital market and consolidate the good conditions to The recovery of the capital market, ”he explained.
The Chinese Communist Party announced this measure just before the biggest holiday of the year in China, the Lunar New Year, which begins on Wednesday, January 29. It is a time when families tend to increase spending on meals, travel and cash gifts for adult children and young people.
Hong Kong and Shanghai markets climbed after the announcement, with the Shanghai Index composite initially winning about 1.5 percent, although in the middle of the session it was rising 0.8 percent. Hang Seng Kong's Hang Seng Index lost its first gains and remained virtually unchanged.
Chinese shareholder markets have reached their maximum value before the Asian financial crisis and have since kept far below this level. The lack of assessment in the prices of actions, along with the fall in property prices, diminished investors' confidence, raising deflationary risks in the second largest economy in the world.
Advances and Reforms
To date, Chinese government efforts to make people spend more and save less have been mitigating success. An initiative to promote the purchase of energetically efficient vehicles and appliances through the payment of subsidies to consumers who deliver old versions of these articles increased sales. But action prices stopped after a brief recovery at the end of last year.
Wu stated that pension funds will be required to reformulate the way they evaluate their performance and that companies will be encouraged to perform more action repurchase and pay higher dividends to provide better income to shareholders.
“This is a very important institutional advance for the entry of medium and long term funds in the market. It can be said that it solves a problem that has been solved for many years, ”he added.
"Sales of the main shareholders and the high market volatility have impaired Chinese financial squares," said Law Meng, Chinese action analyst at UBS Securities, in a comment widespread yesterday.
"The willingness of long -term investors to participate in the scholarship market has decreased," he added. "The proposal to reform the management of market value directly addresses this issue, because it is directly related to the sense of gain of investors," he said.</description><pubDate>2025-01-24 02:15:29</pubDate></item><item><title>Ukraine | Beijing and Brasilia highlight “growing consensus” to find political solution</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/24/ucrania-pequim-e-brasilia-destacam-consenso-crescente-para-encontrar-solucao-politica/</link><description>The two nations continue to effort to find a solution that end the conflict in Ukraine.

The Republican leader said he said "the other day" with Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, and that he told him that he did not want this "crap" in the country. Last year, about 70,000 deaths from excessive consumption of synthetic opiate were recorded in the United States.</description><pubDate>2025-01-22 23:55:36</pubDate></item><item><title>Sunac | First real estate prosecutor to restructure debt</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/22/sunac-primeiro-promotor-imobiliario-a-reestruturar-divida/</link><description>Plans to pay the debt of more than 15 billion Yuan were approved by creditors
 
Sunac, once one of China's greatest real estate promoters, became the first sector company to successfully restructure its debt issued in the “onshore”, after being able to support creditors.
In a statement sent to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, where it is quoted, the company stated that the creditors of these obligations, which was missing about 15.4 billion Yuan, approved the plan presented by the company.
The proposal provided for a reduction to less than half of this amount and offered several options, such as prolongation of obligations until 2034, with no obligation to start paying them by 2029.
Sunac had already been a pioneer among Chinese promoters when, in October 2023, he obtained the approval of the Hong Kong court for the agreement he had reached with creditors to restructure about $ 10.2 billion of debt issued in the markets International (“offshore”).
The Standard &amp; Poor's (S&amp;P) debt notation agency stated at the time that Sunac was to pave the way for the offshore debt restructuring of other Chinese promoters in similar situations, since it not only sought to extend obligations to gain time, but also Included instruments such as debt swaps.
However, on March 10, the state asset manager Cinda filed a settlement against the company in Hong Kong for non -payment of a $ 30 million loan. The first hearing was scheduled for March 19.
This case is distinguished from similar ones, such as those who also face in hong Kong giants such as Evergrande or Country Garden, because the complainant is a Chinese state company and not a private creditor, although Beijing has repeatedly promised measures to stabilize The real estate market in recent months.
Wound
The prosecutor's actions in Hong Kong fell more than 25 percent following this news. Yesterday, despite the agreement with the 'ONShore' creditors, they fell 2.41 percent during the morning of the session.
Sunac had a total liability of about 896 billion Yuan at the end of the first half of 2024, during which a net loss of 14.957 billion yuan.
The financial situation of many Chinese real estate companies worsened after Beijing was announced in August 2020 restrictions on access to bank financing for prosecutors who had accumulated a high level of debt, including Evergrande, with a liability of almost 330,000 million dollars.</description><pubDate>2025-01-22 23:53:31</pubDate></item><item><title>Afghanistan | Talibans claim that Chinese citizen was killed</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/22/afeganistao-talibas-afirmam-que-cidadao-chines-foi-morto/</link><description>A Chinese citizen was killed in northeastern Afghanistan, announced yesterday a Taliban police spokesman, although the murder of foreigners was rare in the country, especially since the removal of US troops in 2021.
Police spokesman Mohammed Akbar in Takhar province said the man was killed on Tuesday night by "unknown people," when he was on his way to Dasht-e-Qala district.
Akbar said the Chinese citizen, nicknamed Li, traveled to an unknown destination with his interpreter and without informing security authorities. The interpreter was not injured in the incident, according to Akbar. “Police began their initial investigation. Stay tuned for more detail, ”added Akbar without providing more information.

Asked about the incident, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Mao Ning said yesterday that he is not familiar with the matter. "I believe that the China Embassy in Afghanistan will do everything within your reach to protect the safety of Chinese citizens and we will follow the situation," he said.
China is of particular importance to the Taliban, who are cutting foreign investment and regional alliances in the face of their continuing isolation in the international scene due to their repression against women.</description><pubDate>2025-01-22 23:50:14</pubDate></item><item><title>Francisco Leandro, author and professor at the University of Macao: “Support from the country reinforces the role of Macao platform”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2024/12/16/francisco-leandro-autor-e-professor-na-universidade-de-macau-apoio-do-pais-reforca-o-papel-de-plataforma-de-macau/</link><description>Gang Wen interview with China Daily newspaper
Francisco Leandro, an associate professor at the Faculty of Social Sciences at the University of Macao, states that the nation's support has allowed the MSA to serve as the Center for Commerce, Investment and Cultural Interactions between China and Portuguese -speaking communities.
 
 
How do you see Macau's development since your return to the homeland? Among the city's achievements, which ones impressed him most? What about its sector, has there been an important progress in the last 25 years?
The 25th anniversary of Macau's return to the homeland and the creation of the Special Administrative Region of Macao is a significant milestone in the history of the region, reflecting a successful diplomatic process and demonstrating its current political and economic stability. Currently, RAE de Macao enjoys political stability and is deeply integrated into national development plans. The governance of the city under the beginning of “a country, two systems” allowed him to maintain a high degree of autonomy, while aligning himself with national policies. This integration facilitated Macao's economic growth, making it a vital part of the country's broader economic strategy.
Macao's socioeconomic development strategy is consecrated in the policy “a center, a platform, a base”. This picture aims to position MSA as a world center of tourism and leisure, reinforcing its attraction as a global tourist destination. In addition, MSAR acts as a platform for economic and commercial cooperation between China and Portuguese -speaking countries, promoting international trade and cultural exchange. Rae de Macao is also becoming a base of exchange and cultural cooperation, promoting cultural interactions and the conservation of heritage. This multifaceted approach supports Macao's integration into national development plans and reinforces its global presence. The unique position of MSA as a bridge between China, in particular the great Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Bay, and Portuguese-speaking countries underline their strategic importance.
The concept of “a platform, three centers” enhances Macao's role in promoting economic and cultural exchange. This platform allowed the city to serve as a platform for trade, investment and cultural interactions, reinforcing the ties between China and the Lusophone world.
Macau's development as a tourism and leisure center, along with the promotion of four main industries - conventions and exhibitions, cultural and creative industries, traditional Chinese medicine and modern financial services - diversified its economy. These initiatives not only boosted economic activity, but also reinforced the global attraction of Macau as a tourist destination.
The central government adopted a series of policies for Macao. Is there any specific measure that has benefited your sector? As?
The interior of China and the Macao Economic Economic Partnership Agreement (Cepa) play a crucial role in the great bay and in the promotion of ties with Portuguese -speaking countries. By promoting commercial and economic cooperation, the strain reinforces the position of MSA as a bridge between China and Lusophone countries. This agreement facilitates access to the market, investment and cultural exchange, promoting Macao as an international business center. In addition, the strain supports the integration of Macau in the Great Bay area, contributing to regional development and economic diversification. This strategic role underlines the importance of Macau in the broader economic and diplomatic initiatives in the country.
The promotion of higher education in RAE de Macao also played a crucial role in its development. In investing in education and research, Macau contributed to the objectives of national development and was positioned as a center of academic excellence. This bet on education has allowed to create a skilled labor, essential to sustain economic growth and innovation. The University of Macao is highly considered in global academic rankings. It was classified in 180th place at the World University Rankings 2025 by Times Higher Education, and 245th at QS World University Rankings 2025. In addition, the University of Macao is ranked 262nd in the best global universities by US News &amp; World Report. These classifications reflect the university's commitment to excellence in teaching and research, particularly in areas such as Artificial Intelligence, Engineering and Social Sciences. The university's strong international collaboration and innovative investigation contribute significantly to their estimated global position.
This year is the third anniversary of the creation of the Guangdong-Macau in-depth cooperation zone in Hengqin. In your opinion, how should Macau continue to take advantage of the advantages of the zone to develop himself and the education sector?
Hengqin's cooperation zone is one of the main objectives of Macao's modernization efforts. This zone has been fundamental to boosting innovation and economic diversification, providing a space for new industries and promoting a narrower integration with the continent. The area exemplifies Macau's commitment to modernization and its strategic role in regional development.
Macao is a unique mix of Chinese and Portuguese cultures. In your opinion, how can this merger help the nation to reinforce communication with the international community and tell the good stories of China?
Macao is a fascinating mix of cultures, where the East meets the West in a unique and harmonious way. His linguistic landscape is a testimony of his multicultural heritage. The Chinese is the official language and the Portuguese language can be used for official purposes, reflecting the historical ties of Macao with Portugal and its Chinese roots. English is also widely spoken, especially in business and tourism, which makes Macau a truly multilingual society.
The legal system of MSAR is another domain in which this cultural mixture is evident. Based on the Portuguese Civil Law System, it was adapted to the local context under the “one country, two systems” principle. This double legal system allows a unique mix of Chinese and Western legal traditions, ensuring that Macau's legal environment is familiar to its residents and accessible to international companies.
Macao's approach to the extrajudicial resolution of commercial conflicts further enhances its multicultural policy. The city offers various arbitration and mediation services that serve both local and international parts, promoting the efficient and friendly resolution of disputes. Macao's open city policy and multicultural attitude are the key to its success as a global center. The city welcomes people from around the world, promoting a diverse and inclusive community. This opening is reflected in its festivals, its gastronomy and their daily lives, where different cultures coexist and enrich each other. Essentially, the mix of language, legal systems and multicultural attitudes of Macau makes it a unique and dynamic place that establishes bridges between cultures and promotes global bonds.
What achievements would you like to see by Macau in the next 25 years?
In short, Macao's future is brilliant, with greater integration with mainland China, its central role in international trade, diversified economic growth and a strong global presence. These elements will ensure Macao's continuous success and development at the world scene. The 25th anniversary of Macao's return to the Fatherland celebrates not only a successful diplomatic achievement, but also the continuous contributions of the region to national and world development. Macao's strategic initiatives and their integration in national plans underline their importance as a dynamic region and facing the future.</description><pubDate>2024-12-16 02:20:12</pubDate></item><item><title>António Antunes, cartoonist: “Sometimes I consider myself an artist”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2024/12/12/antonio-antunes-cartoonista-as-vezes-considero-me-um-artista/</link><description>It's called Antonio Antunes, but signs her cartoons simply as Antonio. For 50 years it has characterized today using drawing and humor, most of them in the Express. In an interview, the cartoonist, who designed the days of the April 25, regrets that today young cartoonists do not have so many opportunities to sing in their career
This 50 -year adventure is already long dedicated to Cartoon. Have you ever thought you were going to do this for so many years?
No. Things were happening, and the result is this. There were not even perspectives to have a plan. Portugal has not been a country that greatly favors this type of activities.
He did training at António Arroio school during the Estado Novo period. What was it like to learn arts at a time when the country [Portugal] was so gray, with limits to creativity?
We mainly learned techniques, work or composition. Now creativity is something else. Not only was she very limited, but it's not something to sell either. There are no courses to take artists, there are courses that give us notions about painting composition or techniques, or colors. But that alone is not enough. Then there needs to be anything beyond what is academic. In the arts there is always anything that escapes even if you learn everything. Creativity is a strange thing because there is no rule.
Is Antonio considered an artist?
(Hesitates) Sometimes I consider.
He has had many controversial cartoons, namely Pope John Paul II with the condom in his nose. What were the cartoons that forced you to make the biggest waist play or deal with more pressures?
Maybe it's my happiness, but my problems are never a priori, but to posteriori. So far I have not been very limited in what I can do in the newspaper [Expresso]. Now, when things go out, sometimes have consequences. In Portugal it was the issue of condom in the Pope, internationally other things. This cartoon continues to move.
What was it like to deal with all this controversy?
This cartoon [Pope John Paul II] was controversial because they wanted to be so. That went very well and did not generate any ranks. Then there was a conservative movement within the church that wanted to make it a controversy, three weeks began to excite that, to make a petition. The man who led the Catholic forces said he expected a million signatures, but fortunately he got only 29,000, and the difference made the mountain not a mouse Parisse. It was even discussed at the Assembly [of the Republic]. It is a controversy a lot of little, even more, 30 years later, when the church itself is changing its point of view on this matter, namely with this Pope [Francis], fortunately. In the face of what led me to do this cartoon, I did it again. The Pope's statements at the time were public, they were not even hidden, inside walls, and spoke to the whole world, so also to me. I felt injured, that it made no sense. I think the Pope's attitude at that moment was criminal at the Pico da Aida and in Africa. It was of huge insensitivity and foolishness.
Is Cartoon a throwing weapon, a form of expression?
Throw of throwing is a hard expression of too much, but the cartoon is, in fact, the way I express myself. There are my colleagues who make articles, but I make drawings.
What other cartoons highlights, for what they brought you?
The first one that sensitized me was the one who made me win the world's largest salon in the world [major prize of the XX Salon International of Cartoon, Montreal, 1983], from this corner that is Portugal. A hall that had over a thousand participants, and gaining it was very good. I was safer, confident, because from then on they could continue to do things. This first cartoon also gave controversy, the “Warsaw Ghetto in Shatila”, in which I use the known photograph of the ghetto, a Jewish kid raised, harassed by Nazi soldiers, and in the cartoon the kid is Palestinian and Israeli soldiers. [The controversy was] with all the voices of the Jews, who are experts in this, making a lot of noise, with a certain tone of victimization, even if they are attacking. A hall director said he tried to change the vote, such is the weight of Jewish lobby, but failed.
This cartoon could be drawn today again.
I already published it again. Unfortunately it is not out of date.
But do you feel that much of what you designed about today is repeated, in a sign that the story is cyclical?
There is a resistance to change. One of the merits of the cartoonist is to be able to see ahead of time, or over time if you want. I have the invasion of Crimea made in 2014, and I assume that vision. It was above, and others did it later. There are other examples.
It begins to do cartoon after April 25, 1974, there a little there in the aftermath of the revolution. Do you feel that, in a way, has inaugurated the discipline of the Political Cartoon in Portugal?
Perhaps. But I'm not very clear about it, because before me there was a great designer, João Abel Manta, a fantastic chart, which had a huge difference from us, because we were kids and he already had a culture that allowed him that. But there is a less good side, because he did political propaganda. He was a man of the Portuguese Communist Party (PCP), and made this advertisement to where the revolution allowed it. Then when things stabilized, he went out and went to do other things. This does not remove the quality, but it is not my notion of Cartoon. I respond to the various stimuli of events otherwise. Cartoon allows me to express opinions, but be able to do so in different meanings of life, perspectives, without being a prisoner, as he became a prisoner of the PCP, was something that helped me a lot.
Did you ever feel any pressure from the newspapers where you collaborated?
(Hesitates). Some things, but they are not important. One thing I got, without much effort, was to make people think I have a bad damn shape, and it was better not to get me. It helped because they thought twice before talking to me. Once in Expresso, a type of sport commissioned me a cover, and began to give tips on how I should make the design. Until I asked you if I ever told you how to write news. This must have been in memory for many years, and must have reverberated this conversation in other people. I did not go to the Express, I was always in my corner and did not wear out with everyday life, with friendships and enmities.
Do you usually draw here, in the studio?
Here. But this [the image of bad shape] really helped me. And there is also the story of me having another profession. I often say that I really had two professions, because I was a cartoonist and graphic designer, and then I had my clients who were also of the Express, namely the Tabaqueira. He was a friend of the commercial director, a comfortable type, who was staring to negotiate contracts with the newspaper in the name of A Tabaqueira. Therefore, I conveyed an effective image of power that actually did not have. If you add a type that has bad shape to a type that apparently has power, it is a boring (laughs).
When I ask you about the pressures, I think in the period right after April 25, 1974-1975, when everything was politicized. Were there bigger?
I managed to deal with it. During this period of the Prec (ongoing revolutionary process) it even had a cartoon over the need that lasted two years. It was a kind of escape forward. There was a great confusion, and I think it was interested in my newspaper [express], although that was never said. It gave an idea of ​​freshness of the newspaper about a complex period, but they never told me that. I have the idea of ​​this use of Cartoon, it was the way of consolidating the newspaper's independence regarding events, even when sometimes there was no such independence.
Are we today in a politically correct era, where everything seems to offend?
I don't feel, because I don't want to feel. I came to a phase of my life where if they didn't want to put up with me, they don't work. It's easy. Everything that was a struggle to impose a name and a point of view, a career, has already been made. It can be improved and consolidated, but if not, it is not. If I become very inconvenient for the newspaper where I work, and I want to believe this does not happen…
But in general terms, to the news, comments on social networks, do you feel that there is the politically correct?
Of course there is. My situation is of exception. The younger ones in the world of Cartoon have no opportunities at all. They have less than when I started. For various chances of life I have a position that has solidified, but this is not exemplary to what goes on. The new cartonists are full of trouble, there is no room for them, there is no means of payment. They are pushed to get out of the newspapers, not to enter.
Doesn't Cartoon have no place on social networks?
(Hesitates) It may appear, but it doesn't seem to me… Journalism is said to die and we cartoonists are going first. I think this is the trend. Journalism has been losing power in the face of social networks, with an anonymous opinion, which cannot be scrutinated, is very bad and mediocre. And that will grow.
What about Artificial Intelligence (AI)? Can replace the cartoonist.
This one I don't even speak because I do not know the limits, but I am intended to be terrible. It can indeed replace the cartoonist, but there is a subverting creativity.
Is there any public figure who particularly likes to portray in Cartoon?
The other day he said that, in relation to Trump, he had two antagonistic feelings: as a citizen, I find man detestable; But as a cartoonist is my raw material. Putin is also good. All men with many narratives and much power are likely to give good things from the point of view of analyzing a cartoonist. They are politicians with a very clear speech about what they want and what they want, and this can be good for Cartoon.
How do you feel to go to Macau again?
The exhibition [at the Military Club] will be different from the others, with 160 works. It's still a lot. It is a trip for these years, for Portuguese and international politics as well. I'm full of curiosity, promoting the show, seeing what they ask me, but this is part of the game.
The press of Macao does not have a great presence of Cartoon, except for Rodrigo [Rodrigo de Matos].
I know him, I get along with him. But I must say that the phenomenon is similar to Portugal. What do we have here? I, in the Express; Cristina Sampaio in the public; André Carrilho left the Diário de Notícias; António Maia in Correio da Manhã and little more. This is a general trend. Sometimes, and I think this happened to me, there are times when a cartoonist can represent a more value for the newspaper, but it's just a few moments when it can happen. In my most complicated period in Expresso, in the late 1970s, a reference newspaper that was in a country in convulsion, with some “irresponsibility” I could go ahead, and I have the perception that I helped the newspaper to detangle of these limitations. But this happens in very specific periods. In this phase [after April 25], I even made drawings at night that were already out of date.
Do you really have a bad shape or is it just to disguise?
I am shy, but I've been treating myself. (laughs) It was never something that had blocked me, I speak well in public. I'm a type I don't like to take stupid risks. I have been in this building for several years and I know only the gate because it has to be, and I do not want to have the risk of having an antipatic person to whom I confident. I do this with the greatest naturalness.
Military Club Exhibition
After the lecture at the Rui Cunha Foundation, this Wednesday, António will be today at the University of São José to talk to students at the “Cartoon Drawing: Ideas” workshop. This Friday follows the inauguration of the exhibition at the Military Club, which will be evident until January 2.</description><pubDate>2024-12-12 00:58:21</pubDate></item><item><title>Ben Lee, a game analyst, about the new concessions: “We need something grand”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2024/12/03/ben-lee-analista-de-jogo-sobre-as-novas-concessoes-precisamos-de-algo-grandioso/</link><description>The game analyst and consultant Ben Lee believes that it is necessary to do much more to diversify the economy of Macau beyond the game, especially given the type of events organized under the new concessions. The analyst thinks that Macau could look at two resorts in Vietnam as examples to follow international tourists
 
What balance do you do the two years of new game concessions?
There is still a lot of work to do. From what we could see so far, dealers have focused on lighter projects, such as local art galleries, cultural events, concerts and small rehabilitation of cultural neighborhoods. Large projects, such as the high -tech amusement park, the conservatory or new hotels have not yet been seen. Since two of the ten years have passed [concession], and given that the construction of some of these projects should take several years, it seems that it will be necessary to add them. The non-game segment revenues, in a percentage of gross revenue obtained by the dealers, seem to be higher than 2019, but have diminished in the last two years. It is possible to return to the next two years to be between the 10.5 and 11 percent verified in 2019.
Recently, Ho Iat Seng thanked the concessionaires for compliance with contracts and collaboration in the development of the non-game segment, reiterating that they were able to make some profits during the pandemic. Do you think it was fair in your words?
Casinos are making efforts to develop the non-game segment, but once again most of these efforts are focused on lower, lower-level events. We don't see great ideas like the $ 2.3 billion investment sphere we see in Las Vegas, for example. If that happened, it would easily fit into the $ 15 billion commitments promised by the concessionaires [when signing the new contracts]. We could also talk about the idea of ​​making a Formula 1 competition on the street, as seen in Singapore and recently in Las Vegas.
How do you analyze the recovery of operators in terms of game revenue in recent months?
The recovery of the game in Macao has been extremely good, and the sector is expected to recover to about 78 or 79 percent of the levels recorded in 2019.
The Macao Game Society (SJM), for example, was one of the game operators with the greatest difficulty in terms of cash flow during the pandemic. Do you consider that your recovery, compared to the other five, was positive?
The SJM had difficulties at first, but it seems to be finally making some progress. But there will still be some challenges to reposition your hardware [facilities and other enterprises] in the future.
What can we expect from the new government of Sam Hou Fai for the game area?
The chief executive elected seems to be trying to ensure that operators honor their commitments. Your two terms will probably cover the next eight years of the new concessions. I think that, ultimately, everything will be known to know if he can motivate the various government appliances to perform his vision and mission.
In the context of new contracts, how do you see the global evolution of the game sector?
In 2019, the percentage of non-game segment revenues compared to the game's recipes reached 10.5 percent. This percentage rose to 22 percent during COVID-19, and has since gradually fallen to 13.5 percent, according to the third quarter of this year. This percentage will continue to decrease as game recipes continue to grow. In recent times we have seen residents of Macau and Hong Kong go to the north [China] to save money. The question that arises is why the inhabitants of the continent would go down and do the reverse? The solution, as provided by the authorities, is that Macau needs to diversify the market [of tourists and players] that comes from the continent. This makes perfect sense in terms of logic, but the reality is that our efforts seem to be regressing. Visitors from outside the Greater China represented 7.8 percent of the total visitors from Macao, but decreased to 6.5 percent by the end of September this year. This refers to the lightweight events that have been organized that, by far and largely, are really oriented to the Chinese who, after all, constitute most of our source of recipes.
How can you get around this scenario?
Returning to the beginning, I think we really need something large, iconic, similar to the sphere in Las Vegas or even something like the “Golden Bridge” project in Da Nang, worthy of appearing on Instagram, or “Bridge From the kiss ”, in Phu Quoc, both in Vietname. The fact that these projects were built by a local group linked to the hotel sector, without any connection to profits from the game, demonstrates long -term creativity and perspective in terms of planning.
Class struggle
Ben Lee warns of the mass market danger of “running away” from Macau
The conversation with Ben Lee comes in the context of a lecture that recently starred in the two years of new game concessions. Promoted by the France-Macau Chamber of Commerce, the session was named “Macau New Gaming Landscape: Two Years Into Concessions, What Now?”, Having Igamix Management &amp; Consulting, according to Asian Gaming Brief, according to the portal Gaming Brief (AgBrief), that the VIP game did not end completely, thus being the target of a new classification.
According to Agbrief, citing words by Ben Lee, "the mass game incorporated the same [players] level that was so openly criticized by the government," but that operators "are changing their focus to accommodating it."
The analyst highlighted the "recent focus on the transformation of older and older hotel rooms into luxury options, with all operators understanding the need to get quality rather than quantity."
However, he argued that “the focus on the luxury segment continues to create an impasse” because “Macau has long focused on increasing the number of visitors to increase revenues”, but the business model “goes against the need to increase expenses per person ”.
Ben Lee also warned that many tourists could, in fact, start choosing other more affordable destinations. The analyst argued that mass players "cannot be ignored" as they remain "the main engine" of the sector. "Exorbitant prices from hotel rooms can be a" dam "for the increase of visitors," as, as suggested, "gamblers can go to other vacation places, such as Thailand, if the price is not good." This Asian country “is growing and is expected to exceed Singapore in terms of gross revenues” at a time when Thai work in the new legislation on the game.
“They hope to pass your game law in May next year. Starting from the principle this happens three to five years to build an integrated resort or enterprise. They may be working considerably before the opening of Japan, ”said Ben Lee.
Still in relation to the game market in Asia, the analyst pointed out that Asian gamblers will focus on the future game markets of Thailand and Japan "while enjoying the current offers in Macau, Singapore and Philippines," wrote Agbrief.</description><pubDate>2024-12-03 00:08:39</pubDate></item><item><title>Miguel Gomes, director: “Cinema is not a court”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2024/11/29/miguel-gomes-realizador-o-cinema-nao-e-um-tribunal/</link><description>Molly and Edward have marriage marked, but when she fetches her bride from the train, Edward decides to escape, starting the "Grand Tour" through Asia. The film is one of the films of Miguel Gomes aired at the Film Festival between China and Portuguese -speaking countries, which is taking place until December 13, the day when “Grand Tour” is shown
 
It is one of the directors in focus at this film festival that takes place in Macao. How do you feel the opportunity to show your latest movie, "Grand Tour" in this region?
Being able to show the film anywhere in the world is always an objective for someone who wants to make movies, as these only exist from the moment they are seen. The film has a relationship with Asia and China. It was bought for Hong Kong, and I don't know if it will be commercially displayed in the territory and what are the distributors' plans. Regardless of this festival in Macau, the film will have visibility in this part of China.
The movie is a tribute to ancient cinema, at least that's how I faced him.
No. I think the cinema does not need to be honored, because the history of cinema is a heritage that we honor seeing it. It is very important that this memory will continue to be part of our lives and that movies can be shown. In Lisbon we are fortunate to have a very competent and strong cinemateca that fulfills this mission. Today's cinema is alive, although it does not have such a strong social role as it had in the twentieth century, and I don't think it needs honors. The Grand Tour is a movie today, but let's say it has the memory of other films that have been made. I do not intend to honor the cinema, but to explore the potential it has, doing two very different things.
What are they?
One of them will have to do, in fact, with the history of cinema and its historical heritage, which I connect with studio work. This is something that cinema has done a lot, inventing worlds that are not our real world. On the other hand, I wanted to capture reality, because cinema also has this potential to put the House ahead of people, film events, places and be able to record it.
When I refer to this tribute to ancient cinema, I refer to the presence of a certain way of filming that it has been in vogue. Did you want to mix old and contemporary cinematic elements?
I wanted to work with Asia manufactured, which never existed, that cinema created.
With the western view of Asia.
The vision that Americans and Europeans created. Much of American cinema was invented by Europeans, people like [Josef Von] Sternberg, who left Germany and was the maximum exponent of a film author who worked with an image of the romanticized Asia.
And filmed in Macao, even. [The movie “Macao”, 1952]
Exactly. I wanted to work with this imaginary, trying to create a dialogue where we could go out of the studio and be in Asia that corresponded to colonial time in many of those countries, but then, at other times, we could be in a present time. This time would be the future of the characters, in another postcolonial historical time.
"Grand Tour" was the name given to the route that many western ones did to discover a certain Asia. To make the movie I assume that some historical research has been needed. How was this process?
I would not call her a very deep research, because that was not the goal. [The "Grand Tour"] is not a sociological movie, it's a movie costume. It's more like this side than on the sociopolitical side, let's say. The starting point was two pages of a travel book [the tale ‘Mabel’ by W. Somerset Maugham], who gave us this itinerary. The situation described [in the tale] corresponds to what we see in the movie, with a couple of bride and groom, with him living in Burma and she returning from London. He panics and runs away the day when he is supposed to go to the pier of Rangum. The couple then makes this itinerary, and in the book she can catch the groom and get married, but in the movie is different.
I assume it is difficult to compare movies. But do you understand that the "Grand Tour" marks a turning into your career over previous productions?
I don't think so. It's a personal movie, like all those I had the opportunity to do. It is personal in the sense that limitations or any production notebook of the producer have not been imposed. I could do exactly what I wanted. I see common elements of this movie to others I made. I think it is part of my work. Then there was the issue of receiving the film and the fact that he won a prize in Cannes [best director], which obviously helps me continue to work and have a more favorable receptivity right now.
It is a great recognition.
Before making this movie I was trying to do another in Brazil, an adaptation of Euclides da Cunha's book, “The Sertões”, and is a complicated project that involves a great production logistics. During the time he was trying to make the film it was difficult [to continue] for several reasons, and one of them is named Jair Bolsonaro [former president of the country]. Today we are resuming this process of returning to the movie. There was a height of discouragement, when I thought I really had to give up the project, and today the process of refinancing of the film is advancing much faster. The perspectives are more encouraging.
Do you feel that the award won in Cannes is also from Portuguese cinema?
I hope so. For my part, I have no doubt that what I do owe it to the efforts of other filmmakers who filmed before me, and some of them continue to do so. They had to confront the characteristics of our market and society, managed to shoot in a country where there is no industry because there is no market for it. They had to fight hard to be able to shoot and make the movies they made. I recognize an experience of identity in these films, I review myself, although the movies are all very different. There is, in fact, this identity in the history of Portuguese cinema, perhaps from the 1960s, with Cinema Novo, with producers and directors who fought hard to shoot. They made movies that, for me, are very important. Nowadays, with the system created with their fight, it is easier for me and my colleagues than it will have been in the 60s and 70s.
Political conditions were also different, with less investment.
Political conditions were changing over time, but their lives were not easy either after April 25, 1974. The way Portuguese cinema was able to impose and gain room for existing to exist was being fought in historical times and interlocutors different. And it was difficult.
Let's go back to the "Grand Tour". He said in an interview that the movie's shooting was "Surrealist." What moments that highlight this phase?
When I said this I referred to a specific time of shooting in China, which was very surrealistic. This occurred thousands of kilometers, was in Lisbon because he could not enter the country because of COVID-19. After two years of waiting to be able to film, I decided that the only way to make the movie would be to have a Chinese team and me to be in Lisbon and shoot at a distance. He was in an Airbnb at Arairo, surrounded by monitors and discussing what should be filmed with the Chinese team. Then it was all very surrealistic, yes.
Have you ever been afraid of not being able to capture the essence of the place, of Asian culture, taking into account all these conditions?
I thought it wouldn't work. I suspect the technique a lot, I'm quite analog, and I thought it wasn't going to work. To result, it had to have the image live, give a "action" and a "cut" in real time, which could have the overall image, which was around the place beyond the image of the camera. I needed to have a communication system that worked with the photography director and the chamber official to be able to give him indications at the time we were filming. This was all possible, and I was amazed at it. On the other hand, the idea of ​​capturing the essence of the place, or a deeper thing of the culture of one of these countries, in this case in China, it seems to me too heavy. That was not my intention in the movie, because it is impossible. I believe a movie is always the result of a negotiation between someone who looks and what exists to look at. There is a subjective side. What interests us, which appeals to us, who dialogues with us and raises the desire to film can exist in China, Vietname, Africa or here on the coffee terrace where we are. I left for Asia as I left for the area of ​​Arganil to make a previous movie, "that dear month of August."
In a village.
Yes, a rural area of ​​Portugal, and I don't know if I looked differently in one situation or another. There is always anything that I think is beautiful or that touches me in different ways. What happens in "Grand Tour" is a series of mismatches, the couple's, but it seems to me that there is also a mismatch between those European characters in the relationship with the territory. It seems that they are always disconnected from the space where they live. They live a lot in a bubble.
But colonialism was a bit of it too.
Yes. I agree, I think there are people who can see this in the movie, this dissociation between what the characters are living and what goes on around them. We often chose not to translate what was going on in front of them so that the Western viewer can be as intrigued and lost as the characters themselves. I also think that, nowadays, there is an idea, which I totally disagree, that cinema exists to correct the history and injustices of all the world. It is also too heavy for the cinema. It seems deeply maladjusted, because cinema is not a court to judge even a space to punish viewers and characters, it's something else. The films do not have to be complaints, prisoners of an expectation. I tried to make a movie where the colonial issue could be dealt with, but without having to punish either the viewers or the characters.
What was your relationship with Asia or your idea of ​​orientalism?
I wanted to work on the idea that there was an invented and manufactured Asia by the European look, and I was aware that it existed and had to work with it in the movie. The world of fiction, on the other hand, has as one aspect this idea of ​​exoticism, regardless of the sociological issue, that there was a western look at the East, almost as a superficial view of this world. But fiction works with stereotypes, and that's not bad. It is the cement and then do anything with these stereotypes.

He is a man with a provocative speech, a corrosive, kind mood and a smile that leaves no one indifferent
Gitelles, we live in an intercultural land and the Gypsies - in particular - have lived about five centuries in Portugal. What is going on for Gypsy communities to remain “on the fringes” of the so -called society? 
The model of society remains to be changed. This is extremely stratified by placing people in subordinate places to privilege a violent minority. The white social structure is patriarchal and racist. What is called the "margin" of society is actually an intrinsic place to it, which belongs to it. In other words, Gypsy people have been included in this model of society since they discovered Europe and its kingdoms. The problem is the model of society that is maintained and the place to which they were relegated and how they were relegated: with violence, in inferior status against whites, without the right to human dignity, to constitute a family, to choose one's own language and religion expropriated from any and all cultural and material rights. A place built and maintained to this day by violence and genocidal and ethnicidal persecution. In 1463, a Gitano Vasco was drowned to an estate. In 1521, Gitans, or Gypsies, were already used as a reference for all that is considered bad in the model of society. The "counter-exemple" in the face of the white that would stand out for the positive. The 'angel' and the 'devil'; the 'other', the enemy; That against whom any attack and persecution is legitimate. Including the prohibition of defending, having weapons, any kind of goods, and the right of permanence.
And is this right to permanence that we still have nomadic gypsy communities within the country is denied?
Yes, no doubt. There are many ways to force nomadism: directly, prohibiting permanence and expelling with police or military force; indirectly, refusing public or private housing to Gypsy people, as they are Gypsy; and even through the gentrification process.
I read the result of an inquiry from the European Union Fundamental Rights Agency, which is said to be approximately 80% of the Gypsies responded to the risk threshold of poverty in their country; One in three Gypsies lives in a housing without channeled water; One in three Gypsies belongs to a family where someone hungry at least once the previous month; and 50% of Gypsies aged 6 to 24 do not attend school. Why does this happen like this? 
It is the historical persecution, which continues. There is no impoverishment that has no external cause. In this case, a political system of total expropriation and imposed on the basis of violence. Already in 1648, D John IV, the restorer, prohibited ‘Giving or Rent houses to Gypsies’. The same D John IV who got the kingdom of Portugal thanks to D. Jerónimo da Costa and his 250 knights. The same D. Jerónimo da Costa who had died to defend Portugal's independence from Castile. Gypsy, like his wife and children. Between prohibitions of permanence, “that do not enter Gypsies in the Kingdom and leave those who are” (D John III, 1526), ​​with expulsions, degred to the galleys, expropriation of goods and properties, imposed with stripping, mutilation and death , systematically carried out to this day (still in 2011 the Faro City Council wanted to ban Gypsies in the county).
The prohibition of working on others (no one employs Gypsy workers, and those who accept they do it in total precariousness, for poorly paid positions and without decent rights and conditions). They cannot be dependent on their own work, they cannot get investment means due to extreme expropriation. Are dependent on precariousness. If you want to know what it is like to live in pure neoliberalism, know the lives of Gypsies. Their reality is paradigmatic of the aggression and depletion to which the "gentlemen" are willing to go to their benefit.
Are you talking about economic and political power?
The group of political, social, cultural and economic power. The owner, the colonizer. This group that has been in power since it established the system of current domination. And that only makes sense within the hierarchically stratified sociopolitical model in which we live. Hence the need to end 'gentlemen' and institute a new model of society, healthy, free, without hierarchies or strata, whether of race, class or gender.
The model we live in leads to the Gypsy (and not only) community to economic exclusion, removing it from access to product consumption or excluding them from its production process; political exclusion associated with lack of access to information; To education and consequently the social exclusion that is seen in inequality of access to quality community areas such as restaurants, libraries, theater, cinema, concerts, health care, etc. How do you feel a gypsy child when you realize that it is not part of a whole? Children who are never represented, neither in movies, nor in books, nor in cartoons, not even in an announcement to eat cereals, for example? Is this a disaster for self-esteem, is a priori condemnation?
The question is that. Gypsy people are not “excluded from society”, by contrast, they are included in it. The problem is the existence of what is cynically called 'social exclusion', which term Orwellian, and there be under coercion, people. Which field of concentration and extermination. Incidentally, Nazi concentration camps are a more visual realization than called 'social exclusion' and, as here, were not a 'excluded' part of Nazi society, but rather its fundamental and characterizing structure. It is a place of violence, where people are maintained by violence, dedicated to their extermination, and designed so that few people can leave. And yet they resist. As in Nazi concentration camps.
And what you have listed as an example of 'consequence' of this 'exclusion', is actually the environment by which this exclusion also happens and remains. Gypsy people are out of theaters, both as consumers and producers (but go to the cinema). They are out of school, education and the gym. Either as 'users' or as producers (but go to school and are on the basis of knowledge construction and academic and scientific debates).
Even in attacking Gypsy children's self -confidence, we talk about a maintenance mechanism of this situation. But Gypsy people respond very well: with Gypsy pride. Another resistance, another aggression. Gypsy people are thus included in society. In a place that belongs to this model of modern society. And they resist and contradict the power of domination and make a point of being in the city, in the cinema, in the theater, in the gym, in all spaces. With a lot of struggle and always resisting, but they are there. Social exclusion, more than a “place outside of society”, is part of its social structure.
Do you want to say that there is a collective resistance?
At work, already in a context of absolute precariousness, during the pandemic, Gypsy people rolled up sleeves and showed once again proactivity and creativity in adversity. They learned seeing and doing. And here, it is again the women who jump to the front line, face, learn to use digital tools with their daughters or children, and throw themselves into the network. And so they explore online sales as well as application by application (transportation or rehabs). In housing, in a context of pandemic in which the evictions were not locked - as they owed and dictated the law itself - residents did not fail to organize and fight unjust evictions and claim dignity in housing; associations of allied residents in their action with other housing and anti-racist struggle organizations.
It should also be noted how they reinvented and intensified to raise and distribute dietary goods and kits of masks/alcohol gel to the most expropriated people. Gypsies and non -Gypsies. In the anti-racist struggle, new movements emerged and their actions intensified by social networks. People who had never been organized or militated before began their first steps in activism, thickening this way of the organization and popular gypsy and anti-racist action. People forget, or do not want to value, but Gypsy action has helped determine results in the political dispute. Gypsy citizens mobilized in large and determined electoral results in the municipalities of 2017, both in Alentejo and in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area, even causing electoral earthquakes.
And even in the presidential, second place was resolved by a value equivalent to the estimated number of Gypsy voters. Apart from the non -Gypsy votes that were mobilized by the action of Gypsy voters. Gypsy people are even co-considering power in the spaces of opinion, local media, social networks and party and institutional political dispute. And most importantly, in the popular Ação and alliances with other social movements. We have never stopped fighting for all means and continuing to resist.
In contrast there are more and more hate speeches, from the far right in particular. What do you have to say about it?
To start these speeches are historical and European. Not even current and even less “of the far right”. These speeches have been adopted and rendered for a long time, even in 'democracy and freedom', by several representatives of the center right, conservatives, left center, liberal, liberal left, even representatives of the PCP. Anti-egana rhetoric has always worked in Portugal as it is the whiter rhetoric [white genesis]. That is, it allows you to create and give the "white" as the superior of all. And so please the white electorate who, when feeling well, pays off with his vote. Even if the policies implemented by their elected people harm him even more.
Finally, did you like them to talk a little about your personal experience and how did you get to the activist?
I studied, fought for studies, made alliances, graduated, went in the labor market of the “formal precariousness”. I started my militant action and here I am today. We can transform this society a better. This certainty combined with the fact that the current one has so much suffering makes anyone want to have a transformist attitude. I wanted to be 'inventor' (physical engineer) and anti -racist militant. And through study (not necessarily schooling) and organization with others, in turn, with other studies, formations and visions, I learned how the world works and how it can be changed. But before transforming, we need to survive.
Hence two types of actions arise: transformative and survival. The struggle against hate discourse arises as survival, but his defeat will be a transformative victory. There is a lot that - like people who want a better world - we have to do, namely working to criminalize hatred speech; condemn and prohibit organizations with racist discourses and practices; denounce the racist institutional structure and logics that organize power and generate community resources. And in this sense, there have been various types of actions, of petitions, to manifestations. And we need more.
I, besides being a military man in the SOS Racism movement, participate in the “We came to stay” podcast, with Mamadou BA and Joseph da Silva. And if all goes well, we will soon start a new project. With friendly people, we also have the project “Gypsy Initiative”, dedicated to reflecting and promoting transformative movements. Essentially focused on educating against anti-agigarism, denouncing historical and continued genocide and working for a new society project. Also with new projects on the gutter. And finally, there are always voluntary actions without an organization, where I try to share what I found out about anti-egism and Roman history in schools and with interested people. In addition, there is still the struggle for housing, because the evictions did not stop during the pandemic. Due to housing and work precariousness, the subjects racialized especially the Roma nationals are the most vulnerable to COVID-19. There is essential to have actions in this area; Of all the struggles, this is the most structural, as it goes against one of the main enemies of a healthy society: the real estate speculation of this capitalist system, which places profit and goods above people and their humanization.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Tennis | Nuno Borges will play in front of Alcaraz in the Australia Open</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/16/tenis-nuno-borges-vai-jogar-frente-a-alcaraz-no-open-da-australia/</link><description>Nuno Borges surpassed the nervousness to defeat Australian Jordan Thompson in three sets in the second round of Australia Open, and will now face 'Carlitos' Alcaraz without pressure, admitted the Portuguese tennis player to Lusa agency.
“I feel it was a good game on my part. Undoubtedly it was better than the first round, the sensations were there, ”he began by analyzing national number, in statements to Lusa, after moving to the third round of the first Grand Slam of the season.
The 27-year-old Maiato contradicted Wednesday the favoritism of the 'local' Jordan Thompson, 27th standard head, imposed on 6-3, 6-2 and 6-4 partials in one hour and 47 minutes, in a John Cain Arena - the third most important court by Melbourne Park - crowded.
"It was very nervous, it was a big stadium, not every day [that happens], so I think inside that I could make a very good game and I really am very happy for the result," he said.
Follow to Alcaraz
Semifinalist in Auckland at the start of the year, Borges has now extended his good moment, setting a meeting in the third round with Spanish Carlos Alcaraz, the third world player.
“Now, against 'Carlitos', there is not much to say. Everyone knows what he is capable of and everything he has done, [is] quite famous around the world, there is not much to highlight, ”he said about his opponent who, in Australia, seeks to become the younger Tennis player (is 21 years old) to complete the career Grand Slam.
In front of Spanish, the 33rd ATP ranking will try to do its best and "make it the most uncomfortable possible." "I will play without pressure, try not to put high expectations in my head to see if I can bring my best tennis," he concluded.
Last year, Nuno Borges, who will still start his walk in the pairs alongside Francisco Cabral, became the first Portuguese tennis player to reach the round of 16 at the Australia Open.</description><pubDate>2025-01-16 22:38:03</pubDate></item><item><title>After “very positive meeting”, Borges “looking forward to playing at a stadium” with Thompson</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/14/apos-encontro-muito-positivo-borges-ansioso-por-jogar-num-estadio-com-thompson/</link><description>Portuguese tennis player Nuno Borges premiered yesterday, the 13th, at the 113rd edition of the Australia Open, first major of the time, with a “very positive meeting” against Frenchman Alexandre Muller in Melbourne Park, where he will now face Australian Jordan Thompson.
“I am very happy. It was a very positive meeting. I think, in general, I served very well, at least I managed to put the ball on the places where I wanted and have a good percentage (69%). I felt that I kept quite constant except in the tie-break of the first set, which I didn't play very well. I always kept looking for and very consistent during a meeting and this turned out to be the key to the result, ”he said in statements to Lusa.
The world's national and 33rd number one needed two hours and 55 minutes to get the best of the Gaul opponent, recently champion of the Hong Kong ATP 250, in four sets, by the 6-7 (2-7) partials (2-7). , 6-3, 6-2 and 7-5, but believes it has deserved the triumph, in the return to Melbourne, where a year ago became in the first Portuguese tennis player to reach the round of 16.
“I feel like I deserved to win in four sets, I was slightly higher from the first set and I'm very happy. The first rounds are never easy in terms of sensations. Tennis does not flow the same way, is trying to gain pace, but fortunately meetings at the best of five sets give more time to find this pace. I feel that I ended up the meeting quite well, although exhausting too, ”he explained.
After the inaugural round victory, Nuno Borges will “take the opportunity to rest and recover tomorrow to play possibly Wednesday” with a home player, Jordan Thompson (27th ATP), who today surpassed at Margaret Court Arena O 'Qualifier' German Dominik Koepfer also in four partials, 7-6 (7-3), 6-4, 4-6 and 6-3.

On the eve of last Christmas, Sro Motorsport Group, the entity responsible for organizing numerous races and championships, including the GT World Challenge Asia and, as the official partner of the FIA, the co-coordination of the FIA ​​GT World Cup in Macau , announced the creation of a competition for GT4 vehicles, consisting of four events in China. At the time of the announcement, only the inaugural event in Shanghai and the end in Beijing had been confirmed as part of the calendar.
Almost 30 cars, representing an impressive total of ten car builders, participated in the GT Cup - Great Bay Race of 2024, a race that has become an important milestone over the weekend of the Macao Grand Prix in recent years. Indeed, no other GT4 event in Asia brings together such quantity and diversity of cars. The Balance of Performance (BOP), responsible for balancing the performance of the various participating cars, was, at the time, managed by SRO.
In a statement, Benjamin Frannasovici, managing director of Sro Motorsports Asia, said:
“We are enchanted, proud and privileged for adding the GT Cup - Great Bay Race to the inaugural calendar of Sro GT Cup, which begins and ends with the two largest motorized sports events in China. We already have a strong working relationship with the GT Cup - Great Bay Race, which has become the most significant race for GT4 cars in Asia. Its inclusion in the 2025 calendar of the SRO underlines the size of our ambition for this new national series. ”
High interest
The SRO GT Cup debut season starts in March at China's Formula 1 Grand Prix in Shanghai, before moving to the Zhuhai International Circuit - a place previously visited by SRO in BPR times and the FIA ​​GT Championship - where two 30 minutes races are planned. This is followed by the new Citadine Circuit of Beijing, which will host the GT World Challenge Asia on the same weekend, before the big end of the Sro GT Cup season, scheduled for a month later at the Guide Circuit in Macao.
The enthusiasm surrounding this competition is evident. As Benjamin Franassovici said, “This is reflected in the number of consultations and registration for the full season we have received since the release of the championship, just before Christmas. The demand has exceeded our expectations. ”
Up to 28 cars will be able to compete in the season end event on the streets of Macau, with places to be assigned based on the classification after the second round of the championship, which is scheduled for the Zhuhai Permanent Circuit. All pilots with “bronze” or “silver” classifications attributed by the FIA ​​are eligible to compete in this competition, as long as they use approved cars from the GT4 class.
To attract brands, the results of SRO GT Cup races will tell the SRO GT4 builders ranking, a title attributed to the brand with better performance in the GT4 category at the end of each season. SRO GT CUP joins its Asian equivalent, Japan Cup, in a list that also includes continental and national competitions in Europe, America and Australia.</description><pubDate>2025-01-27 11:13:41</pubDate></item><item><title>MOTOR EMBALISM | Rui Valente is not due</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/21/automobilismo-rui-valente-nao-se-da-por-vencido/</link><description>Rui Valente will return this year for another season in motorsport in the region. The Macao pilot has been in the active for the same time and will play the Macau Roadsport Challenge, the tourist cars competition organized by the Macau-China General Automotive Association (AAMC), as well as the 72nd edition of the Macau Grand Prix , in November
 
With the same enthusiasm recognized for decades, Rui Valente will again drive, in the 2025 season, a Subaru BRZ, the same car with which he competed in the Guide Circuit last November in the Macao Roadsport Challenge race. In the event held at the event of the territory, the Portuguese pilot finished sixth place, after losing some positions in the start, where he descended to tenth. The result was not even better because the rain -played race ended prematurely due to an opponent's accident.
In the competition for local pilots, which currently combines starting grids with more than half a hundred cars, all of them Toyota Gr86 (ZN8) or Subaru BRZ (ZD8), Rui Valente admitted to HM that “not being overcome”, also revealing who is “missing the podium, both in China and Macau…”.
Premium Racing Team driver had, in the last Macao Grand Prix, one of the fastest in terms of tip speed in the platoon of his race. Therefore, the bet for this year will be in other technical aspects of the car that go beyond the engine.
"At this time, I just wanted to increase the diameter of the front wheels and widen the gauge to improve the car's behavior," he confided to HM, also reporting that he intends to "optimize weight transmission during the curve and its. exit". These improvements, along with lock system updates, should increase the competitiveness of the Japanese machine in a fierce grid, consisting of Macau, Hong Kong pilots and China interior, with constantly evolving cars.
Undefined calendar
The AAMC -organized car competition calendar has not yet been revealed. In 2024, Macau Roadsport Challenge debuted at the Zhuzhou International Circuit in East of Hunan Province, but Rui Valente would rather the competition to return to the Guangdong International Circuit (GIC) this year in Zhaoqing.
“I was very fond of returning to Gic, because I have everything there,” says the Portuguese pilot, defender of the track located in the neighboring province. “When you go to a qualification test, for those who make four races and then Macau, if you are on a track you already know, such as GIC, where you are seven or more years, each time you get on the track and try to do better than which last means you are improving and improving your driving. So you know you soon that you are stronger that year to Macau. ”
On the other hand, for the experienced pilot of the territory, “if you go to a new track, like the Zhuzhou circuit, besides floors there to learn the new layout and improve your time, you will never know if you are really stronger For Macao, as you know when you run in the gic. ”
Like what happened in past seasons, the Macao Roadsport Challenge calendar is expected to be composed of two weekends, with two races each, which also serve as an determination for the Grand Prix.</description><pubDate>2025-01-21 23:47:48</pubDate></item><item><title>GP Macau | Luca Engstler still recovers from the accident</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/12/gp-macau-luca-engstler-ainda-recupera-do-acidente/</link><description>Although every year the Macau Grand Prix Organizing Committee puts a lot of resources and a lot of energy in the driver's safety, the Guide Circuit Continates, and will continue to be one of the most dangerous and risky in the world. This year, the young German Luca Engstler, who first participated in a GT3 car, felt the old maxim of this circuit in the skin: “errors pay dearly”
 
After eight weeks after the most severe accident of his career, the 24 -year -old is still recovering from the apparent misfortune at the Cup of GT World Cup of the 71st Macao Grand Prix. On Friday afternoon, with the chronometer counting and when trying to improve his brand, Luca Engstler lost control of his Lamborghini Huracán GT3 Evo in the dreaded Mandarin curve, beating over 230 km/h in protective barriers. The car inscribed by the Liqui Moly Team Engstler, but prepared and ran by Grasser Racing Team, was completely destroyed and the German pilot even became unconscious after the impact.
“This is a unique event, Lamborghini's progress was not very good and to be ahead we had to risk more than the others. Basically, I was completely thoroughly and was unsuccessful, ”said Luca Engstler, at the time, the accident she suffered. Two months after what was “the most horrible day of my life to this day,” former German Touring Champion (TCR) is still in the recovery process.
“It was really a big impact,” said Luca Engstler, in conversation with the specialized portal motorsport-total.com, who needed a wheelchair after the accident. “The big problem was that my right ankle suffered a lot. I tore the lateral ligaments and had a lot of hemorrhages in tibia and fibula, which caused some concern, ”he recalled.
Returning to walk normally was also a big challenge for the young Lamborghini pilot, who in the 2024 season impressively won two DTM races and first participated in a GT3 car in Macao. "It took me a long time to be able to walk," he recalled. “In the first two or three days, I was really a wheelchair, because I just couldn't do anything and all the bones hurt me,” Engstler described to the publication of his country, saying that “he had bruises everywhere and everything was difficult ”.
Recover
Still, Lucas Engstler, at the end of the day of the accident, already at the Conde de São Januário Hospital Center, made a publication on social networks to say that everything was fine. The pilot, who was in Macao accompanied by his father, Franz Engstler - also a pilot and a well -known figure of Asian motorsport - wanted to reassure the closest. Two days after the accident, appeared on the GT da Fia World Cup starting grid on Sunday, without crutches, only slightly supported by an umbrella.
"What was important to me was not wanting to make a big sink about it," he explained to the Germanic portal. "In the end, the accident seemed very serious, but that only shows how safe the cars are," he said.
The pilot continues to recover from the sequelae of the strong impact. He took advantage of the winter break to take a trip from Autocaravana to Sweden with his best friend. "Everything is going well," he said, clarifying that he can run. "I would say I'm 95 percent and I have no permanent damage."
After the accident, the German worked on their recovery in the Allgäu region, in their homeland, “with some acquaintances, who are physiotherapists and doctors. I received excellent assistance. ”
Return
Luca Engstler admits that she has become impatient during the recovery process. "I was told that I could only do sports again in early February, but of course this could not accept," recognizing that he started training earlier than recommended.
Fortunately to Luca Engstler, DTM only starts on the last weekend of April. In the coming times, the pilot plans to sit back behind the wheel, possibly in a rental kart to start. The aim is to be in shape for the beginning of the preseason and the preparation tests of the popular German championship, scheduled for mid-February and early March.
As for the Macao Grand Prix, two days after the accident, Luca Engstler was quite clear: “I told everyone that my goal is to return and try to fight for victory in this great race.”</description><pubDate>2025-01-12 23:43:24</pubDate></item><item><title>GP Macau | Maro Engel clarified GT World Cup episode</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/10/gp-macau-maro-engel-esclareceu-episodio-da-taca-do-mundo-de-gt/</link><description>Maro Engel won, in an inappropriate race for heart, the FIA ​​GT World Cup in Macao's 71st Grand Prix. However, German's fourth victory among us was anything but peaceful. Maro Engel took advantage of an interview with the German magazine Motorsport Aktuell to explain what happened on the streets of the territory and earned him so many criticism
 
The Germanic pilot, who will turn 40 this year, had a 2024 season full of hits: he won the GT World Challenge Europe, was the best of Mercedes-AMG representatives in the TMD and won a fourth triumph in the Grand Prix of Macao. However, Maro Engel prefers not to highlight a single feat in his 2024 dream season, having referred to his country's expert magazine that “in terms of prestige, the victory in Macao has to be highlighted. But honestly, I don't want to highlight a single moment like the great achievement of this amazing year. I worked hard to reach all these successes. ”
In the since, the triumph of the Bavarian pilot was offered on a tray when the first two ranked ranks, Antonio Foco (Ferrari) and Raffaele Marciello (BMW), fell out in the lock for the Lisbon curve two turns from the end. However, Maro Engel had already been involved in another incident, when, at the beginning of the race, his loneliness, his Mercedes-AMG GT3 gave a subtle touch to the back of the Dryi Vanthoor BMW, which followed in front of him in the third position. The young Belgian was projected against the barriers, eventually abandoning due to damage to the suspension of the M4 GT3, while Maro Engel would see the flag axad said first, with an advantage of 11 seconds.
Already at the end of the race, the Sports Commissioner College decided that the touch of the aforementioned tap deserved a 5 -second penalty, which had no impact on the final result, leading BMW Motorsport, Andreas Roos to tell the press that the incident “ It was not adequately penalized. ” Dries Vanthoor, who was also a candidate for victory, went further and said at the time that when “pushing another car out of track, he should not be able to win the race.”

It was not on purpose
Maro Engel's aggressive style was criticized at the time, but the pilot, who debuted to win in Macau in 2014, prefers to point out that “does everything within the boundaries of Fair Play” and thinks it is “hard to accuse a pilot not to try everything to win there (in Macau). ” In the situation in question, Maro Engel wanted to clarify that “I was clearly faster. At the wide part of the circuit at the bottom, I had no chance of attacking, so I tried at the top. It ended up running badly, and that was not my intention. I apologized to the dries later. In general, I run to win. The day you no longer give it all for that, I hang my helmet. I definitely not here to make new friends. ”
Despite the “chair dance” among the car builders involved in the GT3 class in this preseason, Maro Engel will continue to defend the colors of Mercedes-AMG, something that has been doing since 2008, and of course will be one of the stupid brand choices to The World Cup in November, at the Guide Circuit. The natural pilot of Munich is not being removed from the tracks anytime soon, because “I have not reached my peak yet and I still find pleasure in the races.”
In his curriculum, in events held in Macau, Maro Engel has two wins in the GT Macau Cup - FIA GT World Cup (2015 and 2024) and two in the GT Macau Cup (2014 and 2022), but promises not to stay here.</description><pubDate>2025-01-10 06:21:42</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
