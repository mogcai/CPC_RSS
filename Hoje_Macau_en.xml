"China regrets and opposes this decision and will do everything it deems necessary to defend its legitimate interests," the Ministry of Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian told a press conference.
Lin said unilateral rates impair both the World Trade Organization and international trade relations and insisted that "there are no winners in commercial wars."
Considering the fentanil “an internal problem of the United States,” Chinese diplomacy spokesman said Washington is using his opioid crisis to “press and coerce” China, although the Asian country is “one of the hardest” in the fight against the drug. The diplomat also stressed that Beijing has supported the US in his response to the Fentanil problem, transnational cooperation with results he described as "very remarkable."
The diplomat urged Washington to address the problems "through dialogue and on an equality" and reiterated that China is willing to continue to cooperate with the US to achieve a "solid, stable and healthy" relationship.
The conviction of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs follows to that of the Ministry of Commerce, which stated hours before China will take "all necessary countermeasures" to "defend its rights and legitimate interests."
United States President Donald Trump promised on Thursday that his country would impose an additional 10 percent rate on China to join the other rate at the same value previously announced, with the argument that the Asian country made enough efforts to combat Fentanil entry in the US.</description><pubDate>2025-03-03 00:05:55</pubDate></item><item><title>Demography | Birth is a “social responsibility”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/03/demografia-natalidade-e-uma-responsabilidade-social/</link><description>The chief executive considered that the increase in birth is “a social responsibility”, in statements made at a time when the government intends to have more children.

Two residents of Macao of Portuguese nationality reveal to HM which leads them to cross the border frequently, especially the weekend. Cultural diversity, low prices and higher quality of service in bars and restaurants make all the difference
 
Macao Small and Medium-sized (SME) have faced, since the reopening of borders in the postpandeia period, huge difficulties to recover the business, especially those that are further away from the tourist areas. At a time when traveling to China has become extremely easy and cheap, two residents explain why they prefer to move often to the neighboring city of Zhuhai, or even Shenzhen, and consume there instead of being in Macao. Options like dinner outside, catching a taxi or drinking a glass are much cheaper, and the possibility of driving outside the territory has made this option more frequent. But electronic trade has also contributed to the fall of local consumption, they ensure.
Nelson Moura, journalist and resident of Portuguese nationality, goes to Zhuhai whenever he has a free weekend or holidays. It even goes between three to four times a month. “Costs are lower inside China, and then there is the novelty factor. It has never been easy for a non -Chinese resident of Macau to go to China. I previously needed to ask for a visa, had a reduced deadline, and this greatly limited my trips, and always chose more distant places in a context of tourist travel. Local residents could go to China before, but the current convenience, with organized and developed borders, especially Hengqin, with the connection to the light meter, allows for easier connections, ”he told HM.
Since China has flexed the policy of visas and increased the offer of border circulation, traveling to the country is no longer seen as a great trip. “As a foreigner residing in Macao, going to China was a bit like going traveling to another Asian country. In the pandemic we did not go practically from Macau, but now since the policy of visas to Portuguese has been flexible, it is possible to go to China whenever we want, ”said Nelson Moura.
“I am as easily as a Chinese resident, and it has become a viable option to go to the weekends and holidays to China, knowing different sites. The food is a third of the price of what is practiced in Macau, has more quality, with fresh products, the reception offers are better. Macao is a great city, but after three years of pandemic knows very well to get out of here whenever we want. It is a more convenient option now than before. ”
Nelson Moura also considers that "for the Chinese community of Macao and Hong Kong there is a greater convenience of travel," as "there are many residents leading all weekends to China just to go to large commercial surfaces, which allows you to buy large amounts of food."
“Traffic near the border of the HKZM siege or bridge is at a level never seen before. There is the option of being able to drive in the large bay zone which is good for small and expensive cities like are Macau and Hong Kong, ”he said.
PME, the eternal problem
On the side of Macau, associations linked to the Chinese community's commercial sector call for help, asking for more measures such as the great consumption award, or even consumer cards, that is, more campaigns and initiatives so that residents can buy more in Macao with discounts or support.
One of the last voices showing concern about this scenario was Stanley Au, president of the Macao SME association. To TDM Canal Macau, the official argued that in the next lines of government action the Chief Executive, Sam Hou Fai, has to show effective measures to avoid closing and, consequently, more unemployment. “The most urgent and current situation is the closure of companies. I believe the population saw many stores closed in different neighborhoods of the territory. Sometimes, on the same street, there are more stores closed than opened. In addition, the biggest problem is that Macau is facing continuous economic slowdown. If we do not solve this problem, society does not improve, ”he added.
However, according to Nelson Moura, it will always be difficult to combat the attraction of the consumption of Greater China. “Macao's local commerce is a complicated issue. There is a major reduction in consumers, especially on weekends and days when people have time to leave the city. ”
Electronic trade also enhances a reduction in local consumption. “Residents know they find more and cheaper out there. There are Chinese electronic trade companies, such as TAOBAO, which allow purchases from all over China to Macao without transportation charges, which has reduced domestic consumption. People go to stores to see what they want to buy and then do it at Taobao. I don't know how this trend can be circumvented. It is capitalism to work, ”explained Nelson Moura.
The resident also draws attention to the fact that it is now easier to use online payment platforms in China with foreign cards or Macao banks, namely through MPay.
Nelson Moura believes that local SMEs have only endured so much time because they were in a kind of closed economic circuit. “Local businesses lived a little in an island economy, and they survived the fact that the Macao market is in the territory, without people could leave so much. Now that there has been competition with what China has to offer, companies suffer because they often don't offer the service so much quality and at such an attractive price. I know the situation in Hong Kong is similar. ”
“Like” in China
Macaense Miguel Duque has always worked in Macao and spent in the territory most of the days of the week, but since he started teaching in Zhuhai his life has become more across the border. Highlights the much cheaper night exits as well as the restoration offer. “Macao has no variety and people are filled with the fact that the territory is small. We have hotels and restaurants, but they are expensive because the lace are expensive. Faced with China, in terms of price, the difference is like between heaven and earth. I give an example: To take a taxi from the siege gates to the university where I teach it is 40 minutes of travel, 28 kilometers, and paid about 60 to 80 Renminbis. It's very cheap. In Macao, from the doors of the siege to Coloane we pay 150 patacas or more, the price difference is huge. ”
Miguel Rosa Duque says that the trips to China in her circle of friends have become so frequent that they even created a group on the WhatsApp social network to facilitate group walks. “I prefer to go to China a thousand times just for fun. I have a lot of variety of bars and nightclubs and in Macau everything is dead. A two -person massage costs 600 Renminbis in Macao costs twice. I don't talk about hotel massage. Customer service is much better in China, with more attention to customers, more attentive, and it's all cheaper. If we spend 1000 patacas on a night in Macao, China we spend 400 Renminbis and we are treated like kings. The variety is infinite in terms of restaurants. Macau can't compete, ”he said.
Miguel Rosa Duque says he has friends who, even with a car in Macau, eventually acquired another Chinese enrollment car who are parked in the border parking park because it is cheaper to rent a place to park.
Macanese understands that between local SMEs and trade in China “there is no possible competition”, especially with online sales platforms. “People no longer go to stores here, there are a thousand choices and you can buy it from home. My girlfriend rarely goes to the supermarket, does everything online, for example, ”he added.</description><pubDate>2025-03-03 00:29:46</pubDate></item><item><title>Satellite Casinos | Sam Hou Fai confirms transition or closures</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/03/casinos-satelite-sam-hou-fai-confirma-transicao-ou-encerramentos/</link><description>The chief executive confirmed the policy that can dictate the definitive closure of satellite casinos by the end of the year. Sam Hou Fai threw responsibility for jobs for game dealers
 
The Chief Executive filed responsibility for the eventual extinction of jobs linked to the satellite casinos for game concessionaires. On Thursday night, in statements to the media, Sam Hou Fai confirmed that concessionaires and satellite casinos have to end the year ending the exploration model of game spaces.
Satellite casinos result from agreements between some independent dealers and companies, which explore some game spaces, as with Kam Pek or Bridge 16 casinos, a total of 11 casinos. In this model, the independent companies exploit casinos, but with workers, game tables and chips of the dealers, with whom they have an agreement and who make payments.
However, the last review of the game law established a period of three years to finish this model. As a result, dealers may choose to assume, by themselves, the exploration of these casinos or close the spaces. The last option may be a threat to the direct jobs of the workers of these casinos, as they may no longer be necessary, but also to indirect jobs, linked to spaces such as restaurants and stores living within or in the vicinity of these casinos.
Asked about the matter, Sam Hou Fai confirmed that the government hopes to see the law enforced, so it is not on the table the possibility of allowing a period of transition period. "I believe that game operators will communicate well with their satellite casinos on how they will deal with this issue when the transition period is over," said Sam, quoted by TDM's Macao channel. "But I know that satellite casinos workers are distributed to the game companies, so operators have the responsibility of absorbing them or having plans for these workers," he said.
Sam Hou Fai did not explain what he understands for "plans" to workers, but may undergo early dismissals or reforms, with more advantageous conditions than those legally foreseen.
For now, the ruler claims to be unaware of the dealership plans, but has not removed the possibility of social support: “We have to see how game dealers will treat these casinos-satellite workers. The government will support if necessary, ”he said.
However, the new government leader did not reveal the planned supports. Currently, the value of the unemployment allowance is 150 patacas a day, with workers to receive a maximum of 90 days, which means 13,500 patacas.
Important sector
Despite the impact of the measure, Sam Hou Fai highlighted the importance of the sector. “The game industry is a very important sector for Macao and we expect stable, healthy, ordered, and based development. This is the right way to our territory, ”Sam said.
In recent months several deputies have shown concern about a possible vacancy of unemployment, such as Ron Lam, José Pereira Coutinho and Ella Lei.
The new job reduction vacancy in the game can arrive after the pandemic years have been lost nearly 20,000 jobs, according to the data indicated by Ella Lei, in February 2023. For this number also contributed campaigns against the promoters and the implementation of new rules, which made promoters economically unviable, in the face of concessionaire competition, the existence of promoters.</description><pubDate>2025-03-03 00:24:29</pubDate></item><item><title>GDP | Macao economy grew 8.8% in 2024</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/03/pib-economia-de-macau-cresceu-88-em-2024/</link><description>Macao Gross Domestic Product grew 8.8 percent by 2024 compared to the previous year, supported by the increase in the game industry and internal demand.

Regarding the growth of service exports, DSEC highlights the impetus given by the annual increase of 23.8 percent of the number of visitors entries in 2024.
The determining factor for the positive evolution of GDP was the 21.8 percent increase in game service exports over last year. Growth that contrasted with annual descent of 6.1 percent of exports of other tourist services, "due to the basis of relatively high comparison of the year 2023". Still, in this chapter, the 2024 record represented a growth of 13 per 2019.

Also the resident unemployment rate set a record in 2.1 percent
 
In the period between November and January, the unemployment rate went down to 1.6 percent, the lowest amount since DSEC began collecting data on unemployment in Macao in 1992, even before the transition from territory administration from Portugal to China.
According to the Directorate of Statistics and Census Services (DSEC), after seven months in a row to round 1.7 percent, the indicator fell 0.1 percentage points compared to the previous period, between October and December.
In a statement, the DSEC explained that the rate reduction is due to “mainly the Chinese New Year originating the reduction in the number of individuals looking for employment, which led to a decrease in the number of unemployed”.
The casinos sector hired 900 more people between November and January, reaching a labor of 72,500, while the Grosso and Retail trade also hired 200 more people. Macao received in January nearly 3.65 million visitors, 27.4 percent than in the same month of 2024 and the second highest value ever, while the game's revenues fell 5.6 percent in annual terms.

In the last three months, the unemployment rate has fallen to a historical minimum, despite the labor coming from abroad, including in the interior of China, increasing at almost 5,900 during the year 2024.
According to data from the Public Security Police Corps, released by the Directorate of Services for Labor Affairs on February 5, Macau employed more than 182,500 migrant workers at the end of December.

The game's recipes increased 6.8 percent in February, compared to the same month of 2024, rising after a homologous fall in January, was announced on Saturday. The casinos collected more than 19.7 billion patacas in February, according to data from the Game Inspection and Coordination Directorate (DICJ). A value that exceeded the expectations of analysts.

The Ag600, also the first large amphibian plane built in China, measures 39.6 meters long and 38.8 meters of wingspan, a size similar to that of a Boeing 737, and has a maximum weight of 53.5 tons. An amphibious plane is a model capable of peeling and landing on land and water.
O avião, que foi concebido principalmente para missões de salvamento marítimo e de combate a incêndios, completou os últimos testes de voo na província de Shaanxi, no noroeste da China, informou a AVIC, um dos fabricantes de aviões estatais do país, em comunicado.
Over the past two years, the AG600 has completed 3,560 hours of flight in preparation for aircraft certification, the Chinese state consortium added. Flight tests were performed in a wide range of scenarios, including extreme cold, high temperatures and moisture and strong winds to verify the operational capabilities of the aircraft.
The Ag600 is the largest amphibian aircraft currently in operation, comparable to scale to narrow fuselage aircraft such as Boeing 737 or Airbus A320. The first takeover of the aircraft took place on December 24, 2017, followed by another successful flight in 2018. In June 2024, China began the small scale production of the aircraft.</description><pubDate>2025-03-03 00:04:26</pubDate></item><item><title>Legionella | Man in serious condition attached to the fan</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/03/legionella-homem-em-estado-grave-ligado-a-ventilador/</link><description>A man is in serious condition and attached to a fan, after being infected by Legionella, in the one that is the first case of the year, according to Health Services (SS).

Zhuangzi, the Taoist philosopher, who will have lived between the fourth and 3rd century BC, possibly between 369 and 268 BC, left us in the homonymous work 《莊 (庄) 子》, as was customary at the time, the possibly transmitted teachings in the first person in the interior chapters (1-7), in the second person in the external chapters (8-21) and in the third person of other intellectuals in the chapters of miscellany (22-33).
It is an extremely motivating philosophy that rests, from my point of view, in three fundamental principles: the acceptance of spontaneous nature (道 giving); The Principle of Transformation (物化 Wùhuà), which leads to the postulate of an essential uniformity; and the non-acting (無為/无为 wuwéi), which presupposes the acceptance of a pre-established harmony and destination. We are facing the best order possible, so it is not right to interfere with what is given to us, letting us lead by a necessarily tension rhythm of life, but whose challenges should be viewed without negative reactions, following the existential bamboo model, when confronted with gigantic winds, such as those of tuffons in China.
Chapters 17 and 18, which now bring themselves allegedly belong to their closest disciples, who faithfully transmit the philosophy of the great Taoist master, and Taoism is the most devoted philosophy to develop a personal project, which will therefore function exemplary from the existential point of view.
Completing Chapter XVII, that of the Full Full (Qiū Shuǐ Dìshiqī), is assisted at a symbolic dialogue between the philosopher Zhuangzi and his great friend Huizi (惠子), known in the synological tradition, of which Father Thomas Merton is a good herald in The Via de Zhuangzi (1999, 126-127) Joy of fish ”, whose guideline principle is that of communicating connectivity among all living beings, the same that guides another episode, reported at the end of Chapter II, that of the philosopher dreams of being a butterfly (Zhuangzi, 1999,38-40).
In Chapter XVII, Zhuangzi affects the unbelieving friend Huizi to realize, or rather perfectly intuit the joy of fish, since when looking at them on the Hao River bridge recognizes the signs that in themselves manifest when they feel happy. Friend Huizi, following a rationalizing and separatist philosophy, opposes that this is impossible, being silenced by the logical assumption of communication between all nature. Zhuangzi appeals to the argument that it is possible to extend the intelligent dialogue of humans to all living beings. The philosopher, winning the debate, widened the mastery of language, which now includes the verbal, but also the visual, much closer to silent and intuitive communication, highly valued by the Taoist school, always suspicious of excessive and discursive profanity. And at the same time, guarantees the primacy of the connection, sometimes visible, sometimes invisible, among all nature, rooted in Tao, after all this viable connection of a flow of feelings among all beings, which leads to true joy, against the sad and solipsist cosmos defended in some rationalist philosophical traditions, whose primacy is based on a reason to establish the connection with the body, whether individual or whether it is individual or Collective, as António Damásio had the opportunity to denounce in the error of Descartes (2011).
In fact, what matters so that joy is guaranteed, including humans, goes through a widening of the sphere of sensitivity, the feeling of oneself, still thinking of Damásio, the feeling of others, the recognition of the satisfaction coming from the profound connection between all nature.
Then move on to the translation of dialogue, the traditional Chinese to the contemporary and the contemporary to Portuguese:
原文 Classic Chinese1
莊子與惠子遊於濠梁之上。莊子曰： “鯈魚 2 出遊從容 ， 是魚之樂也。”
惠子曰： “子非魚 ， 安知魚之樂？”
莊子曰： “子非我 ， 安知我不知魚之樂？”
惠子曰： “我非子 ， 固不知子矣；子固非魚也 ， 子之不知魚之樂 ， 全矣。”
莊子曰： “請循其本。子曰‘ 汝安知魚樂 ’雲者 ， 既已知吾知之而問我 ， 我知之濠上也。”
今译 Contemporary Chinese
庄子和惠子在濠水桥上游玩。庄子说： “白鲦鱼从容不迫地游来游去 ， 这是鱼的快乐啊！”
惠子说： “您不是鱼 ， 怎么知道鱼是快乐的？”
庄子说： “您不是我 ， 怎么知道我不晓得鱼的快乐？”
惠子说： “我不是您 ， 固然不知道您；您本来也不知道鱼 ， 那么您不知道鱼的快乐 ， 是完全可以肯定的了。“
庄子说： “请回到原来的话题吧。您说‘ 您怎么知道鱼的快乐 ’这句话 ， 就是您已知道我晓得鱼的快乐而来问我的 ， —— 我是在濠水桥上知道的啊！”
(ZHUANGZI, 1999, 282-3)
Note that the translation I propose to Portuguese has some adaptation to our language, for example, I use conjunctions and conjunctive phrases to join prayers and avoid the repetition of certain verbs, with non-philosophical sense, to make reading more fluid:
Zhuangzi and Huizi were walking on the Hao River bridge, when Zhuangzi said, "The fish swim calmly and carelessly from side to side, this is your joy!"
Huizi replied, "If it's not fish, how can you know the joy of fish?"
Zhuangzi replied, "You're not me, how can you know that I don't know about the joy of fish?"
Huizi continued: “I am not my friend, which is why I do not know him, and the Lord does not know the fish either, so it is more than certain that they do not know their joy.”
Zhuangzi concluded: “Let's go back to the root of the question. He said the following prayer: 'How can you know the joy of the fish', so you already realized that I knew their joy, so I asked me about me, I met her on the Hao River bridge! ”
This spontaneous and natural connection to all that exists is a source of great joy and happiness, as explained to us in chapter XVIII, entitled “Perfect Happiness”. Here the principle of non-acting (無為/无为 wúwéi) is defended, rather, of agreement with nature, inner and exterior, without seeking to interfere with the world around us, because if the goal is to achieve happiness, it is not acquired by any of our actions that have in view of material or social values, as well as wealth, honors, abundance or even health; We arrived at this world without being consulted and will leave when it is our time, as well illustrated the episode of the death of Zhuangzi's wife, reported in this same chapter. When Huizi visits his friend to introduce him to his condolences, he finds him crouching to drum into a basin and singing, in a clear acceptance of fate: yes, the woman had made her very good company over decades, she had to accept the law of nature and not revolt against the pre-established order, which tells us there is health and illness, wealth and poverty, life and death in an eternal transformation cycle.  "Genuine happiness is derived from the absence of happiness, just as perfect fame derives from the absence of fame." (至樂無樂 ， 至譽無譽, in the contemporary version of simplified Chinese, 最大的快乐在于 ‘无乐 '最高的荣誉在于‘ 无誉 ’(Zhuangzi, 1999, 286).
By non-acting, or rather, as we do not follow the existential models of the light/clairvoyant sky and the quiet earth, thus achieving perfect happiness and immense joy in living:
原文 Classic Chinese
天下是非果未可定也。雖然 ， 無為可以定是非。至樂活身 ， 惟無為幾存。請嘗試言之。天無為以之清 ， 地無為以之寧 ， 故兩無為相合 故兩無為相合 萬物皆化生。芒乎芴乎 無從出乎？芴乎芒乎 ， 而無有象乎！萬物職職 ， 皆從無為殖。故曰天地無為也而無不為也
今译 Contemporary Chinese
天下的是非确实还难以下定论。尽管如此 ， “无为” 可以定是非。最大的快乐能存活身心 ， 而只有清静无为才几乎可以存活身心。请让我说说试试看：天 “无为” ， 因而清虚; 地 “无为” ， 因而宁静 ， 天与地这两个无为的合一 ， 才孕育出万物的存在。恍恍惚惚 才孕育出万物的存在。恍恍惚惚 ， 不知道它们从哪里生出来！恍恍惚惚找不出一点迹象来！万物繁多 “天地无心作为 ， 却没有一样东西不是从它们之中产生出来的。”
(ZHUANGZI, 1999, 286)
Translation proposal for Portuguese
It is very difficult to distinguish right from wrong in our world, even though it “not acting” can do so, which is the greatest happiness. Allow me to say it, the sky is clairvoyant because of its "not acting"; The earth is quiet because of its "not acting." Not acting conjugates from heaven and earth leads to pregnancy and existence of all that lives indistinctly, without realizing where they came from! Indistinctly, without traces, the myriads of beings arise, all created from a vital non-report. That is why it is said that, "Heaven and Earth create unintentionally, but nothing is generated."
And it is added in conclusion that it does not interfere with the heaven of the earth with the natural order of the "ten thousand beings" brings great joy and even supreme happiness following what is defended by the founder of Taoism, in chapter VII of the book of the road and virtue 《道德经 • 七》 3, in the translation of António Graça de Abreu (2013):
天長地久
天地所以能長且久者
以其不自生
故能長生
(……)
Eternal, heaven and earth.
Why eternal?
Do not exist for themselves,
So they remain forever.

In 11 disciplines analyzed, such as Law, Management and Economics, China and Singapore are in the 50 best, while Hong Kong stands out in Education Studies
 
The latest world ranking of higher education by areas of knowledge of Times Higher Education, the “World University Rankings by Subject 2025”, concludes that universities in the interior of China have climbed to top positions, although Asia continues to position themselves in the areas of arts and humanities.
In total, 11 academic areas were analyzed. “Arts and Humanities”, “Business and Economics”, “Computer Science”, “Education Studies”, “Engineering”, “Law”, “Life Sciences”, “Medicine and Health”, “Physical Sciences”, “Psychology” and “Social Sciences”.
It is concluded, according to an official note from Times Higher Education (The), that “China and Singapore appear among the 50 best in all 11 subjects”, especially the University of Beijing and Tsinghua University, respectively, for fourth and sex places in “business and economy” disciplines. In fact, “Asia's best performance is registered in the areas of management and economics”, with “its main universities to continue to have difficulty competing worldwide in the field of arts and humanities”. "Concerns about the 'crisis' in humanities seem to be designed to continue this year, but the analysis of The reveals the continuous importance to elite institutions."
Given the analysis of 11 academic areas, the neighboring region of Hong Kong stands out in nine, especially in the area of ​​education, where the University of Beijing and Tsinghua also achieved good results. “The National University of Singapore again occupies the ninth position in Engineering, entering the top 10 of the physical sciences-the first institution in Asia to achieve it-in 10th place,” is also read.
Quoted by the same grade, Simon Marginson, professor at Oxford University, an institution that usually leads rankings worldwide, said that Asia's performance in this classification shows “the multipolar world of higher education” existing today, with greater amplification “national academic capacity”.
"In this context, over time, the relative position of Anglosfera countries and Western Europe must decrease, not because its absolute quality is decreasing, but because the field of comparison is more filled with other countries to emerge," he said.
The same responsible also pointed out that "East Asia and Southeast Asian higher education systems have improved over the past two decades due to the growth in the number of students, increased public funding, more performance -oriented organization and management and selective internationalization policies."
One of the areas where there is a better position of Asian universities is in education studies, showing “a remarkable force, with three universities in the top 10, with the University of Hong Kong in sixth place, the University of Tsinghua in seventh place and the university of Beijing in eighth place”. In addition, The Show that the Chinese University of Hong Kong has made “significant progress” from 19th to 11th position. On the other hand, the Taiwan National University of Science and Technology (Taiwan Tech) obtained "the highest score in terms of research quality."
However, global leadership goes to Stanford University, "surpassing the University of California, Berkeley, demonstrating exceptional performance in both teaching and research environment."
China rises in law
Looking at the area of ​​law, there is currently, according to the ranking of The, the best place to study than Stanford University, which has achieved “excellence in teaching and research environment”, followed by Harvard University, with “exceptional performance” and, thirdly, the University of New York, “with the highest score in terms of research environment”.
Highlight, in this area, for the entrance of the University of Beijing in 14th position, in part due to the good classification “in teaching and the research environment”. It should be noted that, as regards the law, 389 institutions from 48 countries and territories were classified, using 18 “strict performance indicators”.
In the area of ​​law, specialties are analyzed such as constitutional and administrative law and examination to structures and frameworks of governance, or international law, which includes global legal systems and treaties.
Capital knowledge
China also stands out in business and economy, led by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The University of Beijing rose to fourth place, accompanied by 20 other Chinese universities that improved their positions in the table. In this area were analyzed 990 institutions from 85 countries and territories, with the attention focusing on the quality of teaching and research in disciplines such as strategic leadership, international business and organizational development, as well as business finances or economic.
With regard to the social sciences, China actually comes below the list of the top 20, again with the University of Beijing in 16th and the University of Tsinghua in 20th. Here, the lead is up to MIT, passing Stanford University for the third to call Oxford, with "exceptional performance in teaching and research environment." The London School of Economics and Political Science remains an integral institution of the top 10, now occupying ninth place.
1,093 institutions from 100 countries and territories were analyzed in disciplines such as media communication and studies, politics and international studies, including development studies, sociology, geography and anthropology.
China also rose in the discipline of Computer Science with the University of Beijing to move from 16th to 12th place. In this area, leads the University of Oxford, reaching its highest score ever.
MIT Leads in Arts
The MIT has been at the head of Stanford University, assuming “first place in arts and humanities, as well as business, economy and social sciences”, even if it is first recognized “by specialization in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics”. According to the ranking, it is now “the best place to study arts - with high scores in each of the five pillars underlying the methodology, especially the quality of the investigation and the international perspective”.
In the 11 disciplines of the ranking, "Stanford ranked first in education, law and psychology studies, Harvard University ranked first in engineering and life sciences."
The only local institution in the ranking of The Disciplines is the University of Macao (one), but in places far below top 10: in the area of ​​computational sciences, it is in the 126-150 best in the world, a similar position occupied in the area of ​​education and engineering. In the area of ​​law, for example, one is in the best group of 176-200, while in life sciences is among the 151-175 best.</description><pubDate>2025-02-25 04:59:01</pubDate></item><item><title>Study | Digital insomnia treatment can combat depression</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/24/estudo-tratamento-digital-de-insonia-pode-combater-depressao/</link><description>An unprecedented study developed by several universities, including the Chinese Hong Kong University and the University of Beijing, concluded that cognitive behavioral therapy through mobile phone applications can help combat young people by monitoring insomious. The rate of disease reduction is about 40 percent
 
The study “Effectiveness of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Based on insomnia for insomnia in the prevention of Major depressive disorder in insomnia and subclinical depression: a random clinical trial” [Effectiveness of App-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia on Preventing Major Depressive Desorder Inorder Whit Insomnia and Subclinical Depression: Randomized clinical trial] promises answers to the treatment of cases of depression in the younger ones.
The work, published by PLOS MEDICINE magazine and developed by academics from various universities in Hong Kong and China, included the University of Hong Kong, Chinese Hong Kong University or the University of Beijing, concludes that it is possible to reduce, by about 40 percent, cases of depression in young people using a mobile phone application that monitors insoponials, a habitual symptoms, a symptom in the one who suffers from the sufferers illness. The data were presented at the end of last week in Hong Kong.
To reach the results, a random sample of more than 700 young Chinese from the interior of China and Hong Kong with insomnia disturbance and depressive symptoms, aged 15 to 25 years, who underwent testing with application for six weeks, was chosen.
Thus, “this controlled and random study evaluated the efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy for application based on application (TCC-I) in preventing the future appearance of Major Depressive Disturbance (MDD) in young people” can be read. This at a time when "more and more evidence suggests that insomnia plays an important role in the development of depression," in this investigation "intervention in insomnia as a promising approach to prevent depression in young people."
Thus, “applications based TCC-I is effective in preventing the future appearance of major depression and improving the results of insomnia among young people with insomnia and subclinical depression”. The study also concludes that "these results underline the importance of aiming at insomnia to prevent the appearance of DMG [a type of depression] and enhance the need for greater dissemination of digital TCC-I to promote sleep and mental health in the young population."
It is also concluded that the TCC-I based on applications "not only improved night insomnia symptoms, but also reduced daytime fatigue and led to greater change to maturity."
More than 700 young people analyzed
After testing the application of TCC-I, base clinical interviews were conducted over a period of six to 12 months to understand the results in participants and monitor symptoms. We spoke, in the period between September 9, 2019 and November 25, 2022, of 708 participants, of which 407 was women (57 percent), with an average ages of 22 years. The study also points out that “37 participants, 10 percent, in the intervention group and 62 participants, 18 percent, in the control group developed new mood disturbances over the 12 months of follow -up”.
In turn, the group that was subject to CBT-I based on mobile phone application, ie cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, presented “rates of remission of insomnia disturbance higher than post-intervention control groups” within one year. In addition, the same group "reported a greater decrease in depressive symptoms than post-intervention controls and over six months of follow-up." The authors of the study understand that "insomnia was a mediator of the effects of intervention on depression", and no adverse events related to interventions were reported. "
The authors left for this study with some proven ideas that insomnia is one of the main causes for depression. "Emerging data on insomnia intervention, especially cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (TCC-I), have shown promising results in insomnia relief and depressive symptoms in patients with insomnia," he reads.
Existing investigations focus on adults and elderly, so it was important to analyze this matter among the younger ones.
"In addition, there are few studies with suitable statistical power to demonstrate the preventive effect of TCC-I on depression, both at the level of symptoms and disturbances," explains the study authors, stressing that "little is known about whether the digital insomnia intervention can potentially prevent youthful depression."
Important meanings
The study also points out that cognitive behavioral therapy for applications based on insomnia is a viable and effective intervention to prevent future depression at both symptoms and disturbances in young people. ” However, further studies are recommended to explore “the integration of application-based TCC-I in clinical practice to improve accessibility and prevent depression among the young population”.
It is also mentioned the need for more clinical trials “to explore the potential benefits of adapting digital interventions on sleep in relief and prevention of depression” in order to “move towards personalized and staggered care approaches to the community”.
Limitations are referred to in this study published in “PLOS Medicine”, namely “the inclusion of a mixture of individuals with and without prior depression, and a limited sample of adolescents, although there was an adequate global sample”.
To the Hong Kong press, the study authors spoke of the importance of these results and how they can constitute new tools in future treatments of the disease. Quoted by The Standard HK, Chen Si-Jing, the first author of the Postdoctoral Research and Psychiatry Department of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said the study "shows that Digital TCC-I is effective in preventing the future appearance of severe depression, with satisfactory effectiveness." Wing Yun-Kwok, director of the Li Chiu Kong family sleep evaluation unit, indicated that future studies will focus on digital intervention on insomnia in clinical practice.
The unprecedented character of this study in Asia still gives him greater importance. According to Lu Lin, an academic at the Chinese Academy of Sciences and president of the PKU Sixth Hospital, to date "no investigation in Asia had been carried out on the effectiveness of this therapy."</description><pubDate>2025-02-24 02:07:54</pubDate></item><item><title>Diplomacy | Macao Platform seen in the context of Chinese foreign policy</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/19/diplomacia-plataforma-de-macau-vista-no-contexto-da-politica-externa-chinesa/</link><description>In "Paradiplomacy in China: Macao's role in relations between sino-Portuguese countries," Xu Heng Wang concludes that the role of platform with Lusophony "can be seen with extension of China's foreign policy." However, the MSar presents its own ideas, without “complete obedience to the central government”, indicates the academic
 
Macao's diplomatic role in the relationship with China and Portuguese -speaking countries was the focus of Xu Heng Wang's doctoral thesis defended in January at the University of Coimbra (UC) Faculty of Economics. In “Paradiplomacy in China: Macao's role in relations between sino-Portuguese countries”, the author argues that, regarding the role of Economic and Commercial Platform of MSA in the connection of Beijing and Portuguese-speaking countries, there is a certain extent of Chinese foreign policy, but at the same time, ideas proper to local authorities.
"Although the role of Macao as an economic and commercial platform can be seen as an extension of China's foreign policy, this does not mean that Macau is in a state of complete obedience to the central government," is referred to in research work.
Although it is stressed that “it is difficult to discern Macao's desire to develop, it must be mentioned that Macau has his own ideas about the course of his development”, namely in relation to the game and the entire economic structure.
“Macao has long foresaw that the structure of his economy would be unbalanced and that the game would be dominant. Authorities and academics have also made many debates on the issue of unsustainable development based on the game industry. At the same time, Macau is also very aware of its advantages in terms of cultural integration, having carried out the construction of a historic and cultural city, becoming a tourist attraction. ”
Between the own ideas and what is defined in the field of foreign policy by Beijing, there is "a direction of the development of Macao which, basically, is consistent with the role that the central government has conceived to Macao."
In this context, the author concludes that “the interests of Macao and the Central Government are basically the same”, being “a special case of paradiplomacy in China”, due to the implementation of politics “a country, two systems” in the territory and the high degree of autonomy it provides in various areas.
THE ROLE OF THE MACAU FORUM
Xu Heng Wang took a different approach on this issue, not resorting to traditional international relations theories, because “Macao interactions involve both state and non-state actors,” so these theories “do not provide an accurate explanation of Macao's role”. Thus, and to understand the role of Macau in the relations between China and the Portuguese -speaking countries, the idea of ​​paradiplomacy with Guanxi theory, a term used to describe social, economic or political relationships that can enhance business or other benefits, was combined.
Thus, it is said that "the creation of the Macau Forum can be considered one of the prominent paradiplomatic activities," with "Macao playing a role that mixes its development with the strategic objectives of the Chinese central government, especially with regard to Portuguese -speaking countries."
Macao has performed some relevant activities in the relations between China and Portuguese-speaking countries, ”although it is assumed that“ the results have been limited so far ”.
The academic states that these activities are "mainly concentrated in the fields of economics, education, tourism, culture and technology, with political effects that are not yet so evident." In addition, it is pointed out that "the influence of Macau on the relations between China and the different Portuguese -speaking countries has varied in intensity." Still, "much of the interaction and cooperation between Macao, China and the Portuguese -speaking countries occurred through the Macao Forum."
Help with objectives
In general terms, the “paradiplomacy of Macao is a complex and fluid process”, and the territory “shows its identity as a world tourism and leisure center and a characteristic financial center with international activities”, with the aim of “improving economic structure” and making diversification beyond game.
The author highlights fundamental areas such as services for small and medium enterprises, exchange-cultural and formation of bilingual talents. In addition, it is explained that “the central government provides political support to Macau based on its foreign policy needs, with the reinforcement of cooperation” with Portuguese -speaking countries. In these actions, include the Great Bay project, as well as the idea of ​​Macao's establishment as the Renminbi Compensation Center (RMB).
“On the one hand, the central government provides conveniences to Macau and helps [the territory] to establish its identity, 'supported by the mainland China market'. On the other hand, it helps Macau to develop the activity of RMB compensation center for transactions that occur on the Macao negotiation platform. ”
Thus, it denotes the author, "the role of Macao in paradiplomacy, but as an assistant to the implementation of central foreign policy, is also evident." However, "the paradiplomacy of Macao does not only reflect the diplomatic objective of helping the Chinese government to establish relations with Portuguese -speaking countries, but also the improvement of Macau's own international influence."
The doctoral thesis also presents a practical case analysis of Macau's relationship with the most striking Portuguese -speaking countries in the economic relationship with China, namely Angola and Brazil. "For Angola, Macao has played an approach role to China," as the African country needs "foreign investment for the hydroelectric power, infrastructure and agriculture sector." Thus, the binding axis is made at the Macao Forum, where "Angola can establish relations with the Chinese central government and cooperate on investment, in addition to the oil sector."
In addition, "most of China's investment in Angola comes from large companies, while small and medium -sized companies still depend mainly on Macau for commercial cooperation."
In the case of Brazil the situation is slightly different, because “in sino-Brazilian relations, the role of Macao is not obvious”, more “centered around the BRICS”, a group of emerging economies initially founded by Brazil, Russia, India and China, which today has ten member countries.
“Although the first ministerial meeting of the Macao Forum (2003) preceded the first meeting of the BRICS (2009) leaders, the impact of the Macao Forum on Sino-Brazilian Relations is not obviously as good as the influence established through direct meetings. Therefore, in the early days of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Brazil, relations between the two countries developed more at national level. ”
It is also highlighted that "although the role that Macao has in the opening of a door to the mainland China market has been established in Brazil's eyes, the impact of Macau on sino-Brazilian relations has not yet become obvious."
It is certain, however, that in recent years "the continuous development of the Macao Forum and the continuous improvement of organizational activities, its attraction to Brazil has become increasingly evident." “As Brazil tries to expand trade, commercial cooperation and investment with China will no longer be concentrated only in national business giants and will be increasingly targeted at private companies,” is still completed.
Regarding Portugal, the “attitude is very positive”, to the existing historical connection. “In many memos and statements signed with China, Macau has been stated to play an increasingly important role as a link between China and Portugal. Portugal and China have great technical cooperation in the domains of new energies, aerospace industry and other technological innovations. There is also a profound relationship of cooperation in the field of education. ”
It is also noteworthy that Portugal “not only signed cooperation agreements in the field of teaching with universities in the interior of China, but also signed several cooperation and exchange agreements with the main universities of Macao”.</description><pubDate>2025-02-19 00:24:24</pubDate></item><item><title>Economy | Trips to China increase due to diversity and low prices</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/03/economia-viagens-a-china-aumentam-devido-a-diversidade-e-precos-baixos/</link><description>Going to China has never been so easy, fast and cheap. Two residents of Macao of Portuguese nationality reveal to HM which leads them to cross the border frequently, especially the weekend. Cultural diversity, low prices and higher quality of service in bars and restaurants make all the difference
 
Macao Small and Medium-sized (SME) have faced, since the reopening of borders in the postpandeia period, huge difficulties to recover the business, especially those that are further away from the tourist areas. At a time when traveling to China has become extremely easy and cheap, two residents explain why they prefer to move often to the neighboring city of Zhuhai, or even Shenzhen, and consume there instead of being in Macao. Options like dinner outside, catching a taxi or drinking a glass are much cheaper, and the possibility of driving outside the territory has made this option more frequent. But electronic trade has also contributed to the fall of local consumption, they ensure.
Nelson Moura, journalist and resident of Portuguese nationality, goes to Zhuhai whenever he has a free weekend or holidays. It even goes between three to four times a month. “Costs are lower inside China, and then there is the novelty factor. It has never been easy for a non -Chinese resident of Macau to go to China. I previously needed to ask for a visa, had a reduced deadline, and this greatly limited my trips, and always chose more distant places in a context of tourist travel. Local residents could go to China before, but the current convenience, with organized and developed borders, especially Hengqin, with the connection to the light meter, allows for easier connections, ”he told HM.
Since China has flexed the policy of visas and increased the offer of border circulation, traveling to the country is no longer seen as a great trip. “As a foreigner residing in Macao, going to China was a bit like going traveling to another Asian country. In the pandemic we did not go practically from Macau, but now since the policy of visas to Portuguese has been flexible, it is possible to go to China whenever we want, ”said Nelson Moura.
“I am as easily as a Chinese resident, and it has become a viable option to go to the weekends and holidays to China, knowing different sites. The food is a third of the price of what is practiced in Macau, has more quality, with fresh products, the reception offers are better. Macao is a great city, but after three years of pandemic knows very well to get out of here whenever we want. It is a more convenient option now than before. ”
Nelson Moura also considers that "for the Chinese community of Macao and Hong Kong there is a greater convenience of travel," as "there are many residents leading all weekends to China just to go to large commercial surfaces, which allows you to buy large amounts of food."
“Traffic near the border of the HKZM siege or bridge is at a level never seen before. There is the option of being able to drive in the large bay zone which is good for small and expensive cities like are Macau and Hong Kong, ”he said.
PME, the eternal problem
On the side of Macau, associations linked to the Chinese community's commercial sector call for help, asking for more measures such as the great consumption award, or even consumer cards, that is, more campaigns and initiatives so that residents can buy more in Macao with discounts or support.
One of the last voices showing concern about this scenario was Stanley Au, president of the Macao SME association. To TDM Canal Macau, the official argued that in the next lines of government action the Chief Executive, Sam Hou Fai, has to show effective measures to avoid closing and, consequently, more unemployment. “The most urgent and current situation is the closure of companies. I believe the population saw many stores closed in different neighborhoods of the territory. Sometimes, on the same street, there are more stores closed than opened. In addition, the biggest problem is that Macau is facing continuous economic slowdown. If we do not solve this problem, society does not improve, ”he added.
However, according to Nelson Moura, it will always be difficult to combat the attraction of the consumption of Greater China. “Macao's local commerce is a complicated issue. There is a major reduction in consumers, especially on weekends and days when people have time to leave the city. ”
Electronic trade also enhances a reduction in local consumption. “Residents know they find more and cheaper out there. There are Chinese electronic trade companies, such as TAOBAO, which allow purchases from all over China to Macao without transportation charges, which has reduced domestic consumption. People go to stores to see what they want to buy and then do it at Taobao. I don't know how this trend can be circumvented. It is capitalism to work, ”explained Nelson Moura.
The resident also draws attention to the fact that it is now easier to use online payment platforms in China with foreign cards or Macao banks, namely through MPay.
Nelson Moura believes that local SMEs have only endured so much time because they were in a kind of closed economic circuit. “Local businesses lived a little in an island economy, and they survived the fact that the Macao market is in the territory, without people could leave so much. Now that there has been competition with what China has to offer, companies suffer because they often don't offer the service so much quality and at such an attractive price. I know the situation in Hong Kong is similar. ”
“Like” in China
Macaense Miguel Duque has always worked in Macao and spent in the territory most of the days of the week, but since he started teaching in Zhuhai his life has become more across the border. Highlights the much cheaper night exits as well as the restoration offer. “Macao has no variety and people are filled with the fact that the territory is small. We have hotels and restaurants, but they are expensive because the lace are expensive. Faced with China, in terms of price, the difference is like between heaven and earth. I give an example: To take a taxi from the siege gates to the university where I teach it is 40 minutes of travel, 28 kilometers, and paid about 60 to 80 Renminbis. It's very cheap. In Macao, from the doors of the siege to Coloane we pay 150 patacas or more, the price difference is huge. ”
Miguel Rosa Duque says that the trips to China in her circle of friends have become so frequent that they even created a group on the WhatsApp social network to facilitate group walks. “I prefer to go to China a thousand times just for fun. I have a lot of variety of bars and nightclubs and in Macau everything is dead. A two -person massage costs 600 Renminbis in Macao costs twice. I don't talk about hotel massage. Customer service is much better in China, with more attention to customers, more attentive, and it's all cheaper. If we spend 1000 patacas on a night in Macao, China we spend 400 Renminbis and we are treated like kings. The variety is infinite in terms of restaurants. Macau can't compete, ”he said.
Miguel Rosa Duque says he has friends who, even with a car in Macau, eventually acquired another Chinese enrollment car who are parked in the border parking park because it is cheaper to rent a place to park.
Macanese understands that between local SMEs and trade in China “there is no possible competition”, especially with online sales platforms. “People no longer go to stores here, there are a thousand choices and you can buy it from home. My girlfriend rarely goes to the supermarket, does everything online, for example, ”he added.</description><pubDate>2025-03-03 00:29:46</pubDate></item><item><title>Vocational Education | Alert Study for Human Resources Failures in China</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/18/ensino-profissional-estudo-alerta-para-falhas-em-recursos-humanos-na-china/</link><description>A study published in The China Quarterly concludes that there are still many questions to resolve so that technical-professional education in China can respond to human resources needs. The work warns of the “rapid massification” of this type of education, with priority for “number of enrollment over quality”
 
Technical-professional education in China has been popularized, but a recently published study in Cambridge University Press's “The China Quarterly” magazine, concludes that there are still gaps to find that courses can actually respond to the country's needs in the industrial sector.
“More Graduates, Fewer Skills? Vocational Education Expansion and Skilled Labar Shortages in China ”[More graduates, less skills? The expansion of vocational education and qualified labor faults in China] is the name of the study developed by Xinmiao Song of the University of Lingnan, and Duudo XU of the University of Hong Kong Department of Sociology.
Academic work draws attention to the “disturbing tendency” of “rapid massification of vocational education, which gives priority to the number of enrollment over the quality of education” and “does not respond to the search for skills and qualified labor”.
In addition, the authors add to the “adverse consequences for both administrative management and teaching, caused by this scenario. “The development of competences often is up to post-school professional associations and an exclusive group of elite students. However, reform initiatives, such as the Manual Arts Campaign and competency contests, benefit only a few, without improving the prospects of employment of the student population in general. ”
Thus, the two academics argue that “more attention to the tensions inherent to China's teaching and vocational training system”, because “only when there is a deeper understanding of the underlying causes to the ineffective training of competences in vocational schools China can achieve its national objective of industrial modernization”.
The study was developed in two vocational schools, and interviews were conducted to 104 students. In addition, ethnographic data of four doctoral projects were used in the area of ​​vocational education, developed between October 2017 and December 2020.
It is also noted that the country needs “increasingly urgent” of qualified workers “due to world economic competition”. However, "despite the massive expansion of the teaching and vocational training system in the last two decades, there is still a significant deficit of qualified labor," there is "debates about the ineffectiveness of vocational education." These focus above all on, “in the absence of institutional synergies between teaching and industry, but they often ignore the conflicts inherent to the vocational education system and the processes of competency training at the micro level”.
Practical difficulties
To the “micro level”, that is, in schools, the authors denote the existence of several difficulties in the effective functioning of these courses in line with the intended results.
In secondary education there is “a delicate balance between the promotion of social equality and the development of skills”. However, "analysis indicates that, in the context of the rapid expansion of secondary education, schools have difficulty effectively harmonizing these objectives."
“In order to maintain a proper student body, schools and teachers are often obliged to compromise the quality of candidates and teaching standards in the classroom. This situation generates a change in daily pedagogy and school administration to preserve discipline and stability, thus attributing the development of competences and the selection of talents-ideally a mission from the whole school-to extra-curricular professional associations, pursued by a few, ”he is added.
It is also concluded that “the acquisition of competences is a multifaceted process, shaped by the dynamic interaction between educators and students”, because “the academic preparation of students and their motivations to learn are equally pertinent for the formation of microcompetence, as are the resources of schools and the capabilities of teachers”.
Thus, “the resolution of the ineffective formation of competencies requires more than top initiatives to the base”, “a approach that recognizes the obstacles that students face in the acquisition of skills, as well as their seizures and uncertainties in the search for employment, is necessary.
The authors also talk about “elitism” in some formations related to handicraft courses and “competency contests”. "These initiatives may inadvertently suggest that handicrafts are reserved for a restricted number of people, as competencies contests often remain inaccessible to most vocational education students, both objective and psychologically."
Thus, the authors emphasize that "there is a significant undoing between this elitist approach to the acquisition of competences and the real conditions faced by vocational education students."
“The superficial promotion of manual labor spirit and the exclusivity of skills failed to truly resolve the challenges associated with the acquisition of skills, the search for employment and the commitment to follow technical professions among vocational education students,” is also mentioned.
Still, limitations in the study are referred to, namely the fact that it focuses only on public schools in higher secondary education, and the results may not completely represent other levels of vocational education, such as the higher institutes of vocational training ”.

Numbers from the “Factory of the World”
In the study is the intense industrial development that China has achieved in the last 40 years, emerging as the "factory of the world," as the authors describe, "taking advantage of their demographic dividends."
“However, the intensive model of labor growth has proved unsustainable due to population aging and intense global competition. To escape the 'medium income trap', the Chinese government has launched a series of industrial modernization actions in the transforming industry and services sectors, ”but“ despite the ambitious agendas for the next decade, the persistent scarcity of qualified workers continues to make these efforts difficult, ”he is mentioned.
By 2020, there were more than 23 million vocational students, so "this scarcity of skilled labor is a surprise," is referred to in the study, which highlights "the substantial efforts and resources that the Chinese government has dedicated to improving vocational education in recent years."
For example, “Free Secondary Professional Education, the expansion of higher vocational facilities in one million students from 2019 to 2021 and the creation of universities of applied technology” emerged. In addition, the vocational education system watched an unprecedented trajectory, with enrollment in secondary professional schools higher than increasing from 4.56 million in 2004 to 7.11 million in 2009 ″.
In terms of the need for human resources, the study cites data from China's Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security for 80 cities in the country. "The ministry's quarterly reports have revealed that the work between work/person looking for qualified labor reached a historical peak of 2.0 in early 2020", and "higher level qualified workers, technicians and higher technicians had a particularly high demand."
It is also noted that the Ministry of Education predicts that the country continues to confront this year “with a deficit of 30 million qualified workers, which represents a 48 percent break in domains such as materials, energy savings and vehicles powered by new energies”.</description><pubDate>2025-02-18 00:25:20</pubDate></item><item><title>Work | Future Ready Talent Program released in Macau and Hong Kong</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/17/108890/</link><description>Wynn and insurer Aia are two of the 14 companies that are part of the “Future Ready” project, launched by LinkedIn on Thursday in Hong Kong. The program bets on vocational training in the two special administrative regions, with special focus on artificial intelligence
 
The LinkedIn social network, facing the world of work, launched last week in Hong Kong, a talent formation program that has the collaboration of 14 companies from the territory and Macao, namely the Aia insurer and the Wynn game operator. The program, titled “LinkedIn Future Ready”, aims to “equip professionals from Hong Kong and Macau with the skills needed to thrive in a rapidly evolving job market,” is referred to in a note of the organization.
The other companies or participating entities are the Cathay Pacific airline, the Chow Tai Fook jewelry group, the PLC group, the English Schools Foundation, the FWD group, the Hop Lun, the Link Asset Management, the MTR Corporation, the company that manages the hong Kong meter, and the PCCW consultant, without forgetting Prudential, Swire Properties, which operates in the real estate market, and the Hong Kong Jockey Club.
The program includes "initiatives for updating skills, knowledge exchange and [sharing] of data based information." Essentially, “Future Ready” intends to “equip companies with tools and resources needed to navigate a workforce transformation scenario and promote a culture of innovation”.
Given the latest projections of the social network, which published, in January, the report "Work Change Report - Ai Is Coming to Work" [Labor Change Report - Artificial Intelligence (IA) is coming to work], the program "Future Ready" aims to make more training in this area in both territories.
"The" LinkedIn Future Ready "program is a bold initiative that aims to support the work force in Hong Kong and to collect gaps in terms of competences, as well as unlocking new opportunities in growing economy," said Mei NG, director-general of LinkedIn social network in Hong Kong.
The official also added that the social network will work closely with the 14 participating companies, to build “a more resilient workforce” by providing “companies that develop and implement innovative talent strategies and ensure that their employees are equipped with the skills needed to succeed in the future”.
Skills below
According to the same statement, before advancing to this training program, an assessment of markets was made in both territories. It is concluded that “Hong Kong and Macao perform well in cross-cutting skills and innovation-both essential to navigating the dynamic current business landscape”, and by transversal skills, “communication, teamwork and leadership” is understood.
In terms of innovation, another factor analyzed, "Hong Kong exceeds the APAC average [Asia-Pacific countries] in innovation skills, reinforcing its role as a future vision business center that also promotes industry transformation." However, the neighboring region “is behind APAC average in AI proficiency”, so the “Future Ready” program consider that there is “an urgent need for initiatives to improve skills to help enable the workforce to adapt without problems to technological advancement”.
There is, in this domain, a "growing demand for AI -related skills", as "77 percent of Hong Kong business leaders said they would hire a less experienced AI competencies rather than a more experienced candidate without these skills."
In addition, "although transverse skills remain the strongest area of ​​Hong Kong, the region continues to be below APAC average and is late in four of the five domains of critical skills evaluated."
One of the objectives of the program announced on Thursday is to “improve and requalify the labor” of both territories “for a future fueled with AI”, so that there is “a certain combination of technical and human skills”, constituting “a competitive advantage for professionals and organizations”.
The 14 partner companies will have access to more than 23,000 courses available on the “LinkedIn Learning” platform that are based on 41,000 skills sets, namely “curated learning pathways, technology training, AI training and state -of -the -art learning resources”, it is explained.
The future accelerates
According to the same report released by LinkedIn in January, AI's growing adoption worldwide will lead to a "search for new jobs and skills." The social network data reveal that "more than 10 percent of hired workers currently have positions that did not exist in 2000, including functions such as data scientist, social networking manager, sustainability manager, customer success manager and AI engineer."
In the concrete case of Hong Kong, by 2030, “60 percent of all skills used to do a job will have changed, with the innovations of accelerating this transformation to 80 percent”, is mentioned. Thus, it is concluded that "this rapid pace of change has created a gap of competencies that is difficult to conform in the short term."
In addition to betting on professionals, the “Future Ready” program also wants to promote ideas and debates, promising, for example, “quarterly round tables for executives” and “with sector leaders to discuss the evolution of jobs, skills and learning requirements”. “The program will also provide a platform for the sharing of best practices, influencing the broader development of the workforce in all sectors,” is still added.
Also noteworthy is that the LinkedIn report on changes in work structures describe the most usual forms of AI use, namely communication in human resources or marketing. Thus, "recruiters who use LinkedIn's AI -assisted messages to involve candidates are registering an acceptance rate 44 percent higher compared to the AI ​​-free messages." In addition, “marketers who use LinkedIn's ad campaign creation tool, Accelerate, are presenting a cost per 42 percent lower compared to the classic campaigns” of this social network.
For this report were held several inquiries, namely more than 2,500 entrepreneurs from five countries (United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany and India). The questionnaire focused on executives from various business areas (human resources, operations or marketing) was made in nine country and had 19,991 participants from companies with over 1000 employees. This inquiry was held from 26 November and December 13 last year.
In worldwide terms, in 2030 about 70 percent of each worker's tools and skills will change, with “emerging as a catalyst”, and “IMA investments [by companies] are starting to compensate: in the last two years, 51 percent of businesses that have adopted the general AI reported an increase in revenues of 10 percent or more”. “Unsurprisingly, 88 percent of top executives with top management positions said AI adoption to help accelerate business is something important to develop next year,” one reads.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Corruption | Report Alert for gaps in Hong Kong and Singapore</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/14/corrupcao-relatorio-alerta-para-lacunas-em-hong-kong-e-singapura/</link><description>The 2024 Corruption Perception Index presents Singapore as the third cleaner jurisdiction of corruption worldwide, out of 180 countries and regions. Hong Kong is in 17th place in the ranking, but the report leaves a warning: world financial centers remain vulnerable to corruption
 
This Tuesday was released the perception rate of corruption (CPI, in the English acronym), which analyzes corruption in the public sector of 180 countries and regions, the responsibility of the non-governmental organization international transparency.
In the case of China, the CPI reveals that there was no significant change. If 100 points means a country virtually corruption, and 0 points a highly corrupt country, China registered last year 43 points in 100, rising a position compared to 2023, occupying 76th ranking position.
The CPI also looks at Hong Kong's situation, which got 67 points in 100, occupying 17th position in 180 countries and regions around the world. Taiwan, is currently 25th in the ranking of 180 countries, and no change of positioning compared to the CPI of 2023.
To register the presence of an Asian country on the list of the four less corrupt. This is the case of Singapore, third with 84 points in 100, following Finland (2nd) and Denmark (1st). The list of the top four ends with New Zealand.
According to official CPI data, countries and regions that are considered “full democracies” have an average of 73 points, while those who have political systems in which “faults” have 47 points. According to the index, non-democratic regimes receive only on average 33 points.
The CPI analyzes corruption in 180 countries based on sources such as studies or specialists, measuring corruption only in the public sector. However, it is assumed limitations in this count, as the ranking does not include "corruption of private companies, financial secrecy or transnational corruption."
If the score represents "the level of perception of public sector corruption on a scale of 0-100," the country's position in the ranking is only comparison with other countries, and these lists "can change merely if the number of countries changes."
Looking at the global scenario, the report points out that "once again that developed economies dominate the top of the 2024 CPI ranking," it is countries that "have long benefited a state of strong law, the functioning of government institutions and political stability-factors that contribute to a perception of low corruption levels at the inside." However, "these attributes make these countries main targets of corrupt actors for money laundering and protection of illicit gains."
The Money Trail
According to the report, the fact that developed economies dominate the CPI can give a false idea that these countries "are making corruption effectively and remains untouched." “This idea could not be further from the truth. In particular, the nations that constitute large financial centers are more vulnerable to the financial flows of corruption. While their strong institutions convey an idea of ​​integrity, financial sectors and regulatory staff often provide opportunities to explore gaps, reducing anti-corruption global efforts, ”is still described.
In this regard, the examples of Hong Kong and other territories associated with offshore jurisdictions are presented, where it is not always possible to determine the trail of money. “Western financial centers such as Switzerland, Luxembourg, or the United Kingdom have a history of scrutiny of facilitating money laundering movements. However, non -western centers such as Hong Kong, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates progressively have played similar papers and require similar analysis. ”
“Like Western homologists, they boast the existence of a strong rule of law and institutions with a proper functioning, even though bank laws, corporate structures and secret provisions allow cases of funds washing and deviation from regulations, avoiding detection” of less legal cases, is still described.
It refers to the case of the transfer of African funds to financial centers, such as Carlos São Vicente, former CEO of an Angolan state company that transferred about $ 1.2 billion to companies registered in shorts, and later transferred money to accounts in Singapore and Switzerland. Only for a Singapore reported account, 558 million US dollars were transferred.
Opacity here
With regard to Hong Kong, it is revealed that by 2023 the territory "fines for four banks in a total of $ 3.2 million, negligent 0.0085 percent of the profits reported by these same banks this year."
Still regarding Raehk, it is revealed that "there is no central registration system on the possession of beneficiaries - it is simply required for companies that maintain this information for themselves." “Some types of investment funds are still exempt from maintaining records from their owners. With over 1.4 million companies registered in 2023, maintaining compliance with monitoring these rules is a huge challenge, creating gaps that actors in the shadow can easily explore, ”he is also described.
It also states that "opacity is even worse with regard to investment funds," with Hong Kong, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates "not having any form of registration of funds beneficiaries." “As a result, even the authorities have no way to know how many funds there are and how they operate in their countries, leaving the active adjacent to these funds alone. In cases where illegalities are suspected, authorities trust the beneficiaries to provide information: a process that consumes a lot of time and is not efficient, ”he adds.
Money and climate
In general terms, the CPI report points out that, in the Asia Pacific region, "leaders have failed to wage corruption in the middle of climbing a climate crisis." In a note signed by Ilham Mohamed, Yuambari Haihuie and UrantsetSeg Ulziikhuu, regional counselors of international transparency, they consider that “governments throughout the Asia-Pacific region continue to fail in anti-corruption promises”, drawing attention to the fact that the region faces many natural disasters and being a “home of a third of the world, with the second largest number with the second largest number of young people ”from the world.
“With no concerted efforts to combat corruption now, the first generation that is facing the extreme climate change will face disastrous consequences,” is described.
"Corruption obstructs environmental policies, wages climatic financing and prevents advancement in regulations and policies, making those who have less resources more vulnerable," the report, which points out that corruption waging "the effective use of money" in combating climate change.
Pakistan is mentioned, “which has suffered unprecedented climate vulnerabilities in recent years, with systemic governance failures and barriers in the implementation of policies - including delays in the implementation of regulations and establishment of institutions in the climate Change Act 2017 - have left the context of financing far below the US $ 348 billion projected for the end of 2030”.
Also noteworthy is the case of Vietname, which had 32 projects of solar and wind energy under investigation due to “abuse of power”. The report describes "that the lack of civic space for effective inspection, as well as a limited number of mechanisms for effective complaint systems support - such as informators protection - has threatened these fundamental programs."</description><pubDate>2025-02-14 00:11:38</pubDate></item><item><title>Demography | Birth is a “social responsibility”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/03/demografia-natalidade-e-uma-responsabilidade-social/</link><description>The chief executive considered that the increase in birth is “a social responsibility”, in statements made at a time when the government intends to have more children.

"If the financial situation allows it, the government can signal the community, supporting young parents to have more children, but we also consider this to be a social responsibility," he added.</description><pubDate>2025-03-03 00:27:31</pubDate></item><item><title>Supports | Sam Hou Fai prepares changes in the pecuniary check</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/03/apoios-sam-hou-fai-prepara-mudancas-no-cheque-pecuniario/</link><description>The chief executive admitted that he will promote changes in the distribution of the pecuniary check next year, considering that a lot of money was spent on this social program.
In the statements made to the end of the media last week, Sam Hou Fai stated that since the check began to be distributed in 2008, the government spent about 92.1 billion patacas, which understands that it is a large amount. “It's a lot of money. It is a number that exceeds 92 billion patacas, ”said Sam, quoted by the All About Macau portal. “Everyone can give their opinion [about the check], and some people have already given their opinion. This year the check will be distributed. And next year how will the distribution be? It depends on the global economic conjuncture, ”said the ruler.
This year, the pecuniary check budget is 7.48 billion patacas, with permanent residents receiving 10,000 patacas and the non-permanent 6,000 patacas.
In recent times, a campaign has been intensified to end the check distribution to residents who do not spend half of the year in Macao. And this aspect was highlighted by the Chief Executive, who pointed out to have heard opinions asking for support to reflect "justice, accuracy and an effective connection to the masters."
Despite the “a lot of money” spent on the pecuniary checks, the amount did not prevent the government from accumulating a financial reserve with more than 600 billion Patacas or following a policy of large investments, with buildings of several thousand millions of patacas, such as Metro Ligeiro, mud maritime terminal or the Macao Bridge.</description><pubDate>2025-03-03 00:25:45</pubDate></item><item><title>Satellite Casinos | Sam Hou Fai confirms transition or closures</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/03/casinos-satelite-sam-hou-fai-confirma-transicao-ou-encerramentos/</link><description>The chief executive confirmed the policy that can dictate the definitive closure of satellite casinos by the end of the year. Sam Hou Fai threw responsibility for jobs for game dealers
 
The Chief Executive filed responsibility for the eventual extinction of jobs linked to the satellite casinos for game concessionaires. On Thursday night, in statements to the media, Sam Hou Fai confirmed that concessionaires and satellite casinos have to end the year ending the exploration model of game spaces.
Satellite casinos result from agreements between some independent dealers and companies, which explore some game spaces, as with Kam Pek or Bridge 16 casinos, a total of 11 casinos. In this model, the independent companies exploit casinos, but with workers, game tables and chips of the dealers, with whom they have an agreement and who make payments.
However, the last review of the game law established a period of three years to finish this model. As a result, dealers may choose to assume, by themselves, the exploration of these casinos or close the spaces. The last option may be a threat to the direct jobs of the workers of these casinos, as they may no longer be necessary, but also to indirect jobs, linked to spaces such as restaurants and stores living within or in the vicinity of these casinos.
Asked about the matter, Sam Hou Fai confirmed that the government hopes to see the law enforced, so it is not on the table the possibility of allowing a period of transition period. "I believe that game operators will communicate well with their satellite casinos on how they will deal with this issue when the transition period is over," said Sam, quoted by TDM's Macao channel. "But I know that satellite casinos workers are distributed to the game companies, so operators have the responsibility of absorbing them or having plans for these workers," he said.
Sam Hou Fai did not explain what he understands for "plans" to workers, but may undergo early dismissals or reforms, with more advantageous conditions than those legally foreseen.
For now, the ruler claims to be unaware of the dealership plans, but has not removed the possibility of social support: “We have to see how game dealers will treat these casinos-satellite workers. The government will support if necessary, ”he said.
However, the new government leader did not reveal the planned supports. Currently, the value of the unemployment allowance is 150 patacas a day, with workers to receive a maximum of 90 days, which means 13,500 patacas.
Important sector
Despite the impact of the measure, Sam Hou Fai highlighted the importance of the sector. “The game industry is a very important sector for Macao and we expect stable, healthy, ordered, and based development. This is the right way to our territory, ”Sam said.
In recent months several deputies have shown concern about a possible vacancy of unemployment, such as Ron Lam, José Pereira Coutinho and Ella Lei.
The new job reduction vacancy in the game can arrive after the pandemic years have been lost nearly 20,000 jobs, according to the data indicated by Ella Lei, in February 2023. For this number also contributed campaigns against the promoters and the implementation of new rules, which made promoters economically unviable, in the face of concessionaire competition, the existence of promoters.</description><pubDate>2025-03-03 00:24:29</pubDate></item><item><title>Housing | New dump regime in force</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/03/habitacao-novo-regime-de-despejo-em-vigor/</link><description>The new regime makes it easier for the lease of the tenants with three rents, or more, in a delay in force on Saturday.

I decided to sit down and write in the notebook the first lines of this chronicle about what I had just seen and about the latest shocking news from last week.
Fifty years ago, Covilhã was a set of admirable houses without any skyscrapers. Today, the mountain town is so horrible full of buildings everywhere in the city. Various floors are endless. I was thinking how great the real estate business is. It must be a better business than the most profitable in the world, ice cream, pizzas and coffee. Once, I went to Lisbon a week to visit some family members and in one avenue I told ten real estate.
The Portuguese know that they can rarely buy or lease a house without a real estate and that the commissions of these companies make a grand profit. And if they are intended to acquire a land, the ideal is that all the paperwork is treated by a real estate, whether the land near a city, a village or even in a rustic interior. Real estate agents deal with everything and people are subject to what is defined in the business of this type of intermediation with regard to real estate, land and what you have to pay for real estate.
Well, last week the political discussion walked around real estate. I will call them political real estate. Why? Because after a secretary of state of the current government was fired when it came to the fire that owned a real estate and was simultaneously participating in the soil law, the media brought to the collation that Prime Minister Luís Montenegro had a real estate and claimed to have sold his quota to his wife and children. The matter was at Baila in the Assembly of the Republic and the opposition deputies were not satisfied with the explanations on the subject, presented by the Chief Executive.
As for us, Luís Montenegro had no transparency when interrogated on who the customers of his family business were. It was important that if they knew who the business partners were, because it will always be the suspicion that these clients could enjoy government benefits. Even the weekly Expresso, in its edition last Friday, reported that the 'Solverde' casinos pay 4,500 euro a month to the Montenegro company. Then, well, then it has been a crib of news about real estate arrested by members of the government.
The minister of territorial cohesion, Castro Almeida, who has the protection of the changes to the Soil Law, also had a real estate and came to say that he had already sold his part, but only after the "scolding" with the prime minister. However, a different position was assumed by the Minister of Justice, Rita Júdice, who publicly said that “he has no intention to get rid of his personal heritage, constituted with his work and his family”, namely the four companies with real estate business that he is a partner.
The truth is that from culture to work, passing the defense and presidency of the Council of Ministers, several ministries employ current and former partners of real estate companies. In the Ministry of Labor, it is already public that Minister Maria do Rosário Palma Ramalho includes the management of real estate heritage in her company ‘Palma Ramalho, LDA’. But it is not the only one: the Secretary of State for Labor, Adriano Rafael Moreira, also includes in the oblect of his consulting firm the “Heritage Management, and may for this purpose, to alienate, acquire and lease real estate and resale the acquired”.
The company is now called ‘Orbis Terra-Consulting and Management, LDA’, a more discreet name than the previous one with regard to the connection to real estate and the ruler is a single partner. But the appetite for real estate business in the executive of Luís Montenegro is not exhausted in these rulers and even the head of the dwelling folder at Miguel Pinto Luz's ministry was a partner of a company that is dedicated to the purchase and sale of real estate goods. This is' promobuilding-LDA real estate services.
The company where Patrícia Gonçalves da Costa was a manager between 2010 and 2015 and minority partner until 2019 also holds 50 percent of ‘Urbanquestion, LDA’, another company created in 2023 with the same object that includes the purchase and sale of real estate, construction of proceedings for marketing and promotion of urbanization studies. In the Ministry of Defense, the former CDS deputy Álvaro Castelo Branco, now Deputy Secretary of State, is a partner of ‘Rent 4 You - Society Imobiliária, LDA’. This society is also part of the former PSD deputy and current member of the Board of Directors of AICEP Paulo Rios de Oliveira.
The history of business activities of the real estate branch extends to the Ministry of Culture. The newly named Secretary of State Alberto Santos detained 90 percent of the Society ‘Villa Gallaecia-Mediation Imobiliária, LDA’, dedicated to real estate mediation and raising, but also to the evaluation of real estate and consulting.
And the Minister Dalila Rodrigues herself had quota in a family company: it is Rita Aguiar Rodrigues Architects Lda, which as the name indicates provides architectural services, but also includes in its object the construction and remodeling of buildings and the purchase, sale and resale of real estate. In a statement issued last Tuesday night, both the minister and the Secretary of State confirmed that they detained those quotas in societies, but gave them before taking office in the government. And in the Assembly of the Republic? Well, do not go open -mouthed.
In Parliament, there is also no shortage of deputies with companies in the real estate business. In addition to the four parliamentarians of the arrival, the party that has made possible and has been postponing the vote that can spoke the changes to the law of soils, are many examples in the PS benches and especially the PSD. Giving the example of real estate entrepreneurship in a country where the price of houses and incomes is unbearable for those who live with low wages is the President of the Assembly of the Republic.
José Pedro Aguiar Branco is a partner of ‘PortoCovi - Management and Administration of Goods LDA’, which has as its object the purchase and sale of movable and immovable property, lease, management and administration of own goods or other people and service provision. Confronted with public dissemination about his company, Aguiar-Branco responded to journalists complaining of "voyeurism" about political positions, where "everything is sparkling: their heritage, their situation from the financial point of view, all that has to do with a particular collection, although there is no suspicion."
And what did Aguiar-white wanted? May the journalists be "little monkeys" to silence, not listen and not see? The most important thing is that all this comes to public because the government decided to change the law of soils and in which, in the future, all these political real estate agents may enjoy large income…</description><pubDate>2025-03-02 23:46:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Couple therapy or love in the storm</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/28/a-terapia-de-casal-ou-o-amor-na-tempestade/</link><description>Now I work as a couple therapist, a dream that has long wanted to realize. My understanding is no longer based only on countless readings, but also on direct experience with the conflict of couples. I leave that these experiences resonate in my knowledge and my therapeutic practice, in the hope that they result in richer reflections in this space of writing. Today I want to tell you about love in the storm.
A love relationship presupposes an affective bond. We can discuss the many possible forms of “couple”, but I invite you to focus on the idea of ​​two people who find themselves and seek to connect through what they are in the most intimate and deep. Usually, in this kind of relationship, there is sex - the mechanism of connection par excellence, which brings us to our most primary desires. Theory suggests that we choose our partners because they fit the long history of our affective connections, starting with the most primary relationships, such as our parents. Thus, we establish romantic bonds that, while offering the possibility of emotional reparation, also feed our dysfunctions. Love does not exist without this polarity. The bond lives in the tension between finding the love of our lives and the risk of this same love becoming in our greatest enemy. This is, of course, a caricature, but I want them to be aware of this duality.
It is common for couples, when they become aware of this tension, seek therapy. Then comes an distressing question: How can the person who love to awaken me so much sadness, anger or frustration? It is the very evolution of the relationship that leads to these winding paths. Our beliefs, the way they shape our behavior and even our understanding of romantic love influence the way we deal with this ambivalence. The truth is that we have prepared little for this reality. Recently, a husband in deep anguish shared with me: “I didn't betray, nor walk behind anyone. I don't realize why we are like this. ”
In couple therapy, the goal is not to eliminate the conflict, but to understand it. The mismatch is inevitable, which is why tools are sought to better deal with it. One of the pillars of this process is to create a space where one can talk frankly about the challenges of the relationship. However, this mismatch is emotionally charged and not always easy to resolve. It is not enough to offer a new map for the couple to follow a different path. It is not even the therapist's role to give simple solutions. To reconstruct a relationship, it is necessary to face a storm - uncontrolled rainwater, wind at 100 km/h and deafening thunder. The therapist helps navigate this storm so that the couple understands that love contains in itself this disruptive possibility. Deep down, the therapist confirms that even if suffering seems atrocious and the confusing mismatch, it's okay. The mismatch is part of life.
The storm is a symptom of a primitive state, a reflex of the body in the face of the frustration of their emotional needs - they are proximity or removal. It is a state in which rational thinking is overshadowed by instinctive reaction. It can manifest itself as a struggle or escape, as if the partner were a predator, or as avoidance, an attempt to protect himself from a partner who seems to consume the little emotional energy that remains. Ultimately, the way we react to mismatch is linked to the way we deal with the affective bond.
Regardless of the therapeutic approach used, all psychotherapeutic schools converge on this essential strategy: to make these internal mechanisms obvious. From this awareness, therapy helps the couple create new emotional "dances", promoting understanding and empathy to make the mismatch less destructive.
Of course, there are couples who come to therapy at a point where the therapeutic space serves to prepare divorce or separation. In such cases, the mediation offered by the therapist allows them to maintain forms of communication based on respect. Many therapists “divorce” couples, and this is also a successful result.
The stigma associated with therapy in general is a barrier. Apart from the sporadic romantic dinner, or quality time together, which many therapists will surely prescribe, therapy aims to go to other sites. Investing in relationship is essential for love, either through therapy or honest conversations about the couple's dynamics. Because love does not simply happen, it survives between comfort, pleasure and conflict.</description><pubDate>2025-02-28 01:08:11</pubDate></item><item><title>Geogostronomy and the role of Portuguese cuisine in Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/27/a-geogastronomia-e-o-papel-da-gastronomia-portuguesa-em-macau-2/</link><description>(continuation)
Kitchen chiefs are increasingly experiencing melting dishes that incorporate international flavors, remaining faithful to Portuguese roots. The emergence of new gastronomic trends, such as “farm-to-table” and sustainable cuisine, reflects the growing awareness of the origin and quality of food. Social networks have also transformed the way culinary experiences are shared and perceived. Platforms like Instagram have made it easier for bosses to show their dishes to a global audience, attracting food enthusiasts and contributing to the promotion of macanese cuisine.
Through visually appealing presentations, bosses may involve customers and encourage the appreciation of intricate flavors of Luso-Macaense cuisine. Several academic analyzes of Macau's geogostronomic landscape reveal the complex interaction between culture and food. Scholars emphasize the concept of identity, illustrating how culinary practices reflect the cultural heritage and values ​​of the community. The mix of Portuguese and Chinese culinary traditions creates a distinct identity for Macao, reinforcing its position as a cultural cauldron.
The investigation suggests that gastronomic experiences are vital to fostering a sense of belonging among residents and promoting community ties. The culinary events and festivals that celebrate Luso-Macaense gastronomy further reinforce the community's involvement and promote a shared cultural identity, encouraging pride in local traditions and values. The role of Portuguese cuisine in Macau is ready for continuous evolution. The growing awareness of consumers for sustainability and health will probably shape culinary trends. Kitchen heads may prioritize the use of local and organic ingredients, while exploring innovative cooking techniques that honor traditional practices.
Promoting educational programs that emphasize the importance of culinary heritage can help ensure that future generations enjoy and continue the tradition of Portuguese gastronomy. By promoting connections between chefs and consumers, Macau can maintain his unique cuisine in a constantly changing global landscape. The role of Portuguese gastronomy in Macau serves as a rich example of how cultural and geographical factors intertwine to shape culinary practices. As Macau sails for contemporary influences and anticipates future developments, the essence of Portuguese cuisine continues to prosper and evolve, promising a vibrant and dynamic culinary future.
The evolution of macanese culinary culture is also influenced by the change in consumer habits and globalization. The increase in gastronomic tourism in Macao led to a greater interest in traditional dishes, as visitors eager for experiencing local flavors exploit the gastronomic landscape. Restaurants can respond by raising traditional recipes to exquisite gastronomic experiences. Events such as the “International Festival of Cities of Gastronomy, Macao” also promotes the appreciation for local cuisine, drawing attention to the skills of local bosses and the importance of culinary heritage.
In recent years, conscious effort has been assisted to preserve traditional methods, simultaneously integrating modern techniques and global influences. The introduction of elements such as molecular gastronomy begins to be a practice in various luxury restaurants in Macao, creating a new dialogue between traditional dishes and contemporary food science. Estas abordagens inovadoras desafiam a noção de autenticidade, sugerindo que a tradição não é estática, mas dinâmica. While there are purists who advocate the preservation of original revenues, others advocate a reinterpretation that reflects contemporary food and preferences.
The sustainability of Macanese cuisine in the modern context is another critical area to examine. Environmental awareness began to influence culinary practices, with an increasing emphasis on the use of local ingredients. This change improves the freshness of foods served in Macanese restaurants. Establishments are increasingly highlighting their commitment to ecological practices and can integrate in their sustainable seafood menus and organic vegetables. These practices ensure that although the kitchen remains rooted in its historical context, it continues to evolve in a sustainable way.
In addition, the intersection of global trends had an impact on Macao's traditional culinary landscape. The global fascination with the melting kitchen encouraged bosses to experience unconventional combinations. This mixture of culinary traditions can be seen in the popularity of dishes such as the Macaense-Taieman lobster curry or almond cookies influenced by Portuguese and Chinese pastry techniques. These developments reflect the evolution of the taste of both local inhabitants and tourists, reflecting a broader culinary narrative that challenges traditional concepts of what constitutes macanese food.
The future of Macanese cuisine seems promising, characterized by continuous exploration of identity, innovation and cultural exchange. As the culinary scene evolves, it is crucial that chiefs and gastronomy enthusiasts find a balance between respect for traditional methods and the adoption of new techniques. The potential for greater international recognition remains strong, particularly in the field of exquisite restoration, where macanese flavors can be presented with modern interpretations.
However, challenges persist, namely as regards the preservation of authentic culinary practices. Discussions may arise around cultural appropriation as macanese dishes gain popularity and are adapted to various culinary contexts. The challenge lies in ensuring the maintenance of the integrity of traditional dishes and, at the same time, interacting effectively with a global audience. This dialogue enhances the delicate balance between adaptation and authenticity in culinary heritage.
Macau's Portuguese cuisine represents a rich tapestry of flavors formed through centuries of cultural exchange, innovation and adaptation. The historical context provides a basis for understanding how these diverse influences intertwined, leading to a distinct culinary identity.
Influential heads have defended this kitchen, ensuring its relevance in modern gastronomy, while sustainability efforts aim to keep it linked to local traditions. The interaction between tradition and modernity, authenticity and innovation will continue to shape the future of Macanese cuisine. The enthusiasm surrounding this culinary landscape promises to attract global interest, immortalizing the flavors and narratives that define this unique gastronomic heritage.</description><pubDate>2025-02-27 02:00:39</pubDate></item><item><title>Improve the economy of Macau (i)</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/26/aperfeicoar-a-economia-de-macau-i/</link><description>After Sam Hou Fai took office as the Chief Executive of Macao, he repeatedly expressed the desire to improve the region's economy, promoting moderate sector diversification and correcting the situation that leads to the game industry to master the city's economy.
Macao has positioned itself as a leisure city, but its tourist model is changing 'traditional sightseeing' to 'immersive tourism' and there are many closed stores on the city streets. According to data from the Directorate of Statistics and Census Services, there were 42,996 industrial and commercial spaces closed in June 2020. In December 2024, this number rose to 43,343. These data show that the economy has not yet completely recovered after the pandemic and that the work of the Macao government at the level of economic development has become difficult.
To stimulate the vitality of Macao's economy and benefit more residents of the city, several people argue that tourism should focus on the community rather than forwarding visitors to tourist attractions. Thus, the sales of stores in community areas can be increased, allowing more people to have access to tourism revenues and reducing the number of closed commercial spaces. Already part of this plan is the increase in the number of check-in points on Fulong Street and the appearance of many stalls in Coloane who sell top of gamma products.
But how can we lead tourists to consume in the community? Some say that this objective can be achieved through concerts. The process would organize free transportation to take people who visit community tourist locations to the concert room.
One of the reasons why Macau can successfully host these events is the fact that Hong Kong concert halls are always full. Macau can take the opportunity and provide alternative places. The concerts attract crowds so they are a great way to bring many tourists to Macau.
Currently, some travel platforms, in collaboration with concert organizers, sell tickets, in packages that include stay at the hotel, meals, transportation and other items. The package is cheaper than if purchases were made individually. This model reduces the cost of travel to Macau and can increase tourists the desire to consume in the city. If the project is enriched with tourist bus services to allow visitors to access directly to tourist sites in the community areas, naturally the possibility of consuming local commerce will increase and this will be a way to stimulate Macao's economy.
To achieve this goal, first it is necessary to ensure the success of the concert. Organizers have to sign a contract with the artists. But if there is more than an artist acting, you need to be very careful. The case that occurred with Messi, which was supposed to have played in Hong Kong, but ended up not playing, made the Raehk government have noticed that besides making a contract with a team, if they do not make individual contracts with all participants, the coming of some of them can be endangered.
Messi's episode inspired Macau. When a concert is organized, in order to make sure that the fears that call more public will be present, it is necessary to sign separate contracts to ensure the presence of them all. Without this provisions, there is a possibility that some of these stars fail the concert.
After ensuring the presence of the star, the next step is the transportation organization for viewers. Should this bus be a traditional tourist bus? Due to the current tendency of immersive travels, tourists apparently prefer normal buses to experience the city's daily life. Perhaps the society of Macao may have this innovative idea, that is, to use the macao public transport buses to perform this tourist service. These vehicles would take visitors to community tourist sites and could transport local tourists and residents. In this way, tourists would not only have the feeling of traveling in a vulgar bus, but the number of tourists who expect in transportation and congested local buses would also be reduced. And this should be taken into account because tourists carry luggage that takes up a lot of space. Tour buses would only travel between concert sites and community tourist areas. The number of passengers would be relatively low and each would have enough space, which increases comfort. The decision that these trips are paid or free must fit the carrier company.
What will be the next step after guaranteeing concerts and tourist buses? Will tourists consume in community areas? We will give the answer next week.

Also the resident unemployment rate set a record in 2.1 percent
 
In the period between November and January, the unemployment rate went down to 1.6 percent, the lowest amount since DSEC began collecting data on unemployment in Macao in 1992, even before the transition from territory administration from Portugal to China.
According to the Directorate of Statistics and Census Services (DSEC), after seven months in a row to round 1.7 percent, the indicator fell 0.1 percentage points compared to the previous period, between October and December.
In a statement, the DSEC explained that the rate reduction is due to “mainly the Chinese New Year originating the reduction in the number of individuals looking for employment, which led to a decrease in the number of unemployed”.
The casinos sector hired 900 more people between November and January, reaching a labor of 72,500, while the Grosso and Retail trade also hired 200 more people. Macao received in January nearly 3.65 million visitors, 27.4 percent than in the same month of 2024 and the second highest value ever, while the game's revenues fell 5.6 percent in annual terms.
Reinforcements from abroad

We invest in our business to improve customer experience and build a more solid growth base, ”Lawrence Ho said in a statement. “The contributions of these initiatives are now evident, with the market share in the fourth quarter of 2024 to grow month by month and the visitation of properties to exceed the pre-parish levels. We are committed to continuing to fulfill our strategic objectives and we hope to continue to reveal new and exciting projects to support continuous growth in Macao, ”he added.
Casinos in the region closed 2024 with revenues of 226.8 billion patacas, more 23.9 percent than in 2023.</description><pubDate>2025-03-03 00:11:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Game | Revenues go up in February, after falling in January</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/03/jogo-receitas-sobem-em-fevereiro-apos-queda-de-janeiro/</link><description>Despite the most positive numbers, with February revenues reaching 19.7 billion Patacas, the total revenues of January and February fell short of the expected by analysts
 
The game's recipes increased 6.8 percent in February, compared to the same month of 2024, rising after a homologous fall in January, was announced on Saturday. The casinos collected more than 19.7 billion patacas in February, according to data from the Game Inspection and Coordination Directorate (DICJ). A value that exceeded the expectations of analysts.
In a statement released on Wednesday, the company Creditsights, which is part of the Fitch Financial notation Agency group, said it was not certain an increase in the revenue of territory casinos in February.
In January, Macao casinos had raised less than 18.3 billion patacas, a 5.6 percent drop compared to the same period as 2024. But with the recovery in February, the game sector ended up ensuring the best start of the year since 2019 before the COVID - 19 pandemic.
In the first two months of the year, Macao casinos registered total revenues of nearly 38 billion patacas, more 0.5 percent than in the same period of 2024. This amount represents 75.5 percent of the accumulated in the first two months of 2019.
Scratch
Still, the start of the year fell short of the expectations of analysts of the company JP Morgan Securities, who on January 20 predicted that the recipes of the game in Macao would rise up to 2 percent annually in January and February.
February included much of the so -called Golden Week of the Lunar New Year, a high time for tourism in Macao. This period of holidays in mainland China, which varies depending on the lunar calendar, took place this year between January 28 and February 4.
On January 17, the director of Macao Tourism Services, Maria Helena de Senna Fernandes, said she expected a daily average of 185,000 visitors during the 'Golden Week'. But, according to data from the Macao Public Security Police, between January 28 and February 4, they entered the Chinese semi -autonomous region, on average, more than 163,700 tourists per day.
In total, nearly 1.31 million people visited Macau during the Lunar New Year's 'Gold Week', less 3.5 percent than in the same period of holidays last year. Macao closed 2024 with total game recipes of 226.8 billion patacas, 23.9 percent than in 2023, but only 73.2 percent of the registered in 2019, before the Covid-19 pandemic.</description><pubDate>2025-03-03 00:09:44</pubDate></item><item><title>Hotels | 1,25 million guests received in January</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/28/hoteis-recebidos-125-milhoes-de-hospedes-em-janeiro/</link><description>Macao hotels received more than 1.25 million guests in January, a 4.7 percent drop in annual terms, was announced yesterday. In January 2024, hotel establishments in the territory had set a new record by hosting more than 1.32 million guests, the highest number of the year.
The fall in January this year is “to reduce the number of guests in 5-star hotels”, according to a statement released yesterday by the Directorate of Statistics and Census Services (DSEC).

A renovated Ukrainian, with the same name of the president, guilty Zelensky about the extension of the conflict that destroyed his village. Zelensky, the village, who has never left his land, now lives mortified because his favorite gravedigger died in the bomber.
This Zelensky, the village, represents half the world that reproves the other Zelensky, the villain, for not wanting to negotiate with Putin.
Negotiate what? The invader enters us through the house, pies us his wife and daughter (cf. Recent UN report on Ukraine violations in this “special operation”), an act that forced us to watch, and then we say: High there, we are for peace, but we have to negotiate: You have not said the name you want to give to children!
A peace that is not worthy is but a cessation of rights. As severe as Russophobia that Putin inflicts his people.

In a lunch with several guests I hear a friend, who declares himself a spiritist, explaining about the particularities of his belief, in a serene and balanced way, would even say, without "irrationalism". He discussed long and serenely, devoid of any fanatical proselytizing. “Here is someone to whom belief brought weighting!” I thought, a rare alliance.
However, at one point a phrase that horrify me. He says, “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!” And I enter the voracious fauces of holism. Because holismo has a pathological aspect like all good things, a side of shadow.
Two examples: In Hinduism there is less sensitivity to existential dramas, if that child suffers in this life this is only an expression of the strict karmic symmetry, an effect of the acts she committed in her previous life. In Africa it is not accepted that death may have been accidental, and many women are accused by the dead family of having caused her husband's death, in an act of manifest dementia, and, in the blatant majority of cases, in a huge injustice to his wife - madness that spreads and infiltrates the social fabric.
Buddhism introduced compassion and Christianity to Caritas, trying to break with this logic, but in many other beliefs and religions the cage of causalities prevails about sensitivity to experience, the need to respond to the now.
It is a tremendous logic that transforms the world into a platonic stage, where we are just the shadows of something -an inextricable law -in a determinism that calcines all singularities, but strangely fascinates many.
The conquest of modernity has anchored in the conquest of chance and random, subtracting the incidences of a life to this fierce determinism that closed the world in a web. When the Renaissance freed the body from the influence of the stars, at this moment sexuality was relieved of guilt and individualism and their volition could emerge.
There is an unequivocal moral implication in the phrase “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!”, Which should work as a key to self-knowledge and self-judgment, but usually this phrase is managed to seek a reason for things abroad from us in the other. It is an alibi.
There is a holistic temptation in the world today, as in the Middle Ages there was a satanic temptation, without great reflection on its consequences. Because it is not enough we want to connect everything in a resonant chain of affection. Even the most unexpected: affection itself can kill.
I realize, thanks to this cultured, balanced, intelligent woman, that “the combat” moved at the beginning of this century. One of the great misconceptions of the twentieth century was the false dichotomy between "rationalism and irrationalism", a debate that extended to all fields, including art. First, rationality was confused (the positive side of reason) with rationalism (the pathological feature of reason), and articulated in this lack of discernment was confused irrationalism with freedom. Almost all the art of the twentieth century, with surrealism to the head, worked in this error. The fallacy still exists despite having consolidated the emergence of 'irrationalism' and the consequent relativist currents that followed it. Essentially much of what happened in the twentieth century, it turned around this shock between two paradigms: rationalism versus irrationalism.
Now, I see, the indetermination, chance, the random of the terrible temptation of the causal cage. Holism, in its pathological feature, can be the reductionism that puts itself the way as a new 'eschatological narrative'.
Is it "by chance" that the holism emerges at the moment when neo-liberalism and its cynical contempt for the human person besides all freedoms, all acquired rights?
Holistic consciousness has brought positively a greater ecological awareness but followed with scholastic rigor stifles reality under the blanket of a determinism that is much more than inconvenience: all great authoritarian ideologies are holistic.
My friend will know how to combine her holistic and transpersonal belief with the freedom and responsibility that every moment asks us - but how many will make the destruction, under a law that explains and encompasses?
How many will not be abandoned to what it is?
The awareness of the indeterminate brings tragic conscience, as the Greeks knew, but also brings the will and the courage of the decision. And of this we cannot abdicate.
In addition, as Drummond shows in Carlos Drummond de Andrade's poem “Quadrilha”:
"John loved Teresa who loved Raimundo/ who loved Maria who loved Joaquim who loved Lili/ who did not love anyone./ John went to the United States, Teresa to the convent,/ Raimundo died of disaster, Maria stayed to aunt,/ Joaquim committed himself and Lili married J. Pinto Fernandes/ who had not entered the story."
Real always runs outside the track, in full exteriority to our concepts. This is what is worth a J. Pinto Fernandes at the exact moment we thought we had everything under control.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Nobel and others</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/17/do-nobel-e-outros/</link><description>9/10/22
Reading many people's reactions when the Nobel Prize in this year's literature was announced, I couldn't help but remind me of this repair of Jean-Pierre Siméon, in relation to another Nobel Prize: “An editor of a large national newspaper wrote five lines of indignation because the Nobel Prize for Literature, a complete stranger. But unknown to whom? How did not occur to this patented and paid literary columnist to do his work, that his apparent ignorance was a matter of incorrect professional conduct? Tranströmer was translated into many languages, it was available in French. »
There is always the choir of those waiting for the announcement of the prize to complain about not being invited to the jury of it, there is a subgroup of Irados that professes “I never read and I will not bother to read”; It is an uncommon fauna, which inhabits social networks.
I don't always know all the winners-I was unaware of the existence of Louise Glück, who I find a great poet, or the Olga Tokarczuk, for example-but it only brings me the comfort of knowing that the world is not a soap opera where everyone knows each other and the joy of recognizing that the gauge of the world is not measured with my short measure and that on the contrary it gives me a new opportunity to face the unknown.
And perhaps the most cretin of reactions was the smart one who wrote, but there are still those who read French? Confirming only that today there is a new kind of ignorance that fires with a displeasure: the one who only read English.
I would also prefer that, in French, Pascal Quignard, Linda reads, or even Sollers, or, among the new ones, Mathias is awarded, but that does not take dignity to the work of Annie Ernaux (and it would be enough to have written the “Les Années”). There are books that I like less, like the vulgar "a simple passion," but this happens with almost every authors, they have a channel books and others that are like intervals in their itinerary. I advise reading a beautiful book of interviews with her, "L'Ecriture Comme un couteau".

Yesterday came an article in Maputo's morning “News”, realizing that the Pen Club narrative prize was assigned to my wife, Teresa Noronha, for her soap opera “Tornado”, which had already had the Maria Velho da Costa award.
The summary they made of the book does not even deserve comments, by pathetic, but what matters to highlight is the note of disqualification about their "Mozambicanity" by calling it Luso-Mozambican. It is not inaccurate, but for those who know the context, it is a dirty touch.
Because finally, following the same logic, Adelino Timothy should be called Tsonga-Mozambican, to Álvaro Taruma Ronga-Mozambican, and Macua-Mozambican to writers who are from the north, etc., etc. Which is not reported to happen.
At the beyond moment, in the soap opera, she writes:
«Our color has never been dominant. In colonial time we were not white, we were ripped from monories, gone mugs, the pejorative term to speak of a son of Goes and Portuguese. In the postcolonial period, I was not black and if, in Lisbon, they took me by Brazilian or Cape Verdean, already in France were lost in cogitations of where they would be and amazed when they found out it was African. There I had to explain my DNA's wanderings before relying on moorms. It took me a long time to accept that it was so because yes, and that it was no curse that were so; On the contrary, I could even discover intense patterns of fantasy and freedom in this shrewd cloak that is our genealogy… »
In the current Mozambique it is white… and this is overlapping it soon to what it does or what it is.
It is sad, but as Naipaul warned, through these stops the race is everything and is soaked in it as deeply as, elsewhere, in religion.

Bruno Latour, an anthropologist who studied the sciences and their procedures and legitimations, law, technique and religions died and entertained themselves to turn the guts to the dogmas of the “modern”. For him the place, the expert's function, was more defined by the perplexity he embodied than for the supposed truth he would support him.
He proposed, as an alternative to the kinds of multiculturalism and his mistaken password "all different all the same", the return to "diplomacy", given precisely, not from the presupposition that "we are unified because participants of the same nature" but simply reveal that we "do not yet share an ordinary world"; It is necessary to deal frontally with the "abyss of disagreement" that separates us, rather than wanting to delude it.
And about politics said, disassessedly:
«If transparency is required from the politician, we kill him; If one requires fidelity to what the other was or he says, kills him; If a mimetic relationship is required between what the crowd wants and what its representative says, the representation is killed. These must, therefore, by definition, betray, deceive, modify, distort the word. Without this ability to double the word and betray, political language would not exist. I put the perfectly plausible hypothesis that political vocabulary will become as inaccessible as the religious language of the last twenty, three or fifty years. (in “UN Monde Pluriel plus Commun”). I believe it will be missed to decipher this frantically complex world that fit us.</description><pubDate>2022-10-17 02:18:03</pubDate></item><item><title>The yo -yo</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/30/o-fuxi/</link><description>O my friends, companions of these funerals trips to countries as old as the stars and the moon, and as strange as the profound interior of our disgraceful souls, - that startle still awaits us, what secret spells we will have to overcome, what horrors will rise to our dilated pupils of amazement and terror?
Increasingly close to our precarious existences, howling the war monster, which threatens to merge humanity with the earth, incessantly traveled by the squalid spectrum of hunger and the invisible evil of ten thousand pests.
O human human, who cries superior to his own nature, but then reveals to you, once and again, unable to simply order your existence and do not understand that you are possessed by the fickle wrath and are slave to your own ambition! Do not be content with the white jade or the light gold, there is no treasure that gives you your inextinguishable thirst for other men, animals and things; for in you an eternal anguish in you; in you crawl the expelled snakes; For you grows, powerful and impossible, the very fertile ivy of evil!
This is perhaps why on the mound they call the white deer, where one of the eight immortals in sacred mount was evolved through the skies to Penglai, inhabits the fuxa, a bird whose form resembles that of the rooster, although topped by a human head. What strange copulas, what monstrous amplexes, what terrible procedures will have occurred to make the existence of this animal sinister possible? We do not know, but it is enough for our exhausted mind to dare to raise an answer, so we soon feel the skin traveled by horrendous goose bumps and the heart trigger in paraded, which wild horse beaten by the night whip of fear, oblivious to reins and containment.
May men refrain from going through the Mount of the deer, because although there are riches capable of calming the most misunderstanding ambitions, if they have the disgraced fortunate to glimpse a fuxa, it will be immediately triggered the cultivated fields, because it will be beheaded the soft animals, for it will be sacrificed the best young man and destroyed superb from countries.
Fuxi emits a sound that resembles its name. If you hear it, dark night or clear day, goose way, for the path where you find you is the most right of the ways for misfortune!</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Procrastinators Club</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/29/clube-dos-procrastinadores/</link><description>Walking in rereading of Easter, because of an article I prepare, I give this excerpt, extracted from “the universal man”:
«Every man morally is one and absolute; But you have to live with your personality to mitigate. (…) Coexistence is only possible among people reduced to a negative or hollow presence, which is constantly giving in. Hence, the emptiness of society, a huge ghost composed of numerous deceased. An upper man is antisocial or criminal. Its destination is jail and desert.
He is in thinking about whether she reflects here about the political-social conditioning that gagging, and worse, in a sad country as Portugal was in the middle of the Estado Novo (and the book is from 1931) where any possibilities of spontaneity and frankness in human relations were coarcet, or only lends the behavior of men (oppressed) a metaphysical frame, a “essence”, from a presumption of each one in the presumption of each one be in isolation “one and absolute”. Sometimes, to an excess of spirituality (or longing), it adds to Pascoaes to lack the world. He is a great poet, but he is a poet who takes gray-Jewish ampoules and is therefore written amiiude on a programmatic furor, ceasing to have pores; There is often a glass between him and the real, the same one who made him wring the Ballet, 1921: “Everything is ghost. There are only clouds, clouds of voices, clouds of souls, afflictions and tragedies! Clouds and more clouds, appearances and more appearances! It is a divine lightning that pierces them, the instant appearance that arises and throws us to the ground, dazzled! »
Sometimes I would like to remind him, as António Sérgio did in the article “Regeneration and Tradition, Moral and Economy”, which dedicated to Easter: “Easter, Easter My Dear Friend: You are a pure, excellent, and very noble poet, but also a victim of this social environment, like us all: of this horrible isolation that you praise and I”.
"As a child, he stole two melos," says Jacinto do Prado Coelho, stole him from a nest, and throb his life for his life for it. The person, few more mischief is known to him. Only in Álvaro de Campos sprouts a twinge of evil and obscenity: “Oh, and ordinary and dirty people who always seem the same,/ who employs profanity as usual words,/ whose children steal at the grocery door/ and whose daughters at eight years-and I think this is beautiful and I love him! -/ masturbate decent -looking men on the stairs. » (Ode triumphal).
Both poets beaten by a certain idea of ​​holiness, they were identical to the inability of breaking the siege of the skin with the overflow of the dike, the same curse of sublimating Eros's concrete ferocity with the mansuity of the verses.
Of course, they are the two "Bigger Than Life", but sometimes unnerves to watch, from my hostor's post at the Procrastinators Club, to the tantrums between them, just to see who occupies, in the internal organization, the place of president and treasurer.
Although a person has guessed more, for example, this he wrote in the least known martial ode and that is declining in the situation we live today, differently, with the heart in his hands:

"China regrets and opposes this decision and will do everything it deems necessary to defend its legitimate interests," the Ministry of Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian told a press conference.
Lin said unilateral rates impair both the World Trade Organization and international trade relations and insisted that "there are no winners in commercial wars."
Considering the fentanil “an internal problem of the United States,” Chinese diplomacy spokesman said Washington is using his opioid crisis to “press and coerce” China, although the Asian country is “one of the hardest” in the fight against the drug. The diplomat also stressed that Beijing has supported the US in his response to the Fentanil problem, transnational cooperation with results he described as "very remarkable."
The diplomat urged Washington to address the problems "through dialogue and on an equality" and reiterated that China is willing to continue to cooperate with the US to achieve a "solid, stable and healthy" relationship.
The conviction of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs follows to that of the Ministry of Commerce, which stated hours before China will take "all necessary countermeasures" to "defend its rights and legitimate interests."
United States President Donald Trump promised on Thursday that his country would impose an additional 10 percent rate on China to join the other rate at the same value previously announced, with the argument that the Asian country made enough efforts to combat Fentanil entry in the US.</description><pubDate>2025-03-03 00:05:55</pubDate></item><item><title>AVIC | Largest amphibian plane in the world concludes flight certification tests</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/03/avic-maior-aviao-anfibio-do-mundo-conclui-testes-de-certificacao-de-voo/</link><description>The world's largest amphibious aircraft, the Ag600, completed all the flight tests needed to obtain aircraft certification, aviation industry corporation of China (AVIC).
The Ag600, also the first large amphibian plane built in China, measures 39.6 meters long and 38.8 meters of wingspan, a size similar to that of a Boeing 737, and has a maximum weight of 53.5 tons. An amphibious plane is a model capable of peeling and landing on land and water.
The plane, which was designed mainly for maritime rescue and fire -fighting missions, completed the latest flight tests in Shaanxi province in northwest China, Avic said, one of the country's state aircraft manufacturers in a statement.
Over the past two years, the AG600 has completed 3,560 hours of flight in preparation for aircraft certification, the Chinese state consortium added. Flight tests were performed in a wide range of scenarios, including extreme cold, high temperatures and moisture and strong winds to verify the operational capabilities of the aircraft.
The Ag600 is the largest amphibian aircraft currently in operation, comparable to scale to narrow fuselage aircraft such as Boeing 737 or Airbus A320.

The government led by Donald Trump confirmed this week that it will eliminate more than 90 percent of US Agency for International Development Agency (USAID) and $ 60 billion in general assistance around the world.
In Africa, the cuts should have a particularly serious impact on health, which occupies the largest share of US support to the continent. Similar to what happened during the COVID-19 pandemic, experts expect China to fill the void left by Washington again.
“Among African leaders, China has already built significant influence. Now it has the opportunity to seduce public opinion, ”explained Paul Natulya, a researcher at the African Center for Strategic Studies, a US Department of Defense Institute and funded by the US Congress.
The US provides more than a quarter of all development aid on the African continent. An analysis performed by Denver's International Futures concluded that cuts can shoot another 5.7 million Africans below the $ 2.15 extreme poverty per day next year.
During Trump's first term, which coincided with the Covid-19 pandemic, Africa became the region that most benefited from Chinese vaccine donations, testing, masks or fans, while Washington diminished his contributions and withdrew from the World Health Organization.
"When the West retained donations of vaccines and medical equipment, China quickly filled the void," Natulya recalled. "In return, they received a lot of publicity and prestige, for a relatively small investment," he noted.
Ranking in the ranking
Different surveys now show that China has surpassed the United States in the popularity rate among African public opinion.
According to an international poll from the Gallup Association, Beijing's approval among Africans went from 52 percent in 2022 to 58 percent in 2023, while Washington's popularity fell from 59 percent to 56 percent in the same period. Inquiries conducted by other institutes, such as Afrobarometer and Ichikowitz Family Foundation, demonstrate the same trend.
"China is using all the tools at its disposal to gain this competitive advantage in the face of the United States," the researcher described. "At this time, I bet that, in Beijing, employees are studying the next step and when and how to increase China's contribution," he said.</description><pubDate>2025-03-03 00:01:26</pubDate></item><item><title>Diplomacy | Xi says Beijing and Moscow should reinforce international coordination</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/02/diplomacia-xi-diz-que-pequim-e-moscovo-devem-reforcar-a-coordenacao-internacional/</link><description>The Chinese president reaffirms the union between the two neighbors in the face of changes in the international scenario
 
Chinese leader Xi Jinping said China and Russia should continue to reinforce coordination in international matters and that both countries are “true friends,” Chinese state press has advanced on Saturday.
Xi spoke at a meeting with Russian Security Council Secretary Sergei Shoigu, in Beijing, on Friday. Chinese head of state said Beijing and Moscow will implement in 2025 "a series of important agendas" and also requested the maintenance of "close communication at all levels."
Xi recalled that he spoke twice this year with Russian homologist Vladimir Putin, the last of which this week. The Chinese leader also appealed to the maximization of the role of the BRICS Emerging Economies Group and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, two blocks of which China and Russia are members.
Shoigu said Russia “greatly appreciates China's continuous efforts to promote peaceful resolution for the Ukrainian crisis,” but Chinese press did not indicate whether Xi made any mention of the peace process in Ukraine.
The statements were published hours after a verbal confrontation in the White House between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and US homologist Donald Trump.
According to the Xinhua official news agency, the Russian envoy said that the alliance between China and Russia "plays a significant role in the world and is a model for power relations." Shoigu also said that the relationship between the two countries "does not aim for third parties."
Reinforced ties
Before meeting Xi, Shoigu maintained talks with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, said the Russian Official Agency Tass. “Russia and China have coherent approaches to major international and regional problems,” said Shoigu, according to a video posted by Tass.
Shoigu said he moved to Beijing “at the request of Russian President Vladimir Putin, following his telephone conversation with Chinese President Xi Jinping” without further details. "The fact that we have managed to organize our meeting within such a short term demonstrates the special nature of bilateral dialogue," said Sergei.
The visit of the former Russian Defense Minister comes after a conversation between Xi and Putin on Monday during which the Chinese leader praised Moscow's "positive efforts to disagree" the Ukrainian crisis.
Moscow and Beijing have reinforced military and commercial ties since the beginning of the Russian offensive in Ukraine, although China seeks to present itself as a neutral in the three-year conflict. According to the Russian press, Shoigu "will discuss bilateral security issues, as well as international and regional problems, with high Chinese leaders."</description><pubDate>2025-03-02 23:58:25</pubDate></item><item><title>Hong Kong | Secretary for Innovation looking for business in Portugal</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/02/hong-kong-secretario-para-a-inovacao-procura-negocios-em-portugal/</link><description>Hong Kong's secretary for innovation, technology and industry will be on Thursday in Portugal to “explore business opportunities” for the innovation and technology sector, the Chinese region said yesterday.

The delegation includes managers from three public institutions: HKSTP, a company created in 2001 to promote innovation and technological development in the region, the Institute of Research in Science and Technology Applied and the Institute of Research and Development of Microelectronics.
In addition, they will be in Lisbon leaders of the Cyberport Technology Park, as well as representatives of 24 companies or Hong Kong innovation and technology institutions.
Before passing through Lisbon, the Hong Kong delegation will be in Barcelona, ​​in northeastern Spain, to participate in Mobile World Congress, considered one of the most influential technological events worldwide.
This will be the second visit to Portugal of a member of the Hong Kong government within a year, after the secretary for the region's financial and treasure services had passed through Lisbon in June. At the time, Christopher Hui Ching-Yu asked Portugal to remove Hong Kong from the list of tax havens and argued that it already fulfills European Union (EU) standards to combat fiscal dropout.</description><pubDate>2025-03-02 23:43:16</pubDate></item><item><title>Japan | Worst fires since 1992 have been forced by two thousand people</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/02/japao-piores-incendios-desde-1992-forcam-retirada-de-duas-mil-pessoas/</link><description>About two thousand people had to abandon their dwellings in northern Japan, where forest fires have already burned the largest area since 1992 and did a dead, the Japanese authorities said yesterday.
The Japanese disasters and fires response agency (FDMA) said the areas around the city of Ounato were evacuated in the Iwate Forest Region. Many took refuge with friends or family, and more than 1,200 were taken to shelters, added FDMA.
At least one person died in the flames, which triggered on Wednesday, and also damaged over 80 buildings. "We are still trying to determine the affected area, but it is the largest since 1992," a FDMA spokesman said yesterday to the France-Presse news agency. In 1992, a fire destroyed 1,030 hectares in Kushiro, Hokkaido, in the north of the country.
According to the Japanese press, the fire has already spread to 1,800 hectares. Aerial images of the Japanese public broadcaster NHK showed military helicopters to fly over white tobacco clouds, four days after the beginning of the fire.
About 1,700 firefighters were mobilized across the country to try to extinguish the flames. The cause of the fire is not yet known, but it is believed to have started in a work shed and spread from there to a wooded zone, where dry meteorological conditions favored its propagation.
This is the third fire in a week to affect the southern coastal areas of Iwate, which have been on alert for dry weather since February 18.</description><pubDate>2025-03-02 23:40:06</pubDate></item><item><title>Deepseek | Nvidia leaves compliments and is attentive to Trump's rates</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/28/deepseek-nvidia-deixa-elogios-e-esta-atenta-as-taxas-de-trump/</link><description>The American semiconductor manufacturer Nvidia praised the work of the Chinese DeepSek Artificial Intelligence Company (IA) and recognized uncertainty in the face of US commercial policy during a conversation with analysts and investors.
Following the presentation of the results for the last quarter of his fiscal year, Nvidia's executive president Jensen Huang highlighted the demand for the state-of-the-art chip 'Blackwell and spoke positively about Deepseek, although his appearance was seen as a threat to the leadership of the US company and caused a strong drop in his actions in late January.
“Openai O3 or DeepSeek R1 are reasoning models that apply inference. Reasoning models can consume 100 times more computing. And those of the future, especially, ”said Huang.
“Deepseek R1 caused global enthusiasm. It is an excellent innovation but, better yet, has placed a world -class reasoning model in open source. Almost all AI creators are applying the R1 or similar techniques "to climb the results of their models," he added.
Asked about his business predictions, given the possibility of US President Donald Trump, imposing more customs duties on his partners' goods, the company's financial director, Colette Kress, admitted an environment of "uncertainty."
“Regarding rates, it's unknown. It is unknown until we better realize the plan of the US government or its calendar. We are waiting, ”he said.
According to Huang, Nvidia, which plans to increase the production of the Blackwell chip next quarter due to "extraordinary demand", is "at the center of all this development," referring to the new AI vacancy called "Agentic", which involves a more autonomous thought.</description><pubDate>2025-02-28 01:11:11</pubDate></item><item><title>Japan | Births fall to a new negative record</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/28/japao-nascimentos-caiem-para-novo-recorde-negativo/</link><description>The number of births in Japan fell to a new record, increasing the challenge related to increasing social security costs in an aging society, with an increasingly reduced group of workers who pay taxes.
The number of newborns in 2024 fell 5 percent over the previous year to 720,988, extending a number of nine years of decline, according to preliminary data on the population released yesterday by the Japan Ministry of Health.
This reading marks the lowest value since these records started in 1899. Also the deaths increased by 1.8 percent to a record of 1.62 million in the same period, resulting in the largest annual decline as always of the total population, according to the report.
The sustained decline of births in the country increases the urgency felt by a government that is already supporting the heaviest debt among developed countries. Japan's public debt will be 232.7 percent of the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) this year, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
The demographic situation in Japan is in tune with a growing global trend. South Korea's fertility rate increased last year for the first time in nine years, but with 0.75, it is still far below the rate required to maintain the population.
The fall in birth in France accelerated in 2023, reaching the fastest rhythm in half a century, while China's population decreased for three consecutive years.
Fewer workers means fewer tax revenues for niponic state coffers, while pressuring companies, which face staff scarcity.
Vain efforts
Since Japan's active age population has reached their maximum in 1995, their labor market has been relatively tight. The unemployment rate is 2.4 percent, the lowest among OECD countries, and has been maintained below 3 percent for almost four years. By 2040, Japan is expected to face a labor deficit of 11 million people, according to an estimated Recruit Works Institute, quoted by Bloomberg.
In 2024, a record number of 342 Japanese companies went bankrupt due to labor shortages, according to a teikoku Databank inquiry, according to the news agency. However, Japan's social security costs continue to increase as a growing proportion of the population exceeds the age of reform.
For the fiscal year that begins in April, the government has attributed 37.7 billion of yen to social security, an increase of almost 20 percent over the last decade. Japan's pension system is also under pressure, with fewer contributors and more beneficiaries. Over the past two decades, the number of taxpayers has decreased by about 3 million, while the number of beneficiaries has increased by almost 40 percent, according to the Japanese Ministry of Social Security.
The continuous decline in the number of births reflects, in part, the reluctance of younger generations to have children despite recent government efforts.
Based on an initiative of his predecessor, Prime Minister Shigero Ishiba is promoting a package of child care policies worth 3.6 billion yen, which includes support for future parents and improvements in the working conditions of day care workers.</description><pubDate>2025-02-28 01:10:12</pubDate></item><item><title>Xiaomi | Appreciation of actions make founder in the richest man in China</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/28/xiaomi-valorizacao-das-accoes-tornam-fundador-no-homem-mais-rico-da-china/</link><description>The 5.8 percent rise in the quotation of Chinese Xiaomi actions on Wednesday made the technology founder and executive director, Jun Law, in China's richest man, local press reported.

At the head of the orchestra two decades ago, the official reveals to HM details about the next concerts, including a passage in Portugal and the “24th Concert of the New Generation 2025 Musicians”, scheduled for this Sunday at the Cultural Center of Macau
 
Image: António Sanmfaurn_MacauNews
Let's start by talking about the show at the Great Auditorium of the Macao Cultural Center (CCM) this Sunday. It is a great opportunity to reveal your project to the public.
Yes. In fact, the orchestra has existed since 1997, almost 28 years ago. Throughout this time we held about 100 concerts, in what we call Macao signature shows. The new generation of local musicians is indeed quite enthusiastic about the show we will have next Sunday.
Conducting concerts and participation in festivals is the most visible part of your project. But how many musicians are they currently on the orchestra? To what extent is the orchestra important for young people who want to be musicians?
We are indeed the only youth orchestra in Macao that provides specific training in this musical genre. At this stage, young musicians may have the opportunity to show their talent. We really try to build a new generation of musicians. This type of show encourages them to learn and go out more, studying music over the years, so it's really very important to them. In Sunday's show, musicians will have the opportunity to play in orchestra, and this year we organized two auditions to choose the soloists. I am happy to have a total of 33 groups of young people who participated in these auditions this year, where nine soloists were chosen.
He is the director of the only youth orchestra in Macau. How do you describe the panorama of musical formation of younger people? Where do you need to improve?
Yes of course. I started playing from the Macao orchestra from an early age, I'm a violinist. I can tell you that, at the level of training, most teachers are from Hong Kong or Guangzhou, that every week moving to Macau to train our young people. Macau is well known as the city of the game, but it is also a cultural space. You can feel the heritage that exists in Macau, thanks in part to the previous Portuguese administration, and we have to thank the maintenance of this Portuguese culture and a whole western culture mixed with the eastern. Macau is special for that. I think we have to promote this culture and know how to develop it. In the case of classical music, we started to have an orchestra in 1983, still during the government of the Portuguese administration, and there we also organized a series of competitions for the younger ones. The Macao International Music Festival also began to be organized several decades ago, as well as the Macao Arts Festival. Today, Macau has more initiatives of this genre and this is good for enriching our culture, especially the classical music that is made in the territory.
In addition to the Sunday show, what is on the Macao Youth Orchestra Agenda for this year?
I can tell you that we will participate in this year's edition of the Mafra Music Festival “Filipe de Sousa”, scheduled for July. I will visit Mafra and all the places where we will act, have meetings and organize myself with production. It will not be the first time we are, as a group, in Portugal, but I think that for most young musicians will be the first time. Our orchestra has played twice in Portugal, the first time was in 2010.
Do you understand that the Macao government should give more support for classical music training?
I always think that the government should give more support to classical music studies. For this it is not enough to spend money on the organization of festivals, it takes a greater focus on music education. We also have to teach the population how to appreciate classical music, listening to it and consuming it so that they can know what they hear and go to concerts. Macao is a small territory with about 600,000 inhabitants, and has a lot of money because of the game. We have to use this money to build a Macao culture, which includes classical music. We must create a city that shows its culture, so I always encourage the government to support musical formation. Not just for professional orchestras, but for youth orchestras and music associations.
Macao also lacks higher education courses in the music area, having only the Conservatory. Is this also a gap?
It's right. There are several universities in Macao, but there is, in fact, a lack of formative offer in the area of ​​music. The conservatory does not offer this formation at higher level. At this time, students who want to study music professionally have to leave Macau and go to Europe, the United States of America, Hong Kong or even China. But, on the other hand, the population of Macau is very small and maintaining a conservatory with another type of formative offer would cost a lot of money. I think the best you can do is the government financially supporting these excellent students to be accepted in courses outside Macao.
The young stars that will take the stage of the Cultural Center of Macau
Organized by the Macao Youth Symphonic Orchestra Association, Sunday's show starts at 7:45 pm and has as its motto “Progressing Towards The Future” [progressing towards the future]. The show will be directed by Italian conductor Lorenzo Antonio Iosco, who is also clarinetist and has been working with the Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra. Before moving to Asia in 2015, he studied clarinet at the Luigi Cherubini Conservatory in Florence and played in Spain and London.
With regard to the young Macao musicians who take the stage on Sunday, highlighting Zita Ho Nok Chon, born in the territory in 2009, and member of the orchestra since 2021. The young woman attend Pui Ching high school, studies violin and has participated in several contests with distinction. It has played in the orchestra as the first and second violinist.
In the harp stands out Eugenia Wong Hei U, born in 2011 and a student at the Anglican College of Macao. He began playing this instrument with only four years, starting his training at the Conservatory School of Music, which earned his first award when he was only five years old. It currently has classes with Ann Huang, the main harpist at Sinfonietta from Hong Kong.
To HM Eugenia Wong hei u confessed that he feels very pleased by the opportunity provided by the CCM concert. “It has been a great honor to be part of this orchestra, where I met many talented partners and earn a great musical knowledge.”
Another name of Macao on the young orchestra is Brian Mui On Ian, violinist, who also attends Pui Ching Secondary School. In addition to the violin, he began studying piano in 2018. The young man was one of the soloists of last year's edition of the Macao Youth Symphonic Orchestra, the “23rd Macau Music New Generation Musicians Concert 2024”, where he played the composition “Bruch Double Concerto In and Minor”.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Cristina Ferreira, jurist and professor at the University of Macau: “The Fatf was in the right place and moment”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/27/cristina-ferreira-jurista-e-docente-da-universidade-de-macau-o-faft-estava-no-lugar-e-momento-certos/</link><description>Cristina Ferreira, an expert in international law, investigated the legal status of the “International Financial Action Group”, which fights money laundering and terrorism financing. In the book “The Legal Status of the Financial Action Task Force in the International Legal System”, the jurist discusses the undefined legal status of the body that got great power worldwide
 
What are the main reasons for the creation of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF)?
The FATF emerges within the scope of the G7 in July 1989, largely at the United States of America (US), to respond to the crime of laundering of capital trafficking and the United Nations Convention against illicit trafficking and psychotropic substances of 1988. Common guidelines and the coordination of preventive measures, especially in the financial scope and international cooperation. 40 international recommendations were elaborated against the laundering of capital ”. Today the FATF has 40 members, 38 jurisdictions, the European Commission and the Gulf Cooperation Council. The last member, Indonesia, entered 2023. These members represent industrialized countries, large financial squares and emerging economies.
How do you evaluate the performance of the FATF over the years?
He played a very important role of leadership after September 11, 2001. Suddenly, the fight against terrorism (FT) became an international obligation and priority on the agenda of all countries. In the international level, the states were urged to be part of the International Convention to suppress terrorism financing, as well as regional or international agreements and actions to combat terrorism and their financing. Internally, countries have been instituted to criminalize the FT, to adopt FLS, prevention and detection measures of the FT in financial entities, such as banks and insurers, and non-finances, such as casinos, real estate agencies or pledge stores. To adopt new international instruments that harmonize or even standardize the practices of various states, and agree on their content, it may take years. But the fatf was in the right place and moment. Given its informal nature and flexibility to adjust your mandate due to the threats that could exist in the financial system and its technical know-how, the FATF incorporated in its mandate the fight against FT and produced recommendations, at a time when this matter was new to most jurisdictions. The FATF acted quickly, useful and efficiently to the international community. It had experienced experts in the financial area and the ability to assist in the application [of the recommendations] and supervise its execution. The same happened in 2009, following the 2008 financial crisis and the G20 request to reinforce measures intended for transparency and combat corruption. Therefore, it has been a positive way.
It argues that the FATF has occurred in a “institutional metamorphosis” in this body. As?
The FATF was created as an informal, technical and temporary group, renewable every eight years, but over 30 years has become an increasingly complex organization, governing 206 jurisdictions today. The extension of the mandate also implied the evolution of its powers and responsibilities, and today the FATF is worldwide recognized as the international authority on this matter. It is endowed with a public power of world governance whose recognition is translated into several resolutions of the UN Security Council.
The study comes to clarify the legal status of FATF. What status is this and what is the connection with other entities also linked to the fight against FT and money laundering?
The FATF is the world authority responsible for setting international standards, rules and policies on these subjects and there is no duplication of functions with other international organizations and entities, including International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank and the European Union. This study argues that the gradual evolution of the mandate, the FATF's institutional structure and 'modus operandi' has changed its 'modus constiti'. That is, an organization can evolve into an international organization of full right, regardless of the initial intention of the members and not being created by a treaty.
How do you explain that, to date, the FATF Legal Statute is lacking clarification?
I think there was never a real interest in analyzing this issue in depth. This theme was addressed between 2016 and 2018, during the Spanish and Argentine FATF Presidencies, but was “Marinar”, with the argument that there would be a advantage of maintaining a flexible entity to more easily be able to respond to emerging challenges and risks against safety, transparency and integrity of the international financial system. But the fact is that the FATF began to stop and exercise enormous power, as it evaluates and identifies non-compliant jurisdictions, naming them in lists ('Blacklisting'). It may also install measures to members and non -members, a power detained by very few international organizations.
To what extent does your recommendations impact and put into practice?
FATF recommendations have impact because countries are regularly evaluated on their application, called the “Technical Compliance”, and the effectiveness of their practical application, with the designation of “immediate outcomes”. This assessment is made according to strict criteria, being given a classification. If the result is disabled, the jurisdiction has to make a high level of resolution political commitment to these deficiencies, becoming part of the 'gray list', subject to an action plan and a term [compliance]. In the absence of political commitment or lack of sufficient progress in the execution of the plan, jurisdiction can be appointed to the 'blacklist', and the FATF may appeal to all FATF network jurisdictions to advise their financial institutions to reinforce diligence measures regarding the risks associated with such a jurisdiction. This is what has been happening to Myanmar since October 2022. If jurisdiction has serious deficiencies or does not comply with the action plan or is not a member of a regional group, it can be appointed to the 'blacklist'. In this case, the FATF may appeal to apply the 'Recommendation 19' measures, ranging from reinforcing the diligence and systematic communication of transactions and operations involving jurisdiction to the limitation or prohibition of financial transactions with jurisdiction.

Are there some concrete examples?
This happens with Iran and North Korea two decades ago. The international reputation [from this measure to a country] is real, has a political and economic cost. A study of the 2021 International Monetary Fund (IMF) reveals that the estimated negative effects of 7.6 percent of gross domestic product on capital flows and a significant reduction in foreign direct investment in the jurisdictions in the 'gray list' and may even have consequences under IMF.
It raises, in the book, the question of the importance of FATF in the global institutional landscape. What importance is this?
FATF serves as an institutional, operational and regime model for other international organizations. This study develops a theoretical model that can be used in any organization that acts on the international scene, gathers the same objective elements and whose legal status is uncommon. In the background, the FATF is a practical case. International law is not static and one has to analyze reality and adjust the models, and they must reflect the objective reality of the international legal order.
China and Hong Kong are members of the FATF. What is the relationship of MSAR and local policies to combat FT and money laundering with this entity?
MSAR is a member of one of the FATF regional groups-the Asia-Pacific group to combat capital bleaching (APG), and obeys the recommendations and mechanisms of FATF supervision, exercised by APG. Macau has had a good performance, obviously fulfilling his recommendations. This happened, for example, with the adoption of the property freezing regime and the law of transmitting control control of cash and negotiable instruments to the bearer. Incidentally, the MSAR was the world's first jurisdiction to obtain the best technical compliance note compared to the 40 FATF recommendations when it was evaluated in 2017.
What are the main challenges that FATF currently faces in combating this type of crimes?
The use of new technologies, virtual currency and limited access to formal financial services leading to the use of unregulated channels, increasing the risks of capital bleaching and FT. In the book also speak of the economic pit and response or action capacity between FATF's member jurisdictions regarding the member jurisdictions of regional groups. Many of them are fragile or low -income economies, so it is not surprising that they have more disabilities or difficulties in complying with FATF international standards. In APG, by way of example, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Nepal, Timor-Leste and Tuvalu are on the World Bank list of 2023 of the least developed countries, which makes the uniform and global application of FATF standards and policies difficult. In addition, the standards, policies, evaluation procedures and recommendations or FATF action plans are poorly flexible or adjustable to the local reality and internal and regional conditionalisms of non -FATF member jurisdictions. A more equitable participation or representation of these jurisdictions in the final decision -making process of the FATF should also be ensured in order to increase its legitimacy and transparency.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Interview | Shan Hai Jing, a museum and the appetite of the old</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/24/entrevista-escrever-uma-nova-versao-da-historia-mundial-parte-ii/</link><description>An interview with the duo of authors of the next English language publication Shan Hai Jing Code 《上古文明密码》, which today Macau has already presented, but now becomes a museum. Michael Du &amp; Julie Oyang, the authors are currently organizing a breathless textual race through the most important piece of Chinese literature and the heaviest treasure of Chinese culture and… beyond. Julie Oyang is an art and culture critique based on Europe, commentator of Chinese culture and visual philosopher. He is a guest professor at the University of São José in Macau, China. Michael Du is a knowledgeable of the Ancient Chinese Canadian culture, holding the largest collection of Hongshan civilization in the world. He is the founder of Haikou Kiwen International Art &amp; Culture Co. Ltd. (海口啓運國際文化藝術品有限公司) and Kiwen International Cultural Exchange (Yantai) Co.ltd (国际文化交流（烟台）有限公司). Both authors are closely involved in the operation of the China Museum of Art for Pre-Dinastic Civilizations (华夏上古文明艺术馆), which will soon open in Yantai, China.
Q: In part I of the interview, we talked about the historical meaning of the former Chinese manuscript Shan Hai Jing 《山海经》, also known as the Book of Mountains and Seas, especially its universality. What follows?
Michael: We have talked about how a deeper study of Shan Hai Jing can help us understand the origin of the first human civilizations on Earth. But we are makers. We are not for the written pages: we want to ensure that Shan Hai Jing is relevant and alive and making it part of the current culture. With this objective, I found a new company. Kiwen International Cultural Exchange (Yantai) Co.ltd (启运国际文化交流（烟台）有限公司) was created after Haikou Kiwen International Art &amp; Culture Co. Ltd. (海口啓運國際文化藝術品有限公司) is the place where global investigation will take place and the global exchange of knowledge will be encouraged and stimulated in the form of international delegations and high level visitors. We know so little about the old ones, there are so many questions to ask…
Julie: In fact, there is so much to do. There is so much we can do. In collaboration with the Chinese government, we are both involved in the operation of the China Museum of Art for Pre-Dinastic Civilizations (华夏上古文明艺术馆), where Michael cures his own collection of artifacts, as well as privately renowned private collections, including all pre-doinestic civilizations such as Hongshan, Liangzhu, Shanxingui, HongShuihe, Shijiahe, etc. These art objects have never been exposed and were never explained by traditional historians. We understand that it is extremely important for us to provide private collectors a place where they can show their journey dedicated to seeking answers to questions about humanity. In this sense, the China Museum of Art for Pre-Dinastic Civilizations (华夏上古文明艺术馆), which should open in Yantai in April, is a unique and brilliant view. We even have the architecture to correspond to this vision. Our goal is to educate the global public in general, as well as establish a connection with the young audience in a fun way and with high quality standards.
Beyond the exhibition, which will do more to make the mysterious old “alive and active” to the global audience?
Julie: At this time, Michael and I are planning a parallel exhibition and a workshop in collaboration with French artist chef Gil Gonzalez-Foerster (Chinese name: 晓松). In a way, the Yantai museum is a time capsule where an old and faded memory is stored. And Gil's kitchen deals with memory, this time from these pre-doneastic civilizations, starting from Shan Hai Jing. Being the imaginative guardian of memory, the Chinese classic contains the oldest memory in China, or even in the world. Shan Hai Jing records ancient memories in the form of mythology meditations and the most interesting facts about flora and fauna known for their magical power and powerful force that live from one extreme to the other. This seems to be the reputation of this ancient and inexhaustible text. But Shan Hai Jing is also an extraordinary recipe book!
But why food?
Michael: You are what you eat. Food is an essential part of everyday human life that can tell us more about the past. When a dish is no longer remembered, part of us cease to exist. Food is perhaps the most intimate and sensual memory. Perhaps this is one of the reasons why Shan Hai Jing was written: remember through food? Our curated exhibition will become more complete, more 3D, more realistic, exploring the taste of the ancients!
Julie: Shan Hai Jing documents diverse gastronomic experiences, mixing natural history and food knowledge. His humanist approach makes Shan Hai Jing unique in his genre. The word Shi (食), “eat”, appears more than 160 times in the book, of the ancients. There are, however, many cases about exotic food that heals medical conditions quite familiar to modern men, but Shan Hai Jing also offers cure for conditions such as arrogance, confusion/lack of wisdom, ward off physical dangers. This is a unique culinary philosophy! Food involves the mind, not just the taste. To provoke the intellect. This deep idea is still deeply rooted in modern Chinese food. Through our exhibition, we also understand why Confucius taught his disciples that food is a virtuous gift and why the great Chinese scholarly poets were famous food lovers.
We currently do not know who was the author of the mysterious Chinese classic whose imagination exceeds a thousand and one nights…
Michael: The ancients were "men of appetite." Appetite can explain humanity's historical and economic landscapes more clearly than academic jargon.
Speaking of economics, how is the museum economy managed?
Michael: The museum is an educational organism. It is also a business. We focused on five volumes of business. The investigation mainly involves cooperation with various institutions and training programs in China. We organize courses, events and publications. This part will generate 7.6 million RMB/year. Ticket sales will generate 7.2 million RMB/year. Authenticity certification will generate 3.5 million RMB/year. We will also form art and antique auctions agents, whose program will generate 4.9 million RMB/year. In spring and fall, a large scale auction will be held, with a conservative estimate of 50 million RMB of auction volume. This amount does not include revenues from the commission of 15% of sellers and buyers. In addition, four more themed auction games will be held annually, with a conservative estimate of 5 million RMB of business volume and 6 million RMB of auctioning commission.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>António Queirós, philosopher and academic: “the West there is great ignorance” about China</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/21/antonio-queiros-filosofo-e-academico-a-ocidente-ha-uma-grande-ignorancia-sobre-a-china/</link><description>Doctorate in Philosophy of Sciences, Environmental and Environmental Ethics, António Queirós, linked to the Faculty of Letters of the University of Lisbon, regrets that the West continues to face China in the wrong way, especially in environmental issues.

Will talk about the theme “The Environmental Crisis and the China Eco-Civilization Project”. What project is this?
This is China's great project for the New Age. It is a concept that began to be elaborated from 2013. This idea began to be realized with different projects. Since the “New Democracy” regime, which resulted from the Chinese resistance to the occupation of Japan and the geopolitical confrontation of the countries of the axis of different democracies. This is when the Popular Republic of China is proclaimed, such as the proclamation of the “new democracy” and comes the awareness of the world's environmental crisis by China, with the regime to evolve into the so-called “ecological socialism” from 2003. It was necessary for the country to experience a model of industrialization common to the early experiences of socialism, and above all capitalist countries. China's fundamental thesis is that all regimes can collaborate in building a new civilization, but this implies outdoor democratic reforms that are consigned in global civilization proposals, guaranteeing peace according to the principle of indivisibility of security. But I would like to point out the moment when the United Nations (UN), representing the whole world, became aware of the existence of an environmental crisis, from the Stockholm Conference, which took place in 1972. In China this process of awareness of the socialist state organs, citizens and parties, began in 2003. It is strange that issues like this will never be debated. The ideological confrontation that comes from the Cold War did not cease with Helsinquia's agreements, and therefore there are themes that are unknown to the West because of this harmful tradition of the Cold War, which has extended, and because the media have no openness to discuss and present the proposals that China makes.
China is present and is an important actor in world meetings on environment and climate. Why do you understand that there is no discussion the West about the concept of eco-civilization?
It is not discussed why the West there is great ignorance about China and the reality of the country. The only advantage I have about most people who write and talk about China is that my relationship with the country is over 50 years old. I know how China was presented to the West 50 years ago. We lived [in Portugal], a fascist regime where information came to people with great difficulty. I have seen these years to all kinds of visions about China that lacked concrete information, because the country, until reform and openness, was a closed society. But this lack of information was general in the West. I also had visions that were not reality and I began to question whether China's historical experience is unique, without parallel in the history of society, democracy and socialism, for its historical characteristics, hermeneutics, in the sense of method, the analysis of concepts and starting points, which predominates the West, does not serve. But then let's go to the concrete issue, which is the responsibilities that China has in environmental matters.
Which, specifically, are…
One thing is the contribution that give China, India and other countries to global warming, because they are populations that represent most of humanity. There are technologies that are themselves polluting. But if we look at this angle we ended up falsifying reality, because greenhouse gases that exist in the atmosphere have been at least 150 years ago due to European and American industrialization. In terms of historical responsibility, the US is largely responsible [for global warming], and I cite official European Union data, for example. I speak of tons of carbon dioxide and greenhouse gases emitted to the atmosphere in all these years.
Because they industrialized much earlier than China.
Yes, and presented an industry without this kind of environmental concerns. Therefore, this reality is hidden, which greenhouse gases have begun to pollute for 150 years and that it is not only today's contributions [which are the major causes of global warming].
Therefore, the idea that China is the main polluting country finds it wrong.
In current terms China and India can be the most polluting. But they are neither in “per capita” nor historically. What is really [in the Western discourse] is that they currently contribute [to global warming]. But then we have to see the trends where we are going to walk. But if we deepen this topic we have come to even less favorable conclusions to Western policies. China's environmental history can be summed up at four periods. The first period is in the years of reform and openness, from 1978, and the fourth period is when China launches the pilot projects of ecological civilization. The process is global. Still in relation to China's responsibilities, in the first phase the West and the industrialized east carried to China the most polluting industries, because China's appeal was to industrialize and create more employment. The UN resolution that adds an article beyond the 30 articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, finally recognizes as an inalienable right of the human being to a healthy environment. This statement, the West, completely truncated, reduced to no thing, has a preamble with 30 articles in which the environmental issue is not posed. Since this statement is no longer in line with current political and social reality, it has been moving, mutilated and reduced to formal freedoms. Also ignored by the set of citizens who do not know their origin either. China is co-founder of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, a fact that is also concealed. But I also wanted to talk about the largest fallacy of the Western environmental policy.
What is it?
The idea that, from now on, one will protect nature. So what is done to what was destroyed? Especially in developing countries, because it was there that we sent these residues from the polluting industries and exploited all resources. No one wanted to know that, and what did China did? He assumed the leadership of the process and through his diplomacy to "act without acting," Tao's way, without violating nature, respecting the laws and dignity of things, approving the Kunming-Montreal agreement [on biodiversity]. We then have a commitment that the US probably will lie down to the rubbish crate to recover the biotypes that are destroyed, because much of the world is in environmental crisis and has so far been whistling to the side. China has a gradual view that risk factors in the environmental crisis tend to decrease with China's effort, both nationally and international. But the most remarkable issue in the idea of ​​building an ecological state in the country was the fact that, at the initiative of President XI Jinping, principles of environmental philosophy were included in the Statutes of the Chinese Communist Party, an unprecedented fact in another Communist Party and even some ecologists.
Global reformulation
According to the study “Ecological Civilization in the People’s Republic of China: VALUES, Action, and Future Needs”, by Arthur Hanson, published in 2019 by Asian Development Bank, the concept of ecological civilization “is being used by the Popular Republic of China (RPC) to provide a coherent conceptual framework for adjustments to development that responds to the century. XXI.
It differs from sustainable development in the emphasis placed in political and cultural factors, as well as in the definition of new relationships between people and nature that allow you to live well and within the eco-environmental boundaries of planet Earth. ”
In addition to reducing pollution and promoting circular economy, for example, they are also considered “domain of finance, law, institutional reinforcement and technological innovation”, having already been defined some ideas in five-year five-term agents, especially until 2035, when it is expected that ecological civilization, in its basic form, is fully implemented for the modernization of the RPC ”.</description><pubDate>2025-02-21 00:36:40</pubDate></item><item><title>Piménio Ferreira: “Anti-igan rhetoric has always worked in Portugal”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2021/04/26/pimenio-ferreira-a-retorica-anti-cigana-sempre-funcionou-em-portugal/</link><description>Piménio Ferreira, better known as Gitelles Ferreira, anti-racist militant, 34, physical engineer, national Romani. He is a man with a provocative speech, a corrosive, kind mood and a smile that leaves no one indifferent
Gitelles, we live in an intercultural land and the Gypsies - in particular - have lived about five centuries in Portugal. What is going on for Gypsy communities to remain “on the fringes” of the so -called society? 
The model of society remains to be changed. This is extremely stratified by placing people in subordinate places to privilege a violent minority. The white social structure is patriarchal and racist. What is called the "margin" of society is actually an intrinsic place to it, which belongs to it. In other words, Gypsy people have been included in this model of society since they discovered Europe and its kingdoms. The problem is the model of society that is maintained and the place to which they were relegated and how they were relegated: with violence, in inferior status against whites, without the right to human dignity, to constitute a family, to choose one's own language and religion, expropriated from any and all cultural and material law. A place built and maintained to this day by violence and genocidal and ethnicidal persecution. In 1463, a Gitano Vasco was drowned to an estate. In 1521, Gitans, or Gypsies, were already used as a reference for all that is considered bad in the model of society. The "counter-exemple" in the face of the white that would stand out for the positive. The 'angel' and the 'devil'; the 'other', the enemy; That against whom any attack and persecution is legitimate. Including the prohibition of defending, having weapons, any kind of goods, and the right of permanence.
And is this right to permanence that we still have nomadic gypsy communities within the country is denied?
Yes, no doubt. There are many ways to force nomadism: directly, prohibiting permanence and expelling with police or military force; indirectly, refusing public or private housing to Gypsy people, because they are Gypsy; and even through the gentrification process.
I read the result of an inquiry from the European Union Fundamental Rights Agency, which is said to be approximately 80% of the Gypsies responded to the risk threshold of poverty in their country; One in three Gypsies lives in a housing without channeled water; One in three Gypsies belongs to a family where someone hungry at least once the previous month; and 50% of Gypsies aged 6 to 24 do not attend school. Why does this happen like this? 
It is the historical persecution, which continues. There is no impoverishment that has no external cause. In this case, a political system of total expropriation and imposed on the basis of violence. Already in 1648, D John IV, the restorer, prohibited ‘Giving or Rent houses to Gypsies’. The same D John IV who got the kingdom of Portugal thanks to D. Jerónimo da Costa and his 250 knights. The same D. Jerónimo da Costa who had died to defend Portugal's independence from Castile. Gypsy, like his wife and children. Between prohibitions of permanence, “that do not enter Gypsies in the Kingdom and leave those who are” (D John III, 1526), ​​with expulsions, degred to the galleys, expropriation of goods and properties, imposed with stripping, mutilation and death, systematically performed to this day (still in 2011 Faro City Council wanted to ban Gypsies in the municipality).
The prohibition of working on others (no one employs Gypsy workers, and those who accept they do it in total precariousness, for poorly paid positions and without decent rights and conditions). They cannot be dependent on their own work, they cannot get investment means due to extreme expropriation. Are dependent on precariousness. If you want to know what it is like to live in pure neoliberalism, know the lives of Gypsies. Their reality is paradigmatic of the aggression and depletion to which the "gentlemen" are willing to go to their benefit.
Are you talking about economic and political power?
The group of political, social, cultural and economic power. The owner, the colonizer. This group that has been in power since it established the system of current domination. And that only makes sense within the hierarchically stratified sociopolitical model in which we live. Hence the need to end 'gentlemen' and institute a new model of society, healthy, free, without hierarchies or strata, whether of race, class or gender.
The model we live in leads to the Gypsy (and not only) community to economic exclusion, removing it from access to product consumption or excluding them from its production process; political exclusion associated with lack of access to information; To education and consequently the social exclusion that is seen in inequality of access to quality community areas such as restaurants, libraries, theater, cinema, concerts, health care, etc. How do you feel a gypsy child when you realize that it is not part of a whole? Children who are never represented, neither in movies, nor in books, nor in cartoons, not even in an announcement to eat cereals, for example? Is this a disaster for self-esteem, is a priori condemnation?
The question is that. Gypsy people are not “excluded from society”, by contrast, they are included in it. The problem is the existence of what is cynically called 'social exclusion', which term Orwellian, and there be under coercion, people. Which field of concentration and extermination. Incidentally, Nazi concentration camps are a more visual realization than called 'social exclusion' and, as here, were not a 'excluded' part of Nazi society, but rather its fundamental and characterizing structure. It is a place of violence, where people are maintained by violence, dedicated to their extermination, and designed so that few people can leave. And yet they resist. As in Nazi concentration camps.
And what you have listed as an example of 'consequence' of this 'exclusion', is actually the means by which this exclusion also happens and remains. Gypsy people are out of theaters, both as consumers and producers (but go to the cinema). They are out of school, education and the gym. Either as 'users' or as producers (but go to school and are on the basis of knowledge construction and academic and scientific debates).
Even in attacking Gypsy children's self -confidence, we talk about a maintenance mechanism of this situation. But Gypsy people respond very well: with Gypsy pride. Another resistance, another aggression. Gypsy people are thus included in society. In a place that belongs to this model of modern society. And they resist and contradict the power of domination and make a point of being in the city, in the cinema, in the theater, in the gym, in all spaces. With a lot of struggle and always resisting, but they are there. Social exclusion, more than a “place outside of society”, is part of its social structure.
Do you want to say that there is a collective resistance?
At work, already in a context of absolute precariousness, during the pandemic, Gypsy people rolled up sleeves and showed once again proactivity and creativity in adversity. They learned seeing and doing. And here, it is again the women who jump to the front line, face, learn to use digital tools with their daughters or children, and throw themselves into the network. And so they explore online sales as well as application by application (transportation or rehabs). In housing, in a pandemic context in which the evictions were not locked - as they owed and dictated the law itself - residents did not fail to organize and fight unjust evictions and claim dignity in housing; associations of allied residents in their action with other housing and anti-racist struggle organizations.
It should also be noted how they reinvented and intensified to raise and distribute dietary goods and kits of masks/alcohol gel to the most expropriated people. Gypsies and non -Gypsies. In the anti-racist struggle, new movements emerged and their actions intensified by social networks. People who had never been organized or militated before began their first steps in activism, thickening this way of the organization and popular gypsy and anti-racist action. People forget, or do not want to value, but Gypsy action has helped determine results in the political dispute. Gypsy citizens mobilized in large and determined electoral results in the municipalities of 2017, both in Alentejo and in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area, even causing electoral earthquakes.
And even in the presidential, second place was resolved by a value equivalent to the estimated number of Gypsy voters. Apart from the non -Gypsy votes that were mobilized by the action of Gypsy voters. Gypsy people are even co-considering power in the spaces of opinion, local media, social networks and party and institutional political dispute. And most importantly, in the popular Ação and alliances with other social movements. We have never stopped fighting for all means and continuing to resist.
In contrast there are more and more hate speeches, from the far right in particular. What do you have to say about it?
To start these speeches are historical and European. Not even current and even less “of the far right”. These speeches have been adopted and rendered for a long time, even in 'democracy and freedom', by several representatives of the center right, conservatives, left center, liberal, liberal left, even representatives of the PCP. Anti-egana rhetoric has always worked in Portugal as it is the whiter rhetoric [white genesis]. That is, it allows you to create and give the "white" as the superior of all. And so please the white electorate who, when feeling well, pays off with his vote. Even if the policies implemented by their elected harm him even more.
Finally, did you like them to talk a little about your personal experience and how did you get to the activist?
I studied, fought for studies, made alliances, graduated, went in the labor market of the “formal precariousness”. I started my militant action and here I am today. We can transform this society a better. This certainty combined with the fact that the current one has so much suffering makes anyone want to have a transformist attitude. I wanted to be 'inventor' (physical engineer) and anti -racist militant. And through study (not necessarily schooling) and organization with others, in turn, with other studies, formations and visions, I learned how the world works and how it can be changed. But before transforming, we need to survive.
Hence two types of actions arise: transformative and survival. The struggle against hate discourse arises as survival, but his defeat will be a transformative victory. There is a lot that - like people who want a better world - we have to do, namely working to criminalize hatred speech; condemn and prohibit organizations with racist discourses and practices; denounce the racist institutional structure and logics that organize power and generate community resources. And in this sense, there have been various types of actions, of petitions, to manifestations. And we need more.
I, besides being a military man in the SOS Racism movement, participate in the “We came to stay” podcast, with Mamadou BA and Joseph da Silva. And if all goes well, we will soon start a new project. With friendly people, we also have the project “Gypsy Initiative”, dedicated to reflecting and promoting transformative movements. Essentially focused on educating against anti-agigarism, denouncing historical and continued genocide and working for a new society project. Also with new projects on the gutter. And finally, there are always voluntary actions without an organization, where I try to share what I found out about anti-egism and Roman history in schools and with interested people. In addition, there is still the struggle for housing, because the evictions did not stop during the pandemic. Due to housing and work precariousness, the subjects racialized especially the Roma nationals are the most vulnerable to COVID-19. There is essential to have actions in this area; Of all the struggles, this is the most structural, as it goes against one of the main enemies of a healthy society: the real estate speculation of this capitalist system, which places profit and goods above people and their humanization.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>GP TCR | Australia confirms presence in Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/19/gp-tcr-australia-confirma-presenca-em-macau/</link><description>The 2025 season of TCR Australia will end largely when joining the TCR World Tour in the race of the 72nd Macao Grand Prix, which will take place from 13 to 16 November
 
After welcoming TCR China by 2024, the FIA ​​TCR World Tour “worldwide” will have the company of the Australian competitors in the most demanding race of the season, as HM had already foreseen at the end of last year.
This announcement is the second news in the calendar of one of the largest national TCR competitions in the world, after the announcement of a new promoter for the championship.
One pilot who was certainly pleased with the news was Australian Ben Bargwanna, who ran on the streets of Macao in 2023. TCR Australia's first international participation was made possible by the global rights holder, the WSC Group, which will ensure full transportation costs for Australian teams traveling to Macau.
"TCR Australia has always been one of TCR's most important and exciting competitions, rooted in the long tradition of tourism motorsport in the country," said WSC Group president Marcello Lotti. The Italian businessman made it clear that “when logistical issues forced us to cancel the Australian rounds of Kumho Fia TCR World Tour last year, we immediately started working to return in 2025. It is fantastic to extend cooperation for a second event and offer Australian competitors the unique opportunity to finish the season in Macau.”
Other applause
TCR Australia Prosecutor David Sonenscher, an old acquaintance of Macao, highlighted the importance of the moment for the category.
"I am very happy to bring TCR Australia to one of the most iconic circuits in the world and certainly one of the biggest challenges for a pilot," said former Malaysian-based English driver and entrepreneur and co-founder of TCR Asia. “The opportunity to expand our cooperation with the TCR World Tour FIA and to show the talented Australian riders on the highest international stage in Macau demonstrates the unique opportunity that TCR Australia and the TCR Global Platform provide all participants.”
Confirmation of the presence of TCR Australia in the Guide Race should not be impeded to the participation of local pilots and the interior of China in the most celebrated tourist car race on the Asian continent.</description><pubDate>2025-02-19 01:54:58</pubDate></item><item><title>Motorcycling | FHO RACING WITH NEW FOCUS IN 2025</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/13/motociclismo-fho-racing-com-novo-foco-em-2025/</link><description>Doubts dissipated this week. Macau's businesswoman Foye Ho's FHO Racing will continue to active in the 2025 season, but without the initially announced riders. Peter Hickman and Davey Todd are leaving and goes to a new team called 8ten Racing
 
According to a statement sent by FHO Racing, BMW Motorrad UK has restructured its training for the 2025 British Superbike Championship, and FHO Racing BMW will compete with a single pilot aboard a BMW M 1000 RR. German 2024 Superbike Champion and Resistance World Cup driver, Ilya Mikhalchik, will make his debut in the British competition, at a time when team owner Faye Ho, realinhas the objectives of his team “to explore new activities in motorized new markets, with the support of BMW Motorrad Motorsport”.
Currently in his fifth year at the British Superbike Championship Paddock, Faye Ho has been a strong presence in the British competition, as well as in the popular road races, such as the Macao Grand Prix, as well as supporting several young female riders, helping them progress in their careers since the lower classes. Faye Ho, Stanley Ho's granddaughter and Clementina Leitão, has supported Kate Walker and Jamie Hanks-Bliott on BMW F 900 R Cup and, it seems, which will continue to support.
To be
Contrary to the rumors that put her from Paddock's departure, Faye Ho made it clear that she is a “great advocate of the British Superbike Championship, one of the world's most exciting and competitive competitions” and will keep her commitment to discipline. However, the territory entrepreneur now has new objectives for herself and its structure. The future will be in Asia and support for young female talents.
"Given my long -term objectives, which include expanding motor sport activities in Asia and continuing to support young women in motorcycling, I realized that I cannot dedicate the same time, to the British Superbike Championship and the road races, which I gave them since I became the owner of the team in 2021, due to additional commitments I have in Macao," Faye Ho said.
Another chapter
This announcement put an end to a successful partnership, particularly on the island of Man TT, between Peter Hickman, four times winner of the Macao Motorcycle Grand Prix, and Fho Racing. Hickman left some words of thanks to his now former boss.
“I want to leave a huge thanks to Faye [Ho] and Fho Racing for all they have done for me over the past four years,” Hickman wrote in a Facebook social network post. “As it is normal in motorized sport, we had amazing moments and others more difficult, but Fho has always been and always will be a fundamental part of my career. I will be eternally grateful for this opportunity. ”
The new 8Ten Racing team, which will be officially presented on February 26, will be mostly composed of former FHO Racing elements. Hickman and Todd will maintain the important support of BMW Motorrad UK and are expected on the big prize starting grid in November.</description><pubDate>2025-02-13 01:30:05</pubDate></item><item><title>GP Macau | FIA confirms GT World Cup</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/28/gp-macau-fia-confirma-taca-do-mundo-de-gt/</link><description>The World Council of the FIA ​​last Wednesday confirmed the expected, that the eighth edition of the FIA ​​GT World Cup will be held as part of the Macao's 72nd Grand Program, from November 13 to 16. However, there is a big news for this year's edition
 
The International Federation, which co-organizes this race in partnership with Sro Motorsports Group and the Macau-China General Automotive Association (AAMC), took the opportunity to announce a new qualification model for the race. In addition to the 30 -minute qualification session equal to the previous editions (Q1), a second qualification segment (Q2) was added, reserved for the top ten pilots of the first session.
The Q2 session will be held in Super Pole format, with each pilot to go to the track individually for a total of two qualification turns, and each pilot is also allowed to use a new tire set at this session. This novelty will allow qualification to be decided without interference from third parties.
The remaining program of the Queen of GT will remain the same as the previous editions, with the free training session, the traditional 12-lap classification race on Saturday afternoon, followed by the 16-lap main race that will decide the world's Cup winner on Sunday.
Veterans compliments
These measures introduced by the FIA ​​were very well received by the most experienced GT riders. This is because traffic has always been a huge obstacle in obtaining a good qualification return on the guide circuit, something essential for those who aim to win this title.
"It's an excellent idea to introduce the Super Pole session in Macao," said German Maro Engel, the winner of the World Cup last edition by Mercedes-AMG. This will be one of the most spectacular and exciting sessions of the season and should also secure sports justice. Fans have a lot to yearn. ”
Raffaele Marciello, for two occasions winning of this trophy, and one of BMW's factory riders, also reacted positively, adding: “In Macao, it was always complicated to make a clean turn. With this new format, you will not hear the excuse of traffic or a red flag. Having only two laps will be very challenging, but now the fastest pilot will probably be in pole. ”
This is an opinion shared by Laurens Vanthoor, the World Cup winner in 2016, who said there will no longer be “apologies” in the qualification. Porsche's experienced Belgian pilot believes that “there will be an added pressure because you only have these two turns”, because in a difficult circuit like this, “if you make an error, there is nothing else to follow. In a normal qualification, you have more opportunities. Personally, a shootout is always something I appreciate a lot. For pilots, on a track like this, it will be almost the highlight of the weekend. ”
And the younger ones too
Chinese pilot Yifei Ye premiered at the Grand Prix last November at the World Cup. Ferrari's official pilot, which competes in the Endurance Fia World Championship (WEC), has left a good impression on the guide circuit, and he also welcomes the now introduced measurements.
“It's good to eliminate these red flag interventions and yellow flags, so that in the end, the one that really is the fastest to get pole position,” said Yifei Ye that she could return to the race this year. “In Macau, everyone is very close in terms of times, so it will be extremely difficult for pilots to try to reach Super Pole. I think it will also be great for viewers. ”</description><pubDate>2025-02-28 01:03:51</pubDate></item><item><title>GP | Célio Alves Dias will continue to run this season</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/24/gp-celio-alves-dias-vai-continuar-a-correr-esta-temporada/</link><description>Macaense pilot Célio Alves Dias was one of the long -term returns of the 2024 car.
 
The Macao Cup winner of Macau in 2021 was removed from motorsport at the time of 2023 for personal reasons, but last year made his debut in the competition that joins the Toyota Gr86 (ZN8) and the Subaru BRZ (ZD8). Despite the vast experience in tests of the specialty, having conducted several generations of tourism cars, Célio Alves Dias had never managed the new bobbinns that the Macao-China General Association (AAMC) introduced in its competition in 2023. Last time turned out to be of learning, with some difficulties in the tuning and behavior of the Japanese car.
Participation in races at the Zhuzhou International Circuit and the Macau Grand Prix made Célio Alves Dias realize that his Toyota GR86 was not at the strongest competition level. Based on the conclusions drawn from these experiences, he decided to start preparing for the new season.
“The car had to be all dismantled. My car was bought on Monday, and the chassis and the security arc, for me, were not well done, ”explained Fu Lei Racing Team pilot to HM. “This, made the car too hard and very difficult to bow. I tried a car from China, which was well assembled, and there is a difference. I had a long time in January, in China, with this car. Our cars, made in the same workshop, were very hard, which made it difficult to make turns fast. ”
If in the Macao Grand Prix, the house riders, excellent guide circuit, managed to equate the progress to their hong Kong opponents and the interior of China, in the initial races on the Zhuzhou track in Hunan province, it wasn't quite like that. “There are many differences between cars, but especially in chassis, because engines, in terms of power and horses, are almost all at the same level. Our opponents also experienced many pieces, many engines, even gearboxes, and chassis. Competition cars are always the same. You have to have engine power, but also chassis. Having only power is not enough. Having better a good chassis is the most important. ”
Silver Jubilee in November
Being a usual Portuguese name in the Macao Grand Prix in recent decades, Célio Alves Dias debuted at the Guide Circuit in 2000 and from then was a frequent presence and no fouls in the race until 2023. This year, its objective is to account for its twenty-fifth participation in the largest sports event of RAEM, but will have to align in the findings.
While awaiting the announcement of the 2025 calendar by AAMC, Célio Alves Dias details details to start his test program, because his Toyota, after being reviewed, "is ready to test" in the interior of China, something that will happen "very soon," says the pilot.
In the last edition of the Grand Prix, Célio Alves Dias qualified in 12th place for the Macau Roadsport Challenge race. However, his participation was short and unhappy: at the wheel of Toyota with dorsal No. 11, was forced to give up after being immobilized on the climb of San Francisco. The Macanese pilot was out of the race on the first lap, in an incident that caused the Safety Car.</description><pubDate>2025-02-24 02:50:53</pubDate></item><item><title>FHO RACING | Peter Hickman denies closing</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/07/fho-racing-peter-hickman-nega-encerramento/</link><description>Peter Hickman, four times winner of the Macao Motorcycle Grand Prix, denied the rumors that claimed that the team Racing, from Macau Faye Ho businesswoman, would have closed the doors and would be absent on the British Superbike Championship (BSB) and the Macao Grand Prix in 2025
 
Peter Hickman goes to the fifth season in the British Championship with Fho Racing, however, before the season's start, some rumors came to circulate in Paddock about the team's future. In recent years, FHO Racing has become one of the top teams in the British Superbike Championship and road events, such as the MAN's island TT or the Macao Grand Prix.
Last November, the team announced that they featured Peter Hickman and Davey Todd, winner of the troubled last edition of the Macao Grand Motor Prize in the British Superbike Championship. Faye Ho said at the time that “for 2025 and also for this year's Macao Grand Prix, we have a very strong team, with Davey joining Pete and Michael aboard the BMW. We have two super talented drivers on the roads for next season, and with Davey jumping to the Superbike class, after winning the Superstock Championship for the second time, I think we'll have a strong season. I can't expect my team to return to Macau, I love to share my hometown with the team and show all points of interest, it's such a special place for me. ”
Although Hickman and Todd have been present at the BMW Motorrad Motorsport season in Berlin in mid -January, since November that Fho Racing has no news, which has generated some discomfort and doubts among fans. Hickman was testing his BMW M1000RR from his Phr Performance in Spain, when he responded with a striking "no" to a fan of a fan on Instagram social network about the rumor of FHO Racing activity ceasing, a "no" that had wide repercussion in the specialized British press.
It's not the first time
After a difficult season of his team in 2024 in the British Superbike Championship, Faye Ho, Stanley Ho's granddaughter, had to face similar rumors last September. In Oulton Park, before the opening race of the 2024 showdown, Faye Ho confirmed to journalists that FHO Racing would continue to participate in the 2025 British Superbike Championship, “which is good news, but anything will be announced in time. But I'm happy to be back here and to stay here, it's a big championship and I love to be in this racing environment. ”
To increase speculation between fans, Hickman suggested on social networks a change of direction this year, leaving an announcement about his plans for the North West 200 and TT of the island of Man. In Spain, the British will have tested with his motorcycle without any reference and FHO Racing spectals, while Todd changed his profile photo on social networks, for a photo with a motorcycle from Milwaukee BMW by Tas Racing.

On the eve of last Christmas, Sro Motorsport Group, the entity responsible for organizing numerous races and championships, including the GT World Challenge Asia and, as the official partner of the FIA, the coordination of the FIA ​​GT World Cup in Macau, announced the creation of a competition for GT4 vehicles, made up of four events in China. At the time of the announcement, only the inaugural event in Shanghai and the end in Beijing had been confirmed as part of the calendar.
Almost 30 cars, representing an impressive total of ten automotive builders, participated in the GT Cup - Great Bay Race of 2024, a race that has become an important milestone over the weekend of the Macao Grand Prix in recent years. Indeed, no other GT4 event in Asia brings together such quantity and diversity of cars. The Balance of Performance (BOP), responsible for balancing the performance of the various participating cars, was, at the time, managed by SRO.
In a statement, Benjamin Frannasovici, managing director of Sro Motorsports Asia, said:
“We are enchanted, proud and privileged for adding the GT Cup - Great Bay Race to the inaugural calendar of Sro GT Cup, which begins and ends with the two largest motorized sports events in China. We already have a strong working relationship with the GT Cup - Great Bay Race, which has become the most significant race for GT4 cars in Asia. Its inclusion in the 2025 calendar of the SRO underlines the size of our ambition for this new national series. ”
High interest
The SRO GT Cup debut season begins in March at China's Formula 1 Grand Prix in Shanghai, before moving to the Zhuhai International Circuit - a place previously visited by SRO in BPR times and the FIA ​​GT Championship - where two 30 -minute races are planned. This is followed by Beijing's new city circuit, which will host the GT World Challenge Asia on the same weekend, before the big end of the Sro GT Cup season, scheduled for a month later at the Guide Circuit in Macao.
The enthusiasm surrounding this competition is evident. As Benjamin Franassovici said, “This is reflected in the number of consultations and registration for the full season we have received since the release of the championship, just before Christmas. The demand has exceeded our expectations. ”
Up to 28 cars will be able to compete at the season end event on the streets of Macau, with places to be assigned based on the classification after the second round of the championship, which is scheduled for the Zhuhai Permanent Circuit. All pilots with bronze or “silver” classifications attributed by the FIA ​​are eligible to compete in this competition, as long as they use approved cars from the GT4 class.
To attract brands, the results of SRO GT Cup races will tell the SRO GT4 builders ranking, a title attributed to the brand with better performance in the GT4 category at the end of each season. SRO GT CUP joins its Asian equivalent, Japan Cup, in a list that also includes continental and national competitions in Europe, America and Australia.</description><pubDate>2025-01-27 11:13:41</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
