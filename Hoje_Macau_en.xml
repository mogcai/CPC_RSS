Iranian Parliament President Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf said the International Atomic Energy Agency (AIEA) refused to condemn the attack on Iranian nuclear facilities, compromising the international credibility of the United Nations.
Ghalibaf's statements occurred after the deputies voted in favor of the suspension of cooperation with AIEA. "The Iranian organization of atomic energy will suspend cooperation with AIEA while the safety of nuclear facilities is not guaranteed," added the president of Parliament of Teerão.

“We have to transform Macao International Airport, in fact with direct air routes to Europe, namely to Portugal,” Coutinho said after the presentation of the political program of the Nova Esperança list to the local parliament.
The jurist said the largest long -haul aircraft in the world can land in Macao, but a lack of space to park aircraft, a problem that said he expected to be solved by expanding the infrastructure.
The expansion of the airport, launched in November, involves the construction of a landfill with more than 129 hectares and is expected to be over in 2030, increasing the capacity of 9.6 million to 13 million passengers per year.
"We hope that in the future it is not necessary to move to Hong Kong to take an international flight to Europe or America and we can start the trip in Macao which is our home," said Coutinho. Macao airport currently has regular passenger flights operated by 27 airlines to 41 destinations in mainland China, Taiwan, Southeast Asia, Japan and South Korea.
Criticized cuts
On the other hand, Coutinho criticized local government's decision to restrict financial aids given annually to people with resident status to those who in 2024 resided in the region at least 183 days.
The measure provides for exceptions, including for those living in nine cities of mainland China integrated in the Great Guandong-Hong Kong-Macau Bay project and those studying at universities abroad. But Coutinho warned that the exceptions did not eliminate all injustices, namely cases of retired people living in Portugal.
The deputy gave the example of a former Portuguese soldier, “almost 90 years old”, who worked for 40 years as a police in Macao, but has no right to financial aid for going to live with his daughter in Portugal after being widowed. "Do you think it is fair?" Coutinho asked the journalists.
The Nova Esperança political program also advocates "a deeper realization" of the role of Macao as a cooperation platform with Portuguese -speaking countries, "with the greater participation of the population and entrepreneurs."
The new hope was one of eight candidacies validated by the Electoral Affairs Commission of the Legislative Assembly (Caeal). Four years ago, there were 19 lists of candidates for the Legislative Assembly, although five lists and 21 candidates -15 of which pro -democracy -were then excluded for "not defending the basic law" and not being "faithful to masters".</description><pubDate>2025-06-26 01:31:24</pubDate></item><item><title>SMG | Sign 1 of storm</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/26/smg-sinal-1-de-tempestade-icado/</link><description>The Meteorological and Geophysical Services (SMG) issued yesterday at 4:30 pm Sign 1 of Tropical Storm due to a low pressure area in the northern part of the Southern Sea of ​​China that intensified to a tropical depression, but pointed out that the possibility of raising the alert to signal 3 was “relatively low”.

About 23 properties belonging to businesswoman Isabel Chiang were placed in auction to pay debts to more than 200 creditors, according to the Fasome Court Portal.

In turn, Rita Santos says she will devote more time to the family. Still will again assume the functions of advisor to the Portuguese communities
 
José Pereira Coutinho will be the first candidate on the Nova Esperança list, which highlights the absence of Rita Santos, who was nominated by the deputy as a candidate of the list in an eligible place. Minutes before the presentation of the list, which took place yesterday afternoon, the president of the General Assembly of the Macao Public Function Association (ATFPM) shared a video on social networks to announce that he would not be a candidate, for wanting to spend more time with his family.
The absence was devalued by José Pereira Coutinho who, through the analogy with the captain of the Portuguese football team, Cristiano Ronaldo, declined the idea that the list was deprived of a member with unique quality and a lot of experience: “In New Hope, Cristiano Ronaldo is me, I am Cristiano Ronaldo,” said the deputy, with Rita Santos and the other members of the list next door.
The legislator also said that the deputy position requires dedication and time, with personal loss, and indicated that Rita Santos did not want to make this sacrifice: “Who has no temporal availability, because there are family, children and grandchildren to follow and gives the priority to grandson, so my dear friend, I can not accept [this person on the list]. Coutinho. "We are very friends since childhood, but one thing is bread, bread, something is cheese, cheese," he added.
Despite the candidacy for deputy, a political office, José Pereira Coutinho refused that the list of nine hope is classified as "politics", understanding that it is a "civic" list and "friends". The deputy said he also did not feel any political pressure in the definition of candidates on the list: "Do you think I'm not free? I never had pressure to anything," Coutinho replied when asked about it.
Backwater
Present in the presentation of the list, minutes after having published the video explaining that he did not apply, Rita Santos did not want to make statements in his own name to journalists. However, the chairman of the ATFPM General Assembly confirmed that he will take over the position of advisor to the Portuguese communities. The information was also transmitted by José Pereira Coutinho, in the statements made to journalists.
The withdrawal of the elections of September 14 to the Legislative Assembly is days after the prosecutor of the MSAR revealed that Rita Santos, although without revealing the name, had been questioned, at the request of the authorities of Portugal, due to investigations related to a “crime against the electoral law of Portugal in Macao”.
When asked if the withdrawal was related to the investigations, both Rita Santos and José Pereira Coutinho refused any connection. The two also indicated that the possible inclusion of Rita Santos in the lists had come from Coutinho, as a "obligation" that the colleague did not want to accept.
At the request of the family
Regarding the option of justification to be left out of the elections, Rita Santos indicated that she departed from “a request from family members” to “spend more time with them”, mainly due to “her grandson” and the 10 brothers who complain the distance the most. "Respecting my family's desire, I will not participate in this year's Legislative Assembly elections," he said. "But, I promise to continue to support Deputy José Pereira Coutinho and also support the Public Service Workers Association and personally meet the partners. I hope you accept and respect my decision," he added.
Rita Santos's participation in the legislative elections had been announced for the first time in mid -2024, at the headquarters of the Macao Public Function Association, when a visit to Macao de José Cesário, then secretary of state for the Portuguese communities.
Chestless chest
Regarding the New Hope list, Coutinho will be the first candidate, followed by Chan Hao Weng. Deputy Che Sa Wang was relegated to third place after being elected in 2021, when he was number two. About these changes, Coutinho indicated that Che was unable to follow the “pedaling” of legislative work. "The position of deputy is demanding. You have to intervene, you have to work, you have to handle the bills. Not everyone can keep up with the pedaling," said the legislator about the bench colleague. "My colleague is excellent co -worker, but has not been able to follow the pedaling. This is like the marathon, it is necessary to have dedication, because the projects are increasingly, complex and one person has to be prepared," he noticed.
The candidate was present for a few moments in the presentation of the list, but left early. According to Coutinho, the early departure was due to a trip to Hong Kong.
In addition to the three nominated candidates, the list is also made up of Chan Ka Wai, Melina Tam Leng I, Jose Miguel de Sales da Silva, Fong Im Ha, Chang Fong, Fok Chao Iu, Hung Oi Ming and Ho Sio Peng.</description><pubDate>2025-06-26 01:01:19</pubDate></item><item><title>Big Bay | Sam Hou Fai ends in Foshan</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/26/grande-baia-sam-hou-fai-termina-periplo-em-foshan/</link><description>The chief executive returned to Macao on Tuesday night after a three-day trap for cities in the Great Bay. In the last stop, in Foshan, Sam Hou Fai suggested articulation between Foshan's Traditional Chinese Medicine Industry and Macao universities, as well as cooperation in the so -called “silver economy”
 
The government leader returned to Macau on Tuesday night after a three-day visit to the Great Bay cities, which culminated in Foshan, a neighboring city of the province capital, where he met with the Secretary of the Communist Party of China (CCP) Municipal Committee, Tang Yifeng.
Sam Hou Fai stressed the advantages of combining Foshan's “traditional Chinese Medicine Industry, in articulation“ with the qualified staff of Macao Higher Education Institutions and the skills in scientific research ”. This level of cooperation can“ further increase the nuclear competitiveness of the respective industries of both territories, ”he said.
Also at the level of care for the elderly, the two cities should establish bridges, in the perspective of the chief executive. "Given the search for the elderly of Macao to pass old age in the interior of China, the advantages of integrated services of elderly care with the health care of Foshan can be enhanced." The similarities of customs and cultural affinity between the two cities were also trumpians listed by the ruler to promote the “silver economy”.
Foshan's “strong manufacturing industry” is another factor that Sam Hou Fai would like to take advantage, both at the level of industry-university-coating cooperation, combining Chinese city companies to Macao universities, and taking advantage of the role of platform from MSAR to promote Foshan products in Portuguese-speaking countries.
Seven stars
Prior to visiting Foshan, the chief executive passed the city plus the west of those who are part of the Great Bay project: Zhaoqing. There, Sam Hou Fai thanked the political leaders “the long -term protection commitment to the quality of the Xijiang river water, effectively ensuring drinking water safety for the population of Macao”.
The leader of the Government of MSA also highlighted the role of Zhaoqing while the "only" city-car "of the Great Bay that connects the Southwest regions and also one of the important links to boost the exchange of Chinese and West cultures. It should be noted that Zhaoqing borders Guangxi province.
Sam Hou Fai said that the city has a "rich cultural tradition" linked to traditional Chinese medicine, which Macao could help reach European Union markets and Lusophone countries.
Zhaoqing's ecological and natural heritage was another aspect highlighted by the Chief Executive as an opportunity to form a “advantage synergy and jointly develop 'premium' routes of 'a trip with various destinations'”.</description><pubDate>2025-06-26 00:52:20</pubDate></item><item><title>China-Portuguese | Chengdu Pavilion shows Portuguese products</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/26/china-portugal-pavilhao-em-chengdu-mostra-produtos-portugueses/</link><description>In the Euro-Asia National Commodity Pavillion venture in Chengdu, pavilions for foreign countries and entrepreneurs who want to establish business in China are installed. Portugal is also there, represented by the Portugal Pavilion, but according to manager Ângelo Sousa, there is a lack of support from the Portuguese government and strength to combat competition
 
“For us there are no barriers between Portugal and China. We are 365 days here and there.” This is the way the objectives of the team that is behind the Portugal Pavilion present at the Euro-Asia National Commodity Pavillion are presented in Chengdu and which is managed by two partners: Yinhui Tui and Ângelo Freitas de Sousa.
The two realized that the Shanghai zone had reached a saturation point in the trade of products and that it was necessary to go more to the interior of the country to try to sell things as Portuguese as wine, cod or olive oil.
HM talked to Yinhui Tui about this project on the sidelines of a lunch in Lisbon by the Friends of the New Seda Route Association, chaired by Fernanda Ilhéu. The event served precisely for Yinhui Tui to present the objectives of the Portugal Pavilion and try to capture business interests.
“This is a very important market for Portuguese products. In China we have separated the country [in commercial terms] in four markets. We have the region of Beijing and Shanghai, which we call 'Yangtze River Economic Zone', and 'Pearl River Economic Zone'. The fourth zone is composed by the cities of Chengdu and Chongqing and which is a new economic area established in 2020. Portuguese have a lot of potential in these markets, ”he said.
The businessman recalls that the marketing of Portuguese products is still below what is done by French, Spanish or other countries, but when the Chinese buyer discovers wine or olive oil, he is surprised.
"In Shanghai, for example, some customers already have their opinion on French or Australians. But many think that Portuguese products have more quality," said Yinhui Tui, noting that in the area where the Portugal Pavilion operates in Sichuan province, "people are a little more conservative and prefer to try, prove and feel before buying."
"Our pavilion is next to the French pavilion and we often see customers to opt for French wine. But when they go through our pavilion, they see our brands and ask what we have. When they realize that we have cheaper wine compared to French, they are surprised and say it is better, and then buy."
This responsible explains that the population in the fourth economic zone is 130 million people, much more than the number of people living in the Iberian Peninsula. "Then I think it's a market with a lot of potential," he said.
The Role of Lusosino
Yinhui Tui and Ângelo Freitas de Sousa created Lusosino that it acts as the managing entity of the pavilion, which was born “with the intention of promoting Portuguese products in the Great Market of China”. Thus, there is a “showroom” of very Portuguese products, representing some brands known as is the case of Vieira crackers, Esporão wine, Sal Marnoto, the Prisca jams or Vista Alegre, among others. It is in this pavilion that "exhibitors display the best products, buyers discover trends and where they both find the conditions to realize business." Moreover, Lusosino, through this pavilion, helps Portuguese entrepreneurs in marketing campaigns and in the best way to contact potential Chinese customers.
Specifically, Lusosino promises to perform “producer and brands records, commercial representation, market analysis, market support and preparation, among other services”, reads on the website.
However, and according to Ângelo Freitas de Sousa to HM, there are many obstacles to putting Portuguese products in China. “[The Chengdu and Chongqing zone] has the advantage of being a growing market that is not overloaded with exporters and has no addictions as happens in the Shanghai zone. It is a very large market and where there are many producers.” By addictions, the entrepreneur refers to “competition” from other countries and buying habits of Chinese customers, who are faster looking for products from other nationalities than from Portugal. "There are habits of certain brands that are implemented and people don't even look at others or experience them."
The Portuguese Pavilion project began with an idea of ​​Ângelo Ferreira de Sousa, who has a Chinese wife who helps him in the business. “I met Yinhui Tui, he liked Portuguese products, we got friends and then we ended up gathering energy,” he said, explaining that the interior of the country is still knowing foreign products, not just Portuguese.
"The Shanghai zone has nowhere to grow and this is a growing economic zone. There are many factories that are moving to Chengdu, so there will be more development," he said.
Absence of marketing
The Portuguese entrepreneur regrets that the Portuguese authorities have given little support to the project, except for any follow -up by AICEP - Agency for Investment and Foreign Trade of Portugal.
"All the investment was made by us and we have not had a lot of support. We had some help from AICEP, but nothing special. We do fairs, the showrooms, to prove and know our products in major cities," said Angelo Ferreira de Sousa.
The entrepreneur also regrets that, despite the relationship of hundreds of years between Portugal and China, there is still flaws in the commercial strategy for the export of Portuguese products in the country. "The Spaniards are much further ahead than us," he said.
Regarding the role of Macao as a platform, the entrepreneur says it is equally difficult to bring products from Portugal to China or Macau to China, due to lack of customs agreements and little flexibility.
"It is not because we call Macau that I can, for example, putting sausages, cod or preserves in China, or other Portuguese products. To pass from Portugal to Macau is easy, but it is no longer so easy to take after Portuguese products from Macau to China. We have not been able to do much through Macau, but we have not sought much," he said.
At the presentation in Lisbon, Yinhui Tui advanced some figures behind the construction of the Euro-Asia National Commodity Pavillion, and help to understand their size: about 70 billion euros of investment and a space of 300,000 cubic meters. The Portugal Pavilion does not only do contact sessions or fairs: if a businessman wants to leave tons of products there, he can do so. Then the pavilion is in charge of distribution through several areas of China. “In the southern market, closer to Macao, there is a lot of competition in some areas, so it should be betting inside China,” said Yinhui Tui, referring to the potential and factor novelty that exists in some areas of the country regarding commerce.</description><pubDate>2025-06-26 00:50:24</pubDate></item><item><title>Iran | Approved suspension of cooperation with the AIEA</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/26/irao-aprovada-suspensao-da-cooperacao-com-a-aiea/</link><description>The Iranian Parliament yesterday voted to suspend cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency following 12-day war marked by Israeli and Americans attacks against Iran's nuclear facilities.

“We have to transform Macao International Airport, in fact with direct air routes to Europe, namely to Portugal,” Coutinho said after the presentation of the political program of the Nova Esperança list to the local parliament.
The jurist said the largest long -haul aircraft in the world can land in Macao, but a lack of space to park aircraft, a problem that said he expected to be solved by expanding the infrastructure.
The expansion of the airport, launched in November, involves the construction of a landfill with more than 129 hectares and is expected to be over in 2030, increasing the capacity of 9.6 million to 13 million passengers per year.
"We hope that in the future it is not necessary to move to Hong Kong to take an international flight to Europe or America and we can start the trip in Macao which is our home," said Coutinho. Macao airport currently has regular passenger flights operated by 27 airlines to 41 destinations in mainland China, Taiwan, Southeast Asia, Japan and South Korea.
Criticized cuts
On the other hand, Coutinho criticized local government's decision to restrict financial aids given annually to people with resident status to those who in 2024 resided in the region at least 183 days.
The measure provides for exceptions, including for those living in nine cities of mainland China integrated in the Great Guandong-Hong Kong-Macau Bay project and those studying at universities abroad. But Coutinho warned that the exceptions did not eliminate all injustices, namely cases of retired people living in Portugal.
The deputy gave the example of a former Portuguese soldier, “almost 90 years old”, who worked for 40 years as a police in Macao, but has no right to financial aid for going to live with his daughter in Portugal after being widowed. "Do you think it is fair?" Coutinho asked the journalists.
The Nova Esperança political program also advocates "a deeper realization" of the role of Macao as a cooperation platform with Portuguese -speaking countries, "with the greater participation of the population and entrepreneurs."
The new hope was one of eight candidacies validated by the Electoral Affairs Commission of the Legislative Assembly (Caeal). Four years ago, there were 19 lists of candidates for the Legislative Assembly, although five lists and 21 candidates -15 of which pro -democracy -were then excluded for "not defending the basic law" and not being "faithful to masters".</description><pubDate>2025-06-26 01:31:24</pubDate></item><item><title>SMG | Sign 1 of storm</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/26/smg-sinal-1-de-tempestade-icado/</link><description>The Meteorological and Geophysical Services (SMG) issued yesterday at 4:30 pm Sign 1 of Tropical Storm due to a low pressure area in the northern part of the Southern Sea of ​​China that intensified to a tropical depression, but pointed out that the possibility of raising the alert to signal 3 was “relatively low”.

June 2025
Much has been written about Luís Vaz de Camões in his fifth centenary, celebrated over the past two years, given the question mark, subscribing to the exact date of his birth, 1524, 1525 or always Renaiscent? It is in the perpetual movement of its eternal Renaissance that this article fits, this time in the search for biography recreated from contemporary poets, read swimming and created in the twentieth and twentieth centuries, which were passed, passed or just stayed overnight in dreams in Macao. Some of them identified with the national poet, others dialogued, distanced themselves or simply silenced him.
Dialogues
Among those who dialogue with Camões, is Cecilia Jorge1, who in the work dedicated to writer João Aguiar, with the preface by Professor Vera Borges, meditates and recreates the identity of Macaense, presenting the valuable perspective of the daughter of the earth, in which it seeks to provide a realistic look at what is “being macanese”, deconstructing myths. Already the Portuguese ancestor is presented in its less romanticized version, in the poem “mestizaje”, such as “Corsican, Reinol, Adventurer”, in the wake of the cultural tradition of Fernão Mendes Pinto. Therefore, it is natural that Camões arise not in the solar space of praise and more of dialogue, in the shadow of the demystification of a very expensive idea to a certain macanese and Portuguese intellectuality, that of “Lusitanity”, which dates culturally to the epic poem Os Lusíadas and their wonderful heroes to contrace it with illustrious divades of the Greco-Latin world. In “Making Read…” (without forgetting the reticence), says the poetic self in the last block of the poem:
Lusitanity clay feet
loose candle caravels
ripping
on the return to the homeland
(Jorge, 2021, 33)
Still it is the figure of Camões who gives strength to the poem, even with a “lusitanity of clay feet”, for, in a possible reading, while the caravels (or ships) remain in the sea, there is a destination to fulfill, with “flesh and bone” feet, or rather, with full feet; The problematic space seems to arise when the return that removes the adventurers from their predestined maritime adventure.
The Camonian ideas are discussed, perhaps, to the best defend.
António Duarte Mil-Homens2 will be a Portuguese poet, this time in open dialogue with Camões in his work poemography, in the poem, untitled, started by the verse “There is a cave”:
There is a cave
In my chest
And it's not Camões.
Stanzas of suffering,
Karma from other lives,
Eco docts poems,
Involves Darkeys.
Praying many coming,
Tear of many trips,
Headquarters of the same source,
Failure of other passions.
(MIL-HOMENS, 2019, 16)
There is a clear existential identification of the Poetic Mil-Homens self with the 16th century poet, although the cave is not the same, because they are not the same meat, however, identical the poetic space in which they live, one and the other, fed by a constant movement between here and there, in which they imagine both to stop drinking to the inspiring source and feeder.
Myths and images
Camões is an inexhaustible source of myths, not only for his existential path, but also for the poetic epic around which he developed, from his death to our day, a national image that contributed to the creation of a collective imagination and a Portuguese philosophy around national heroes, the Lusitans and the Lusitanity. The illustrious descendants of Lusitanians are a people of adventurers and poets, all people linked to the sea, where they will seek their greatest inspiration. Thus we are presented and seen by the descendants lenses, which extend from Portugal to the East, naturally passing through Brazil. Read the verses of Ricardo Portugal's “TAPROBAN BLues” in passages, with which many Portuguese instinctively identify, sympathize or, even when they distance, are not able to remain indifferent:
Round World The Father's Name
That sounds to Camões, short and thick
(…)
Every sailor seeks the port,
Every poet is a sailor.
Portuguese Ocean Sea
that the port opens by the crests
from another written sea,
badly sacred by the thread of poetry,
text of other texts, a country,
Dead Sea without Bible.
All Portuguese is poorly born,
The whole poet is Portuguese.
(Portugal, 2004, 55)
The romantic appeal of the sea is stronger in these verses that cross sailors and poets, connecting the sea indissolibly to Portugal, “Portuguese the Ocean Sea”, as another larger poet, Fernando Pessoa4, had already told him in “Portuguese Sea”, shed in salt, so much tear from Portugal:
O Salgado Sea, how much of your salt
They are tears of Portugal!
For crossing you, how many mothers cried,
How many children in vain prayed!
How many brides were getting married
So you were ours, O sea!
(PERSON, 1986, 86)
Of course, “it was worth it, even for the myths it has been cherishing on this Portuguese soul, recreated literary to the present.
The sea of ​​poets, or perhaps the sea inspired by the national poet, but also that of love spirits, where once again Camões appears in a place. This will be brought here by António Manuel Couto Viana5 in the book to the distant China navigated… In the long drama in verse “Camões and Dinamene, argument for a ballet”, in which the sad wreck of Camões and his love story with “Dinamene” 6 is narrated. Couto Viana Nothing Nething, not even the poetic verses of the national poet, which introduces into the "poetic argument." To retain the explicit reference to Os Lusíadas, which imbr while in the plot, in order to explain that the beloved of Camões passed away, but fate had other accounts for him:
The poet will finish the corner.
If it does not end, Portugal is mute.
And God wants this homeland to be
The word of the world. And the Lusíadas
They are the source and root of that word.
(VIANA, 1991,84)
Certain images can be discussed by some intellectuals, but will be forever linked to Macao, such as Camões has been in the territory, being closely related to a homonymous garden, in which it appears a bust of yours and the first, second and third resorts of Canto I of the Lusíadas recorded in the pedestal.
António Bondoso7 in the work in Macau Porsa (1999) dedicates the poem “Garden of Camões”, contributing, with so many other poets, including those cited in this text, to consolidate the connection of the cultural image of the national poet to Macau, in a poem of accurate simplicity:
No jardim há flores
and stones with history.
And the shadow of the poet's bust
cut in the slab
weather
eternalizes centuries of words!
(Bondeoso, 1999, 41)
Camões in China and, specifically, his stone address in Macao are still sung by José Augusto Seabra in “Da Gruta”, José Valle de Figueiredo “in the Cave of Camões”, or Josué da Silva8 in “Camões to the Sad orient”, this brings the last stanza:
Finally here I find insignated rod
in this cave so sad and so dark,
Trying in her hauir all the passion
that forces this cold stone,
SEE HEAR THE HEART OF A HEART
that made Portugal, the soul of poetry.
(Kelen and Han, 2009, 305)
Myths and dialogues, separately, or myths and dialogues included, the truth is that even today the Portuguese, wandering and migrants, with more or less built-in Portuguese, drags sadness, sharing it with Camões, some well counterfeit, due to the hope of better and greatest destination, the one that can only be found in the “soul of poetry”, with Josué Silva with the Portuguese language ” Person/Bernardo Soares.

Taking the idea of ​​grammar that names the book, what are the main terms or concepts around Coloane, its tradition and preservation that can enumerate?
The “grammar” of the book introduces the concept of vernacular architecture, which reflects the knowledge of the informal, local construction and the maritime identity of this Coloane community. It addresses the assets at risk, proposing a method of cataloging existing houses, this digital method, which establishes a dialogue between tradition and modernity to preserve this cultural landscape.
What concrete proposals are suggested in the book for the protection and preservation of Coloane's stilts?
The book proposes (indirectly) the classification of stilts as a heritage to give them legal protection. By cataloging existing stilts, the book contributes to preserving the memory of this type of architecture and a broader discussion about its possible protection.
How could we reuse the stilts taking into account these specific ways of life and the economic diversification that the government wants to achieve?
The stilts could be reused for experience tourism, or centers of cultural interpretation, valuing local history. They can be transformed into creative and artistic spaces or in fact propose new wood buildings along the water line, with various uses and that can generate value to the Coloane community, contributing to Macao's cultural and economic diversification.
Why approach Coloane and the stilts? How did this project come about?
Coloane and the stilts were approached by their architectural and cultural uniqueness, representing a threatened memory and identity of Macao. This assets at risk has a significant potential. The project also emerged from the gap of scientific knowledge about these structures and the urgent need for documentation, consolidating itself as an academic-scientific investigation.
In the Asian or Southeast Asian context, are the coloane stilts or not unique in architectural terms?
Water constructions are common in various Asian countries, Coloane's stilts are not a unique case in terms of existence. See the example, in Hong Kong, of the well-known Tai o village, but are unique in their specific context. Its architecture is the reflection of local regional influences and materials, adapted to the history of the evolution of Colona's fishing community and the development of Macao. Its value lies in its particular architectural language and its persistence in a rapidly transformed urban environment.
What is the story behind the emergence of stilts? Are you associated with Coloane piracy reports, for example, which refer to the early twentieth century?
The stilts emerged as a practical and functional solution to the sea -related way of life, allowing sea access, tidal protection and efficient use of space in coastal areas. Piracy reports in Coloane were not the direct cause of their emergence. Shapes are essentially the response of an informal architecture of local communities to adapt to the maritime environment.
Museum Idea on Coloane Stop Stand since 2017
The need for preservation of coloane stilts is not a recent idea. Between 2017 and 2018, the Directorate of Tourism Services proposed the creation of a museum entirely dedicated to the stories of these dwellings arranged in Rua dos Navegantes, but the project was being postponed for legal reasons.
In 2018, the Tribuna de Macao newspaper (JTM) published an article where it referred precisely the absence of “legal foundations” for the construction of new infrastructure in the Maritime area of ​​Macao, something that has changed, however, given that the MSAR passed, from 2018, to include in its jurisdiction the management of 85 square kilometers of maritime zones.
Last year alone, the executive's plans for the creation of a “functional maritime zoning”, “maritime areas” and other related laws, and a concrete decision on what will be made on what will be made on the stilts. Both zoning and plan will be defined for a temporal period by 2040.
One of the objectives of the executive is environmental and ecological preservation, as well as certain experiences of the population. One of the points of the public consultation report speaks of “optimizing ocean exploration modalities according to Macau's development needs; coordinating the use of sea in production, daily life of the population and ecology” and performing “intensive and economizers uses to realize the rational allocation of maritime resources”.
In 2018, according to the JTM, STD assured that it would be necessary to “wait for the publication of the maritime area and administrative regulation on the administration of the use of maritime zones” and only then could you think of the planning of the museum. HM questioned STD of this article, and until the closing of this edition, obtained new clarifications.
A gradual development
In a master's dissertation in architecture, defended in 2023 at the University of Coimbra, Ana Rita Rodrigues made the study of the “Evolution of Macao Territory-Aterros and Urban Design in the Taipa and Coloane islands”, and concluded that “Portuguese occupation in the islands of Taipa and Coloane brought improvements in infrastructure, safety and village organization”. In the late nineteenth century, "there were already, in the islands, schools, hospitals and basic infrastructure, promoting the economic growth of the region."
Referring to the existence of stilts “used for the construction of fishing and housing boats for fishermen, naturally facing the river”, in a coloane zone composed “by precarious housing of one or two floors, unlike the type of common housing found in mud or macao, which was more focused on high development”.
The author also points out that “development was slower” in Coloane, as well as the absence, on both islands, of “a unified general plan and the need for better urban planning to ensure a cohesive and sustainable environment”.</description><pubDate>2025-06-24 23:53:24</pubDate></item><item><title>Teaching | I was entering local schools, but resources are scarce</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/23/ensino-ia-entrou-nas-escolas-locais-mas-recursos-sao-escassos/</link><description>The government has been betting on the introduction of artificial intelligence in territory schools, but with a few hours in the curriculum. In addition, schools complain of few resources to meet government goals
 
Macao schools have integrated artificial intelligence tools (AI) in classrooms, such as smart paintings and linguistic models, but some teachers warn that most are not prepared to comply with outlined policy for the sector.
After classes, students at Pui Va Secondary School remain in the classroom, distracted to explore a smart condition. These staff - explains Ruan Zhan Teng, school teacher at the school - act as interactive projectors and are used as soon as the first year, to write, watch videos or participate in classes with digital media.
"In the third year, students begin to learn to identify artificial intelligence in everyday life, basic programming and photos and videos generated by AI," the computer teacher added to Lusa.
The change took place in 2024 and is stipulated in the law: AI should be included in primary education (with a workload of 17 hours and 20 minutes per year), from 7th to 9th grade (19 hours and 20 minutes) and from 10th to 12th (18 hours and 40 minutes).
Despite the requirement, Andy Chun Wai Fan, professor and director of the University of Macao Information and Communication Center in Education, Note that schools face two obstacles: lack of resources and faculty formation.
“Some schools have only one information technology teacher,” said Fan, also referring that institutions generally have computer classes only once a week.
Do not update
Pedro Lobo, a teacher in this area, with 30 years of experience in the territory, including at the Portuguese School of Macau, is concerned about the lack of training. "Most teachers are already a certain age, they have not grown with this new technology ... So the mindset is still short of all this evolution, and change is being so fast that it can hardly follow," explained the Portuguese.
Education authorities require teachers 30 hours of annual IA training, however, Pedro Lobo considers not sufficient. Although this year has already studied almost 40 hours, the teacher says he is "little prepared".
Regarding this government policy, Andy Chun Wai Fan also remembers that it is required to schools that address ethics, innovation and collaboration in the domain of AI, although it fits the institutions the creation of the manuals themselves. “We do not have a manual about what to teach (…), each school has its own ideas about what to do with its students,” wolf reacted, explaining that he teaches “transferring AI to school work”, either through image generation, small game development, AI ethics approach and copyright issues.
Since 2021 at PUI VA
In a different record, the Pui Va Secondary School, which introduced AI in 2021, assumes to be “well prepared” to “the change”. The institution spends about two million patacas a year on AI tools, employs seven information technology teachers (IT) and hired a university professor in Beijing to support. “We want students to be able to use artificial intelligence to identify problems and solve real -life problems,” noticed the IT Office Director of Chinese educational establishment, Chong Wai Yin.
Here, students work, for example, with programming languages ​​(Python, Tencent, Iflytek), and AI models such as Deepseek and ChatgPT, engaging in intelligent city projects, in the first cycle, and in the creation of applications, at a later stage, said Zhao Qihao, former professor at the University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, who taught in Puija VA.
“In the first cycle, we developed smart cities, automated houses and AI -powered parking systems (…). In the second cycle, students create mobile applications and sustainable technological projects,” he explained.
In April, the Secretary for Social Affairs and Culture, LAM, announced that Macao's educational reforms for 2025 will focus on AI and include plans for an intelligent classroom in all schools.
The Government of Macao attributed to the school network under the direction of the Directorate of Youth Education and Development Services (DSEDJ) 15 million PATACA for AI software for this academic year.
In an email sent to Lusa, DSEDJ stated that the government “attributes great importance” to the teaching of information technologies. "The medium and long term plan for non-higher education (2021-2030) identified 'reinforcement of creativity and technological education' as one of the main directions of development," he explains in the note.
However, Pedro Lobo questions the pressure on young students: "Are we seeing children 8, 9, 10 years old to develop applications? Maybe 1 percent is capable. The rest does the best they can. They have classes and homework that never end."
Concerned deputies
In the last debate of the Legislative Assembly, last Thursday, two deputies, Iau Teng Pio and Kou Kam Fai, linked to education, defended the need for “high quality development of education in Macao”, namely with the bet on AI.
One of the suggestions, referred to during the interventions before the order of day, was the reinforcement of the “coordinated development mechanism between education, scientific and technological innovation and talents”, with the increase of “Stem resources [science, technology, engineering and mathematics] and artificial intelligence on basic education, rooting the basis of scientific literacy”.
In the debate on the 11th of this month, deputy Ma Io Fong appealed to the AI ​​regulation to avoid scams, but also to increase the awareness of society in relation to this new reality.
“With the rapid development of technology these days, the use of AI functions is gradually becoming important help for society and residents in daily life and work. However, AI can give rise to illicit acts, especially the worsening cyber attacks and the diffusion of false information.”
Also during the interventions before the agenda, the deputy asked the executive to “reinforce sensitization and education on the prevention of AI fraud, to raise the elderly and young people, emphasizing that the dissemination of false videos generated by AI can be a legal offense with serious consequences”.
In this context, the systematic integration of “AI safety knowledge in school curricula and the realization of different awareness and education activities with community associations was requested to increase public knowledge about AI technology and the risk derived for its abuse”.
"It is also due, through cooperation between the government, society, schools and the family, to reinforce the ability to respond to information and the internet discourse, allowing to react, clarify and follow up on useful time, when the public faces information that can cause negative influences or be misleading," said Ma Io Fong in the 11th debate.</description><pubDate>2025-06-23 23:45:47</pubDate></item><item><title>History | The MA-chan escape to the colonial and macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/23/historia-a-fuga-dos-ma-chan-para-o-portugal-colonial-e-para-macau/</link><description>The MA-chan family is from Mozambique with Chinese roots, sought its new path in the then colonial Portugal and since 1976 that set roots in Macao. José Manuel Machon, resident in the territory since he was 13, told Lusa the very peculiar trajectory of his family, which reflects many of the family directions taken in the years of war and the end of the Portuguese colonial empire
 
The MA-chan, the Mozambican family with roots in China, fled twice to communism and twice resumed in colonial Portugal. In 1976, they landed in Macao, where Mozambique's memory had erased with the departure of the Landins, African troops that parked in the territory for decades since 1912.
According to a report by Luís Andrade de Sá published in Macau magazine in 1992, and quoted by the blog "Chronicles Macanese", the Landins were in Macao "for about five decades", and "the Chinese never used to their conviviality, suspiciously who had the huge blacks who played a horrible drumsticks while returning the ostensiva. ferocity ”. The term Landim became a reference “to identify all indigenous battalions that passed by Macau”, is described in the same report.
Massá Ma-chan went in 1963 to the Namphlam, northern Mozambique Conservatory to register the fifth son, but once again denied this Chinese, with roots in Guangzhou, the transmission of the nickname to descent. José Manuel was the same as his brothers: the nickname Machon, corruption of MA-chan.
The identity of José Manuel Machon, embryoly marked by this bureaucratic detail imposed by the then Portuguese Mozambique, is not only a reflection of the colonial past of Portugal, but from the beginnings of Sino-Mozambican relations.
“I don't have great confusion, I tried to adapt to life,” he tells Lusa in Macau, where he has lived since he was 13. The grandfather-also MA-chan-was the one who defined that this story began in Africa, leaving China looking for better life, in the starter of the twentieth century, and settling in Nampula, alongside Sharing, a Macua woman, Mozambican ethnic group.
Massá, the son -and father of José Manuel -was sent to Guangzhou at 14, to receive formal education there. When he returns to Mozambique, he is a married man with a bullet mark near his left shoulder.
In China, he faced the Japanese in World War II and married a Chinese, which he met on the day of marriage, until, on the threshold of the civil war, which would victory to Mao Zedong's communists, fled. He dedicated himself to Nampula to the cucumber of the cucumber-the 'Magojojo'-and the tubar bit, which he exported to Hong Kong.
The Great Return
However, unable to adapt, the woman returned to Macao with her four children, where she died. Massá returned to marry, this time with a Mozambican - José Manuel came first, Carla later.
When the Frelimo flag raised on the mast in Mozambique on June 25, 1975, the MA-chan-headed Macao, with a brief passage in Portugal, where they inhabited a pension paid by the then IARN.
“We are nothing returned, because we have not returned anywhere, we are refugees,” says Carla Machon, residing in Portugal.
“When my father heard again about communism, he fled,” says his brother, José Manuel. While speaking, bowling balls pack on the floor and travel the track to a new crash. The noise in the center of Bowling Future Bright does not seem to bother this big man, 61, fluent in Cantonese and Portuguese and president of Macao Bowling Club. “This is what keeps me stable. Instead of going to the glasses, I come here,” he notes.
For Joseph, independence "it was an open openness, an opening to the world." It doesn't even talk about political reasons, but how important it was to cross half a world until you arrived in Macau.
A new life
In this page turn, the MA-chan/maachon family came to find, in 1976, a city with little civil presence abroad. José and Carla do not remember other Mozambicans, who began to arrive after independence, many from Portugal.
Mong-Há's fortress is an old witness to Mozambique's presence in Macau. Then the Landins, Mozambican soldiers at the service of the Colonial Army were quartered, recalls journalist João Guedes, a scholar in the history of Macao. It is this historical circumstance that baptized the hill of Mong-há of “Mountain of Black Ghosts”.
These troops, with the “greatest warrior instinct”, in the expression of Emperor Gungunhana, remained in Macao half a century, until around the 1960s. They were responsible, for example, by the storage of the siege gates, border of the territory with China and recurring incident place.
“They passed by and faded as if they had never been,” resumes Guedes, indicating that there was no material heritage attesting this military presence. Not far from Mong-Há, but at the Riquexó restaurant, troops are still there, eternalized in photos hanging on the walls.
This serves African chicken, macanese dish, whose origin is still today the target of debate. Two theories: It was created by the Portuguese chief Américo Ângelo, inspired by a trip to Mozambique. Another version realizes that, seeing the African soldiers missing roasted chicken, Americo made the dish.
And the memory of macau-moca-mandamous relationships is not complete without evoking the trafficking in leaf. If, on the one hand, it is known that the Portuguese took slaves from the African colonies by settling in the doors of China, in reverse, were also sent via Macao, Chinese to work in Mozambique, often in slavery conditions.
The sons were part of a migratory movement from the late nineteenth century, “to develop the Mozambican colony,” explains the professor at Joaquim Chissano University in Maputo, Fatima Papelo, who investigates Sino-Mozambican cooperation. The first group, he says, was sent in 1858 and "consisted of 30 men."
More than a century later, in the struggle for Mozambican independence, Beijing supported the Liberation Front of Mozambique (Frelimo) and is one of the first countries to recognize the new sovereign state. In Macao, the reinforcement of the ties was later paid, with the transition from the territory of Portugal to China in 1999.
But for José Manuel, Mozambique was always present. The last time it went, tells, visited and cleaned the family campaign, "there at Machamba". "It's a Chinese custom," he explained.</description><pubDate>2025-06-23 02:46:38</pubDate></item><item><title>China-Portuguese | Chengdu Pavilion shows Portuguese products</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/26/china-portugal-pavilhao-em-chengdu-mostra-produtos-portugueses/</link><description>In the Euro-Asia National Commodity Pavillion venture in Chengdu, pavilions for foreign countries and entrepreneurs who want to establish business in China are installed. Portugal is also there, represented by the Portugal Pavilion, but according to manager Ângelo Sousa, there is a lack of support from the Portuguese government and strength to combat competition
 
“For us there are no barriers between Portugal and China. We are 365 days here and there.” This is the way the objectives of the team that is behind the Portugal Pavilion present at the Euro-Asia National Commodity Pavillion are presented in Chengdu and which is managed by two partners: Yinhui Tui and Ângelo Freitas de Sousa.
The two realized that the Shanghai zone had reached a saturation point in the trade of products and that it was necessary to go more to the interior of the country to try to sell things as Portuguese as wine, cod or olive oil.
HM talked to Yinhui Tui about this project on the sidelines of a lunch in Lisbon by the Friends of the New Seda Route Association, chaired by Fernanda Ilhéu. The event served precisely for Yinhui Tui to present the objectives of the Portugal Pavilion and try to capture business interests.
“This is a very important market for Portuguese products. In China we have separated the country [in commercial terms] in four markets. We have the region of Beijing and Shanghai, which we call 'Yangtze River Economic Zone', and 'Pearl River Economic Zone'. The fourth zone is composed by the cities of Chengdu and Chongqing and which is a new economic area established in 2020. Portuguese have a lot of potential in these markets, ”he said.
The businessman recalls that the marketing of Portuguese products is still below what is done by French, Spanish or other countries, but when the Chinese buyer discovers wine or olive oil, he is surprised.
"In Shanghai, for example, some customers already have their opinion on French or Australians. But many think that Portuguese products have more quality," said Yinhui Tui, noting that in the area where the Portugal Pavilion operates in Sichuan province, "people are a little more conservative and prefer to try, prove and feel before buying."
"Our pavilion is next to the French pavilion and we often see customers to opt for French wine. But when they go through our pavilion, they see our brands and ask what we have. When they realize that we have cheaper wine compared to French, they are surprised and say it is better, and then buy."
This responsible explains that the population in the fourth economic zone is 130 million people, much more than the number of people living in the Iberian Peninsula. "Then I think it's a market with a lot of potential," he said.
The Role of Lusosino
Yinhui Tui and Ângelo Freitas de Sousa created Lusosino that it acts as the managing entity of the pavilion, which was born “with the intention of promoting Portuguese products in the Great Market of China”. Thus, there is a “showroom” of very Portuguese products, representing some brands known as is the case of Vieira crackers, Esporão wine, Sal Marnoto, the Prisca jams or Vista Alegre, among others. It is in this pavilion that "exhibitors display the best products, buyers discover trends and where they both find the conditions to realize business." Moreover, Lusosino, through this pavilion, helps Portuguese entrepreneurs in marketing campaigns and in the best way to contact potential Chinese customers.
Specifically, Lusosino promises to perform “producer and brands records, commercial representation, market analysis, market support and preparation, among other services”, reads on the website.
However, and according to Ângelo Freitas de Sousa to HM, there are many obstacles to putting Portuguese products in China. “[The Chengdu and Chongqing zone] has the advantage of being a growing market that is not overloaded with exporters and has no addictions as happens in the Shanghai zone. It is a very large market and where there are many producers.” By addictions, the entrepreneur refers to “competition” from other countries and buying habits of Chinese customers, who are faster looking for products from other nationalities than from Portugal. "There are habits of certain brands that are implemented and people don't even look at others or experience them."
The Portuguese Pavilion project began with an idea of ​​Ângelo Ferreira de Sousa, who has a Chinese wife who helps him in the business. “I met Yinhui Tui, he liked Portuguese products, we got friends and then we ended up gathering energy,” he said, explaining that the interior of the country is still knowing foreign products, not just Portuguese.
"The Shanghai zone has nowhere to grow and this is a growing economic zone. There are many factories that are moving to Chengdu, so there will be more development," he said.
Absence of marketing
The Portuguese entrepreneur regrets that the Portuguese authorities have given little support to the project, except for any follow -up by AICEP - Agency for Investment and Foreign Trade of Portugal.
"All the investment was made by us and we have not had a lot of support. We had some help from AICEP, but nothing special. We do fairs, the showrooms, to prove and know our products in major cities," said Angelo Ferreira de Sousa.
The entrepreneur also regrets that, despite the relationship of hundreds of years between Portugal and China, there is still flaws in the commercial strategy for the export of Portuguese products in the country. "The Spaniards are much further ahead than us," he said.
Regarding the role of Macao as a platform, the entrepreneur says it is equally difficult to bring products from Portugal to China or Macau to China, due to lack of customs agreements and little flexibility.
"It is not because we call Macau that I can, for example, putting sausages, cod or preserves in China, or other Portuguese products. To pass from Portugal to Macau is easy, but it is no longer so easy to take after Portuguese products from Macau to China. We have not been able to do much through Macau, but we have not sought much," he said.
At the presentation in Lisbon, Yinhui Tui advanced some figures behind the construction of the Euro-Asia National Commodity Pavillion, and help to understand their size: about 70 billion euros of investment and a space of 300,000 cubic meters. The Portugal Pavilion does not only do contact sessions or fairs: if a businessman wants to leave tons of products there, he can do so. Then the pavilion is in charge of distribution through several areas of China. “In the southern market, closer to Macao, there is a lot of competition in some areas, so it should be bet on the interior of China,” said Yinhui Tui, referring to the potential and factor novelty that exists in some areas of the country regarding commerce.</description><pubDate>2025-06-26 00:50:24</pubDate></item><item><title>Elections | “Soldier of Mao” claims innocent and says he was six days unable to take a shower</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/18/eleicoes-soldado-de-mao-afirma-se-inocente-e-diz-que-esteve-seis-dias-sem-conseguir-tomar-banho/</link><description>Accused of electoral corruption and having an illegal Mahjong business, Wong Wai Man yesterday returned to the load to cry out his innocence. The president of the Iron and Steel Shipowners Association says he was “provoked” to climb to the roof where he was a few hours, and was six days without being able to bathe or change clothes
 
The panorama of the legislative elections for the hemicycle already boils. In addition to these elections with the smallest number of candidate lists since the creation of the MSAR, the controversy is installed with the almost candidate Wong Wai Man, who tried to submit his candidacy without success.
Also known as the “Soldier of Mao” and “Captain of Macao”, and after being accused of electoral corruption and having an illegal Mahjong business, behold, Wong Wai Man returned to the cargo to explain: refuses the accusations that he is targeted, says he was persecuted by the authorities and refers to “torture” the way he was treated when his detention.
The president of the Iron and Steel Association was on Monday, several hours on a roof of a house made with a metal plate in the mud, having been rescued by the Fire Department. A solution that says it was “provoked” after being detained by the Judiciary Police (PJ), referred to the Public Prosecution Service and receiving the Commissioner's Call against Corruption (CCAC), which accuses him of having the illegal business.
Wong Wai Man explained that, shortly after leaving the CCAC Office in the Nape area, he was intercepted by an employee of this body that alleged the lack of signature in some documents. However, not satisfied with the situation, Wong Wai Man picked up a taxi towards the mud, eventually taking refuge on the roof. "I had no other option, CCAC wanted to chase me to death. So I was on the roof," he explained.
Regarding accusations of electoral corruption, man says he is poor and is unable to commit such illegalities. Regarding Mahjong's alleged illegal business, Wong Wai Man stressed that the Association's headquarters in fact has Mahjong tables, but only for the enjoyment of the partners.
Regarding the use of money in these games, Wong Wai Man said there was always a sign to say that it was forbidden to be bets on money and that there was, at the association's headquarters, a box for donations, but that was intended for voluntary support of the partners to help the association's operation.
This is because, according to this, besides being president is also the only one to support all expenses of the Association of Iron and Steel shipowners, namely those related to income, water and light, considering that since 2014 that the entity has not received subsidies.
One thing is certain: the association's headquarters will close doors tomorrow due to the end of the lease. Wong Wai Man says that for now, he will not look for a new address for the association because, for now, he has a more pressing subject: looking for a place to live. Wong Wai Man made the association's headquarters to his home.
Life lesson
Despite having missed the opportunity to submit a list and be a candidate for elections for the Legislative Assembly by Via Direct, Wong Wai Man argued that the most important thing was to participate in the whole process and learn new things. The "captain of Macao" also said that he is dedicated to society of heart and not by selfishness. Your ideal is to do things justly for society, since it argues that traditional associations do not defend the people.
Wong Wai Man also told journalists a personal episode to justify their participation in social and public causes. "In 2007 my wife was pregnant and the hospitals convinced her to end her pregnancy because the baby's survival rate would be 50 percent, due to the fact that a fetal anomaly was detected after the exams. I insisted and the government eventually paid the operation worth 70 thousand patacas. So I want to make my contribution to repay a favor" to heaven "," he said.
Six days without bathing
According to the All About Macau newspaper, Wong Wai Man reported that he was still six days without bathing and sleeping, having remained a week missing until he performed with CCAC this Monday. Before he did, he said he was a total of six days detained, which for himself was “torture”, and that in total was all this time without bathing, sleeping or changing clothes. On Sunday, you will have been able to go home.
“Last night [Tuesday] I was finally able to sleep well and shower. I was six days without being able to bathe or change my clothes,” he explained. The climb to the roof of the house in the mud was also a form of protest by the way it was treated, he said.
The detention took place at dawn last Wednesday, the 11th, between 3 am and 4 am, with the argument that Wong Wai Man would maintain an illegal Mahjong business. It was then that he was detained for 48 hours in a squad in the mud, and was then transferred to the Public Prosecution Service (MP) to continue to make statements.
After this process, he was notified to present himself with CCAC, having signed the requested documents. He was then arrested again for another 48 hours and transferred again to the MP. When, already on the street, he was again informed that he would have to return to CCAC to sign more documents, decided to escape and take refuge on the roof.</description><pubDate>2025-06-18 23:46:24</pubDate></item><item><title>Breast Cancer | Research of one does “revolutionary discovery”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/18/cancro-da-mama-investigacao-da-um-faz-descoberta-revolucionaria/</link><description>A study by a team led by two professors at the University of Macao seeks answers to combat breast cancer. Academics concluded that cancer cells spread mainly through the lymphatic system, not by the bloodstream
 
“The lymphatic system is the main route for breast cancer dissemination and metastasis, revealed by tracking unique cell lineage” is a scientific article that seeks to increase knowledge that allows you to find solutions to the disease. The work was developed by a research team led by the full professor Chuxia Deng and assistant professor Miao Kai at the University of Macao Faculty of Health Sciences (one) and, according to a note from UM, is a “revolutionary discovery in the study of cancer metastases”.
Thus, and for the first time, “a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the machine cancer metastases was made, and was applied by scientists“ a barcode system based on a unique cell lineage tracking approach ”called Celltag.
With this method, results were obtained that reveal that "cancer cells spread mainly through the lymphatic system, not by the bloodstream." In addition, he points out one, “research also found that interaction between tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment (TME) determines the metastatic potential of cancer cells”, ie whether or not they may easily reproduce.
In this sense, “the study systematically demonstrates the roads of tumor metastases and opens new ways for the development of cancer treatment strategies”, is described.
The article was published in the magazine “Molecular Cancer” and is the result of an investigation by a vast team, consisting of Kai Miao, Aiping Zhang, Xiaodan Yang, Yipeng Zhang, Anqi Lin, Lijian Wang, Xin Zhang, Heng Sun, Jun Xu, Yuzhao Feng, Fangyuan Shao, Sen Guo, Zhihui Weng, Peng Luo, Xiaoling Xu and Ch -xia Deng.
Highlight for the collaboration of scientists from other higher education institutions in the region, such as Aiping Zhang, Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital University, and Jingyao Zhang and Shuai Gao, linked to China Agricultural University in Beijing. In turn, Dong Wang and Xiao-Yang Zhao are linked to Southern Medical University's School of Basic Medical Sciences in Guangzhou.
Microenvironment is an important factor
One explains, in the same statement, that the study in question “provides empirical evidence for route preference in cancer metastasis”, demonstrating that tumor cells are “pre-programmed” with “intrinsic information that determine their metastatic potential”, and these cells “adapt dynamically their genetic expression based on the target organs”.
Thus, "these findings establish the foundations for the development of therapies directed to lymphatic metastasis, such as inhibition of cytokine signaling or interruption of communication between tumor and stroma to suppress metastasis."
In the investigation, the “single cell RNA sequencing technology” was used, which allowed the team to “discover that genetically identical tumor cells exhibit profiles of specific genetic expression of the organ”, so the microenvironment proves to be “fundamental in the formation of tumor cell behavior”.
"For example, pulmonary metastatic cells positively regulate oxidative stress -related genes, while hepatic metastatic cells activate metabolic regulatory pathways," is referred to.
The danger of metastases
One points out that, in cancer diseases, metastases are the main cause of death. However, to date, "the mechanisms that govern the selection of the route" of these same metastases remained "obscure."
“Using Celltag technology, the research team traced the spread of breast cancer cells on mice models,” discovered that “less than 3 percent of cancer cells spread throughout the bloodstream, while more than 80 percent metasta through the lymphatic system for distant organs such as lungs and liver”.
Thus, "further analysis has shown that lymph spread cells have distinct genetic expression patterns and communicate closely with stromal cells, such as endothelial fibroblasts and cells in the microenvironment, forming an adaptive" seed-solo "mechanism."
Looking at the study, the authors explain that cancer metastasis “is a process in which the tumor cells of the primary tumor invade the basal membrane of the blood or lymphatic vessels (intravasation), travel the blood or lymphatic system and colonize distant organs and tissues to continue their development”. Several studies point to the fact that metastases are responsible for 70 to 90 percent of cancer -related mortality, and “the dissemination of tumor cells in the vasculature and lymphatic vessels occurs simultaneously in the vast majority of cancers”.
Blood roads
In the discussion of the results, the study authors say that, in general terms, “tumor cells metastatize mainly through blood circulation and lymphatic system”, and until the publication of this work had been performed “numerous studies to distinguish the role of both systems in the various phases of cancer metastasis”, without knowing “which way’ for metastasis ”.
It is referred to in the article, citing other studies that “cancer cells enter the bloodstream through intravasation to become CTCs [Circulating Tumor Cells-Tumor Cells in circulation], having revealed highly correlated with the survival results of breast cancer patients”.
The authors also explain that “the lymphatic system is considered critical for metastasis” because “melanoma cells with experience in the lymphatic system were more resistant to ironPtosis and formed more metastases”, and in cases of “cancer tumor resection, cancer cells can further disseminate the lymphatic ganglia for blood vessels and form tumors and forming tumors metastatic in the lungs ”.
To date, “although metastatic dissemination was viable by both ways, the relative importance of each process for a certain type of cancer and the target organ was unknown due to the lack of adequate quantitative tools”, something to which this study, using the celltag system, intended to respond.
Thus, "we demonstrate that most lung and liver metastatic cells can be detected in the lymphatic system rather than CTCs [circulation tumor cells] derived from the blood, indicating that the lymphatic vessels can be the favorite way for tumor cell metastasis, at least in breast cancer."
The authors promise not to stop here in the discovery of the course made by the metastasis of carcinogenic cells, having already performed "preliminary tests" with some cells in order to find out the possibility of "drastic" reduction of tumor cells disseminated by lymphatic. "We will continue to work on this to deepen the lymphatic dissemination mechanism and explore therapeutic interruptions in our future efforts," he is mentioned.</description><pubDate>2025-06-18 02:57:22</pubDate></item><item><title>Commerce | CUPPA Coffee manager calls for support to Portuguese companies</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/17/comercio-gestor-do-cuppa-coffee-pede-apoio-a-empresas-portuguesas/</link><description>The story of Cuppa Coffee dates back to 2008 when it was hard to find a space in Macau to drink good coffee. The location in the old mud brought fame to the project, but the space ended up closing doors and moving to Studio City. João Incarnation, who manages coffee, speaks of the news and the importance of supporting Lusophone matrix projects
 
It all started in the mind of Portuguese Cristiana Figueiredo, at a time when for a Portuguese or passionate about coffee living in Macau it was hard to find a space to enjoy this drink accompanied by bakery or pastry products, in good Portuguese way.
Cristiana Figueiredo said, in an interview with the Macao Commerce and Investment Promotion Institute (Ipim), which led her to invest in this type of business. "In Europe, people have a habit to go to coffee and to work for work. When I came to Macau for over 20 years, I realized that the Portuguese coffee culture is not popular in Macao, so I was born the idea of ​​opening a coffee in Macao, hoping to promote the food and culture of Portuguese coffee."
Since 2008, Cuppa Coffee, associated with the initial project of the businesswoman, Nata Bakery, founded in 2007 and focused on bakery and pastry products, has become one of the favorite spaces of the Portuguese, foreign and even resident of the territory. However, the direction of the economic environment, with greater difficulties in paying lace, has dictated some transformations to the project, which now ends doors to the entrance of Taipa Velha and also with Lakes Nam Van, to be only in the Studio City venture in Cotai. The closure in the lakes Nam Van took place in January.
At HM, João Incarnation, director and shareholder of the company that generates Cuppa Coffee, explains that, in fact, the change to the Cotai was decided for a long time. "I often say that there was no change to Studio City, because this was a plan that already existed and that came regardless of the taipa store closure. We would always open this space regardless of whether we continue, or not, with the store in the mud, whose closure was due to a failed negotiation regarding space income."
According to João Incarnation, who today generates the company with Nicole Massa Helm, both considered that "in the current economic situation there was no conditions to continue in that space, which is relatively large and had its costs."
"We needed to contain if we wanted the business to continue to work, because the alternative is always to close completely. We did not give up on the idea of ​​opening anything in the mud and being a little closer to our regular and more faithful customers, so we continue to open another establishment in the mud that can serve customers who live there. So there is no trip to Studio City," João Incarnation.
The director and shareholder understands that this change always causes some nostalgia. “We pity it to have closed it. It cost us, we really have a lot of pity,” he confessed. "It was a decision that could have been made longer, at least a year, but we still tried to keep the establishment there, but we were not possible. We will see what the future reserves us."
Despite these changes, Cuppa Coffee can be considered a successful case. "It worked there for many years and it worked well. This is a business that has to have certain conditions to work because, as we know, it has a lot of movement, but with little performance regarding each client. It is a business that needs many customers to support themselves, and for many years, at the level of rent values ​​and everything else, suppliers, for example, was much cheaper and things worked better," he recalls.
The location in Taipa Velha gave Cuppa Coffee “a very large recognition and clientele”, despite the growing difficulties. "As prices were increasing, we also needed to increase our prices, but never in proportion to the increase in expenses. There was a time when we could not continue," he assumed.
What the future reserves
João Incarnation ensures that what customers have always sought in this space will continue in Studio City: good coffee and pastry products, with the presence of Portugal. "We always try to introduce new products. We created a new, coffee and coconut -based drink, which is excellent. We also introduced the" Nata Bomb ", a Milkshake Beat Concept flavored Nata, a true bomb," he described.
There are also “traditional Portuguese products that did not exist before, such as bay bread”, as well as the donuts with different flavors, “to complete the offer we have”. "Our offer is already so varied that, even without introducing more products, it is sufficient to satisfy the values ​​of Portuguese customers and others as well."
John Incarnation also said that the change of establishment to Studio City was born from an invitation. “We don't know how to run yet, it's a bet that we are making right now”, and the goal is always to go back to street coffee. "The concept of having a neighborhood store or on the street is something that interests us a lot and we are already seeing other possibilities," he added.
"I don't have enough data to tell you that the change to Studio City is a winning bet. It's different, just like the concept, and we will have another type of customers beyond the usual."
A “Heart” project
Looking back, John Incarnation says that, for example, major problems have never been registered with human resources. "To this day we do not feel the big problem with lack of labor, it has never been something that has greatly affected us. Nowadays it is not as easy as it used to have quotas [for non-resident workers], as there are enough places that need placement. It is able to be easier, at this time, to get more local workers than before," he said, confirming that lace remain to be the big problem for such business.
“Cuppa Coffee is a project of the heart and during the pandemic I realized that I was going to close. I also realized that there was a series of closures, almost simultaneously, from other Portuguese establishments. Talk to my partner, who has a lot of experience in this area, and told him that I liked to try to keep Cuppa Coffee open. Possible to continue exactly the same concept and the same quality as it had been having with Cristiana, who did an excellent work in the creation and growth of Cuppa Coffee. ”
Overcoming the pandemic years, and at a time when Macau faces a break in local consumption, João Incarnation says that "it fulfills a bit to the Portuguese community to make the possible to support the effort we do so that everything is still open."
"I am not just talking about Cuppa Coffee, but also from wheat d'Ouro, butteria, Portuguese restaurants and Lord Stow, which is not a typical Portuguese business is based on Portuguese culture. All these businesses have to be fed and supported. For our part, we must maintain quality, but the Portuguese community has to take advantage of what exists and support the Portuguese business."
Despite the breach of consumption by the places, João Incarnation says that a balance with the consumption of tourists is guaranteed. "We feel a little [Break of consumption], but we can counterbalance with the offers we make and that satisfy the taste of local Chinese and visitors. But of course [Breaking of Consumption] has, of course, impact on business, not just the Portuguese, and this is in the city. But I think there is still some critical mass to keep Portuguese business open," he said.</description><pubDate>2025-06-17 00:32:25</pubDate></item><item><title>Coutinho wants direct flights between Macau and Portugal</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/26/coutinho-quer-voos-directos-entre-macau-e-portugal/</link><description>Deputy José Pereira Coutinho defended direct flights to Portugal yesterday and warned that restrictions on annual financial aid given to the residents of the Chinese region will affect reformed in Portugal.
“We have to transform Macao International Airport, in fact with direct air routes to Europe, namely to Portugal,” Coutinho said after the presentation of the political program of the Nova Esperança list to the local parliament.
The jurist said the largest long -haul aircraft in the world can land in Macao, but a lack of space to park aircraft, a problem that said he expected to be solved by expanding the infrastructure.
The expansion of the airport, launched in November, involves the construction of a landfill with more than 129 hectares and is expected to be over in 2030, increasing the capacity of 9.6 million to 13 million passengers per year.
"We hope that in the future it is not necessary to move to Hong Kong to take an international flight to Europe or America and we can start the trip in Macao which is our home," said Coutinho. Macao airport currently has regular passenger flights operated by 27 airlines to 41 destinations in mainland China, Taiwan, Southeast Asia, Japan and South Korea.
Criticized cuts
On the other hand, Coutinho criticized local government's decision to restrict financial aids given annually to people with resident status to those who in 2024 resided in the region at least 183 days.
The measure provides for exceptions, including for those living in nine cities of mainland China integrated in the Great Guandong-Hong Kong-Macau Bay project and those studying at universities abroad. But Coutinho warned that the exceptions did not eliminate all injustices, namely cases of retired people living in Portugal.
The deputy gave the example of a former Portuguese soldier, “almost 90 years old”, who worked for 40 years as a police in Macao, but has no right to financial aid for going to live with his daughter in Portugal after being widowed. "Do you think it is fair?" Coutinho asked the journalists.
The Nova Esperança political program also advocates "a deeper realization" of the role of Macao as a cooperation platform with Portuguese -speaking countries, "with the greater participation of the population and entrepreneurs."
The new hope was one of eight candidacies validated by the Electoral Affairs Commission of the Legislative Assembly (Caeal). Four years ago, there were 19 lists of candidates for the Legislative Assembly, although five lists and 21 candidates -15 of which pro -democracy -were then excluded for "not defending the basic law" and not being "faithful to masters".</description><pubDate>2025-06-26 01:31:24</pubDate></item><item><title>Light Metro | Plans disclosed for sign 8 of Typhoon</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/26/metro-ligeiro-divulgados-planos-para-casos-de-sinal-8-de-tufao/</link><description>The Macao Light Metro Society and the Directorate of Service for Traffic Affairs yesterday released the transport operation plans when signs of tropical storm are listed.

Another opportunity born from the eventual arrival of the light meter to Qingmao, will be the possibility of diverting tourists who enter Macao through that border to the areas of Fai Chi Kei and Patane.
During the construction, the deputy recommends to the government to guarantee the conditions of habitability for residents of the vicinity of the Yat Yuen canhy, given the large works.

In turn, Rita Santos says she will devote more time to the family. Still will again assume the functions of advisor to the Portuguese communities
 
José Pereira Coutinho will be the first candidate on the Nova Esperança list, which highlights the absence of Rita Santos, who was nominated by the deputy as a candidate of the list in an eligible place. Minutes before the presentation of the list, which took place yesterday afternoon, the president of the General Assembly of the Macao Public Function Association (ATFPM) shared a video on social networks to announce that he would not be a candidate, for wanting to spend more time with his family.
The absence was devalued by José Pereira Coutinho who, through the analogy with the captain of the Portuguese football team, Cristiano Ronaldo, declined the idea that the list was deprived of a member with unique quality and a lot of experience: “In New Hope, Cristiano Ronaldo is me, I am Cristiano Ronaldo,” said the deputy, with Rita Santos and the other members of the list next door.
The legislator also said that the deputy position requires dedication and time, with personal loss, and indicated that Rita Santos did not want to make this sacrifice: “Who has no temporal availability, because there are family, children and grandchildren to follow and gives the priority to grandson, so my dear friend, I can not accept [this person on the list]. Coutinho. "We are very friends since childhood, but one thing is bread, bread, something is cheese, cheese," he added.
Despite the candidacy for deputy, a political office, José Pereira Coutinho refused that the list of nine hope is classified as "politics", understanding that it is a "civic" list and "friends". The deputy said he also did not feel any political pressure in the definition of candidates on the list: "Do you think I'm not free? I never had pressure to anything," Coutinho replied when asked about it.
Backwater
Present in the presentation of the list, minutes after having published the video explaining that he did not apply, Rita Santos did not want to make statements in his own name to journalists. However, the chairman of the ATFPM General Assembly confirmed that he will take over the position of advisor to the Portuguese communities. The information was also transmitted by José Pereira Coutinho, in the statements made to journalists.
The withdrawal of the elections of September 14 to the Legislative Assembly is days after the prosecutor of the MSAR revealed that Rita Santos, although without revealing the name, had been questioned, at the request of the authorities of Portugal, due to investigations related to a “crime against the electoral law of Portugal in Macao”.
When asked if the withdrawal was related to the investigations, both Rita Santos and José Pereira Coutinho refused any connection. The two also indicated that the possible inclusion of Rita Santos in the lists had come from Coutinho, as a "obligation" that the colleague did not want to accept.
At the request of the family
Regarding the option of justification to be left out of the elections, Rita Santos indicated that she departed from “a request from family members” to “spend more time with them”, mainly due to “her grandson” and the 10 brothers who complain the distance the most. "Respecting my family's desire, I will not participate in this year's Legislative Assembly elections," he said. "But, I promise to continue to support Deputy José Pereira Coutinho and also support the Public Service Workers Association and personally meet the partners. I hope you accept and respect my decision," he added.
Rita Santos's participation in the legislative elections had been announced for the first time in mid -2024, at the headquarters of the Macao Public Function Association, when a visit to Macao de José Cesário, then secretary of state for the Portuguese communities.
Chestless chest
Regarding the New Hope list, Coutinho will be the first candidate, followed by Chan Hao Weng. Deputy Che Sa Wang was relegated to third place after being elected in 2021, when he was number two. About these changes, Coutinho indicated that Che was unable to follow the “pedaling” of legislative work. "The position of deputy is demanding. You have to intervene, you have to work, you have to handle the bills. Not everyone can keep up with the pedaling," said the legislator about the bench colleague. "My colleague is excellent co -worker, but has not been able to follow the pedaling. This is like the marathon, it is necessary to have dedication, because the projects are increasingly, complex and one person has to be prepared," he noticed.
The candidate was present for a few moments in the presentation of the list, but left early. According to Coutinho, the early departure was due to a trip to Hong Kong.
In addition to the three nominated candidates, the list is also made up of Chan Ka Wai, Melina Tam Leng I, Jose Miguel de Sales da Silva, Fong Im Ha, Chang Fong, Fok Chao Iu, Hung Oi Ming and Ho Sio Peng.</description><pubDate>2025-06-26 01:01:19</pubDate></item><item><title>Lisbon | Lúcia dos Santos with renewed mandate</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/26/lisboa-lucia-dos-santos-com-mandato-renovado/</link><description>The appointment of Lúcia Abrantes dos Santos as head of the Macao Economic and Commercial Delegation in Lisbon was renewed for a year, according to an order published in the official bulletin.

In the last stop, in Foshan, Sam Hou Fai suggested articulation between Foshan's Traditional Chinese Medicine Industry and Macao universities, as well as cooperation in the so -called “silver economy”
 
The government leader returned to Macau on Tuesday night after a three-day visit to the Great Bay cities, which culminated in Foshan, a neighboring city of the province capital, where he met with the Secretary of the Communist Party of China (CCP) Municipal Committee, Tang Yifeng.
Sam Hou Fai stressed the advantages of combining Foshan's “traditional Chinese Medicine Industry, in articulation“ with the qualified staff of Macao Higher Education Institutions and the skills in scientific research ”. This level of cooperation can“ further increase the nuclear competitiveness of the respective industries of both territories, ”he said.
Also at the level of care for the elderly, the two cities should establish bridges, in the perspective of the chief executive.

Obviously, it is not certain that Trump succeeds in this complicated task of dividing to reign. However, it is perfectly possible for one of these actors to develop AI models or other inventions so powerful that they cannot be ignored, forcing the president to co-opt for someone else, with all the consequences that it entails.
An example could be Microsoft, which in 2024 announced a partnership with Blackrock to do exactly what Stargate should do, that is, launching AI physical infrastructure. Thirty billion have been invested and this year will be added other eighty billion dollars. Total are one hundred and ten billion dollars, ten more than the portal of the stars. But that, for Trump, is a problem to some extent. If companies compete to earn their favors and remain faithful to American interests, the better. The big names in technology must compete fiercely with each other, producing innovation. Just don't think they are more important than the president even if they may really be.
In his monumental “sociology”, Georg Simmel distinguished between existential competition in which the life of the contenders and competition oriented to the result in which it matters is the achievement of the objective is at stake. While this type of competition prevails among the magnates of American technology, Cencelli Manual or how to share Trump's power will work. But if someone feels existentially threatened by someone else, the situation may explode.
We are evidently in the middle of Elon Musk, champion of existential risks. The founder of Spacex took just a few hours to react to the Stargate announcement. And obviously, he did in X, commenting on the publication with which OpenAi announced the birth of the project stating that "they have no money. Softbank has less than ten billion dollars, according to reliable sources. Now, even without knowing what are the reliable sources of Elon, their calculations are correct. If we subtract from the twenty -five billion of dollars of liquidity that the Masa Fund has stated in the September 2024 balance, the nominee's nineteenth -month -old one that will invest in Stargate, there are about six billion dollars in Softbank accounts.
But, as we have seen, the problem is not that. And this is not the difficulty of Elon. The founder of Spacex was actually surprised by Trump's play, which after using it throughout the election campaign as a public image, made him disappear from the scenes that matter except for the controversy that followed his supposed Roman greeting. Above all, however, the former Doge Chief (left the Trump administration and his position in Doge, the agency in charge of reducing US government spending and reducing jobs) does not tolerate that the Stargate Project is built around OpenAi, a company that musk found in 2015 and was stolen by Altman, accused by Elon of wanting money developing a general artificial intelligence (AG) capable of destroying humanity.
In a clear summary of Musk, "OpenAi is evil." The situation is paradoxical. Trump, with whom Musk has basically lived in the last three months, despises Elon's AI and attributes the operational leadership of the largest AI -related AI project to him who, according to Tesla's founder, is not simply a competitor but an existential threat to humanity survival. Consequence, a former government who, such as Musk, publicly states that Stargate is an unrealistic project, unable to finance herself and led by evil people ready to 'evoke the AI' demon 'to make money.
In this madness, the president had to hurry to declare that Elon is only a little agitated because in the project "there is a person he hates" and that, anyway, there is nothing to worry about because "I hate some people." Altman's response to Musk, also published in the X, was almost immediate. “What is good for the country is not always good for its companies.
But I hope that, in your new position, always put the United States first. The OpenAi chief demonstrates to know Elon very well, because it hits exactly at the point where Trump America and the Musk Empire can take different ways.
For the president, the government must bet on the development of AI without any ethical, philosophical or environmental concern, because the goal is to make America big again or at least ensure that it remains greater than China.</description><pubDate>2025-06-26 01:29:09</pubDate></item><item><title>Disadvantage</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/25/desassossego/</link><description>No one supports the morning birds when Alba comes to start the day, which the day always happens, only the night seems to us the first of our lives, and the ones we now transpite, so small, even seem betrayals.
We are in the Summer Solstice, and we, those who get older, are catapulted by exuberant energy that we do not know how to follow the same flash as the abundance of this flow rather than resurrection causes prostration. In fact, there is no greater threat than all that rises in sound, sensation, meaning and lust- nothing shuts down, empties, soothes, Fenece- the contrary, everything imitates sound, reproduces, replica, multiply, and for those who await the exit, such exuberance may be demolishing.
"To live is to be another" unlover: but what another supplies what we have been to be henceforth? No one responds to this. We are others without realizing that things were once loved with sense, and that we still have to cross the time loaded with others who finish us until we are nothing. To summer and those who will come, we must look at them as light of the world, interpret their abundances, and not succumb to the domain of the emptying permanence.
- No one remembers having been dead, but we remember well what it was to be alive- We were calculated with the book of the disaste, enchanted and goose bumps to the soul, which we all recognize that alluvion of extremely lucid and absurd, and some still dive into the final dissolution as in those Woody Allen movies when I stopped the middle of the morning race with the frustrating sensation to die. What is it for then to run or stand still? It is possible that only a large neurathnic know how to produce withdrawal and reflection, and that everything else is a reality as parallel as it is paralyzing to see by the effects produced.
The impermanence of living leads to long reflections that only the most permanent dare to do, but they are not testimonials of the gregarious existence of the toil to overcome the ablyse states of others, that without a reserve of subtle slavery they would know nothing, and we will flow into the elaboration of what is necessary to be human in the midst of this profile- a stunning degree of thought- that a humanity that drags on its existence. Pilling and sabotaging everything around in a primitive fear of starving, this one will never experience such delights.
Hunger has various meanings, which its obscure condition is preparing for the cannibal phase where the ogres of the world is already being disliked by giving human pieces to lie in the dumps of disassass mutual all those who will swallow. But all of this seems to be a finitude that it is about, and what we see is the euphoria to end up with trepidation spheres where all the tomorrows that sing will be extinguished. This ordinary evil is so paralyzing that it is on a collision route even with the need.
"The heart, if you could think, would stop," here is a disadvantage; And what more? If the brain could feel, it would think; This is a grateful task for mismatched organs. If we could guess with the body we would be capturing and premonitory in the succession line of happy sources, but not even that life has given us so that we can pacify ourselves in solution and art. We have been embarrassed by the tribal frenzy and competed as crazy for a place in the sun that will erase in the big nuclear winter, and when we are in the caves of the story watching the long programmed of a passionate and crazy species, maybe tears come to our help. Now we are just crazy, cold crazy, the most dark way you can produce monsters in your strength. It is disarmed that we had built this nursery of trepidation with so much formal contempt to the laws of love, but this is what we did. A amalgam of lives that are delirious trembling, which sleep with open eyes, have sarcastic and injured delights, and forge martyrons that they are unaware of the consequences.
Sustainability is a very vast area, and no feature or source gives us the harmony somewhat dreamed, and will still come a quiet as well as the disassessment of this invented joy.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Michael Hui (III)</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/24/michael-hui-iii/</link><description>Last two weeks, we analyzed the factors of the success of Dr. Honoris Causa Michael Koon-Man movies. Michael is a star of film and television for the past 50 years. A person who dedicates 50 years to a career has to have dedication and passion for his work.
With a accurate tact, clearly distinguishes the differences between the thinking of the oldest and the latest generation and uses these differences very well to entertain the audiences. Michael knows that a lot of people go to the movies and that movies have a profound impact on the public and therefore have social responsibility. For a movie to succeed, it has to be innovative and innovation is important in all sectors of activity. If a company does not innovate and its competitors do, it is left behind. Today we will make one last analysis of the successful factors of Michael Koon-Man's movies.
Reflection on work is one of many factors that determine the success of a movie. "The Last Dance" inspired Michael and made him understand that we only have one life. In the journey we do, we should all learn to appreciate the gifts we receive along the way. These gifts include the people we love, our friends and even our enemies. To appreciate the people we love and our friends means that we have to learn to get along well with them. When we are faced with our enemies, overcoming them and destroying them is not the only possibility. We can also learn to accept them, forgive them, forget them, etc.; Whatever the decision made, it will change us and also to others. Just reflecting on work we can invest, progress and improve in the future.
Many people live only in the present and think that if they live well now this is enough. But Michael's view is clearly beyond the attitude of “living only in the present”, because living in the present implies that we do not accept our enemies. It is not just about changing ourselves, but it is also about changing our enemies. Passing the confrontation to make up and tightness, or even make friends, it's not something that two people who are angry do easily. If we come to the end of life without enemies, it means that we had a happy life.
Here we can understand that Michael's achievements in the world of cinema have been creating successively myths because he is a born observer, a hardworking worker, has a spirit focused on the future and puts all his enthusiasm in each movie. These factors must always be present in all the work we do, whatever they may be. In the creative process, it is necessary to innovate and fight for change. And we must understand that films have a social responsibility. Innovation and social responsibility are indispensable elements in modern companies. Combining these personal elements with business elements, regardless of what we will do in the future, can only result in a happy ending.
When Michael attended the ceremony of assignment of his doctorate Honoris, he was accompanied by his wife and grandson. An 82 -year -old man was able to watch another glorious moment of his life accompanied by his family. What else can anyone ask? It is really appropriate to say that Michael has a family life, fame, fortune and a lot of happiness. The factors that determined their success in the film industry deserve to be considered for our learning and should be disclosed.

The increase in violent actions of neo -Nazi groups in Portugal and the continuous discourse of incitement to hatred on social networks is to worry populations and judicial authorities to make a bomb of amazement and informative concern. The judicial police had been controlling since 2020 certain neo -Nazis groups and last week owned several elements of a group that had over 900 elements. The detainees are suspected of integrating the so -called Lusitanian Armillary Movement (evil), which already has an armed militia.
After searches of surprise from certain properties suspected of belonging to this neo-Nazi group, several weapons were found, some of 3D system war, as well as Soqueiras, large knives, Nazi propaganda, and very serious documentation that indicates that the group was preparing to kill President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, former Prime Minister António Costa and presidential candidate Almirante Gouveia and Melo and Melo and Assembly of the Republic with armed violence. Eight members of the Neonazi Group have already been arrested including a PSP head that operated at the Lisbon Municipal Police and several PSP agents and GNR military, who belonged to the group and raised young people to the group. Among the many members of the group is the father of the arrival deputy, Rita Matias. The facts are very serious. Constitutional law itself is concerned because we talk about crime and terrorism, not a simple political position.
Secret Services and Judicial Police have already detected 11 neo -Nazi organizations in Portugal. None of this appears by chance. On social networks, namely in the Telegram network, there is a discourse of hatred and xenophobia by the Elements of the arrival and neonazis, which has given strength to which most radical movements of the far right can lead to acts of violence essentially against African and Asian immigrants. This time, the Judicial Police already have very serious elements of terrorist actions that were planned soon. Neo -Nazism is a sad reality in Portugal that is coming to plans of high criminal violence. And nothing happens by chance. When we watched the radical, xenophobic and racist politician André Ventura to instill in public opinion a speech against Gypsy communities and immigrants, obviously that neonazis feel that this discourse is favorable to terrorist action.
On the 10th of Portugal, Camões and Portuguese communities, the illustrious and nationally and internationally awarded writer Lídia Jorge, as coordinator of the ceremonies, gave a speech of great depth and realism regarding our history of centuries, as the President of the Republic must have given his best discourse of his two mandates, having pointed out that we are all clear against discrimination, in a clear reference against discrimination, in a clear reference that we are all clear against discrimination, in a clear reference against discrimination that we are all Portuguese defend against immigrants.
And what happened next? André Ventura came to public with absolutely offensive statements to Lídia Jorge and Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, and not only. The Leader of the arrival stated that "Lídia Jorge and the President of the Republic betrayed the name of Portugal". What's more, "José Luís Carneiro gives pity when he appears on television. I feel like going there and telling the man:" Listen, friend. The country has not been the same as 40 or 30 years ago. " What's more, "if the constitutional revision does not advance shows me that the prime minister is hostage, he is kidnapped, is stuck with the same interests and to the same collusion that the PS has always been."
Now, who calls traitor to the President of the Republic is not reflecting a speech of hatred before those who hear it? Isn't it instilling forces to more radical groups? When Ventura says that the country today is not like 40 or 30 years ago, of course not, today we have at least 11 terrorist neo -Nazi organizations, of which elements of PSP, GNR and relatives of deputies of the André Ventura party are part. Crimes of incitement to hatred and violence have increased more than 200 percent in the last five years.
The situation regarding these neo -Nazi groups is severe. Democrats are worried. The list that the Judiciary Police seized where individualities to kill is not small. Only the intention to propose to kill personalities that have given their country, including freedom on April 25, 1974, is already very serious. And why do we speak in freedom? Because in the referred list are also part of Captains of April.
Judicial authorities can no longer be contemplated by such organizations and serious statements given by certain politicians who only aim to increase their will to the neo -Nazis to get out of the den, as in many violent cases they have done so. The trendy justice reform also has to include the building of special prisons where fascists can be placed convicted of criminal or terrorist activity.</description><pubDate>2025-06-23 03:43:14</pubDate></item><item><title>Silk Route | Talent Training Program started in Beijing</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/26/rota-da-seda-programa-de-formacao-de-talentos-arrancou-em-pequim/</link><description>It was officially launched in Beijing, on the 16th, the talent formation program in the areas of cultural and creative design of the Seda Maritime Route, supported by MGM and selected for funding from the China National Arts Fund (FNAC) this year.

About 23 properties belonging to businesswoman Isabel Chiang were placed in auction to pay debts to more than 200 creditors, according to the Fasome Court Portal.

Some prices may rise up to 10 percent
 
The possibility of going on to advance with the closure of the Ormuz Strait can shoot inflation in Macao. The scenario was drawn by the president of the Macao Suppliers Union Association, IP Sio Man, in statements to the newspaper or Mun.
After US and Israelite bombings against Iran, the possibility of the country ending the Strait of Ormuz was advanced. IP Sio Man acknowledged that the negative effects of closing will affect mashes to consumer goods prices and should begin to feel more intensely about two to three months after blocking.
The Association's president estimated that the closure will lead to the “inevitable increase in prices” from about 5 to 10 percent. Price growth will take about two to three months to feel, because many of the importers and distributors have reserves of products that can be affected, so they can be sold at current prices. However, when new more expensive products are imported, prices in Macau will also reflect this increase.
IP Sio Man also indicated that after the beginning of the war between Israel, the US and Iran, the cost of insurance for maritime transport increased by 50 percent. Oil prices rose about six percent.
The president of the association also indicated that with the blockade of the Strait of Ormuz, the maritime transport that currently takes three months will take four to five months. Faced with this scenario, IP believes that the impact on the level of goods transport between and Asia and Europe will be similar to what happened during the pandemic.
China more protected
Despite the negative panorama, IP Sio Man also pointed out that China is better prepared to face the impact than regions such as Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Macao or others from Southeast Asia.
The president pointed out that rail transport between China and Europe can be an alternative for transporting some products and is currently used for most consumed high-class goods, such as wines, liqueurs, dairy products, sweets, chocolates and cookies.
An area where Macao should be impacted is at first -need goods, such as cereals, food oil and other foods, since these products originated in the interior of China and the countries of Southeast Asia.
The newspaper or Mun article also cites an anonymous supplier that indicates that Europe is not a source of imports in Macao and that the impact should not be much felt. The same anonymous source indicated that since the pandemic, Macau began to diversify the fate of imports of imports, looking for alternatives in Southeast Asia.
This supplier also indicated to expect a moderate impact on inflation level, because consumption inside China is in retraction due to the employment crisis on the other side of the border.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Taxis | Offenses almost triple between January and May</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/24/taxis-infraccoes-quase-triplicam-entre-janeiro-e-maio/</link><description>Between January and May 2025, more irregularities were recorded by taxi drivers than last year. The number of accidents has decreased except those involved pawns. More vehicles were blocked on public roads, but the total value of traffic fines decreased slightly
 
In the first five months of this year, the Public Security Police (CPSP) registered 993 irregularities committed by taxi drivers, which supplanted the 870 irregularities detected throughout the last year, and 162.7 percent over the same period as 2024.
Among the most practiced offenses by taxi drivers, it jumps in sight in the statistical data of traffic to “refusal of transport”, which increased by 63 percent annually in the period under analysis. But the summary place of this type of offenses is “not waiting for the order of customers in taxi squares”, which more than sextipated with a meteoric increase of 515 percent in annual terms.
Of a total of nearly 1,000 offenses, 229 were delivered to the management of services for traffic affairs for follow -up, less than a quarter, but which still represented a rise of almost 75 percent.
In general, traffic data reveals stability, with a slight increase of 0.37 percent of the roads to road rules to a total of 306,304, with a wide slice to relate to illegal parking (almost 270,000 offenses in the first five months of 2025).
Horses and pedestrians
In the first five months of 2025, the authorities reported 6,069 road accidents, 5.3 percent over the same period last year, without death and the number of injuries to fall 7.4 percent to 2,159. In the accident level, the most worrying statistics were the accidents to involve pawns, which increased 27.3 percent to a total of 261.
In the period under analysis, the authorities passed fines in a value of over 81.2 million patacas, 1.1 percent less in annual terms. One of the factors responsible for most of the fines, was the illegal parking lot, which despite the slight break of 0.65 percent, accumulated almost 270,000 infringements. Despite the descent of illegal parking, the authorities reveal that in the first five months of the year the blocking of vehicles on public roads increased by 29 percent, with a total of 1,100 blocked vehicles, the large majority cars.
Another type of offenses that have been prominent in recent years, concerns pedestrians that cross the roads without complying with traffic rules, chapter where 3,949 irregularities were detected, which represented a decrease of 3.2 percent.

A renovated Ukrainian, with the same name of the president, guilty Zelensky about the extension of the conflict that destroyed his village. Zelensky, the village, who has never left his land, now lives mortified because his favorite gravedigger died in the bomber.
This Zelensky, the village, represents half the world that reproves the other Zelensky, the villain, for not wanting to negotiate with Putin.
Negotiate what? The invader enters us through the house, pies us the wife and daughter (cf. recent UN report on Ukraine violations in this “special operation”), an act that forced us to watch, and then we say: Alto there, we are for peace, but we have to negotiate: You have not said the name you want to give to children!
A peace that is not worthy is but a cessation of rights. As severe as Russophobia that Putin inflicts his people.
 
10/28/22
In a lunch with several guests I hear a friend, who declares himself a spiritist, explaining about the particularities of his belief, in a serene and balanced way, would even say, without "irrationalism". He discussed long and serenely, devoid of any fanatical proselytizing. “Here is someone to whom belief brought weighting!” I thought, a rare alliance.
However, at one point a phrase that horrify me. He says, “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!” And I enter the voracious fauces of holism. Because holismo has a pathological aspect like all good things, a side of shadow.
Two examples: In Hinduism there is less sensitivity to existential dramas, if that child suffers in this life this is only an expression of the strict karmic symmetry, an effect of the acts she committed in her previous life. In Africa it is not accepted that death may have been accidental, and many women are accused by the dead family of having caused her husband's death, in an act of manifest dementia, and, in the blatant majority of cases, in a huge injustice to his wife - madness that spreads and infiltrates the social fabric.
Buddhism has introduced compassion and Christianity to Caritas, trying to break with this logic, but in many other beliefs and religions the cage of causalities prevails over sensitivity to experience, the need to respond to the now.
It is a tremendous logic that transforms the world into a platonic stage, where we are just the shadows of something -an inextricable law -in a determinism that calcines all singularities, but strangely fascinates many.
The conquest of modernity has anchored in the conquest of chance and random, subtracting the incidences of a life to this fierce determinism that closed the world in a web. When the Renaissance freed the body from the influence of the stars, at this moment sexuality was relieved of guilt and individualism and their volition could emerge.
There is an unequivocal moral implication in the phrase “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!”, Which should work as a key to self-knowledge and self-judgment, but usually this phrase is managed to seek a reason for things abroad from us in the other. It is an alibi.
There is a holistic temptation in the world today, as in the Middle Ages there was a satanic temptation, without great reflection on its consequences. Because it is not enough we want to connect everything in a resonant chain of affection. Even the most unexpected: affection itself can kill.
I realize, thanks to this cultured, balanced, intelligent woman, that “the combat” moved at the beginning of this century. One of the great misconceptions of the twentieth century was the false dichotomy between "rationalism and irrationalism", a debate that extended to all fields, including art. First, rationality was confused (the positive side of reason) with rationalism (the pathological feature of reason), and articulated in this lack of discernment was confused irrationalism with freedom. Almost all the art of the twentieth century, with surrealism to the head, worked in this error. The fallacy still exists despite having consolidated the emergence of 'irrationalism' and the consequent relativist currents that followed it. Essentially much of what happened in the twentieth century, it turned around this shock between two paradigms: rationalism versus irrationalism.
Now, I see, the indetermination, chance, the random of the terrible temptation of the causal cage. Holism, in its pathological feature, can be the reductionism that is the way it puts the way as a new 'eschatological narrative'.
Is it "by chance" that the holism emerges at the moment when neo-liberalism and its cynical contempt for the human person besides all freedoms, all acquired rights?
Holistic consciousness has brought positively a greater ecological awareness but followed by scholastic rigor drifting reality under the blanket of a determinism that is much more than inconvenience: all great authoritarian ideologies are holistic.
My friend will know how to combine her holistic and transpersonal belief with the freedom and responsibility that every moment asks us - but how many will make the destruction, under a law that explains and encompasses everything?
How many will not be abandoned to what it is?
The awareness of the indeterminate brings tragic conscience, as the Greeks knew, but also brings the will and the courage of the decision. And of this we cannot abdicate.
In addition, as Drummond shows in Carlos Drummond de Andrade's poem “Quadrilha”:
"John loved Teresa who loved Raimundo/ who loved Maria who loved Joaquim who loved Lili/ who did not love anyone./ John went to the United States, Teresa to the convent,/ Raimundo died of disaster, Maria stayed to aunt,/ Joaquim suicide himself and Lili married J.

Reading many people's reactions when the Nobel Prize in this year's literature was announced, I couldn't help but remind me of this repair of Jean-Pierre Siméon, in relation to another Nobel Prize: “An editor of a large national newspaper wrote five lines of indignation because the Nobel Prize for Literature, a complete stranger. But unknown to whom? How did not occur to this patented and paid literary columnist to do his work, that his apparent ignorance was a matter of incorrect professional conduct? Tranströmer was translated into many languages, it was available in French. »
There is always the choir of those who wait for the announcement of the prize to complain about not being invited to the jury of the prize, there is a subgroup of Irados that professes “never read and I will not bother to read”; It is an uncommon fauna, which inhabits social networks.
I don't always know all the winners-I was unaware of the existence of Louise Glück, who I find a great poet, or the Olga Tokarczuk, for example-but it only brings me the comfort of knowing that the world is not a soap opera where everyone knows each other and the joy of recognizing that the gauge of the world is not measured with my short measure and that on the contrary it gives me a new opportunity to face the unknown.
And perhaps the most cretin of reactions was the smart one who wrote, but there are still those who read French? Confirming only that today there is a new kind of ignorance that fires with a displeasure: the one who only read English.
I would also prefer that, in French, Pascal Quignard, Linda reads, or even Sollers, or, among the new ones, Mathias is awarded, but that does not take dignity to the work of Annie Ernaux (and it would be enough to have written the “Les Années”). There are books of her that I like less, like the vulgar "a simple passion," but this happens with almost every authors, they have a channel books and others that are like intervals in their itinerary. I advise reading a beautiful book of interviews with her, "L'Ecriture Comme un couteau".

Yesterday came an article in Maputo's morning “News”, realizing that the Pen Club Narrative Prize was assigned to my wife, Teresa Noronha, for her soap opera “Tornado”, which had already had the Maria Velho da Costa award.
The summary they made of the book does not even deserve comments, by pathetic, but what matters to highlight is the note of disqualification about their "Mozambicanity" by calling it Luso-Mozambican. It is not inaccurate, but for those who know the context, it is a dirty touch.
Because finally, following the same logic, Adelino Timóteo should be called Tsonga-Mozambican, to Álvaro Taruma-Mozambican, and Macua-Mozambican to the writers who are from the north, etc., etc. Which is not reported to happen.
At the beyond moment, in the soap opera, she writes:
«Our color has never been dominant. In colonial time we were not white, we were ripped from monories, gone mugs, the pejorative term to speak of a son of Goes and Portuguese. In the postcolonial period, I was not black and if, in Lisbon, they took me by Brazilian or Cape Verdean, already in France were lost in cogitations of where they would be and amazed when they found out it was African. There I had to explain my DNA's wanderings before relying on moorms. It took me a long time to accept that it was so because yes, and that it was no curse that were so; On the contrary, I could even discover intense patterns of fantasy and freedom in this shrewd cloak that is our genealogy… »
In the current Mozambique it is white… and this is overlapping it soon to what it does or what it is.
It is sad, but as Naipaul warned, through these stops the race is everything and is soaked in it as deeply as, elsewhere, in religion.

Bruno Latour, an anthropologist who studied the sciences and their procedures and legitimations, law, technique and religions died and entertained themselves to turn the guts to the dogmas of the “modern”. For him the place, the expert's function, was more defined by the perplexity he embodied than for the supposed truth he would support him.
He proposed, as an alternative to the kinds of multiculturalism and his mistaken password "all different all the same", the return to "diplomacy", given precisely not from the presupposition that "we are unified because participants of the same nature" but simply that we "do not yet share an ordinary world"; It is necessary to deal frontally with the "abyss of disagreement" that separates us, rather than wanting to delude it.
And about politics said, disassessedly:
«If transparency is required from the politician, we kill him; If one requires fidelity to what the other was or he says, kills him; If a mimetic relationship is required between what the crowd wants and what its representative says, the representation is killed. These must, therefore, by definition, betray, deceive, modify, distort the word. Without this ability to double the word and betray, political language would not exist. I put the perfectly plausible hypothesis that political vocabulary will become as inaccessible as the religious language of the last twenty, three or fifty years. (in “UN Monde Pluriel plus Commun”). I believe it will be missed to decipher this frantically complex world that fit us.</description><pubDate>2022-10-17 02:18:03</pubDate></item><item><title>The yo -yo</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/30/o-fuxi/</link><description>O my friends, companions of these funeral trips to countries as old as the stars and the moon, and as strange as the profound interior of our disgraceful souls, - that startle still awaits us, what secret spells will we have to overcome, what horrors will rise to our dilated pupils of amazement and terror?
Increasingly close to our precarious existences, howling the war monster, which threatens to merge humanity with the earth, incessantly traveled by the squalid spectrum of hunger and the invisible evil of ten thousand pests.
O human human, who cries superior to his own nature, but then reveals to you, once and again, unable to simply order your existence and do not understand that you are possessed by the fickle wrath and are slave to your own ambition! Do not be content with the white jade or the light gold, there is no treasure that gives you your inextinguishable thirst for other men, animals and things; for in you an eternal anguish in you; in you crawl the expelled snakes; For you grows, powerful and impossible, the very fertile ivy of evil!
This is perhaps why on the mound they call the white deer, where one of the eight immortals in sacred mount was evolved through the skies to Penglai, inhabits the fuxa, a bird whose form resembles that of the rooster, although topped by a human head. What strange copulas, what monstrous amplexes, what terrible procedures will have occurred to make the existence of this animal sinister possible? We do not know, but it is enough for our exhausted mind to dare to raise an answer, so we soon feel the skin traveled by horrendous goose bumps and the heart trigger in paraded, which wild horse beaten by the night whip of fear, oblivious to reins and containment.
May men refrain from going through the Mount of the deer, because although there are riches capable of calming the most misunderstanding ambitions, if they have the disgraced fortunate to glimpse a fuxa, it will be immediately triggered the cultivated fields, because it will be beheaded the soft animals, for it will be sacrificed the best young man and destroyed superb from countries.
Fuxi emits a sound that resembles its name. If you hear it, dark night or clear day, goose way, for the path where you find you is the most right of the ways for misfortune!</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Procrastinators Club</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/29/clube-dos-procrastinadores/</link><description>Walking in rereading of Easter, because of an article I prepare, I give this excerpt, extracted from “the universal man”:
«Every man morally is one and absolute; But you have to live with your personality to mitigate. (…) Coexistence is only possible among people reduced to a negative or hollow presence, which is constantly giving in. Hence, the emptiness of society, a huge ghost composed of numerous deceased. An upper man is antisocial or criminal. Its destination is jail and desert.
He is in thinking about whether she reflects here about the political-social conditioning that gagging, and worse, in a sad country as Portugal was in the middle of the Estado Novo (and the book is from 1931) where any possibilities of spontaneity and frankness in human relations were coarcet, or only lends the behavior of men (oppressed) a metaphysical frame, a “essence”, from a presumption of each one in the presumption of each one be in isolation “one and absolute”. Sometimes, to an excess of spirituality (or longing), it adds to Pascoaes to lack the world. He is a great poet, but he is a poet who takes gray-Jewish ampoules and is therefore written amiiude on a programmatic furor, ceasing to have pores; There is often a glass between him and the real, the same one who made him wring the Ballet, 1921: “Everything is ghost. There are only clouds, clouds of voices, clouds of souls, afflictions and tragedies! Clouds and more clouds, appearances and more appearances! It is a divine lightning that pierces them, the instant appearance that arises and throws us to the ground, dazzled! »
Sometimes I would like to remind him, as António Sérgio did in the article “Regeneration and Tradition, Moral and Economy”, which dedicated to Easter: “Easter, Easter My Dear Friend: You are a pure, excellent, and very noble poet, but also a victim of this social environment, like us all: of this horrible isolation that you praise and I”.
"As a child, he stole two melos," says Jacinto do Prado Coelho, stole him from a nest, and throb his lifetime remorse for it. The person, few more mischief is known to him. Only in Álvaro de Campos sprouts a twinge of evil and obscenity: “Oh, and ordinary and dirty people who always seem the same,/ who employs profanity as usual words,/ whose children steal at the grocery door/ and whose daughters at eight years-and I think this is beautiful and I love him! -/ masturbate decent -looking men on the stairs. » (Ode triumphal).
Both poets beaten by a certain idea of ​​holiness, they were identical to the inability of breaking the siege of the skin with the overflow of the dike, the same curse of sublimating Eros's concrete ferocity with the mansuity of the verses.
Of course, they are the two "Bigger Than Life", but sometimes unnerves to watch, from my hostor's post at the Procrastinators Club, to the tantrums between them, just to see who occupies, in the internal organization, the place of president and treasurer.
Although a person has guessed more, for example, this he wrote in the least known martial ode and that is declining in the situation we live today, differently, with the heart in his hands:
«Ode martial

Iranian Parliament President Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf said the International Atomic Energy Agency (AIEA) refused to condemn the attack on Iranian nuclear facilities, compromising the international credibility of the United Nations.
Ghalibaf's statements occurred after the deputies voted in favor of the suspension of cooperation with AIEA. "The Iranian organization of atomic energy will suspend cooperation with the AIEA while the safety of nuclear facilities is not guaranteed," added the president of Parliament of Teerão.
On June 13, Israel, with the support of the United States, attacked Iranian military and nuclear facilities. Iran retaliated firing missiles and launching unmanned air appliances against Israel.

According to the Hong Kong Free Press news portal, the Court of Appeal marked the hearing requested by Patrick Lam Shiu-Tung, former Stand News' interim writing head. The Stand News News Portal closed doors in December 2021 after a police operation involving 200 police, the company's freezing and the detention of the board, including Patrick Lam.
Last October, Lam filed an appeal of the conviction, a month earlier, to 14 months in prison, the first sentence against a journalist under an established sedition law when Hong Kong was an ancient British colony.
Although the first instance considered Lam guilty, the chief of writing came out of freedom due to health issues and for already fulfilling 10 months in custody. Also in September, the same court sentenced the former Stand News' chief of writing, Chung Pui-kuen, 21 months in prison by sedition.
Judge Kwok Wai-Kin considered Chung and conspiracy culprits for publishing and reproducing seditious materials, along with Best Pencil (Hong Kong) Ltd, the company that owned Stand News.

"What the world needs is not the jungle law, but of mutual success through cooperation," Li said, in an implicit reference to protectionist tensions and measures led by the United States to reduce China's dependence on strategic sectors.
I was speaking at the inaugural session of the Annual Meeting of New Champions, known as the “Summer Davos” and promoted by the World Economic Forum, which takes place this week in Tianjin, in northeastern China, and brings together political and business leaders from over 90 countries and regions.
Transformed
In his speech, Chinese prime minister warned of “deep changes” in the international economy, driven by geopolitical tensions, technological transformation and reconfiguration of global supply chains. "The world cannot be a set of isolated islands again. We need more cooperation bridges in which we all win," he said.
In a context marked by increasing customs rates, restrictions on foreign investment and calls to economic 'dissociation' with China, I read that global trade and investment should not be politicized or transformed into confrontation instruments. ”
He also stressed that China is still committed to dialogue, economic integration and promoting an open multilateral system. "Economic globalization will not stop. It can go through ups and downs, but will continue to advance," he said.
Li also highlighted the growing role of emerging economies such as “new engines” of international trade, recalling that they represent about 70 percent of the world's population.
This year's edition of “Summer Davos” takes place under the sign of geoeconomic uncertainty and increased protectionism, placing the tonic in the opportunities offered by entrepreneurship and new technologies to boost economic growth and resilience. Participants include heads of government from countries such as Ecuador, Singapore and Vietnam.</description><pubDate>2025-06-26 01:21:58</pubDate></item><item><title>Qingdao | Shangoi Cooperation Organization Meeting Prata</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/26/qingdao-reuniao-da-organizacao-de-cooperacao-de-xangai-arranca/</link><description>The meeting of the Ministers of Defense of Asian countries representing 40% of the world's population happens at the same time as in The Hague, the NATO Summit
 
The meeting of Ministers of Defense of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, sometimes nicknamed “Nato Asian”, ripped yesterday in the city of Qingdao, northeast of China, in parallel to the Summit of the Transatlantic Alliance in The Hague, which will be provided to give Trump green light for European countries to increase to 5 percent to the financial alliance.
The event aims to “consolidate and deepen mutual confidence in military matters” and promote “practical cooperation between the Member States,” said the China Ministry of Defense in a statement.
According to the same note, the meeting, which ends today, will contribute to “the maintenance of world and regional peace and stability” and to “common development and prosperity”. Among the highlighted objectives is also the “reinforcement of the organization's ability to combat regional terrorism”.
An intervention by Chinese Defense Minister Dong Jun is planned, as China currently exercises the rotating presidency of the organization. Attention will also be facing the eventual participation of Iranian Defense Minister Hosein Dehgán, after he will have accepted a ceasefire with Israel in the last few hours. The meeting in Qingdao occurs in a context of aggravation of tensions in the Middle East in recent weeks.
Following the US attack on Iranian nuclear facilities over the weekend, the Shanghai cooperation organization condemned the operation and expressed “serious concern”, considering that it represented “a serious violation of international law” and had “a negative impact on global peace and safety”.
Russians at the table
The presence of Russian Defense Minister Andréi Beloussov is also planned. Moscow and Beijing have deepened their ties in the defense area in recent years, while China maintains an ambiguous position against the war in Ukraine. Dehgán and Beloussov gathered on Monday, both condemned the attacks of the US and Israel against Iran.
The Russian minister also expressed his support to Tehran and classified western requirements in the nuclear domain as a "pretext" to weaken the country.
Gigantic coverage
The organization includes as members China, Russia, India, Iran, Kazakh, Kidstan, Pakistan, Tajiquistan, Belarus and USBekistan, being considered the world's largest regional organization in terms of geographical coverage and population, covering about 40 percent of the world's population.
Although its members claim that this is not a military alliance and that the main objective is to protect the member states from threats such as terrorism, separatism and extremism, analysts consider that the block aims above all to counteract the influence of the NATO.</description><pubDate>2025-06-26 01:20:42</pubDate></item><item><title>Middle East | Facts demonstrate that the military way does not bring peace</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/25/medio-oriente-factos-demonstram-que-via-militar-nao-traz-paz/</link><description>The Chinese government said yesterday that “the facts show that the military way does not bring peace to the Middle East, after US President Donald Trump announced a ceasefire and requesting the parties to respect him.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun transmitted yesterday at a press conference his hope that "peace will be achieved as soon as possible" and said that "the Pacific dialogue is the right way to solve problems."
"We exhort the parties involved to resume the right way to a political solution as soon as possible," added the spokesman, ensuring that China "is willing to collaborate with the international community to make efforts to maintain peace and stability in the Middle East" and "doesn't want tensions to intensify."
The Israeli government, led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said yesterday in a statement accepted Trump's proposal to a “bilateral ceasefire” with Iran after reaching his goals in 12 days of war, but warned that Israel will respond “firmly” to any violation of this agreement.
"Israel thanks President Trump and the United States for his support in defense and his participation in the elimination of the Iranian nuclear threat," reads in the statement, in reference to US bombing perpetrated on Sunday against three Iranian nuclear facilities in Ford, Natanz and Isfahan.

XI, who congratulated Wong for victory in last month's parliamentary elections, indicated that, “in the current international situation of interconnected changes and chaos, China is willing to strengthen strategic communication with Singapore”, according to a statement widespread by state television CCTV.
The Chinese leader urged both parties to "strengthen cooperation ties, work together to face challenges, and generate greater benefits to peoples from both countries." Wong said that "the importance of relationships between China and Singapore is greater than ever in a turbulent world situation," according to CCTV.
“We can work together to build more narrow bilateral relationships and strengthen regional and multilateral cooperation to strengthen multilateralism, protect international rules and order and benefit all countries in the world,” said Wong, who chose China as his first international official trip outside Southeast Asian after May elections.
Unquestionable victory
Wong ascended as Prime Minister of Singapore in May 2024, when the predecessor, Lee Hsien Loong, left office after almost two decades in power.
In the May elections, his party, the Popular Action Party (PAP), which has been in power in Singapore for six decades, has managed to wage the fall and wage the rise of a reduced opposition, winning 87 of the 97 seats in Parliament.
China maintains close relationships with Singapore, where it is estimated that hundreds of Chinese companies have changed in recent years in an attempt to avoid the impact of geopolitical and commercial tensions between Washington and Beijing. Singapore, which has a strong regulatory system and low corporate taxes, also proved to be the ideal alternative to Hong Kong.</description><pubDate>2025-06-25 00:15:07</pubDate></item><item><title>NATO / Defense | US insist on the 5% increase for all allies</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/24/nato-defesa-eua-insistem-no-aumento-de-5-para-todos-os-aliados/</link><description>The United States yesterday insisted that their commitment to increase by 5% of defense spending concerns all member countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), gathered in Summit in The Hague.
"Thanks to the leadership of the [American] president Donald Trump, NATO is on its way to achieving a historical commitment, in which each ally is committed to spending at least 5 percent of its GDP in defense," said the US ambassador to the Atlantic alliance, Matthew Whitaker, stressing that "all" will have to show "significant progress" in their sector budgets.
On the deadlines to reach the goal, Whitaker avoided moving on a date, although he reiterated that "there is no unlimited deadline," so he expects "significant and incredible growth from allies and their defense budgets year after year."
In this sense, he added that this is determined by the security threats that the military block faces and not by the demands of Trump or Nato Secretary-General Mark Rutte. "Our opponents will not expect us to be prepared," he warned.
In this way, Whitaker reiterated that the US president asks for “a clear and credible plan” to reach 5 percent of defense investment to “whole” to the swim. For Whitaker, the security situation requires European partners to take steps ahead to reinforce the transatlantic bond, so it reiterated that the expense issue will continue on Washington's agenda.

Since the Ukraine invasion of Russia in February 2022, European Union aircrafts have been prohibited from flying over Russian territory, which led to the cancellation of dozens of routes and forced companies to divert by corridors southern or Arctic.
In the case of East Asia calls, such as China, Japan or South Korea, the impact translates into additions of up to four hours of flight, extra fuel consumption and, consequently, increased operating costs and ticket prices.
In recent days, the intensification of the conflict between Israel and Iran, with military support from the United States, aggravated the situation, leading to the suspension of flights over Iran, Iraq, Syria and Israel. Several companies, including Qatar Airways, Lufthansa and Singapore Airlines, adjusted the routes or canceled calls to the region, citing security reasons.
A source of a large European airline quoted by the British newspaper Financial Times under anonymous said that although companies were used to dealing with periodic airspace closures, the current situation is "more serious" because companies have had a "really small corridor" to fly.
With the main air corridors blocked north and south, flights between cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Seoul or Tokyo and destinations in Europe now pass more narrow, flying over Central Asian, Turkey, or the Arabian Peninsula. Dependence on these corridors increases pressure on air traffic controls and makes any local disturbance in a threat to global flow.
Gains and Loss
Chinese airlines such as Air China and China Eastern, which are still allowed to use Russian airspace, have gained, however, a competitive advantage. Their flights are shorter and cheaper, allowing them to offer tariffs up to 35 percent lower than those practiced by European operators on the same routes, according to an estimate of the Financial Times.
In addition to the impact on passenger transport, the logistics sector also records difficulties, with delays in the delivery of goods and increased freight costs.
Rosen Röhlig expert pointed out in a report such as “the closing of Russian airspace to European companies affects air loading on Asia Europe Route”, leading to “setbacks in global centers and increased costs and delays”.
"The general tendency is an additional tightening in the capacity of carriers. As a result (…), longer crew rotations and increased fuel costs can lead to higher rates and changes in schedules," he said.
Also an OECD study demonstrated as "the closing of Russian airspace to carriers from 36 countries caused significant increases in travel time to passengers by about 80 percent of the routes that connect Asia to Europe."
The same analysis stressed that alternative corridors “cannot fully absorb these flows”, originating delays in the delivery of goods and increased freight costs, with direct impact on global supply chains.
The European Aviation Security Agency (EASA), which maintains regular updates on air exclusion zones, warned that the situation remains volatile, with the risk of new closures or unexpected incidents.</description><pubDate>2025-06-24 00:14:43</pubDate></item><item><title>Filipe de Saavedra, Teacher: “A Camões Interpretative Center in Macau is missing”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/21/filipe-de-saavedra-docente-falta-um-centro-interpretativo-de-camoes-em-macau/</link><description>Professor at the University of Science and Technology of Macao and a scholar of the presence of Camões in Asia, Philip de Saavedra understands that Macau is missing an interpretative center about the poet's life and work. The academic spoke yesterday at the National Library in Lisbon, about the correspondence written by Luís de Camões in Asia
 
He participated yesterday at the “from Lisbon to Goa: What the Letters of Camões” participated. What path does the East arise portrayed in these letters, and who were directed?
The letters Camões wrote from Asia are in the order of the dozens. There is in them scholarship, philosophy, and also a lot of humor, sarcasm, and satire of humanist nature. Some were written from Ternate, others from Malaca, Macau, probably others from Cambodia, to recipients in India and Portugal. With the exception of the letters of Goa, where the identification of the writing site is generally present, maping those that were written during the rest of it would be a complex task. They are only given as written in Asia.
Can you give examples of written letters in this context?
I mention here two of the first he sent to the kingdom. The epistle whose first line is “The Poet Simony speaking” was written in January 1554, when Camões has just arrived in Goa, destined for his pupil, D. António de Noronha. It is a very emotional letter, giving it the storm that had plagued the Armada in the Cape of Good Hope, "seeing the death of the before me." Camões survived this limit experience aboard the São Bento ship, the only one to arrive that year to Goa, and which was lost in the turn of the Christmas lands, dying in this second bid the Captain Fernão de Álvares Cabral, and many of those who traveled with him. In addition to the news of his salvation, the poet was equally eager to tell his friend the expedition of D. Afonso de Noronha to Malabar, in which he had taken part in the previous month. In Irenal pages, Camões vehemently condemns the massacre of the few native troops by the “thick armed” of the disproportionate vice-king army. In his radical compliment of peace, the poet calls "true remedy" to the early death that cure the war crazes of those who want to live "by knights", for "who will walk by following the fero Mars always brings their eyes to their danger." Cruelly prophetic words: by irony of fate, at the moment the poet wrote these lines and sent them, that recipient diletus, for whose life he feared, already lay, lying during a military foray in Ceuta on April 29, 1553, only 17 years old.
And the second letter?
A year later, in January 1555, he wrote to a friend a different epistle in tone and in purpose, whose first line is "I wished so much", where he evoked the shock he suffered from the death of D. António, gathering a sonnet that had composed to his memory. It is clear that Camões also had great intimacy with this correspondent, who knew D. António and the poetry of Camões, Petrarch and Boscán. Interestingly, the letter includes some male lines, which Camões says they are mandatory in private letters, containing what can be called a resort conversation, so being worship or scholar did not prevent it if it were "bon vivant".
The presence of Camões in Macau is still wrapped in a certain myth. What are the concrete tests of your presence in the territory?
It is necessary to separate the waters. The landing of Camões in Patane's busty, then called “cave”, is surrounded by a beautiful legendary aura. But the presence of Camões in Macao, this is not involved in "myth", is a factual and historical reality, founded on a wide variety of testimonies, all independent of each other. Insisting on a chronology that contained in the sources, but which was flagrantly erroneous, it was deliberately sought to confuse the doubts that could have about his permanence in the sinned, although unjustified, with false doubts about the poet's stay in Macau, which are laughable and devoid of the minimum foundation. The joke ran a swimming, and little by little it was embedded in the collective imagination, to the point that some less informed people take it for a supposed “discovery” recent. However, nonsense was released in 1907, and soon dismantled in 1911 by Jordan de Freitas. Judge Eduardo Ribeiro put more “points in the iis” in this regard. In your time I will publish the full documentation about the presence of Camões in Macao, putting a definitive end to the mythical “myth”.
What life did Camões in Macau?
We can say that these two years were those of the greatest professional, economic and affective in his life. Is it written poetry? Constantly, as the dimension of the work attests. A significant part of “the Lusíadas” was composed here, although the poem had neither began nor ended in Macao. Not least in his life was that it was in Macao who publicly assumed a relationship with a young Chinese, most exactly the Tanka ethnicity of poor fishermen. This asymmetrical connection is not surprising and with a modest young woman: only disadvantaged families would not prevent daughters from relate to foreigners. This explains the fact that she left with Camões in 1565 to Goa, with concubine status. But the private vessel in which they followed, belonging to Chinese merchants, suffered a wreck by Cambodia, and Camões lost there the “kind lamp I loved so much”. It was only after his death that he would come to chrisma as Denamene, a Greek nymph of the waters, so that she could live forever in the ocean. The Chinese of Macao have a special relationship with Camões, such as the Portuguese and the Macanese.
How is this relationship?
It existed in the eighteenth century in Macao the first monument in honor of Camões, something that in Portugal only began to think about the following century. He even received an inscription on Chinese, and even a Chinese pavilion was built on his sanctuary. The Viscount of Juromenha says that in 1845 the Viceroy of Canton and Imperial Commissioner Ki-A there was worshiped Camões as the “Portuguese Confucius”. And rightly, Camões shares many aspects of the sages of Chinese tradition: he established a dialogue with the masters through the recreation of larger works, cultivated a millennial tradition (he gloss two thousand years prior to his own time), practiced itinerary as a source of "sagesse", said the primacy of poetry, conceived the rivers as mythical entities, even personifying them, even personifying them, even He showed a marked tendency to moralize, and epitomously his thinking in masterful sentences.
What connection did Camões have with Goa?
Unlike Macao, Goa raised in Camões mostly negative feelings. The first impressions he had, like a lawless land in which only the little turns were worse, could not have been worse, as read in the initial letter to which he alluded: "long land, from all the poor honorable grave." In the second letter, he goes on, "I can say that it is the mother of bad villains, and stepmother of honorable men." These impressions would not improve over time, as corroborated the satire that led to the expulsion to Ternate in 1556. Goa, where he became the deputy protected, to fall later in the greatest disfavor under D. Antão de Noronha, was in his texts the inverted mirror of the Kingdom, the corrupt and corrupt Babylon, theil of God, and the betrayal of God, King and the law. In what is not original, as there are other sources that reinforce this Jeremiac and apocalyptic portrait of the capital of the Portuguese East Empire. Remember Bocage: "From the land to worst you are, O goa." This said, obviously that he will also have lived there sweethearts, especially under the viceroyalty of his protectors, and in living with some companions of the poetic lines that then lived there, and which he evokes in the so-called “feast of trovas”. To one of these cultured spirits, the poet Luís Franco, even a copy of his almost complete works, including the 'self of filodemo' that had composed there, that they could be saved if another adversity survived in the kingdom to the kingdom.

Do you think Portugal should pay more attention to your writings, streamlining your work more? How?
In Lisbon it is necessary to build a great literary museum dedicated to Camões and its creations. The ideal place will be the Convent of St. Bento de Xabregas, where his friend Dom António had a grave at the Pantheon of the Line Chapel. Also in Goa the statue of Camões left for exile in the cruelly called “Archaeological Museum”, which is not the appropriate place to end the poetry or image of a poet. Being the greatest intangible heritage of Macau, Camões has been poorly enjoyed in this region. multimedia.
What about Macau? Is Camões studied at higher education?
Two students from the Macao University of Sciences and Technology will now defend their master's theses. The first is an in -depth technical study of the translation of Zhang Weim of the Camões Odes. The second runs through the literary survival of the figure of Dinamene in contemporary Portuguese fiction, and are both excellent, bringing novelty.</description><pubDate>2025-05-21 22:42:45</pubDate></item><item><title>Rui Leão, architect and co-author of “Layering the City” | A four -hand city</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/16/rui-leao-arquitecto-e-co-autor-de-layering-the-city-uma-cidade-a-quatro-maos/</link><description>Architects Rui Leão and Carlotta Bruni have accumulated many drawings over the years, which have now been materialized in “Layering the City”, a work that was released last week at the Venice Architecture Biennial. The book results from two lives dedicated to architecture and two doctoral theses defended at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology
 
How does the initiative come to publish “Layering the City”, which makes the retrospective of your work a little?
This project is born from a dialogue between my dissertation thesis and Carlotta [Carlotta Bruni's] dissertation thesis, who both take different aspects of our contribution as architects to Macau, to the city. And therefore, the project of this book is the encounter of these two theses.
The title of the book refers to the idea of ​​a town in layers.
No, what happens is that in the case of our views, my and Carlotta, there is work brought by each one to the project, and which gives a response to the programmed request, what the client asks, to what lives in the alignment plant [of the project], or a series of questions at civic, public space or the right to quality of life. There are a number of social dimensions [to take into account] to make spaces for people, even when they are impossible [in terms] of politics and in the city. It is these layers that go into the projects and that, deep down, are creating opportunities to qualify the life of the city, the person, the street. And this has nothing to do with those who pay, it has to do with the management that the architect makes in the city through the project. It is these layers, the layers, in which the architect is enriching what is the project's offer to the city and creates several micro-projects within this larger project, which qualify the ride, social spaces and public space in a way that was not requested.
Therefore, in a project of architecture always persists the idea of ​​the people and the spaces they inhabit.
In the case of Macau there is this extreme situation where the public space is always the minimum, with a narrow walk, and where everything is resolved. Because there is a lack of more public space profile in the city, this management done by the architect through the project turns out to be a way to compensate for the city, to reconcile people with it, or the opposite.
The cover of the book refers to Fai Chi Kei's public housing project. I assume that they consider the project one of the great milestones of your studio.
Undoubtedly. This was the first large housing building in collective terms, where we had the opportunity to apply ideas that we had developed to the public space, in Praça do Lago, or even in the park next door. All of these projects have a lot of involvement with the public space and this was our first initiative with a housing program. We did a number of super important experiences that allowed us to demonstrate that it was possible to qualify public housing. We produce a series of gardens, packets, air gardens in various floors [from the building]. We were collecting the floors two to two and four to four to create communities inside the building, almost like a Chinese pharmacy that has drawers, social interaction sites since the bottom floor, and so on. All of this has been worked with small public terraces present throughout the project, and in this respect, it is very innovative. It is, in fact, a demonstration that, whether it is a housing building or a museum, it can indeed contribute to the qualification of people's lives. Any [architecture program, in order to order or contract] it serves for the architect to act on the project.
What other projects are in this book?
We have the Barra station and the intermodal zone [related to the light meter]. There are two projects, for us, very important, because they also come to reconfirm the ability to overlap many and many layers. In the case of Barra Station, there is also a public park on top, and the two marginals, the historic and the new. It is an all -glass, transparent project that allows me to be on the side of the slaughterhouse and see the river and boats through the glass. The building turns out to be a kind of octopus that makes ground level connections, with the gardens around the season that connect with the roof. There is a certain complexity, in which almost a new city system is created and there is at the same time a trial overlap of the train, buses and the passing people. The book also has projects that are not yet built.
What was it like to combine the content of your doctoral thesis with that of Carlotta Bruni?
The book consists of texts by some critics about our work. There is a text by Jorge Figueira, for example, and a great interview conducted by Ana Vaz Milheiro [Academic] and then has our texts.
Is there a presence by architect Manuel Vicente in this work?
Manuel Vicente is very present, because some of these projects were made in partnership with him. Therefore, there is a continuity of these first projects for those who came next, already without Manuel Vicente, and who is very polished for us. Deep down, it has to do with what we not only inherited, but what we brought with us from Manuel.
Presenting this work at the Venice Architecture Biennial, and considering that the MSAR is also represented with an exhibition, is it important for your work and visibility of the studio?
Yes. The idea of ​​publication, with Barcelona's Actar Books, has to do with putting the work, and more than that, its message, which is very specific to Macau and our way of working in the international and architects community, and this goes a lot through the Biennial. It was also in Europe that a consensus was built on the level of descriptions [in architecture] for a few centuries, and where there is a discussion, national and international, around the issues of the profession. We want our work to be present, either through the book and through acting Books, in this international community, to be part of the world.
Leaves and layers
“Layering the City” intends to establish with the international community of architects and passionate about the profession a dialogue showing the last years of work and the vision of the LBA - Rui Leão and Carlotta Bruni's architecture and planning. The work is born of the intersection between two doctoral theses of the two architects: “Designing by Increments: Opportunistic Planning as Urban Strategy for Macau” (by Rui Leão) and “Shaping Macau’s Unpurposed Space: Design in Context” (by Carlotta Bruni).
According to a book presentation, "LBA's intellectual contributions are evidenced through the space narratives that integrate complex urban contexts with culturally sensitive design strategies."
The two architects and their team "emphasize the importance of creating spaces that harmonize with their surroundings, while responding to the functional needs of modern urban life." It is therefore a “particularly relevant approach in Macao, where the juxtaposition of the old and the new is a defining characteristic of the city”, it reads.</description><pubDate>2025-05-16 01:04:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Álvaro Barbosa, vice-rector of the University of São José: “Student visa is very limiting”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/07/alvaro-barbosa-vice-reitor-da-universidade-de-sao-jose-visto-de-estudante-e-muito-limitativo/</link><description>The University of São José continues the negotiation saga with the Chinese authorities to recruit students from the interior of China. Vice-rector Álvaro Barbosa expects, soon, the increase in master's students from 30 to 200. Regarding the internationalization of higher education, the official defends changes in student visas to facilitate recruitment
 
Does the recruitment of students from the interior of China remain a matter pending to the University of Saint Joseph?
It is a process that is underway. We have had huge support from the Macao government in negotiations to obtain the quota for our university, and they have been tireless in the effort to try to resolve the issues raised by the central government. Many of the questions are legitimate and concern concerns that arise. We were granted a temporary quota of 30 students for masters ago over a probative period, which served to evaluate how we, as Western University, would host students from China. From China, there is this concern with the host of students in Macau. I think we have made a huge effort and the students who are there, included in this contingent, are quite satisfied.
Is this quota for masters just?
Yes. For a degree we do not have authorization yet. In this way, we are currently at the time we try to overcome this probative period in order to obtain a quota of about 200 students for masters. We are in the final phase of the evaluation process and everything has been doing well. We will have the possibility that, next academic year, expand this quota. That would be great, because for our university, to have a greater impact of our mission in Macao, it is essential to have access to students from mainland China. We cannot be a university in an integrated region in a country like China, and not contact with students from China.
Is it more difficult for USJ to compete with other universities, such as those of Hong Kong, by foreign students, outside China?
The issue of recruitment of international students has become a priority for Macao universities. In the last two or three years, it has become evident that this internationalization is very important. What difficulty is there? There is the issue related to student visas, as these visas currently do not allow students to do any kind of work, denying them that minimum local subsistence mechanism to be able to meet expenses. Nor is it contemplated the possibility of, when the student concludes his formation, to be in the territory and find work. What all countries and regions that are competitive in higher education do, such as Singapore, Hong Kong or Australia, is to have incentive policies. Allow students to work part -time, for example. In Hong Kong when a degree ends, the student can stay in the territory up to a maximum of two years to find a job. This kind of measures do not yet exist in Macau, but I think the government is pondering this possibility. From the moment the decision was made that the internationalization of higher education was important, this must be accompanied with the corresponding measures. The current student visa is extremely limiting and does not encourage the coming to Macao to study, only allows coming. This issue was not as present as it is now, but now there is a strategic policy of internationalization.
It is also a matter of survival for local universities.
Yes. Perhaps there is no greater example of a catalyst for the diversification of Macau's economy than higher education. We have ten institutions, 60,000 students in about 700,000 inhabitants. This is the potential of internationalization, to foster diversification.

And also the research that comes out of higher education.
The investigation, the dynamics of the work that is done. There are a number of vectors that higher education brings to a region or country, this happened to Portugal, for example, with the policy of doctoral scholarships for students from abroad, which completely changed the dynamics of higher education. Cape Verde developed thanks to the impact of higher education.
Then we need to make the system more flexible in Macau.
I don't know if it's a matter of having a holistic view of strategy. There may be an idea, but then it does not intervene in all the necessary dimensions to achieve a certain goal. But I am very optimistic. I believe this new student policy is a key step to be taken in Macau. The internationalization strategy followed by all these countries and regions I spoke, and were successful in capturing international students, was always the same. No need to invent much. First, one should increase the capacity and notoriety of universities, and then a policy of scholarships, which will enhance a student flow, creating a reference for the territory, so that studying there becomes a habit. After this flow of students for a few years, an image is already created and some scholarships can be removed, which students will continue to choose a particular territory to study in it. Australia has a huge higher education industry, for example, and I think that in Macau we just have to follow the same strategies. We do, at USJ, that a little.
How, in concrete terms?
We offer many scholarships, and in this sense the Diocese of Macao has helped us build this flow of international students that allow us to create this dynamic that we hope will be sustainable by itself in the future. I think the government is also doing this. There have always been scholarships in Macau, attributed mainly by the Macau Foundation, but this measure will be strengthened. Solving the student's visa issue, creating a scholarship incentive system for five to ten years, Macau will have a bright future as an international higher education destination. But we need to invest, continue, and it takes a few years.
USJ created the “Macau Hub” platform, in partnership with the Macau Scientific and Cultural Center (CCCM) in 2023. At what stage is this project?
This project has to do with our interest in developing a relationship dynamic of Lusophone countries centered in Lisbon in the area of ​​entrepreneurship, first. This cabinet we have at CCCM is not intended to offer training in Portugal, but we want to do something else. As we are positioned in the Great Bay and with Hengqin, where it is intended to activate a business ecosystem, we want to take advantage of the fact that we have relations with the Lusophone world to activate the access of the startups of Portugal, Brazil and Angola, above all, to the great bay and hengqin. We are trying to create a kind of incubator of transnational companies, in which we support the development of Lusophone businesses that want to settle in the large bay and also the reverse system. Strategically, for a university, it is absolutely fundamental to have a dynamic in the area of ​​entrepreneurship. Currently, more than half of our students do not want to go to the corporate world, but create their own businesses. Just as universities have to have employability solutions, they also have to have them for entrepreneurs, who are increasingly. So a university has to have a business incubator. My vision of the future for higher education goes around: a university, besides having a library and canteen, will also have its own business incubator. I would say that most students of management or economy courses dream of having their own business, especially in China. China is perhaps one of the most entrepreneurial countries in the world. The CCCM welcomes this initiative in Portugal, but we also work with the Portuguese Catholic University.
And concrete results, already have it?
We have a number of small initial projects that are starting now, and we also work with many business organizations. We have now negotiated a series of projects, and I think everything will develop very quickly, based on the manifestations of interest we have. We were in Angola in December and we have already aligned a series of initiatives, we also have projects with Brazil and Portugal.</description><pubDate>2025-04-07 22:56:36</pubDate></item><item><title>Adelina Moura, teacher and trainer: “The mobile phone is like a Swiss knife”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/07/adelina-moura-docente-e-formadora-o-telemovel-e-como-um-canivete-suico/</link><description>Graduated in the area of ​​educational technologies, Adelina Moura will conduct lectures to parents, students and teachers about the use of digital technologies in classrooms, within the “Letters &amp; Company” festival of the Portuguese Institute of the East. The teacher understands that prohibiting mobile phone in schools is not a solution
 
What are the challenges felt by teachers with the introduction of technologies in the classroom? Can the mobile phone actually be a complement to learning?
Yes. I've been saying this since 2005. The mobile phone can be an excellent learning tool, a means to motivate students and to enrich their learning. We have a kind of Swiss knife here, a very powerful equipment in the hands of the students and there is a school failure, because they do not work and help students enhance this equipment they have. What happens is that students learn in the worst way, in a destructed way, by attempt-rrove. There is a gap, as students are not alerted to the positive potential for mobile phone use. They face their mobile phones as a free time use, spending time on social networks and scrolling, and time consumes. It is essential that teachers are users, in their practices, mobile phones, and for the preparation of classes and other projects, to know how to prepare students. I consider that the school has lost several stages of students' preparation and awareness to use these equipment that lead to classes and with which schools have not spent any money. With the prohibition of bringing the mobile phone to the classroom we did not advance anything in this regard.
During the pandemic period, for example, the use of technologies, with distance learning, was quite enhanced.
But during the pandemic we also burned some steps regarding the use of digital by teachers, because before the pandemic many teachers did not believe or used. They thought it was a fashion and they saw no use in the use of mobile phones and other technologies. With the pandemic the use of these equipment proved that without them the situation of education would have been much worse. In these pandemic years, teachers have become more aware of the technologies that already exist and are available to anyone. With internet access on mobile phone, something that has existed since 2007 with the launch of the first iPhone, the e-learning system is enhanced and then we move to “Mobile Learning”, where you can learn anywhere and anytime with mobile devices. It is this reality that we see a little away from school.
And after the pandemic, how has it been?
I think we will take a few more steps towards digital literacy. With Artificial Intelligence (IA), it seems that we are as in the phase I created my first website in 1999 or email in 1995. We are at the beginning. But it is 30 years of technology where there have been many changes, and technology in fact goes on and if we immediately do not realize what we have available, we and students, we help create a moat that has happened in the past compared to digital. In the face of AI, if we do not look back and do not realize what was not done and should have been at school level, we are wasting time. Only a few years from now will people be alert to AI, and the gap is increasing. Hence it is very important to bet now, in this early stage, in the training of teachers, students and families.
Is there much ignorance of parents, removal from this reality?
We have parents who are from this century. That is, they were born with the existence of computers, internet, saw the appearance of the smartphone. But when they studied, the school did not talk about the potential of digital. So these former students came to society and did not bring this sensitivity to digital, to educate their children. We teachers, when we do digital training, are doing good to society because we are also preparing these young people for the future, because they will be parents and should be aware of educating their children. At school we do not only prepare for the job market, but for personal and family life. Hence teacher education is essential. The invitation I received from IPOR seems to me an excellent holistic view of everything, because the school includes several actors, connecting with society.
How should AI be introduced into the classroom?
We currently watch changes in search engines, in fact. We have search engines created from root to Age Age, for example. The best way to introduce AI into the classroom is to ask students and how they use it, and already resort to this tool. At the beginning of the academic year I always ask students to answer a questionnaire about their digital routines, and then I know more or less their practices. In 2023, when the chatgPT came out, I introduced AI in my classes, and realized that students were using this tool to deceive the teachers. Students have to realize that when using AI, they are falling into a certain trap because they are not learning. It is the law of the lowest effort, equal to the phase in which the internet emerged, when students selected, copied and sent to the teacher. We now have the problem that the answers are in Brazilian Portuguese, for example, and I see soon that AI was used. We have, therefore, to dismantle this action in the heads and face them. I tell them that they are being intellectually dishonest and that they have not read the AI ​​response, for example. Since 2023, I feel that students, in the answers to this questionnaire I do, say they are afraid to use chatgpt because they are afraid of being caught by teachers. That is, it seems to have gained some conscience.
It will give these lectures in a different educational context in Asia, where the use of mobile phone can be earlier. How will you deal with these differences, or do you understand that the problems of using technology in the classroom are transversal?
It is a transverse question. Do we have to wonder if the use of a particular equipment and tool will make us wiser? It seems to me not, because we may have the equipment, but the use we make it varies a lot. I tell my students that they should be ashamed, because they have much easier access to content than in my time, when we truly had to do research and read in physical format. I tell them that with this technology they should all have a grade 20, and that they are wasting resources, being dishonest intellectually, because they sign works that are not theirs and do not read, even, they deliver. One of the works we have with students is to teach them how to make bibliographic references, refer to the sources. But I am an optimistic by nature, and I hope that in a decade, secondary education students who are fathers and mothers will be able to deal with these problems of social networks and increase fraud with their children. It is this “parents school” that the school can help create. We are in a moment with no return from digital, and forbidding is the most comfortable situation, but it is not the best to face reality. We have to use the right words to alert. We have in this time of alerts and consciences, encouraging the critical spirit of our students, which is little today.

He is a man with a provocative speech, a corrosive, kind mood and a smile that leaves no one indifferent
Gitelles, we live in an intercultural land and the Gypsies - in particular - have lived about five centuries in Portugal. What is going on for Gypsy communities to remain “on the fringes” of the so -called society? 
The model of society remains to be changed. This is extremely stratified by placing people in subordinate places to privilege a violent minority. The white social structure is patriarchal and racist. What is called the "margin" of society is actually an intrinsic place to it, which belongs to it. In other words, Gypsy people have been included in this model of society since they discovered Europe and its kingdoms. The problem is the model of society that is maintained and the place to which they were relegated and how they were relegated: with violence, in inferior status against whites, without the right to human dignity, to constitute a family, to choose one's own language and religion, expropriated from any and all cultural and material law. A place built and maintained to this day by violence and genocidal and ethnicidal persecution. In 1463, a Gitano Vasco was drowned to an estate. In 1521, Gitans, or Gypsies, were already used as a reference for all that is considered bad in the model of society. The "counter-exemple" in the face of the white that would stand out for the positive. The 'angel' and the 'devil'; the 'other', the enemy; That against whom any attack and persecution is legitimate. Including the prohibition of defending, having weapons, any kind of goods, and the right of permanence.
And is this right to permanence that we still have nomadic gypsy communities within the country is denied?
Yes, no doubt. There are many ways to force nomadism: directly, prohibiting permanence and expelling with police or military force; indirectly, refusing public or private housing to Gypsy people, as they are Gypsy; and even through the gentrification process.
I read the result of an inquiry from the European Union Fundamental Rights Agency, which is said to be approximately 80% of the Gypsies responded to the risk threshold of poverty in their country; One in three Gypsies lives in a housing without channeled water; One in three Gypsies belongs to a family where someone hungry at least once the previous month; and 50% of Gypsies aged 6 to 24 do not attend school. Why does this happen like this? 
It is the historical persecution, which continues. There is no impoverishment that has no external cause. In this case, a political system of total expropriation and imposed on the basis of violence. Already in 1648, D John IV, the restorer, prohibited ‘Giving or Rent houses to Gypsies’. The same D John IV who got the kingdom of Portugal thanks to D. Jerónimo da Costa and his 250 knights. The same D. Jerónimo da Costa who had died to defend Portugal's independence from Castile. Gypsy, like his wife and children. Between prohibitions of permanence, “that do not enter Gypsies in the Kingdom and leave those who are” (D John III, 1526), ​​with expulsions, degred to the galleys, expropriation of goods and properties, imposed with stripping, mutilation and death, systematically performed to this day (still in 2011 Faro City Council wanted to ban Gypsies in the municipality).
The prohibition of working on others (no one employs Gypsy workers, and those who accept they do it in total precariousness, for poorly paid positions and without decent rights and conditions). They cannot be dependent on their own work, they cannot get investment means due to extreme expropriation. Are dependent on precariousness. If you want to know what it is like to live in pure neoliberalism, know the lives of Gypsies. Their reality is paradigmatic of the aggression and depletion to which the "gentlemen" are willing to go to their benefit.
What do you talk about is economic and political power?
The group of political, social, cultural and economic power. The owner, the colonizer. This group that has been in power since it established the system of current domination. And that only makes sense within the hierarchically stratified sociopolitical model in which we live. Hence the need to end 'gentlemen' and institute a new model of society, healthy, free, without hierarchies or strata, whether of race, class or gender.
The model we live in leads to the Gypsy (and not only) community to economic exclusion, removing it from access to product consumption or excluding them from its production process; political exclusion associated with lack of access to information; To education and consequently the social exclusion that is seen in inequality of access to quality community areas such as restaurants, libraries, theater, cinema, concerts, health care, etc. How do you feel a gypsy child when you realize that it is not part of a whole? Children who are never represented, neither in movies, nor in books, nor in cartoons, not even in an announcement to eat cereals, for example? Is this a disaster for self-esteem, is a priori condemnation?
The question is that. Gypsy people are not “excluded from society”, by contrast, they are included in it. The problem is the existence of what is cynically called 'social exclusion', which term Orwellian, and there be under coercion, people. Which field of concentration and extermination. Incidentally, Nazi concentration camps are a more visual realization than called 'social exclusion' and, as here, were not a 'excluded' part of Nazi society, but rather its fundamental and characterizing structure. It is a place of violence, where people are maintained by violence, dedicated to their extermination, and designed so that few people can leave. And yet they resist. As in Nazi concentration camps.
And what you have listed as an example of 'consequence' of this 'exclusion', is actually the means by which this exclusion also happens and remains. Gypsy people are out of theaters, both as consumers and producers (but go to the cinema). They are out of school, education and the gym. Either as 'users' or as producers (but go to school and are on the basis of knowledge construction and academic and scientific debates).
Even in attacking Gypsy children's self -confidence, we talk about a maintenance mechanism of this situation. But Gypsy people respond very well: with Gypsy pride. Another resistance, another aggression. Gypsy people are thus included in society. In a place that belongs to this model of modern society. And they resist and contradict the power of domination and make a point of being in the city, in the cinema, in the theater, in the gym, in all spaces. With a lot of struggle and always resisting, but they are there. Social exclusion, more than a “place outside of society”, is part of its social structure.
Do you want to say that there is a collective resistance?
At work, already in a context of absolute precariousness, during the pandemic, Gypsy people rolled up sleeves and showed once again proactivity and creativity in adversity. They learned seeing and doing. And here, it is again the women who jump to the front line, face, learn to use digital tools with their daughters or children, and throw themselves into the network. And so they explore online sales as well as application by application (transportation or rehabs). In housing, in a context of pandemic in which the evictions were not locked - as they owed and dictated the law itself - residents did not fail to organize and fight unjust evictions and claim dignity in housing; associations of allied residents in their action with other housing and anti-racist struggle organizations.
It should also be noted how they reinvented and intensified to raise and distribute dietary goods and kits of masks/alcohol gel to the most expropriated people. Gypsies and non -Gypsies. In the anti-racist struggle, new movements emerged and their actions intensified by social networks. People who had never been organized or militated before began their first steps in activism, thickening this way of the organization and popular gypsy and anti-racist action. People forget, or do not want to value, but Gypsy action has helped determine results in the political dispute. Gypsy citizens mobilized in large and determined electoral results in the municipalities of 2017, both in Alentejo and in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area, even causing electoral earthquakes.
And even in the presidential, second place was resolved by a value equivalent to the estimated number of Gypsy voters. Apart from the non -Gypsy votes that were mobilized by the action of Gypsy voters. Gypsy people are even co-considering power in the spaces of opinion, local media, social networks and party and institutional political dispute. And most importantly, in the popular Ação and alliances with other social movements. We have never stopped fighting for all means and continuing to resist.
In contrast there are more and more hate speeches, from the far right in particular. What do you have to say about it?
To start these speeches are historical and European. Not even current and even less “of the far right”. These speeches have been adopted and rendered for a long time, even in 'democracy and freedom', by several representatives of the center right, conservatives, left center, liberal, liberal left, even representatives of the PCP. Anti-egana rhetoric has always worked in Portugal as it is the whiter rhetoric [white genesis]. That is, it allows you to create and give the "white" as the superior of all. And so please the white electorate who, when feeling well, pays off with his vote. Even if the policies implemented by their elected harm him even more.
Finally, did you like them to talk a little about your personal experience and how did you get to the activist?
I studied, fought for studies, made alliances, graduated, went in the labor market of the “formal precariousness”. I started my militant action and here I am today. We can transform this society a better. This certainty combined with the fact that the current one has so much suffering makes anyone want to have a transformist attitude. I wanted to be 'inventor' (physical engineer) and anti -racist militant. And through study (not necessarily schooling) and organization with others, in turn, with other studies, formations and visions, I learned how the world works and how it can be changed. But before transforming, we need to survive.
Hence two types of actions arise: transformative and survival. The struggle against hate discourse arises as survival, but his defeat will be a transformative victory. There is a lot that - like people who want a better world - we have to do, namely working to criminalize hatred speech; condemn and prohibit organizations with racist discourses and practices; denounce the racist institutional structure and logics that organize power and generate community resources. And in this sense, there have been various types of actions, of petitions, to manifestations. And we need more.
I, besides being a military man in the SOS Racism movement, participate in the “We came to stay” podcast, with Mamadou BA and Joseph da Silva. And if all goes well, we will soon start a new project. With friendly people, we also have the project “Gypsy Initiative”, dedicated to reflecting and promoting transformative movements. Essentially focused on educating against anti-agigarism, denouncing historical and continued genocide and working for a new society project. Also with new projects on the gutter. And finally, there are always voluntary actions without an organization, where I try to share what I found out about anti-egism and Roman history in schools and with interested people. In addition, there is still the struggle for housing, because the evictions did not stop during the pandemic. Due to housing and work precariousness, the subjects racialized especially the Roma nationals are the most vulnerable to COVID-19. There is essential to have actions in this area; Of all the struggles, this is the most structural, as it goes against one of the main enemies of a healthy society: the real estate speculation of this capitalist system, which places profit and goods above people and their humanization.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>GP | Jaguar that won in Macau in 1984 returned to the tracks</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/06/gp-jaguar-que-venceu-em-macau-em-1984-regressou-as-pistas/</link><description>The more than seventy years of history of the Macau Grand Prix are people, machines and great moments. We were in 1984, when Tom Walkinshaw won Jaguar's only victory in the guide race. After years away from the audience, for the affected man, this same car returned to the tracks at the hands of an enthusiast of the MSAR MOTOR EVENT
 
Richard Meins, an English maritime transport entrepreneur who lived many years in Hong Kong, who participated on several occasions at the Macao Grand Prix, led this Jaguar XJs of Group A in the Historic Touring Car Challenge race, a competition for classics during the Donington Historic Festival. This “Big Cat”, Chassis No. 5 and one of the four original XJs still existing, is practically as it was in 1984, but given the limitations of tobacco advertising, today boasts the colors used in the European Tourism Championship, instead of the iconic black and gold decoration of John Player Special (JPS) that marked the ticket through the guide circuit.
Interestingly, this return to the clues, from a car that has been still in New Zealand and Japan, was scheduled for the Algarve International Race Track, but the Historic Touring Car Challenge canceled its race in early April in Portimão. So it was in lands of his majesty that Richard Meins made his first race with the British car.
“The car won in Macao in 1984, so I'm a big fan of this model,” Ricard Meins told the English magazine Motorsport News. “I still have the photographs I took this weekend in Macao,” said this avid classic competition car collector who, besides driving, supported several riders at the Macao Grand Prix.
In Donington Park, Richard Meins shared the imposing Jaguar XJS, equipped with a 5.3 -liter V12 engine with Jack Tetley, and ended in sixth place, winning in his class. Richard Meins had only guided the car once or twice, but plans to participate in more historic touring car challenge rounds with XJS 1984. “Let's try to put it on track more often now,” Ricard Meins said, who revealed that he was a stake in the Silverstone Festival in August with this very rare and striking copy of the 1980s tourism cars history.
Premiere of an iconic decoration
In the summer of 1984, Tom Walkinshaw accepted the challenge of the Portuguese organization of the Grand Prix to travel later this year to Macau. With the European title in his pocket, the English driver and team boss was accompanied by one of his usual riders, German Hans Heyer. The guide race was a BMW fiefdom and the controversial English wanted to put an end to the Bavarian domain in the race. To this end, it had the precious support of JPS, which was relaunching the brand, decorating its cars with the famous black and gold colors that would later be eternalized in Ayrton Senna's Lotus. At the time, the guide race took place three weeks before 1000 km from Bathurst, another important race on the worldwide calendar of tourist racing, and so TWR made a "two in one."
The 100 -mile race on the streets of Macau would not have much history, such as the cars built in the Kidlington workshops against the competition headed by the two BMW 635i Schnitzer officers, guided by Hans Stuck and Dieter Quester, and painted by rival Marlboro. Tom Walkinshaw ended first and Hans Heyer and m second.
At the end of the race, quoted by the Portuguese newspaper Autosport, Tom Walkinshaw said: “The circuit is fantastic. Tight, but with many curves, climbs and descents, which made the race become difficult. But I like difficult things and, for me, the race was great from beginning to end.
The Jaguar were again invited by the Macao Grand Prix committee to run in 1985, but Tom Walkinshaw had other plans for his cars. Fortunately, thanks to Richard Meins we will continue to see this beautiful car on the tracks.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>MOTOR EMBALISM | Project for new track in Zhuhai emerges</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/30/automobilismo-surge-projecto-para-nova-pista-em-zhuhai/</link><description>With a very black cloud to turn to the future of the Zhuhai International Circuit, there is a potential good news for the great bay of motoring: a project for a new permanent circuit in the Chinese city adjacent to the MSAR.
According to Hong Kong's Ta Kung Pao newspaper, Guangdong's provincial government recently published the document “Measures to promote high quality tourism and accelerate the construction of a strong tourist province”, which proposes, for the first time, the creation of an “industrial circle of culture and tourism of the Great Bay”, offering political support to the integrated development of culture and tourism in the region. With this, the first industrial and tourist complex of motorized sports in the Great Bay may emerge.
The project of the Zhuhai Chaoyue international circuit was recently presented at the Zhuhai Ocean Spring Resort, located in Doumen, not far from the city's airport, with an initial investment of 250 million Renminbis.
According to the first information, the project of this circuit provides for welcoming evidence such as Formula 3 and foster collaborative development between motorized sports sectors, cultural events and exhibition industry. The plan includes the holding of several international tests per year and foresees collaboration with Hong Kong and Macau to connect cities such as Jiangmen and Zhongshan, promoting “Multiple stops” and boosting the innovative development of “Event Economics + Cultural Tourism”.
According to Zhou Jian, China Travel Service (Zhuhai) Executive Director General Ocean Spring Resort Co., the FIA ​​grade certification-will also include a karting track, drift track and an interior space of 2,400 m² for exhibitions and events related to the automobile sector. With more than 50 international events projected annually, the goal is to become a "super IP" that joins running, leisure and tourism under the same concept.
The first phase of the Zhuhai Chaoyue International Circuit project will include international certification professionals, as well as support facilities. This project aims not only to fill “a gap in the high -end motorized sports sector in Zhuhai, but will also promote the modernization of the Great Bay's cultural, sports and tourist industries by conducting international racing and themed cultural events linked to motorsport.”
Uncertainties in the air
Last summer, the company Malay LBS Bina Group BHD announced that it sold its participation in the Zhuhai International Circuit (ZIC) - the first permanent circuit built in the interior of China - by 124.7 million ringits (about 214.15 million patacas). In a statement to Bursa Malaysia Securities BHD, the group reported that their subsidiary, Dragon Hill Corporation Ltd, sold all his participation in Lamdeal Investments Ltd (Lil) to Huafa Urban Operation (HK) Ltd, a well -known real estate operator. Lil Detinha 60 percent of Zhuhai International Circuit Limited (ZICL), circuit operator.
Raised in 1996 in order to receive the first major award from China from Formula 1 - something that never materialized - ZIC was still the initial motor of motoring in the country and a reference in Asian motorsport. Since its opening, it has welcomed several international evidence, such as the FIA ​​GT, A1 GP or the Intercontinental Le Mans Series. In recent years, track administration has chosen to organize its own events, abdicating the most costly international evidence.
Despite having received, in the past, auto competitions from MSAR, ZIC has been losing protagonism in local motorized sport, due to high prices, limited availability and reducing sports activity in favor of the most profitable commercial activities. The future of the circuit remains uncertain: it is only known that lease agreements between resident teams and the circuit have been frozen and are not being renewed. The track approval will also be about to expire, requiring a new certification to continue to receive competitions in the future.
However, on the weekend of June 14 and 15, the still only circuit of Zhuhai will host the third race of the Formula 4 China Championship season.</description><pubDate>2025-05-30 01:53:33</pubDate></item><item><title>GP | FIA AFINA REGIONAL Formula Rules</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/23/gp-fia-afina-regras-da-formula-regional/</link><description>The International Automobile Federation (FIA) took advantage of the holding of the Extraordinary General Assemblies and its annual conference to publish the Macao Grand Prix Regulation - FIA Regional Formula Cup of 2025. There are not many changes compared to 2024, but the changes introduced aim to browse gaps from the first edition of this competition in Macau
The twelve red flags during last year's qualification session called for the level of pilots at the Guide Circuit, which was the premiere of the FIA ​​regional formula in Macau regional formula. This happened after the controversial decision of the FIA ​​to consider that Formula 3 was no longer adequate to the Macao Citadino layout.
Unsurprisingly, the sports regulation is now clear that, to compete in the FIA ​​regional formula world, “all pilots must have participated at least 3 competitions with a monolugar that has been projected and/or built to achieve a weight/power ratio of more than 3.0 kg/hp.”
Emanuele Pirro, a former F1 pilot, winner of the Guide Race and president of the FIA ​​monoligai committee, said during the weekend of the 71st edition that, in the future, the FIA ​​will be more demanding about track discipline. Thus, from now on, “any pilot who, in the opinion of sports commissioners, is solely responsible for the display of a red flag during the qualification training session, will not be able to continue to participate in this session and its best time back can be annulled.” The new regulation also states that “if a qualification training session is interrupted with less than four minutes remaining, it will not be restarted.”
On the other hand, the FIA ​​maintains the limit in the participation of more experienced pilots, except only “pilots who participated in a maximum of 3 FI F2 Championship competitions of 2025.” This measure goes a little against the spirit and history of the Great Prize, which has always gathered pilots from higher categories in its main race. In fact, this was a fervent question between Macao and the International Federation on two previous occasions.
In 1985, Alfredo César Torres, then responsible for Portuguese motorsport, convinced Jean-Marie Balestre, against his will, to allow the participation of F1 pilots in the F3 Intercontinental Cup in the name of the economic viability of the race. In 2016, the controversy returned with the veto da FIA to the participation of Nelsinho Piquet, a decision badly received by the teams and then coordinator Barry Bland, which would eventually abandon the co-organization of the race a year later.
Bet on continuity
In sports terms, registrations for this second edition of the FIA ​​regional formula Cup will remain open until July 30. The grill may include a maximum of 27 Tatuus regional formula monologues, all equipped with Alfa Romeo engines built by the Italian Autotechnic. Pirelli will once again be the official tire supplier.
The identities of the invited teams have not yet been revealed, but some news is expected in this field compared to 2024. To avoid any behind -the -scenes disputes, it has already been defined that “the position on the boxes for the teams that participate in the Macao Grand Prix will be based on the ranking of the previous year” and, in turn, “the position on the roads to new teams will be attributed based on the order of the application.”
Equal awards and more restricted advertising
The values ​​of monetary awards remain unchanged this year, with a total of US $ 68,500 to distribute, the equivalent of just over 550,000 patacas at the current exchange rate. The race winner will receive $ 12,000, an amount that is still far from covering the costs of participation in this nature.
On the other hand, the sports regulation introduces two new prohibitions on advertising into the monoligales. In addition to the existing prohibition of advertising to fortune or bad luck, tobacco or pornography, also the promotion of electronic cigarettes and alcoholic beverages - a measure that follows the legislation in force in the territory.
The 72nd Macao Grand Prix, the largest international sports event of the MSA, will take place between November 13 and 16, 2025.</description><pubDate>2025-06-23 03:31:16</pubDate></item><item><title>FIA | Conference helped perceive future of motorsport</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/13/fia-conferencia-ajudou-a-perceber-futuro-do-automobilismo/</link><description>For the first time in its history, in 2025, Macau welcomed the Extraordinary General Assemblies and Conference of the International Automobile Federation (FIA). Organized in partnership with the Macau-China General Association (AAMC), the FIA-affiliated sports territory, and Galaxy Entertainment Group, this event brought together more than five dozen FIA senior delegates from 147 countries in the field.
 
In the Galaxy International Convention Center, to this day, the future of motoring and mobility worldwide is discussed. However, some details about the future of sport in the territory have already been revealed between the lines. Focused on obtaining information about the growth of motorsport and promoting safe, sustainable and accessible mobility to everyone in the Asia Pacific region, the FIA ​​conference opening session highlighted the importance of communication and collaboration, as well as the region's ability to innovate and create solutions that respond to specific questions it faces.
Roberto Carlos Osório, president of the Macau-China General Automotive Association (AAMC), said the association has a strong tradition in motor racing and that following FIA's guidelines is being able to grow rapidly competition at the base level in the region.
“We organized the first GT Macau Cup in 2008,” said the AAMC leader. "Currently, we also have the GT Cup - Great Bay Race for GT4 cars. In addition, in 2008, we created Road Sport Challenge," he explained. “And today, in 2025, we are proud to announce that we have 68 tourism cars in the region to compete in the qualification race to enter the 72nd Macao Grand Prix.”
In a year when AAMC celebrates 30 years of existence - was born as Macao Automobile Club - we also learned that the association's bet for the future will be in the basic disciplines of motor sport. Roberto Carlos Osorio also revealed a curious fact: Macau has 135 pilots with sports license from the territory.
“This growth was achieved following FIA's guidelines to promote grassroots motorsport and create accessible races for riders in the region,” added the manager of the territory. “With the interest of pilots, teams and promoters in developing state-of-the-art activities in Macau, we will focus even more on base competitions and affordable races, not only to support tourism, but also to make Macau in a Karting international center of international events, where champions can be selected for F4 and, later, for regional formula.”
Confirmed GP program
The Macao Grand Prix Organizing Committee (COGPM) held a press conference on June 8 at the Macao Grand Prix Museum to confirm the 72nd Macao Grand Program races, which will take place from November 13 to 16 this year.
As last year, there will be seven races in total, respectively, the Macao Grand Prix - FR da Fia World Cup, the GT Macao Cup - FIA GT World Cup, the Macao Guide Race - Kumho Fia TCR World Tour Event of Macau, the Formula 4 Formula 4 World Cup, the 57th Macao Motor Motor Prize, GT Cup - Great Bay Race (GT4) and Macao Roadsport Challenge. For the first time, the guide circuit receives four different cups under the FIA ​​seal on the same weekend.
Other news
Between meetings and communications, other information was revealed about the November edition of the Macao Grand Prix. The FIA ​​World Council approved in Macao that the winner of the first Formula 4 World Cup of the FIA ​​will receive two points for the super license. We have also noticed that Pirelli will equip all the monologes that participate in both the FIA ​​Formula 4 World Cup and the FIA ​​regional formula World Formula Cup. In turn, the supply of tires and fuel to the FIA ​​GT World Cup remains in the contest phase.
Registration for the Formula 4 World Cup will be open until July 30. The final selection of 20 pilots will be confirmed by the FIA ​​through an official invitation letter, taking into account the current classification of the pilots in the respective championships.
In the case of the FIA ​​Regional Formula World Cup, registrations will also remain open until July 30, and the grill will be able to host a maximum of 27 Tatuus regional formula -equipped with alpha Romeo engines built by the autotechnic. As with Formula 4, participation will be by invitation, with priority assigned to pilots who have reached the best positions in the five regional formula championships of 2025.</description><pubDate>2025-06-13 18:43:57</pubDate></item><item><title>Macao's historicals get a GP clearance</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/20/historicos-de-macau-conseguem-apuramento-para-gp/</link><description>The Guangdong International Circuit welcomed, last weekend, the second and decisive double journey of Macao - Macau Road Sport Challenge cars, proof of finding for the most important motor racing of the season: the Macao Grand Prix. In a journey with few celebration reasons for the colors of the sinters, the veterans Jerónimo Badaraco and Rui Valente managed to ensure the qualification.
With a list of 68 subscribers, the grill was divided into two groups, A and B, with all the pilots competing with Toyota Gr86 (ZN8) or Subaru BRZ (ZD8) models. This year, with only one race scheduled for the Grand Prix Program - due to the inclusion of the FIA ​​Formula 4 World Cup - the number of riders was reduced to 36, which placed a supplementary pressure for both missing races. To complicate, the rain came, changing the turns to teams and riders.
In Group A, where Rui Valente faced a complicated weekend on the track around Zhaoqing, Célio Alves Dias and Maximiano Mannão failed to qualify, in a series dominated by Hong Kong riders. In Saturday's race, the podium consisted of Wong Chuck Pan, Lo Pak Yu and Chan Ka Ping. On Sunday, these three repeated the feat, but with a new order: Lo Pak Yu, Chan Ka Ping and Wong Chuck Pan.
In difficult atmospheric conditions on Saturday, Rui Valente ended only 25th, due to an error in tuning, improving to 15th on Sunday, with the track dry. A penalty after the second race fired him to the 27th place. Still, the 7th place obtained on the first round was enough to secure a place in the Macao Grand Prix.
On the contrary, Maximiano Mannão, behind the wheel of a Toyota with the colors of the historic Macau Racing Team, ended on 26th and 14th, a result below the finding, but it turns out to be positive given that it was Jove Pilot's debut in these wanderings. Célio Alves Dias, with difficulties in his car since the first race, was 24th and 28th, far from the usual level of this experienced Macaense pilot.
Badaraco with final sprint '
On a weekend, where the lively races were broadcast on live streaming in Group B, Hong Kong riders stood out again. On Sunday, Adrian Chung won, with Leung Tsz Wa and Tsang Pak Yin completing the podium. In the second confrontation, Cheang Kin Sang reached a deserved victory, followed again by Leung Tsz Wa and Tsang Pak Yin.
Jerónimo Badaraco came to this challenging weekend without the assured clearance. A modest qualification and 11th Saturday place maintained the open outcome. However, a solid race on Sunday and an excellent 4th place assured veteran Macanese the much desired place on the grid of the Macao Grand Prix, along with countrymen Cheng Kin San, Leong Keng Hei, Lou Check In and Carson Tang.
Also outside the Grand Prix was Dionísio Albino Pereira, who finished 23rd in Saturday's race, but closed the time more forcefully, cutting the line of goal in 13th place in the second race.
At the end of the races, the competitors provisionally calculated had an extra technical verification, being forced to open engines and gearbox, to verify the legality of these two decisive organs of their vehicles.</description><pubDate>2025-05-20 01:57:43</pubDate></item><item><title>Fit F4 World Cup will be in Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/09/primeira-taca-do-mundo-de-f4-sera-em-macau/</link><description>The International Automobile Federation (FIA), announced on Wednesday afternoon that the 2025 Macao Grand Prix will feature its program with the first edition of the Formula 4 World Cup.
The World Motorial Council approved by electronic vote the creation of this Formula 4 World Cup in Macao, along with the return to the Territory of the Regional Formula World Cup, which in 2023 came to occupy the place of Formula 3, and the FIA ​​GT World Cup.
The concept of Formula 4 has been introduced by the FIA ​​for over a decade and has been one of the biggest success stories of motorized training sport, currently there are 13 different national championships within the technical and sports framework of the FIA. This will be the fourth time the discipline runs in Macao, having been a regular presence from 2020 to 2023, and was even “head of poster” in the three years the world was immersed in the pandemic.
The FIA ​​did not say how the pilots will be chosen, just referring in a statement that there will be "a rigorous selection process of pilots, with only the most talented young people to be authorized to compete." The International Federation also stressed that the Chinese company “Mintimes, organizer of the F4 Chinese Championship, will be the Single Operator, along with FFSA (Fédération Française du Sport Automobile), responsible for providing technical support to the F4 F4 World Cup”. This means that all competitors will have to use Mygale M21-F4 singleolugar, recently renamed Ligier JS F422.
Support of Paris
The chairman of the FIA ​​monoligae commission, the Italian Emanuele Pirro, said that “Macau is an essential part of the formation of a young pilot, and we have a duty to protect his legacy and future. There is as few challenges as the Macao Grand Prix that we feel that it was the right time to introduce the F4 Fia World Cup. From F4, which is a little more permissive than a regional formula car, so that when they return to a year or two to the FR world cup, they are prepared to truly show what they are capable. ”
Emanuele Pirro, a former guide race vender and a MSAR test enthusiast, also said that "we are also working hard to ensure that we take this opportunity to inspire and educate young Karting riders in the region. The growth and development potential in China and the Asia Pacific region is huge as we boost participating in motorized sport."
Thinking about Macau
The FIA ​​long statement also states that this initiative “also aims to bring students from Karting de Macao, China and the region in general to watch the event in an observational manner, offering them the opportunity to experience a racing test and to obtain valuable knowledge for the next steps in their careers”.
Without going into detail, the international federation, which did not allow it to decline on the participation of Chinese teams in the regional formula cup last year, says that “this big step will undoubtedly benefit local Macao pilots, which will have access to a complete range of international events - Karting, Formula 4 and Regional Formula - on national soil”.
In a statement of Chong Coc Veng, president of the Macau-China General Automobile Association, he stated: “We are happy to see the FIA ​​hold a F4 World Cup at the Guide Circuit in Macao, which represents an opportunity for young people in the region to find their way of development from the international events of Karting to F4 and FR monoligles, and become world champions in the future.”
The participation of MSAR pilots in this race has not yet been officially disclosed, but may be limited in number.</description><pubDate>2025-05-09 00:41:31</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
