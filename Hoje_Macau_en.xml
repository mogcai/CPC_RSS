TUI also maintained the decision to pay compensation of 1,867 million Patacas, and the insurer should support 288 thousand patacas.
The case was passed on September 13, 2020, around 9:34 pm, when the man led to Macao Commercial Avenue, having parked at the door of the Fit Center Macau building, waiting for his ex-girlfriend to return home. Around 11:30 pm, the woman, when driving the car, saw that her ex-boyfriend was waiting for her and parked in the opposite ride.
The woman had been the victim of assault on the part of the man during the relationship, so she stopped the car and called a friend to ask for help. It was at this moment that the attacker got out of the car, approached the ex-girlfriend's car and hit him after doing a march reversal, "causing him to block the right front door, which could not be opened."
Then the man “left his vehicle and, with the key in hand, crashed violently in the glass window next to the driver of the vehicle” of the former partner, then retreated the car and beaten in the woman's car. That's when she got into her car and assaulted her, namely pressing her body, hitting her face with the key, and punched her and body punches.
Tui's judgment describes that the man "suddenly bit his left forearm and fingers of his left-handed hand, then moving to the rear seat, where he pulled his hair to prevent his escape, causing his hair loss." Some people who passed the scene helped the woman escape and immobilize the man.
Posttraumatic stress
At the time of the incident and aggression the man had a blood alcohol rate of 1.33 grams per liter, above the legal limit. Regarding the woman, she was subject to hospital treatment. "After the expert examination, it was found that it had suffered bruises and abrasions on the scalp, various bruises and abrasions on the face, cerebral concussion, right eye bruise, traumatic cataracts in the right eye, hemorrhage in the lower right eyelid, concussion in the right eye, severe hearing impairment in the right ear," the judgment describes.
In addition, aggressions have caused "the reduction of vision and asymmetry between the right and the left eye, obviously affecting its appearance and, at the same time, caused it to suffer from posttraumatic stress syndrome, which could need long-term treatment." It is also understood that the man "caused serious damage to the vehicle and damaged the Berma da Estrada Stone Floor."</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Tariffs | Suppliers resort to alternative markets</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/09/tarifas-fornecedores-recorrem-a-mercados-alternativos/</link><description>Macao has established trade agreements with Canada, Australia, Japan, and European and Southeast Asian countries that allow to minimize the effect of tariffs imposed by the White House, which came into force yesterday. The President Association of the Union of Suppliers of Macao states that from the end of May the effects will be unpredictable
 
The additional rate of Chinese products came yesterday, raising to 104 percent the total rate, implemented by the administration of Donald Trump, and to which Beijing also responded by raising the parade in the trade war that the White House declared to a vast range of countries and regions.
For now, in the short root, the president of the Macao Suppliers Association, IP Sio Man, considers that the tariffs imposed by the United States Government (USA) will not have an impact on the supply of products and prices practiced in Macau.
Speaking to the newspaper or Mun, the associative leader said that in recent years, Macau has signed commercial protocols with several countries that guarantee the diversification of imported products sources, which have resulted in the replacement of many US imported products. IP Sio Man reveals that, for example, part of the US -faced meat has been replaced by beef from Canada, Australia and New Zealand, as well as supplied by Japan and European countries.
Regarding fruits, the representative points out that the large majority is bought from suppliers from the interior of China.
For now, the containers who were loaded before April 5 and those already on the route to Hong Kong were only subject to a rate of 10 percent. However, IP Sio Man confessed to being difficult to predict what will happen to commercial connections with the US and prices when the load ships already arrive with charged products, something that should happen at the end of next month.
Route problems
The president of the Suppliers Association has an optimistic view of the commercial landscape, arguing that the countries and neighboring regions, especially from Southeast Asia, can look for low -tax markets such as Hong Kong and Macau to export their products and that this competition can lead to pricing down.
In addition to Trump's fares, IP Sio Man stressed the instability that has severely cut off maritime transport in the Red Sea, due to Israel and US offensive in Yemen and the attacks of the Huti rebels, which have attacked load ships. This situation affected the trade of goods from Portugal, with the sale of products such as olive oil, which took two months, twice the time, to circumvent the conflict zone. The main impact was felt at the level of fresh short products, such as cheeses, dairy products and premium meats, which became more expensive.
HM spoke to a Portuguese businessman who imports Portuguese products and who, due to delays in maritime transport, began to choose the airway. Despite the increase in transportation costs, Stock management forced looking for alternatives to the sea route, which takes three months to turn on Portugal to Macau.</description><pubDate>2025-04-09 23:34:16</pubDate></item><item><title>Satellite casinos | SME admit agony with closures</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/09/casinos-satelites-pme-admitem-agonia-com-encerramentos/</link><description>Several entrepreneurs from small and medium-sized companies have admitted that with the end of the satellite casinos will have to close their business or move on to mass discharge
 
Dependent companies or with great revenues generated by the satellite casinos recognize that they are very concerned about the prospects of a closing wave at the end of the year. The position of several entrepreneurs was taken in statements to the newspaper or Mun.
Satellite casinos result from agreements between some independent dealers and companies, which explore various game spaces, as with Kam Pek or Bridge 16 casinos, a total of 11 casinos. In this model, the independent companies exploit casinos, but with workers, game tables and chips of the dealers, with whom they have an agreement and who make payments.
The last review of the game law established a period of three years to end this model, which ends later this year. As a result, dealers may choose to assume, by themselves, the exploration of these casinos or close the spaces.
Speaking to the newspaper or Mun, a resident with the nickname Lam, who is responsible for a software company, said half of the company's revenues derive from one of the satellite casinos. Without these revenues, the leader admits that the company will start losing money and that in this scenario there are only two hypotheses: paying the losses with money from their pocket, until the situation becomes unsustainable, or doing what nicknamed “cutting an arm”, the dismissal of about 30 to 40 percent of workers.
Lam also said that satellite casinos distribute a lot of money to small and medium enterprises by hiring services. However, if only the dealership survives, the local economy will feel an impact it has classified as deep.
Another businessman, with the nickname Sin, responsible for a cleaning company, traveled a similar scenario, and acknowledged that with the closure of the satellite casinos will say goodbye to the total of the total staff, which indicated to represent about 100 workers, due to lack of work.
Less transportation
The need to move forward with the dismissal of workers is also the scenario before Choi, according to the newspaper or Mun. The entrepreneur of a private personnel transport company said that it currently survives in the local market due to services rendered to the satellite casinos.
Choi acknowledged that 80 percent of the recipes come from these spaces and that in case of closing this volume of business will not be replaced. The businessman indicated that although Macau receives more tourists these have a very different profile. Among the differences, he pointed out that they are younger and do not move through this type of transport, first resorting to public transport.
The newspaper or Mun also spoke to another IP businessman, responsible for an advertising lighting product company. It employs between 20 and 30 workers and most services are provided to the satellite casinos. If they end, IP indicates that not only will your company close, as well as several other stores in the vicinity of casinos and depend on them.</description><pubDate>2025-04-09 23:27:36</pubDate></item><item><title>Domestic Violence | Ho Ion Sang asks resources to help victims</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/09/violencia-domestica-ho-ion-sang-pede-recursos-para-ajudar-vitimas/</link><description>Despite the “success” of domestic violence policies, the residents' deputy considers that local associations must have more means to support victims and their children. In addition to subsistence means, Ho Ion Sang highlights the importance of planning professional career and providing child care
 
Ho Ion Sang advocates the reinforcement of cooperation between the government and local associations to provide victims of domestic violence with more subsistence means. The subject is addressed through a interpelation written by the residents' deputy, in which greater cooperation between the government and local associations is requested.
In the document, Ho advocates the reinforcement of the “social assistance network” and the improvement of “support for the level of subsistence means of domestic violence and children”, which involves not only the availability of financial support, but also by “more oriented and diverse services, such as career planning, vocational training and child care”.
According to the deputy, in the current context, associations should assume a key role in helping victims in life after episodes of domestic violence, in cases where they need a network of support to rebuild their lives.
Ho Ion Sang is a deputy for the residents' association, one of the most supported by the government with public funds.
More cooperation
The reinforcement of cooperation between local associations and the government is not only intended to request more resources. Ho Ion Sang asks for the development of guidelines, promised by the executive for this year, who will define ways to deal with cases of domestic violence when there are children involved. In the questions sent to the government, the deputy recalls that the guidelines were completed in 2023, and that last year the authorities heard public services and associations. However, the executive's goal was to publicize and implement the guidelines throughout this year, without more information so far. Therefore, the deputy asks the government to reveal the calendar when they will be presented.
In written interplies, the deputy also considers that “cooperation with non -governmental organizations and consolidate resources from all parties involved” to “create a favorable atmosphere for the whole community to oppose and unanimously resist domestic violence”.
Regarding prevention, Ho Ion Sang praises the work carried out, with the approval of the legislation that made this a public crime, which has led to a gradual reduction of occurrences. However, it asks the executive not to make it easier for the efforts to combat crime to alert the population more to this phenomenon.</description><pubDate>2025-04-09 23:22:33</pubDate></item><item><title>Literature | Dora Nunes Gago closes Macau's trilogy with “gray flowers”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/09/literatura-dora-nunes-gago-fecha-trilogia-de-macau-com-flores-de-cinza/</link><description>Dora Nunes Gago, writer and former director of the Portuguese Department of Portuguese, has just launched a new poetry book. "Flowers of Gray" ends the trilogy of works dedicated to Macau, composed of "flowered by mistake the angry roses" and "Nomadic Words"
 
It was ten years that translated into many words. So many, who gave three books, “they were mistakenly flowered to the angry roses”, clearly reference to Camilo Pessanha; “Nomadic Words” and now “Gray Flowers”. Dora Nunes Gago's new poetry book, a teacher and former director of the Portuguese Department of Macao (one), also refers to Macau who lasts in his memory and, therefore, translates into words.
With the seal of Humus, the book has just left Portugal, resulting from the "many poems" written by Dora Nunes Gago during the period in Macao, an experience that turned her into an published and award -winning author.
Writing poetry in these years of teaching and experience the East turned out to be the way found to deal with Macau's reviliations and their dynamics. “Perhaps because it is a shorter record, a way to capture moments, of crystallizing them, in the midst of all the bullshit and surprises that Macau dresses. Maria Ondina Braga referred to the work“ Statue de Sal ”, written in Macao, around 1963, that Macau is 'sleep of sleep and poetry'. Hm.
“Gray Flowers” ​​is called because he went to seek inspiration from a poem by Natália Correia: “(…) young people oblivious to the pulcitude of the body in celebration / pass me as cypresses of cypresses / And the youth gray flower is an edge / strike me by opening vacuums of wild flowers (…) / the gallop in a teeth foam.”
Dora Nunes Gago selected the “surviving poems” of the remaining two titles of the trilogy. “There were those who were lost, between changes, travel, blocks and lost notebooks.” Like the whole macao's own revocation.
In "Gray Flowers," the territory "is represented by rituals, the symbolic times like the Chinese New Year, which is that festive time when the world is reborn and inventing itself." There are also elements that become poetry such as the dumplings, the temples, the island of Hengqin, where the author lived in the days she taught at one.
“The territory is present in the images, but also in the solitude and silence that inhabits the poems, all of them very short. In this book, my obsession with synthesis culminated,” he describes.
Each book, a message
Há poemas que falam por si só, outros que necessitam de ser explicados. And speaking of the trilogy he has written in recent years, Dora Nunes Gago refers to the first, where the pessanha symbolism is sought and where he denotes "the first look at Asia and Macao."
Here there is no poetry, but 24 tales, "many of them inspired by witnessed stories, heard or read in newspapers." Already the award -winning “Nomadic Words”, winner of the Grand Travel Literature Prize Maria Ondina Braga last year, contains 50 chronicles. "It was the way to find a guiding thread to unite various experiences and learning that had a conductive thread for my life."
Behold, in the last book of the trilogy, 55 poems, organized into three parts, namely “exhibitions, permanences and returns” are gathered. They are “a synthesis of all my route,” he says. “Gray Flowers” ​​is “Perhaps the most autobiographical book of the three, as it is rooted in multiple feelings, in a kind of instantaneous ones that configured my days,” says the author.
From the preface, by Maria João Cantinho, it is read that the first of the trilogy, “flowered by mistake the Brave roses” is “a book of brief stories, whose title was taken from loan to a beautiful verse (and a poem) of the melancholy Camilo Pessanha, in Clepsidra”. While "nomadic words" brings together chronic chronicles that are born "from his experience in Macao, as well as his traveler and adventurous aspect, as the Teotónio Almeida needed very praised." In turn, in the third, Dora Gago "changes the record and we find ourselves in the face of poetic and sensitive writing, built by brief poems," he reads.
Maria João Cantinho also understands that the poem “Destiny” is one of the most beautiful in “Flowers of Gray”: “In the crazy run / of the abandoned / lonely Galgo of existing, lick the wounds of death / in the skin of the poem.”
Here, it is described “poetic writing is presented as vertigo (‘ in the crazy race ’) driven by a allegorical impetus, in which the presence of death emerges”, where “fate is certainly this disadvantaged race in which death surrounds the living and only the poem can save or redeem those”, considers Maria João Cantinho.
For this, "Dora Nunes Gago's writing contains a reflective dimension, addressing topics such as the creation or passage of time, among many others, and using a rich, vocabulary and prosodic level language in the search for effects that accentuate the tension of the poem."
“Exiles”, the first part of the work, starts with “beginning”, a simple name for a short poem: “I follow the memory footprints / inscribed in the sand of time / and I am a ship / anchored without leme / no breath”. Perhaps marked by longing and distance, we find “absence”: “They dance solemn ashes / Silvando Winds of Saudade, / Heavens / Spelled / In Blood / Solitude.”
And as this book is made of comings and goings, the work ends with "return", as if it was a timeline: "Returning the house / tattooing hills and valleys / in the retina, / watering the flowers of gray / reborn / in stony cracks / of hope."
Dora Nunes Gago is a native of São Brás de Alportel and is currently a teacher at the Setúbal Polytechnic Institute. About “Nomadic Words”, the Jury of the Grand Prix of Travel Literature Maria Ondina Braga, granted by the Portuguese Writers Association (APE), considered it to be a “work of varied and rich observations concerning the places where the reports of great sensory liveliness go, which does not lack the intimate look at the places and people, as well as the capture of what is capable of the capture of what has been captured of what has been captured of what is has been capturing designating as 'Génie du Lieu' ”.
"In a prose of great fluidity, eavized of reflections where perceptions, memories, culture, literature and history are intersected, the author has been able to lead a reading reading from the first pages, whose rhythm and interest can maintain throughout the considerable extension of the work," said the same jury.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Timor-Leste | Dili receives interministerial meeting of G7+</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/09/timor-leste-dili-recebe-reuniao-interministerial-do-g7/</link><description>The capital of Timor-Leste will receive tomorrow and Saturday the sixth ministerial meeting of the G7+ that will first join the heads of the organization's diplomacy, which marks 15 years of existence.

This is the history of the first air trip between Vila Nova de Mil-Fontes and Macau starring the airmen Sarmento Beires, Brito Pais and Manuel Gouveia
 
The Children's Festival Letters &amp; Company, promoted by the Portuguese Institute of the East (IPOR), hosts this Saturday the launch of the Chinese version of “The Adventurous Journey of the Fatherland”, a book by Filipa Brito Pais, teachers, telling the story of the first air trip between Portugal and Macau starring the Author, Brito Paisvô, and Menuel Macavô Gouveia. Last year the centenary of this trip was celebrated, and hence Filipa wanted to tell her to a younger audience. The work has illustrations by Leonor Almeida.
In a press release, Filipa Brito Pais describes that “as a teacher of the first cycle, I have been to several schools in Portugal and Macau to fulfill my memory duty to my uncle”. Thus, “the possibility of writing a children's book that would accompany me in the lectures I give, due to the lack of appropriate information to the younger audience, and has been successful in the more adult audience”.
“The adventurous trip of the homeland” has a preface by the president of the Portuguese Republic, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, as well as the support of several entities linked to Macau.
At a time when the version translated to Chinese is known, the work has already been presented to over 2500 students in schools and municipal libraries in Portugal. It was up to the translation of the work.
At the time of launch in Portugal, Filipa Brito Pais told HM that many stories of the trip had to be left out, but this is a tribute to heroes who were forgetting in Portuguese historiography.
“It does not portray all the steps, because it would be impossible for it to be for children. It is a book whose story is very reduced, even at the request of my editor, because I wanted to put all the adventures and adventures they lived. The story of writing on the plane screen in the match was one of the fact that Manuel Gouveia [the mechanic] was said to die. Another of the bath taken to cold water that was then boiling water, ”he said.
For the author, they are adventures "demonstrations of courage and perseverance, leadership ability," this is a book with a strong message, so that young people "do not give up their dreams."
Feed memory
In the same note sent to the newspapers, Filipa Brito Pais describes the fact that “these national heroes [have been] forgotten in history for political reasons”, namely by opposing one of the airmen to the 1926 military dictatorship. The fact that the dictatorial regime of the Estado Novo was instituted a few years later in Portugal in 1933, further contributed to this aerial achievement. To make the trip, several popular background capture campaigns were created, but the best known air route was the trip of Gago Coutinho and Sacadura Cabral.
"I had the honor of having been present in June 2024 in Macao and Hong Kong when the celebrations of the centenary of my uncle's trip, representing the Brito Pais family. I will now have the greatest honor of presenting the book in Chinese and honoring these three Portuguese heroes in the diaspora," he said.
“Brito Pais and Sarmento de Beires dreamed of flying and honoring the homeland and Camões, choosing the destination of Macao, which at that time was Portuguese land. Without financial support and with an old and heavy plane, they risked and flew over countries that until then no one had dared to fly.

Kato has confirmed what analysts have been suggesting, based on the priority objective of the United States to reduce trade balance with countries with which they have deficit and to which tariffs -which he calls reciprocal -like Japan.
"There have been several communications with the American side, including over exchange rates, and then movements in the exchange markets may be among the topics discussed, although the details have not yet been determined," Kato said in a speech in the Japanese parliament. The leader also explained that discussions about the exchange rate will be held among the finance ministers of both countries.
The Japanese government announced on Tuesday that the minister responsible for economic revitalization and new capitalism, Ryosi Akazawa, will be Tokyo's main representative in tariff negotiations.

The idea came from the association's president, IP Sio Man, according to the Chinese channel of Radio Macau.
According to IP, US dependence is negative because tariff policies are unpredictable and are constantly changing. The official indicated that last year, the value of products Macau exported to the US was 300 million patacas, while the value of imported products from the US was 70 billion patacas. On the other hand, IP Sio Man anticipated that the Macao government is unable to follow the interior in adopting retaliation policies against the US, so it should follow an alternative path.
But even though Macau follows the background policy, IP has devalued the case, considering that it will not have great impact, because in recent years, Macau has actively explored new markets and can import products from other regions to replace those of the US.</description><pubDate>2025-04-09 02:29:45</pubDate></item><item><title>Rosa Coutinho Cabral</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/autor/rosa-coutinho-cabral/</link><description>“It is not that the past throws its light on the present or that the present throw its light on the past; but the image is what happened in a flash now, forming a constellation” (Walter Benjamin)
Trying to save the history of his great traditions, to phenomenology, Heidegger does not escape an idealistic waste, as if the things of the world belonged to her, history, and his one-way course, Bragança de Miranda tells us.
For Benjamin, in his search for a tangible surface of time -contaminated objects, what was concerned was surely the haptic drilling we found in Caravaggio and Fontana - the latter bringing to the artistic object a clearly performative gesture and - as in everything that happens in here and now - capable of recreating or inspiring chaos on such artistic things. Things that no longer offer themselves in a harmonious course and do not belong - neither history nor aesthetics, but to the world like the stones or words that jump to us from the mouth.
Somehow surpassing the Barthiano Punctum, Benjamin's dialectical image escapes the “historicity” that offers itself as a sacred altar where the things of art
They are eternalized - teleologically - in another world where the conditions of the world do not feel - where it is supposed that nothing is lost, ruin, or transforms into the essence of things, and of works, in this case of the work of art.
What matters to Benjamin echoes disturbingly in Duchamp, because in the shift between the past, the present and the future, the things done beings that capture in the act of making their power, is that the possibility of belonging to a certain time, expands in the gesture in which the work affects its own historicity, and can be read at any time. It indicates the possibility of your time and the power of your reception at any time. It is a kronotopic and anmorphic boomerangue. Infixed from the moment it is fixed. As Benjamin said, he seize something, the moment the danger shines, is fatal. However, he referred to the power of myth, which here promisedly belong to those who venture to steal fire to the gods-punishment is the esventtation and cannibalism of others, and can read in the world, in the universe, in the universe, and that we do not know the limits, although we can guess them.
For Benjamin, therefore, things and works done by artists can only ecist in an image that sparkles as a star, which is seen according to the conditions and the means, and which is part of a network, a puzzle, or, better, taking advantage of its own essayist methodical - in a constellation.
I love to remember the geometry of the sky to know where the largest bear is the smaller bear. Looking at the sky, this huge ecran of moving images, images that appear and disappear on the huge skin of the world, because we no longer see beyond it, even knowing that there is more. That there is an entire universe of possibilities. We, who do and those who come, touch or enjoy the performance and effects of doing, are - how to say - the bowels within this huge body that is the world.
And we want to repeat it on our small gestures of artists, and have both impact and the extraordinary show of heaven, the shadows, the sea… and how do we do it? Seeking to create images that express time in your space, without contaminating themselves for it. Leaving it loose. Allowing us to doubt our acts that are no longer eternal or belong to history, but they are part of an incredible file of possibilities: we can all do, but not all have the effect of affecting the world and somehow causing inconvenience.
From the collection of possibility, the file of all times and spaces, of all dreams and ways of making, of all sensitivities comes the inflamed object of originality-the one whose form we do not yet recognize, the one who re-crack, dearrange, alters… He who invites a time to sit to play plaid with another time. And such a sharing of the sensitive, of which Rancière tells us, is difficult. As difficult as we have the same image of the world.
I believe these things - which few come because they do not recognize the new aspect, and that contemporary in the immense liberation of exclusionary norms, can have any form, leads us to a reversal of Gestalt's theory: it is no longer possible to share anything - not even the world and its grand skin, the blue sky of Bataille. Ricoeur's great evil devours the eyes of the corpses and the possible image is that of a survival kit in the absence of a nuclear war pavorods on the world.
As Agamben warns us, the contemporary gesture starts from the urgency to respond. What answer bring us images of all time if we believe there is no survival kit for art? She is always changing - touched by the grace of the appearance, she is decaying like everything inside the world. Like light… that today we tear to the machine and technique in an agive aesthetic commotion to see when the world gets around the existence.
What remains, for now, is the hammer, to the shiver of time, without the wicked truth, very nietzschianly acting that we all try to do our part, knowing the look of the look that all sees. Increasingly aware that things of art cannot escape you after the bruschiness of your birth, in disturbing objects that increasingly interfere with the state of things, remembering a wonderful Wenders movie, the artists authors, those who affect and alter the appearance of the appearance of the work of art, such as Duchamp, are real estate travelers who drop objects-image that speaks. Shout. Fight. Fly to the sky. They fall and explode politically the land where we live where all that exists is the image - this is the constant matter that emanates from the act of doing things - artistic or not.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>PAULO MAIA AND CARMO</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/autor/paulomaiaecarmo/</link><description>Zhong Kui, the student's patron is often represented on a strange creature that, observed from the tail, has a fish tail that becomes a dragon, a composite designated to.
In imperial examinations, from the Tang dynasty to the Song, between 618 and 1279, the candidates who studied for the imperial exam, after completing it awaited the result on a staircase where the figure of one of these fantastic creatures was carved. What was first, the first to step on the head of Ao, originated a saying to indicate a successful feat-Duzhan aotou, "seize the head of Ao."
The descendants of the emperor, during the Qing Dynasty designated in Manchu A-G, were not subject to this examination, but their study regime was no less demanding. Since three in the morning studying, among others the four books and the five classics, without vacation, with only five days free a year.
One of the most brilliant heirs of this dynasty was Aisin-Tei Hongli, which between 1735-95 would occupy the throne of the dragon son with the name Qianlong. An episode of his biography confirms him when he impressed his powerful grandfather, Emperor Kangxi (1654-1722). He was then twelve years old when he first found him at the Pony Pavilion of the former Yuanmingyuan Summer Palace, the "Garden of the Perfect Brightness." At the time he recited by color the poem of Zhou Dunyi (1017-1073) in praise of the lotto, the flower that is born for beauty, indifferent to the sludge from where it comes.
When in turn became emperor, the grandson remembered the grateful meeting with his grandfather named two places where he took place; The Peonial Garden Pavilion began to "the moon emerging, the clouds move away", and the place where he studied with him, "wind and pines between a myriad of valleys." Usually it also remembered the place by ordering the glorious morning painting during Guxian, the third lunar month (ink and silk color, 179.4 x 106.2 cm, at the National Palace Museum in Taipei).
Yu Xing (1736-1795), born in the Yushan Hill in Changshu (Jiangsu), the author of this panel, was a painter of the qianlong court who had distinguished in thorough paintings from flowers, plants, insects and fish. In a horizontal roll that made under the theme fish and algae (paint and color on paper, 28.5 x 157.8 cm, sold on Sotheby's), Qianlong wrote a poem proving his appreciation:
Green algae like jade
scattered throughout the lake
and fish swimming free between algae.
This scene makes me think
in the uselessness of our life.
Observing the fish having fun
gives me a great joy.
The classic Zhuangzi states, without explaining the reason for words, that the life of the fish is really jublishing. And who knows if it is not this joy that is figured in the persistent representation of a fish that will fly, light and powerful as a dragon.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>ANA CRISTINA ALVES</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/autor/ana-cristina-alves/</link><description>* Assistant and coordinator researcher at the Macau Scientific and Cultural Center

The old silk routes
Two routes connected the Han Dynasty to the West from the second century BC. The South and North Route, both extended from Chang 'an/XI's to the West, the North through Central Asia, the Caspian Sea, and the South, led to the Mediterranean, Genoa and Venice, Irah and Iraq.  Historically, the old silk route divided into four periods:
From the second century BC to the 6th century, having as high points the diffusion of the Buddhism and emergency of Islam;
2) From the beginning of the seventh century to the late tenth century, the highlight being the diffusion of porcelain;
3) From the eleventh century to the fifteenth century, with the heyday of the diffusion of Islamic and Hindu religions and tax trade in East Asia, the relics of the wreck and 7 trips of Admiral Zheng He (鄭和), between 1405-1431, as well as the emergence of multicultural communities such as Guangzhou, Malaca (Malásia) and Galle (Sri Lanka);
4) mid -century. XV to the nineteenth, with emphasis on the exchange of porcelain goods, peppers and spices, globalization of routes and diffusion of Catholicism, and the predominance of other routes, such as those opened by the Portuguese in the Atlantic to the Pacific, through the Indian Indian, especially the Cape Route. This route started in the 15th and 16th centuries in Lisbon reached India, China and Japan, particularly Nagasaqui, and beyond, Timor, in a project that begins to be outlined by D. João II in 1487, being fulfilled by D. Manuel 1, with the fleet led by Vasco da Gama that would lead to India, near Calecute on May 17, 1498. Farther, Macao, where we established between 1555 and 1557, with scholars, such as Eduardo Kol de Carvalho, who advocate the interesting thesis of ensuring the Route of Japan, opened from 1543 and guaranteed by the Nau do Trato, which made the connection between India and Japan, having elected Macau for the necessary commercial interplay of the Portuguese silk, the territory of this trade Macao in 1557, the base the Portuguese founded on the Chinese coast to support the tract ”(Carvalho, 2018, 77).
For these channels of the old chinese silk routes, silk, lacquer, porcelain and tea arrived in Europe, being transmitted to China glass, gems or precious stones, certain fruits and dry fruits, especially grapes, guavas, cucumbers, as well as other vegetables, for example, garlic and carrots. In addition to agricultural exchanges, also Chinese technological inventions such as gunpowder, the manufacture of paper, impression and compass, or the circulation of ideas and, above all, those that made up religious philosophies. Then, with a sea route of the Portuguese silk, between the 15th and 16th centuries the trade globalized entirely, everything changed and negotiated, transmitted and influenced.
II
The new silk route, including the 21st century sea
If the term “Route of Silk” dates back to the ancient Greek geographers and, in particular, Marinus, already “silk sea route”, is from the twentieth century, an alliance arising in a covenant between the French synologist Édouard Chavannes (1865-1918) and the Japanese with their maritime porcelain trade studies in the 1960s.
The Chinese begin to mention the “sea silk route” in 1974, first with the scholar Jao Tsung-i (饒宗頤, 1917-2018), then explicitly with Chen Yan (陳炎) “Silk Maritime Route” (丝绸之路) from 1980.
The “renewed” version that was born in 2013, announced in Kazakhstan, as a track and route (一带一路) at the initiative of the current Chinese president, XI Jinping (习近平), based on the principle of connectivity, aims to connect Asia, Europe and Africa through land and maritime routes.
The six land corridors well and briefly systematized by Professor Fernanda Ilhéu in “The Last Silk Route that History Knowed and the New Silk Route that History will know” (Ilhéu, 2018: 145) are:
China-Mongolia-Russia;
2) China-Pakistan;
3) China-Bangladesh-India- Myanmar;
4) China-Peninsula of Indochina;
5) New European Earth Bridge;
6) China-Central Western, Central Hands.
They converge all tracks to Europe, Duisburg, Germany, including the sea, of great importance to China, as 90% of Chinese trade is performed by this way. Of course China aims to ensure its sources of energy supply, either oil and natural gas, to which a hub from some central Asian countries, such as Turquemenistan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Russia, “being China since 2014 the largest world importer” (ibidem).
Also according to data provided by Fernanda Ilhéu, since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, she was preparing her way to become an increasingly international economy, reaching in 2010 the Statute of Second World Economy (Ilhéu, 2018, 147).  The country to maintain this statute, or perhaps even overcome it, needs to continue with its plan of 4 or 5 modernizations, maintaining the connection abroad for this purpose, that is, the Going Out policy has to continue. Thus transit a first phase of globalization, that of direct exports and foreign direct investment abroad (IDEE), for a second phase of globalization, as stressed Ilhéu (2018, 149) in the form of mergers and acquisitions in Asia, Europe and Africa, as well as in the Americas or Oceania.
Then comes a new sea route from the silk that extends from Chongqing to Fuzhou in southern China, passes through Malaca in Malaysia, goes to Mombaça in Kenya (branch to Cape Verde and Santos in Brazil), heads to the Chinese African military base in Djibouti, then to the port of Pyreu in Greece (Ramifications for Madrid and Sines and Brazil), for Venice) Italy and Rotterdam in the Netherlands (branches for Panama and South American countries).
Places related to the silk sea route within China are the coastal regions of Hebei, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, Hainan and Macao Special Administrative Region, as well as the Huang-Bohai seas, Changjiang River Basin, East China Sea and Taiwan's Strait, Senior China Sea, Japan archipelago, Korea Peninsula, which is the plaque of East Asia.
However, a new sea silk route begins to draw, the polar silk route, which would suppose China, Norway, and Groelândia, into Arctic, to facilitate trade between Asia, Europe and America. The Arctic Route comes out of Shanghai passes through Alaska crosses the North Pole to Denmark to Rotterdão, and from there he can go to the land, passing to China, or using the Rotterdam Silk Route goes to Pyreu, crosses the Suez Channel, Momba, Kolkata (India), Malaca Strait, Jakarta to Zhanjiang (China).
The evolution of the new silk route in the next decade will depend on the growth of the Chinese economy, which according to Thiago Codongo, commercial manager of China Link, will have to grow more than 6% per year to support support and investments, such as the ones they have done in Angola, Venezuela, Pakistan and Mongolia, all these countries with great debts to China.
As Professor Carlos Gaspar (2020) saw in The World of Tomorrow: Contemporary Geopolitics, China performs through the initiative of the Track and Route (Bri) of its various silk corridors, terrestrial, maritime and polar, a strategy of political, economic, cultural and technological connectivity.  Notable advances in mobile telecommunications are distinguished here, such as the 5G network and also in port and rail infrastructure. Moreover, it has the control of Darwin's main marine ports in the Pacific, Hambantotta in Indian, Pyreu in the Mediterranean, Kirkenes in the Arctic, having built in Kazakhstan the dry port of Khorgos, as well as the dry port of Duisburg in Germany.
Note that these routes are essentially commercial and their impact on foreign trade is immense, developing from the purchase and acquisition of ports. Also according to Thiago Codongo, "for China it is also much more interesting to have the maritime control of several seas, lakes and narrows that are important to their goods, both to acquire and to sell." Among these ports are: the aforementioned port of Pireu in Greece (60%); Many African ports among which the largest, the port of Djibouti, close to Ethiopia in Northeast African, built by the Chinese, as well as ports in Ethiopia and Uganda, and in many other African countries, including Guinea, Angola and Mozambique. China has provided help, in terms of construction of concrete infrastructure, to the underprivileged countries, and the building of Addis Ababa in Ethiopia is to be highlighted.  Also about ports, stand out in Brazil, the port of Paranaguá (90%), in the state of Paraná.
According to an investigation by journalist Cecilia Barría, in 2021 were about 115 ports in more than 60 countries, besides having seven of the top ten ports in the world, namely: 1) Shanghai; 2) Ningbo-Zhoushan; 3) Shenzhen; 4) Qingdao; 5) Guangzhou; 6) Tianjin and 7) Hong Kong. According to the latest data provided by Zongyuan Zoe Liu of August 26, 2024, the country has 129 port projects, of which 115 will be active, including ports in which it will have greater or lesser participation, or up to 17 with total or majority possession, the 14 remaining possession will have been suspended or canceled, such as Porto Khalifa in the Arab Emirates.
Also according to the data presented by Zongyuan Zoe Liu, the country is investing in ports with high regular transport connectivity rates, indicated in parenthesis: South Korea (640); Singapore (586); United States (504); Malaysia (486); Japan (423); Vietname (403); United Kingdom (381); Netherlands (380); Hong Kong (376); Belgium (343); India (342); Taiwan (340);  Germany (305), United Arab Emirates (296); Italy (286); Türkiye (283); Thailand (267); France (263); Morocco (263) (https://www.cfr.org/tracker/china-oveseas-ports)
Hit the fear that the Chinese strategy of port acquisition is double, military and commercial, and that in case of widespread conflict, port companies can be used by the Chinese government and, above all, by the popular liberation army marine ships. And examples are exempt: Port of Singapore, of giving Salaam in Tanzania, Pyreu in Greece, Haifa in Israel, Veracruz in Mexico, or Balboa in Panama, the latter near major naval bases.  It is recalled that relatively, for example, to the Panama Canal, the country was present in two ports, Colón and Balboa. Another highly strategic port for China is Freeport in Bahamas, Caraíbe.
There is also another relevant issue, the financial debts of certain countries of fragile economy towards China, some examples to take into account are: Sri Lanka who leased their port for 99 years as compensatory mode of their debt, well -mentioned such indebted countries: Angola, Mongolia, Pakistan and Venezuela.
Among Important Ports in South America, one stands out in Peru, near Lima, the 100% private multipurpose port terminal and detained by Cosco Shipping (China Ocean Shipping Company). It will also refer to the Rio Grande Multipurpose Port in Argentina.
Chinese property in the port sector is mainly in the following companies: 1) Cosco, state; China Merchants, state and 3) Hutchinson Ports, private. In the port control strategy are involved companies such as Cosco (Ports of Pireu and Hamburg) and Shanghai International Port Group (Porto Israelita de Haifa). In Portugal they operate Cosco, through the EuroNave do Porto Maritime Agency, located in Matosinhos and there are also investments related to the Port of Sines, such as the Calb Electric Cars Battery Factory, as well as interest in the expansion of this port.
The memorandum of bilateral understanding celebrated between China and Portugal in 2018, there are 17 agreements, of which the first is relative to the so -called Silk Route, in its terrestrial and maritime aspects, emphasizing in this bilateral cooperation “connectivity” and “electric mobility” 1.
According to Yuan Peng, vice president of the Institute of Contemporary International Relations The New World Order, according to the Chinese view of the world, is characterized by a concentric circle structure, belonging to China three rings: the inner ring of 14 countries with border with China; The intermediate ring of neighboring sea countries, the areas of the East Pacific, Indian Ocean and the Middle East, including Central Asia and Russia, and the outer ring to which Africa, Europe, America and the two poles belong.
The big question is to know if the domain of seas is equivalent to that of the world, which in the space age does not seem to be the case, although China has been rivaling the United States in this domain, and not only in the quality of the second largest economic power, ambitions are equally political wishing to offer a counterpart to a long -dominated unipole.  Nowadays and, above all, in the nundo of tomorrow, as Professor Carlos Gaspar emphasizes, the political ambitions of both Russia and China favor a multipolar geostrategic framework, at least BI or Tripolar, with three great powers in a prominent place: the United States, Russia and China. If these last two powers came into a lasting connection, which does not seem to be the case, there would be an alternative to American power by the Euroasatic axis. However, China needs to consolidate its position as the main Asian power, linking East Asia to South Asia, being currently the main economic partner of asian countries as important as South Korea, Philippines and Thailand, among others.
That China wants to offer itself as a peaceful alternative to the hegemonic power of the United States, there seems to be no doubt, even by the insistent cultivation of a policy of neutrality in the country led by President XI Jinping.
There is yet another important aspect to emphasize: the initiative of track and route (bri) with its maritime and terrestrial links, arises following an internal movement of China in relation to its development and reaction to “a century of humiliation”, the nineteenth of the two wars of opium.
When in the middle of the twentieth century, in 1949, the CCP seized power in China began the first cycle of power of the “New Age”, as Professor Carlos Gaspar2, Mao Zedong's Maoism, was well noted in the unification of the Chinese state, to which the country's second economic flowering cycle was followed by Deng Xiaoping, culminating in the 100th anniversary of the CCP in CCP 2021, the third cycle followed, after 2013, with the rise of President XI Jinping, who seeks to fully realize the goal of erecting China to the category of great power, this possibly widely developed or even completed in 2049 to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the arrival of the CCP to power. China's Renaissance as great power and, perhaps, until reunification with Taiwan.
Finally, it remains to be known how we will all be connected, if the good of a new world order and a shared future, if the autocratic command of a dominant power over the rest. Invoking the goodness of intent, I believe we will not attend the emergence of a new imperial power with connections to all corners of the globe, assisted by the misuse of new technologies, but before a connectivity of a network that extends network for economic reasons, respecting the sovereignty of the remaining states, which will avoid internal political interference, practicing a policy of strict neutrality, which They privilege humanity and harmony, as well as other constant virtues: rites, wisdom, trust and justice.

Fosun is the largest Chinese private company to invest in Portugal to operate especially in the areas of insurance, banks and health.

In imperial examinations, from the Tang dynasty to the Song, between 618 and 1279, the candidates who studied for the imperial exam, after completing it awaited the result on a staircase where the figure of one of these fantastic creatures was carved. What was first, the first to step on the head of Ao, originated a saying to indicate a successful feat-Duzhan aotou, "seize the head of Ao."
The descendants of the emperor, during the Qing Dynasty designated in Manchu A-G, were not subject to this examination, but their study regime was no less demanding. Since three in the morning studying, among others the four books and the five classics, without vacation, with only five days free a year.
One of the most brilliant heirs of this dynasty was Aisin-Tei Hongli, which between 1735-95 would occupy the throne of the dragon son with the name Qianlong. An episode of his biography confirms him when he impressed his powerful grandfather, Emperor Kangxi (1654-1722). He was then twelve years old when he first found him at the Pony Pavilion of the former Yuanmingyuan Summer Palace, the "Garden of the Perfect Brightness." At the time he recited by color the poem of Zhou Dunyi (1017-1073) in praise of the lotto, the flower that is born for beauty, indifferent to the sludge from where it comes.
When in turn became emperor, the grandson remembered the grateful meeting with his grandfather named two places where he took place; The Peonial Garden Pavilion began to "the moon emerging, the clouds move away", and the place where he studied with him, "wind and pines between a myriad of valleys." Usually it also remembered the place by ordering the glorious morning painting during Guxian, the third lunar month (ink and silk color, 179.4 x 106.2 cm, at the National Palace Museum in Taipei).
Yu Xing (1736-1795), born in the Yushan Hill in Changshu (Jiangsu), the author of this panel, was a painter of the qianlong court who had distinguished in thorough paintings from flowers, plants, insects and fish. In a horizontal roll that made under the theme fish and algae (paint and color on paper, 28.5 x 157.8 cm, sold on Sotheby's), Qianlong wrote a poem proving his appreciation:
Green algae like jade
scattered throughout the lake
and fish swimming free between algae.
This scene makes me think
in the uselessness of our life.
Observing the fish having fun
gives me a great joy.
The classic Zhuangzi states, without explaining the reason for words, that the life of the fish is really jublishing. And who knows if it is not this joy that is figured in the persistent representation of a fish that will fly, light and powerful as a dragon.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Today Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/autor/hoje-macau/</link><description>The capital of Timor-Leste will receive tomorrow and Saturday the sixth ministerial meeting of the G7+ that will first join the heads of the organization's diplomacy, which marks 15 years of existence.

Game recipes and economic predictions should be on the table, according to José Sales Marques and Lou Shenghua. The future of pecuniary checks may be another matter to be in attention
 
Sam Hou Fai has been in the government for almost five months and is preparing to present, next Monday, his first report of the Governing Action Lines (LAG) for this year. Great expectations often reside in the amounts of pecuniary checks, the values ​​attributed to social support and other budgetary predictions, especially after the territory has been through a hard economic period with Covid-19.
LAG 2025 should focus on these themes, and Macao's integration into the various regional cooperation projects, such as Hengqin Island or the Great Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Bay. Fulfilling the annual tradition of local politics, Sam Hou Fai made the usual round of auscultations to local associations, in order to know his opinions on the main measures to take.
Listened to by HM, economist José Sales Marques expects clarity in the policies announced at the economic level. "I would like to see these LAG bring greater clarity on economic policies and the vision for the future of MSAR. I speak of structural measures that encourage the trust of the private investor, and that also realize such reforms of public administration to increase efficiency and effectiveness," he said.
Sales Marques also said that "I would like to clearly see Macao's positions and priorities in his relationship with countries and regions of the world, including measures that lead to deepen the role of Sino-Midfone and Multicultural Dialogue Platform."
Lou Shenghua, a political analyst and professor at Macao Polytechnic University (UPM), said the main ideas presented will be in accordance with what Sam Hou Fai presented in the electoral program. "The tonic can be placed in improving the effectiveness of governance, moderate economic diversification, the construction of the Hengqin cooperation zone and the issues related to the subsistence means of people," said the analyst, stressing that "citizens may be more concerned with subsistence -related issues."
And what program presented Sam Hou Fai in September last year, when it was glimpsed that he would be the only candidate for the position of Chief Executive? A program that has as its “maximum objective to meet citizens' expectations for a better life” and the “fundamental orientation of implementing the principle of a country, two systems” in a full, correct and firm way ”. The importance of national security was not forgotten, referring to the need for defense “of sovereignty, security and interests of the country's development”. About the sin, Sam Hou Fai said he wanted to erect a "macao based on the rule of law, dynamic, cultural and happy."
The then only candidate to head the government promised to improve the government's governing capacity. "We will strive to raise the capacity and level of governance of MSAR, the change in the concepts of governance, the optimization of the form of governance, the persistence of macao governance in accordance with the law, and the deepening of the reform of public administration and the legal system."
Thus, he said "optimizing forms of governance, giving greater importance to the role of advisory bodies, experts and academics, and love associations of the country and Macao, widely listening to the opinions and suggestions of various sectors, different industry branches and various social strata." It remains to be seen if the lag will bring these tin aspects to the field of actions and concrete measures.
MATE
On Monday, the agenda continues as usual in the presentation of a report of the lag. First Sam Hou Fai will go to the Legislative Assembly, from 15h, make a general presentation to the deputies of political and budgetary issues essential for this year, followed by a press conference.
The next day, it is a day of debate in the hemicycle on the same report, then followed the sectoral debates with all secretaries until the 30th of this month.
One of the political themes that have been in the DAY ORDER is the value of pecuniary checks and whether or not they are attributed to residents living outside Macao. There are analysts to defend the reformulation of the program, but Sales Marques recalls that "the amount expected for pecuniary checks in the budget discussion for 2025 is 10,000 patacas for permanent residents."
“Predicted budget revenues were based on calculation a gross revenue forecast of 240 billion patacas to an average of 20 billion per month. It turns out that the effective revenues obtained until the end of the first quarter of this year were short, with a deviation of less than four billion. be hit. ”
Given these less optimistic predictions, referred to by the Secretary himself for the economy and finance, Tai Kin IP last week, Sales Marques believes that, if there are adjustments in the checks, will be "small". "As for the distribution method, I predict that it remains the same," he said.
Lou Shenghua believes that "the pecuniary reimbursement plan may change." "In terms of amount, it is likely to maintain the value of ten thousand patacas per resident, but regarding the form, it can be attributed to consumer valleys," he said.
Last day 1, Secretary Tai Kin IP said the budget accounts are still short of expected. "We noticed that in the first three months of 2025 the gross revenues of the games reached 57.66 billion patacas, remaining the value almost unchanged in annual terms, not yet reaching the expected monthly average of 20 billion patacas."
Thus, it was left the warning that "this year's financial revenues may not be as optimistic as it is expected", and it is necessary to "seriously study the future economic situation and persist in the management of financial resources with prudence."
Game and other stories
Regarding the game sector, which has continued to have a predominant weight in the economy, Sam Hou Fai confirmed a month ago that concessionaires and satellite casinos have until the end of the year to prepare the transition to a subconsers' exploration model. It will be in the "hands" of the dealers to decide whether or not to explore these casinos directly.
For Sales Marques, this dossier “worries several sectors of society, not only about the use of its workers, but also for the repercussion that will close in the areas of the city where they are, especially in retail and restoration trade, small trade in general”.
Thus, "it will be prudent to avoid great shocks in the current conjuncture." "Everything will be done to regularize these units under the law in force, without provoking their immediate closure," he added.
Lou Shenghua hopes to “have room for negotiation about the distribution of revenues between the satellite casinos and the dealers”.
Despite the concerns that reside in the unemployment of these people, Sam Hou Fai advanced in March to TDM that these fears can be removed. "I know that satellite casinos workers are distributed to the game companies, so operators have the responsibility of absorbing them or having plans for these workers," he said.
Laws for I want you
Given the history of Sam Hou Fai in court, as it has presided over the court of last instance since the establishment of the MSAR, some new measures can be expected in the area of ​​law.
Sales Marques deposits expectations in the creation of new regulations “that are more facilitators to the operation of the economy”, quite “more favorable to the competitive business environment of this Great Bay region, namely as to the hiring of qualified human resources, conditions offered to their stay and that of their families and less bureaucratic administratives”.
Lou Shenghua believes it could, in fact, “pay more attention to legal reform,” although it should be in accordance with government policies and follow the pace of times, not being reformed just because yes, ”he said.</description><pubDate>2025-04-09 02:19:47</pubDate></item><item><title>Book | Mark O'Neill tells the history of Europeans in the early days of Hong Kong</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/01/livro-mark-oneill-conta-a-historia-dos-europeus-nos-primordios-de-hong-kong/</link><description>“Europeans in Hong Kong” is the 18th and new book by British writer and journalist Mark O'Neill, who lives in the neighboring region. At HM, he confesses that he began to write the history of the Irish, but the project eventually expanded. As such, it focused on the stories of Europeans who left their brand in Hong Kong, including Portuguese
 
Hong Kong, the city of banking, finance and commerce, a worldwide warehouse for centuries and a gateway to China. It has been the neighboring region throughout the time, since its institution, in 1841. Hong Kong has always been an international territory populated by Europeans of various nationalities, much more than the British who administered the territory until 1997.
It was missing to tell its story, and British author and journalist Mark O'Neill, residing in Hong Kong since the late 1970s, now has it now with “European Europeans in Hong Kong], which even includes a chapter about the Portuguese.
In another work that has just left the newsstands, the author confesses to HM who began to write the history of the Irish in Hong Kong, whose contribution to the "was huge" territory. This work was not published, being born later the idea of ​​doing something bigger.
“I chose the figures that made the greatest contributions, especially at the religious level, or teachers, writers, great figures in the business world and those whose legacies still last,” he confessed.
Mark O'Neill points out that the great contribution of Europeans in the neighboring region took place in the educational area, but not only. "The most lasting contribution was given by schools, universities, hospitals, homes of elderly, social assistance institutions and some companies. Although they are entities that are currently managed, largely, by people from Hong Kong, were founded and fed by Europeans."
O autor explica que a história mais impressionante associada ao legado dos franceses surge na capa do livro. “No século XIX, as freiras francesas adoptaram dezenas de milhares de raparigas chinesas que tinham sido abandonadas e deram-lhes uma boa vida. Sem elas, as raparigas teriam morrido ou trabalhado como mão-de-obra infantil, empregadas domésticas ou prostitutas”, disse.
Another house
Asked about the new perceptions that the book can bring to the general public, Mark O'Neill understands that he is today "familiar with the history of British in Hong Kong, but not with the history of continental Europe."
Thus, the author says he hopes that "the book will help them understand their history, especially their contribution."
In general terms, "in the early decades [of the Hong Kong Foundation], Europeans were, above all, business men and missionaries, both Catholic and Protestants." Then the region grew “as a great Asian city and, from the 1950s, the community expanded.” "Currently, we have architects, engineers, musicians, teachers, restaurant owners, doctors, lawyers, art and people experts in all the domains of life," said the author.
Another prominent figure in “Europeans in Hong Kong” is the Jesuit Hungarian Father Laszlo Ladany, considered “China's greatest observer in the world for thirty years”, and Anders Nelson, “Swedish singer and long-term resident in Hong Kong, well known to local inhabitants”, describes the introduction of the work.
“Most people think that Hong Kong was built by the Chinese during their 150 years of British dominance, which is not entirely accurate. As the reader will discover, many of the schools, social assistance institutions, buildings and companies in the city were founded and managed by people from Europe (defined here as 'east of calais'). They forced it, ”is described in the same introduction.
Mark O'Neill also describes that the Hong Kong cemeteries contain traces of this presence, as "Europeans have enjoyed the city and their people more than their homeland." The European presence increased in the neighboring region from 1949, when the People's Republic of China is founded, as "the new Chinese government closed the doors to foreigners, with the exception of a small number of people from other socialist countries." Thus, "eager to remain in China and in the Chinese world, many Europeans have moved from mainland China to Hong Kong," he is mentioned.
The Macaense Legacy
The fourth chapter is entirely dedicated to the Portuguese and Macaense Hong Kong community, regarded as a “pillar of society” for many years. “For 150 years, the Portuguese were, after the British, the largest non-Chinese community in Hong Kong,” reads the work, which draws the profile of five personalities and describes two social clubs where the community was.
Regarding the personalities, the example of José Pedro Braga, the first Portuguese to be part of the Legislative Council, between 1927 and 1937; Sir Roger Lobo, member of the Executive Council between 1967 and 1985; and Commander Arnaldo de Oliveira Sales, first president of the urban council between 1973 and 1981.
"The Portuguese played a key role in the government, in banks, the liberal professions and the commercial companies. They lived here for many generations. Most of the expatriates were only the time of their mission; when they renovated, departed and returned to Britain or another country in Europe. book.
Regarding the origin of this community, it is described as a “mixed race”, or macanese, but also Portuguese with Asian origins. “Its history dates back to hundreds of years, in the early days of Portuguese trade and exploitation. In the 16th century, Portugal established commercial warehouses and religious missions in Goa, Malaca, Macau and Nagasaki. The Portuguese settlers married local women, creating a mixed root population in India, Malaysia, China and Japan. In 1639, the Japanese government expelled all foreigners and foreigners and isolated the country from the rest of the world. ”
Macao emerges closely linked to this community, as it became, in the mid-16th century, “the basis of Portugal in East Asia” after the Dutch blocked Goa and won Malacca.
"The Macanese began to form as a cohesive community-sharing ties with Portugal, the Catholic religion, a common language and kitchen and a feeling of distinction from the Portuguese colonials and their Chinese neighbors. They were the only people in Macao who spoke Portuguese and Cantonese, giving them a role of intermediaries essential for the proper functioning of government and business," he is explained.
The fact that “the Hong Kong foundation has devastated the economy of Macao” made many macanese began to move from weapons and luggage to a much more brightly saving zone. After all, "just 66 kilometers away [Hong Kong] was the best deep water port in southern China within laws, administration and military protection in the largest empire in the world."</description><pubDate>2025-04-01 23:22:33</pubDate></item><item><title>EPM | Paulo Rangel guarantees increased financial support after 11 years of cuts</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/31/epm-paulo-rangel-garante-aumento-de-apoio-financeiro-apos-11-anos-de-cortes/</link><description>On a lightning visit to Macao, Portugal's Foreign Minister argued that the position the country maintains in the European Union does not affect the relationship with China. During Paulo Rangel's visit, it was also announced that Sam Hou Fai should visit Portugal during the summer
 
He met with Sam Hou Fai, with counselors from the Portuguese communities, associative representatives, Portuguese educational institutions and entrepreneurs. Thus was the visit of Paulo Rangel, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Portugal, in the short visit to the MSAR, which took place on Friday. There are no passages in the Portuguese School of Macau (EPM) and the Consulate General of Portugal in the territory. In the late afternoon, Paulo Rangel also moved to Hong Kong to visit the exhibition “Lusas Stories”, dedicated to the Portuguese community of the territory, patent at the Hong Kong History Museum. In China, Paulo Rangel was present at the Boao Forum in Haião.
In an interview with TDM, the minister assured that Portugal's relations with China remain good, denying that the country's position in the European Union's position (EU) can represent some kind of obstacle.
"Anyone who thinks that Portugal's presence in the EU is harmful to Portugal's relationship with China, does not realize Portugal's relationship with China and does not realize the role of Portugal in the international picture. I realize that some people do not understand, but honestly we have to see it as more value. And this is seen like this," he said.
One of the voices that criticized Portugal's position in relation to stories such as the issue of Huawei and Rede 5G was Amelia António, lawyer and president of the House of Portugal in Macau.
“My expectation is not high. I would like you minister, after visiting China, to say something friendly, as relationships have been very loose. I would like to see this relationship resumed as usual and also that we were not as followers of the EU positions, so fiercely, because we have very special interests and we have a very large Portuguese community. It should not be lost sight of, ”he told Paulo Rangel to Macao.
The EPM question
In the interview given to TDM, Paulo Rangel also commented on the issue of EPM, stressing the points that were not on the agenda, namely the works of expansion of the facilities.
"This question has not yet been addressed. There are, in fact, several issues that have to be detailed and resolved, and one or the other that have not yet been put on the table. We know that there is search for it, but and I am being totally transparent, it is a question that is not yet on the table."
According to Lusa, Paulo Rangel also announced that the government increased financial support to the EPM, returning to the legally expected level after 11 years of cuts.
"We just replaced the Portuguese contribution to the Portuguese School of Macao, which (…) had suffered a huge cut," Rangel said on Friday.
The Portuguese State holds the majority (51 percent) of the capital of the EPM foundation, but since 2014 that Lisbon only contributed with 10 percent of school expenses, a decision taken under the Portuguese financial rescue program. EPM financing “is now at legal levels again and is the first time at the end of 11 years,” he said.
Shortly thereafter, the chief of Portuguese diplomacy told reporters that "there was no reason, honestly, to have this cut and he remained." "We have increased five times this value [of EPM financing], so this is something that is highly significant from the commitment we have."
"There are governments that really give importance to Macau and China and there are others who do not give, this is something that has to be said," lamented the minister, pointing his finger at the previous executive of the Socialist Party. The replacement of financing “is undoubtedly an important help” for EPM, which Rangel described as having a key role for Portugal in Macau.
"We also have pleased ... that there have never been so many Portuguese students - and now I speak of students from the Chinese community - as there are today in multiple schools," added the leader. "It means that also the special administrative region [of Macau] has encouraged Portuguese teaching and knowledge of Portuguese, and this is something that can only bring good relations between the two sides," added Rangel.
SAM in Portugal
From the meeting with Sam Hou Fai, which also took place on Friday, some ideas and opinions on “bilateral exchange and cooperation in the judicial, economic-commercial, education, among others,” says an official note from the Social Communication Office.
Sam Hou Fai led to the meeting topics such as “the most current development of the deepened cooperation zone between Guangdong and Macau in Henqing”, and remembered that “Paulo Rangel is the first foreign ministerial guardian he receives after the executive's head of the executive, a fact that reflects the good relations between Macao and Portugal with a longtime history”.
The head of the executive also pointed out that after December 20, 1999, Macau, "with strong support from the central government, has insisted on maintaining the principle of" a country, two systems ", preserving the continental legal system, traditional culture and customs, as well as actively maintaining the connection and foster relations with Portugal."
The ruler also said that "Macao has deepened the role of bridge and platform between China and Lusophone countries, continuously boosting the establishment of friendly relationships in the various areas of bilateral cooperation."
Another novelty of this meeting was the information, advanced by Sam Hou Fai himself, which “expects to visit Portugal in the near future” without, however, a concrete date has been announced.
Rangel announced that the chief executive of Macao is expected to visit Portugal "immediately before August or in September." "There is clearly here also an alignment of the priorities that is highly symbolic," said the diplomat, on the fringes of a meeting with the Portuguese community in Macau.
Asked about the restrictions to Portuguese in accessing the resident status, Rangel said he spoke with Sam Hou Fai "on all the issues that are relevant to the relationship between Portugal and the MSAR." "But, as it is a dialogue that is underway, I have a duty to give the opportunity we can, with the questions that have been raised from one part and the other, now we have space and time to build solutions," he added.
Rangel said that the "follow -up of dialogue" with Sam Hou Fai will take place at a meeting of the Portugal -Raem Joint Commission, "which will be organized in principle in the second semester here in Macao."
Paulo Rangel also said, in an interview with TDM, that the visit of Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, president of the Portuguese Republic, “will happen a little later”, precisely due to the marking of new elections in the country. Initially, the aim was that Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa came to Macao in June to commemorate Portugal, Camões and Portuguese communities. The visit should take place in the following months of summer, predicted Paulo Rangel.
Encounters and mismatches
Paulo Rangel also had a meeting with local associative representatives, including with the Portuguese communities counselor. Francisco Mannhão, president of the Macao Retirees, Reformed and Pensioners Association (Apomac), took the opportunity to talk about the bureaucracy that still exists in the relationship with the Caixa Geral de Retirement (CGA).
"To dispatch a survival pension process takes six months and then the correspondence goes back and forth. Macao benches do not have Iban, and this, for example, delays the whole process. Whenever a process goes to CGA, they insist that they do not have the number of IBAN and NIF [Fiscal Identification Number], that most of the widows receiving survival pensions, do not have in Portugal." exemplified.
Mannão also compliments to the Portuguese politician. "For a short time he was here, he showed concern. I liked the presence of the minister." In addition, Francisco Mannão stressed that “in a good time the Portuguese government appointed Alexandre Leitão to Consul”, also recalling the good work of the previous Portuguese consul, Vítor Sereno. "The consulate has never been as well functioned as now. The criticism made to our consul are unfair. There were our associates who told me to have been admired for making a marking and was attended the next day," he said.
More bet on the language
Another important point of Rangel's visit was the promise of the reinforcement of Mandarin teaching in Portugal. "With the Chinese authorities I made a point of saying that we will be very committed to teaching Chinese in Portugal."
In the Chinese capital, Rangel met with Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, before meeting with Chinese vice-minister, Ding Xuexiang, on Hailão Island, where the Boao Forum took place.
"The situation today is much better than it was 20 years ago ... We have, in fact, a formation that we did not have at all," said Paulo Rangel. The formation of fluent people in Mandarin “is also decisive for our future”, but “it is not enough for the challenges we have ahead,” he warned.

"Flowers of Gray" ends the trilogy of works dedicated to Macau, composed of "flowered by mistake the angry roses" and "Nomadic Words"
 
It was ten years that translated into many words. So many, who gave three books, “they were mistakenly flowered to the angry roses”, clearly reference to Camilo Pessanha; “Nomadic Words” and now “Gray Flowers”. Dora Nunes Gago's new poetry book, a teacher and former director of the Portuguese Department of Macao (one), also refers to Macau who lasts in his memory and, therefore, translates into words.
With the seal of Humus, the book has just left Portugal, resulting from the "many poems" written by Dora Nunes Gago during the period in Macao, an experience that turned her into an published and award -winning author.
Writing poetry in these years of teaching and experience the East turned out to be the way found to deal with Macau's reviliations and their dynamics. “Perhaps because it is a shorter record, a way to capture moments, of crystallizing them, in the midst of all the bullshit and surprises that Macau dresses. Maria Ondina Braga referred to the work“ Statue de Sal ”, written in Macao, around 1963, that Macau is 'sleep of sleep and poetry'. Hm.
“Gray Flowers” ​​is called because he went to seek inspiration from a poem by Natália Correia: “(…) young people oblivious to the pulcitude of the body in celebration / pass me as cypresses of cypresses / And the youth gray flower is an edge / strike me by opening vacuums of wild flowers (…) / the gallop in a teeth foam.”
Dora Nunes Gago selected the “surviving poems” of the remaining two titles of the trilogy. “There were those who were lost, between changes, travel, blocks and lost notebooks.” Like the whole macao's own revocation.
In "Gray Flowers," the territory "is represented by rituals, the symbolic times like the Chinese New Year, which is that festive time when the world is reborn and inventing itself." There are also elements that become poetry such as the dumplings, the temples, the island of Hengqin, where the author lived in the days she taught at one.
“The territory is present in the images, but also in the solitude and silence that inhabits the poems, all of them very short. In this book, my obsession with synthesis culminated,” he describes.
Each book, a message
There are poems that speak for themselves, others who need to be explained. And speaking of the trilogy he has written in recent years, Dora Nunes Gago refers to the first, where the pessanha symbolism is sought and where he denotes "the first look at Asia and Macao."
Here there is no poetry, but 24 tales, "many of them inspired by witnessed stories, heard or read in newspapers." Already the award -winning “Nomadic Words”, winner of the Grand Travel Literature Prize Maria Ondina Braga last year, contains 50 chronicles. "It was the way to find a guiding thread to unite various experiences and learning that had a conductive thread for my life."
Behold, in the last book of the trilogy, 55 poems, organized into three parts, namely “exhibitions, permanences and returns” are gathered. They are “a synthesis of all my route,” he says. “Gray Flowers” ​​is “Perhaps the most autobiographical book of the three, as it is rooted in multiple feelings, in a kind of instantaneous ones that configured my days,” says the author.
From the preface, by Maria João Cantinho, it is read that the first of the trilogy, “flowered by mistake the Brave roses” is “a book of brief stories, whose title was taken from loan to a beautiful verse (and a poem) of the melancholy Camilo Pessanha, in Clepsidra”. While "nomadic words" brings together chronic chronicles that are born "from his experience in Macao, as well as his traveler and adventurous aspect, as the Teotónio Almeida needed very praised." In turn, in the third, Dora Gago "changes the record and we find ourselves in the face of poetic and sensitive writing, built by brief poems," he reads.
Maria João Cantinho also understands that the poem “Destiny” is one of the most beautiful in “Flowers of Gray”: “In the crazy run / of the abandoned / lonely Galgo of existing, lick the wounds of death / in the skin of the poem.”
Here, it is described “poetic writing is presented as vertigo (‘ in the crazy race ’) driven by a allegorical impetus, in which the presence of death emerges”, where “fate is certainly this disadvantaged race in which death surrounds the living and only the poem can save or redeem those”, considers Maria João Cantinho.
For this, "Dora Nunes Gago's writing contains a reflective dimension, addressing topics such as the creation or passage of time, among many others, and using a rich, vocabulary and prosodic level language in the search for effects that accentuate the tension of the poem."
“Exiles”, the first part of the work, starts with “beginning”, a simple name for a short poem: “I follow the memory footprints / inscribed in the sand of time / and I am a ship / anchored without leme / no breath”. Perhaps marked by longing and distance, we find “absence”: “They dance solemn ashes / Silvando Winds of Saudade, / Heavens / Spelled / In Blood / Solitude.”
And as this book is made of comings and goings, the work ends with "return", as if it was a timeline: "Returning the house / tattooing hills and valleys / in the retina, / watering the flowers of gray / reborn / in stony cracks / of hope."
Dora Nunes Gago is a native of São Brás de Alportel and is currently a teacher at the Setúbal Polytechnic Institute. About “Nomadic Words”, the Jury of the Grand Prix of Travel Literature Maria Ondina Braga, granted by the Portuguese Writers Association (APE), considered it to be a “work of varied and rich observations concerning the places where the reports of great sensory liveliness go, which does not lack the intimate look at the places and people, as well as the capture of what is capable of the capture of what has been captured of what has been captured of what is has been capturing designating as 'Génie du Lieu' ”.
"In a prose of great fluidity, eavized of reflections where perceptions, memories, culture, literature and history are intersected, the author has been able to lead a reading reading from the first pages, whose rhythm and interest can maintain throughout the considerable extension of the work," said the same jury.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>MNE | BIR OF PORTUGUESE AND EPM are topics to discuss with Paulo Rangel</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/28/mne-bir-de-portugueses-e-epm-sao-temas-a-discutir-com-paulo-rangel/</link><description>During the visit to Macao of Portuguese Foreign Minister, Amelia António and Miguel de Senna Fernandes want to discuss the end of access to BIR access by Portuguese. The president of the House of Portugal in Macau associates this article with the position of Lisbon in the issue of 5G
 
It is another visit of a Portuguese ruler to Macau, but Paulo Rangel's first as Minister of Foreign Affairs of the executive of Luis Montenegro, at a time when the country is preparing to go to votes in May after the dissolution of the Assembly of the Republic.
After a journey through China, Paulo Rangel will meet with local associative leaders in order to perceive existing problems related to the Portuguese community.
At HM, Amelia António, president of the House of Portugal in Macau (CPM), argues that the difficulties of obtaining residence by Portuguese should be one of the pressing matters. “My expectation is not high. I would like the Minister, after visiting China, to say something friendly, as relationships have been very loose. I would like to see this relationship resumed as usual and also that we were not as followers of the positions of the European Union (EU) so fierce, because we have very special interests and we have a very large Portuguese community. of the EU, and this should not be lost sight of. ”
Amelia António highlights the position that Portugal adopted in the case of Rede 5G and Huawei, but also “the development that occurred in relation to the coming of Portuguese to Macau, subject to Blue Card”. “I have the feeling that everything comes following this EU policy against China. Portugal must have a position to safeguard these interests.”
Speaking to Lusa, the official made similar complaints. "We are here, we suffer the consequences of these relationships [between Portugal and China], good or bad. We had very close relations for a long time, which changed with Covid. I have not seen things again as they were, and I think it was important that Mr. Minister explains what is the position," he said that Portugal does not have to "align faithfully with everything in Europe and, above all,"
Before the pandemic, he recalled the official, there was “permanent communication” and “much exchange” between the Portuguese and Chinese authorities.
Today is noticeable a “hardening regarding the Portuguese” in immigration in Macao, Maria Amelia António declared, but not being able to affirm categorically whether the position is related to “this remoteness” between China and the West.
Macao authorities have not accepted new requests for residence in the territory for Portuguese for the “exercise of specialized technical functions”, allowing for justification of family reunion or previous connection to the territory.
Also Miguel de Senna Fernandes, lawyer and president of the Macanese Association, regrets the situation of the assignment of the BIR. "I would like the government of the Portuguese Republic to take into account the Portuguese community in the territory, which faces some difficulties regarding the possibility of obtaining the residence. It is a topic that may be addressed between the Portuguese State and the MSAR, to be greater flexibility to allow the Portuguese community to have greater accessibility to the right of residence, as existed before."
For the causal, "Misrere does not have to randomly assign more homes, but it is something that corresponds only to my desire." "Of course, that Mand has its reasons and Macau is different, and there are other communities that are interested in staying in the territory. The Portuguese community, due to greater historical connection that has to the territory, is still another community, among others. As Portuguese we are, we would like to have greater flexibility," he admitted.
The EPM case
Another point that Amelia António and Miguel de Senna Fernandes want to see approached on Paulo Rangel's visit is the situation at the Portuguese School of Macau (EPM) and the lack of teachers. "I think you should see the school and make a little more awareness of the situation, although the EPM is not from its area. As a member of the government it is important to realize that this situation has been poorly conducted, because in Portugal has been gone after some conversations that have little to do with reality and only harm. If he realized a little more of the situation, it would not be bad," said Amelia António.
Already Miguel de Senna Fernandes says that it is time for the Portuguese executive to stop looking at the school as another Portuguese educational institution abroad. “EPM is always a recurring question, and it all depends on how the Portuguese state looks at school: if you look like any Portuguese school spread around the world, this is a mistake. There is no possible comparison, because the EPM emerged in a very special context.”
However, to Lusa agency, Jorge Neto Valente, president of the EPM foundation, was categorical: the school “has nothing to peddling” to Paulo Rangel. "There is no whimper, we have nothing to do, we have nothing to demand, everything is normal," he said.
The lawyer and president of the founding of the EPM said he hoped Rangel "take a correct perception of the school, what it is for, the goals he has." “It's always good to have direct knowledge, it's much better than in papers,” said Neto Valente. "We have to account that the school is fulfilling the role that is expected to play," added the leader, recalling that the Portuguese State holds the majority of the capital of the EPM foundation.
Still on the EPM universe, Miguel de Senna Fernandes, who also leads the Macanese Instruction Promoting Association (Apim), suggested a close look at the Chinese teaching in the EPM.
"I have always advocated that Cantonese must have status. Because students, when they leave school, are in a singing world. This with all the merit that can have teaching in Mandarin," he said. "It is an issue that should be posed. It's a delicate question, because we are talking about an official language," he added, referring to Mandarin, an official language in China.
The official, also vice president of the EPM foundation, admits that this is not a question that generates consensus -"many parents do not agree with this view" -but stresses that the learning of Cantonese "is a vehicle of integration", as it is the dominant language in the territory.
Yes to the electronic vote
Also to Lusa several associative leaders defended the transition to electronic vote, stressing embarrassment in the current options for emigration. "As long as it is not advanced without being tested, I am fully in agreement. The future is this and we have to point out," said the president of the CPM.
In legislative elections, the Portuguese abroad have the possibility of exercising the right to vote in person or by post, while in presidential and European, the vote is in person.
In choosing correspondence, the government sends the address indicated in the census notebook the voting report and two envelopes, one of green and one white, which must be returned to the Ministry of Internal Affairs after filling.
The electronic option “can offer greater security”, defended Maria Amelia António. "With the consulates to work badly, in order to have few employees, with their work, and in countries where they are far from the places where people live, it is very difficult for people to vote personally. There has also been a lot of failures in the guarantees of receiving vote [via mail]," he added.
The electronic choice is a longstanding claim of the Portuguese Communities Council (CCP). Rui Marcelo, president of the Regional Council of the Portuguese Communities of Asia and Oceania, who has a meeting scheduled with the Portuguese Foreign Minister, said that the “theme is already part of the CCP agenda“ a few years ago and has been approached several times and with several governments ”.
"With the advancement of technology and the possibility of implementing security systems that can ensure vote safety - which happens today through the provision of services in other areas also the government - the conditions are created so that we can eventually evolve into a situation where it can obviously be a complement, but not a substitute," he noticed.
In February, the Portuguese Parliament approved a resolution proposed by the PSD to test the electronic vote in emigration. The President of the Portuguese Republic, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, suggested in December, an electronic voting pilot experience in the circles of emigration.
The head of Portuguese diplomacy arrives in Macau today after passing by Beijing and Haikou, in the province of Haimão, where he was present at the Boao Forum.
In Macao, Paulo Rangel has scheduled meetings with the head of local government, Sam Hou Fai, as well as the counselors of the Portuguese communities, associative representatives, educational institutions and entrepreneurs. Visit the EPM and the Consulate General of Portugal in the territory.
In the late afternoon, MNE goes to Hong Kong to visit “Lusas Stories”, an exhibition dedicated to the Portuguese community at the Hong Kong History Museum.

Francisco Mannão competes again for president, Jorge Fão for the General Assembly and Daniel Mendonça to the Fiscal Council. Mannão suggests the creation of a “satellite city” only for the elderly and calls for pensions update
 
Increasing the elderly pensions would be "gold on blue." In the meantime, Francisco Mannão continues to fight for this and other flags designed to improve the lives of older residents, again leading the candidate list for the management of Apomac - Macao's retirees, retirees and pensioners association, which take place tomorrow.
The list is unique and the faces have little or nothing difference from previous years: Jorge Fão continues to lead the General Assembly, while Daniel Mendonça competes for the Fiscal Council. There is only one new name in the position of Member of the Fiscal Council.
"It is very difficult to find people available to do this volunteer work. Jorge and I would like to find someone who could replace us, because we are for a long time in this association. We are elderly, but we have energy. As long as we have strength on the legs to walk, we are walking and trying to do our best by Apomac," Francisco Mannhão told HM.
Jorge Fão highlights the fact that Apomac has been about to celebrate 25 years since the foundation, noting that there is, in fact, a leadership problem that if not solved can culminate in the disappearance of the association. "We are not seeing the emergence of another list of younger and younger people, so that we offer our services for another term and so on, as far as possible. There is a leading problem at Apomac and in other associations. The Apomac issue is more serious, because we have been standing for 24 years, we will celebrate in May."
Satellite city and pensions
In a list that will lead the association by 2028, the motto is “we are elderly but energetic”, reads in the action program.
At the first point, it is indicated that the team's objective is "to monitor the government's policy and the Macau Foundation, with a view to adjusting the needs of our action program throughout this three -year term." In addition, they intend to "provide the necessary support to members so that they can enjoy the benefits awarded by the Government of MSAR and other official entities."
One of the requests on the list to the government led by Sam Hou Fai is the increase in pensions, which is currently 3,740 patacas. It would be for the association would be the update to four thousand monthly patacas.
"It would be good for the government of MSar to pay the pension to the elderly monthly, the pecuniary compensation and the old age, instead of having to wait every three months to receive the pension for the elderly, seven months to receive the pecuniary compensation and ten months to receive the old age. Hm.
Another idea left by Francisco Mannão is from the construction of a satellite city only for elderly dwellings, in what would be a larger project against residence for the elderly already built by the executive, in the area of ​​sand black.
"I liked the Government of MSA to build a satellite city for the elderly. I worry a lot because there are many living alone, and with the construction of this satellite city they no longer have problems of loneliness, and could live with each other, and can provide services common to all. The construction of high buildings is good, but for the elderly it is not that good," he defended.
Still, Mannão assures that being elderly in Macau is much easier than in Hong Kong. “Nowadays, in Macau, the elderly live quite well, because there are many social support attributed to this group of people.
Sufficient resources
Asked about the essential points to make Apomac a larger association, Francisco Mannhão says that “they have enough”, however, the closure of the clinic where they were provided to the elderly health care.
"Of course we had the plan to be able to develop our headquarters more, but due to the lack of the allowance we had to end our clinic. In this context, we had a program to develop this area that had to be abandoned, and that would benefit our associates. We tried to organize more lectures about health, because the senior group needs to know more about disease and health affairs, something that can generate great concerns."
In political terms, Francisco Mannhão, who was even a candidate for deputy to the Legislative Assembly, says that Apomac is an advocate of the principle of “one country, two systems”, thought by Beijing to the regions of Macau and Hong Kong. "We agree with the national policy of 'a country, two systems', so that Macau can be a paradise for us. So far we have been quite well in Macau, we have no problems, but we would like this principle to continue."
A lot of bureaucracy
One of the services provided by Apomac goes through bureaucratic support to the elderly in communication with the General Retirement Caixa (CGA), in the case of former civil servants who receive the reform of Portugal, or the Macao Pension Fund.
"The communication with CGA has improved a little, but the bureaucratic part is still very difficult to deal with on the part of our associates. Not long ago one of our associates has waited more than three years for an amount of an amount that was improperly charged," said Francisco Mannão.
Jorge Fão, in turn, stressed that Apomac is also popular with non -partners, including from the Chinese community, to treat various issues, such as requests for subsidies or funeral -related paperwork.
Still looking at the Action program, Apomac's list also aims to “organize more sightseeing tours to mainland China, making known its culture and success of the country”, as well as the promotion of “more coexistence, so that members join periodically”. Much sought after by the dining service, since in Apomac some dishes of macanese gastronomy can be eaten, the list wants to "improve the management of the canteen whenever possible."
Asked whether many elderly from Macao wishes, one day, to reform China, at a time when regional integration is increasingly a reality, Francisco Mannão admits yes, although many “prefer to stay in the territory, as they have their life rooted here, being used to the uses and customs of Macao”. "The Government of MSA has been doing a lot of work so that they can join the great bay," he said.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>BOAO FORUM | Ia, globalization and sustainability in discussion</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/26/forum-boao-ia-globalizacao-e-sustentabilidade-em-discussao/</link><description>Another edition of the Boao Forum began in Haião, where topics such as artificial intelligence, globalization, current economic issues and sustainable development will be discussed. The head of the Executive of Masters departs today for the event, whose theme is “Asia in the world in transformation: towards a shared future”
 
Posters to announce another edition of the Boao Forum can be seen everywhere in Haião, the Chinese island that hosts the International Forum promoted by Beijing to discuss, with other countries, issues of economic, commercial and cooperation at various levels.
The MSAR will be represented by an official delegation led by Sam Hou Fai, chief executive, who will be on the island between today and tomorrow. Liu Xianfa, commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China in the MSAR, continues to join the delegation of MSAR as a guest advisor.
The official delegation of the MSAR is also composed by the secretary for the economy and finance, Tai Kin IP, and the chief executive chief of the cabinet, Chan Kak. During the absence of Sam Hou Fai, the Secretary for Administration and Justice, André Cheong, will interim the functions of Chief Executive.
The Boa Goveal Forum for Asia 2025 ends on Friday and has as its theme “Asia in the world in transformation: Towards a shared future” [Asia in the Changing World: Tows a Shared Future], and, according to a statement released by the chief executive's office, focuses on four essential areas, one of them “rebuilding confidence and promoting cooperation in a rapid transformation world”.
Objectives are followed by "encouraging growth and rebalanced globalization for inclusive development" or "modeling the future and rapidly implementing the objectives of sustainable development to respond more effectively to global challenges." In turn, the fourth objective concerns a very current area: Artificial Intelligence (AI).
It is thus intended to “explore potentialities and intensify AI's application and governance for development motivated by innovation”.
According to the People's Daily Journal, this year are expected for more than two thousand participants from 60 countries and regions, being held 50 forums, or discussion groups, around the above objectives. 1,140 journalists are expected to coverage the event.
The forecasts of a forum
The main conferences of the Boao Forum include discussions about the Chinese and World Economy, namely in "High-Level dialogue: China's reform and economic predictions" and "construction of an open world economy: challenges and solutions." Following is “Improvement of the construction of digital capacity &amp; conforming the gap between digital”, as well as “unlock the great potential of regional free trade agreements”.
Among the remaining panels are also conversations about the potential of AI in "AI: how to ensure a balance between application and governance." Countries will also address the issue of global governance in the relationship with the United Nations (UN), in "high-level dialogue: global governance after the UN summit of the future."
But the discussion forums start with some predictions made in the report released in the context of the Boao Forum, entitled "Asian Economic Outlook and Integration Progress". One of the forecasts is that the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the Asian continent should grow 4.5 percent this year, reported Xinhua. "Despite growing global economic uncertainty, Asia remains a key growth engine for the world economy," the report says.
In addition, in terms of parity of purchasing power, the Asia GDP ratio, within the world total, is expected to increase from a registration of 48.1 percent last year to 48.6 percent this year. In turn, the report describes that the general situation of employment and wages “is improving in Asia”, with an unemployment rate of 4.39 percent for this year, less than the global rate of 4.96 percent.
The Asian Economic Outlook and Integration Progress also highlights foreign investments in Asia, describing that China and Asean-Association of Southeast Asia nations "are the most appealing economies in Asia." In addition, it refers that the dependence on the internal and external foreign direct and external investment of Asian economies in the region itself reached 49.15 percent by 2023.
From the point of view of the bidirectional dependence of IDE in Asia, China continued to be the most dependent economy of the Asian IDE flows, followed by Indonesia, with its dependence rates over 80 percent and 75 percent, respectively.
The report also pointed out that China remains the center of global production value chains, and since 2017, global trade in intermediate goods has been more dependent on China than in North America.
In 2023, China's global dependence on intermediate goods was 16 percent compared to 15 percent to North America. The commercial friction caused by the United States in 2018 did not raise their position in the global value chains of the transforming industry, the report added.
Thus, the advance of Asia is also described in the level of emerging green technologies, since this is "driven by strong industrial capabilities and political support." Thus, the continent seems to be positioning itself "as a potential leader in advanced materials related to batteries or production of biodegradable plastics."
China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea dominate the Lithium Battery Battery Technology Global Supply Chain, a factor considered crucial for the electrification of transport, the report underlines. However, China is at the forefront of the expanding green hydrogen industry in Asia, being the region responsible for almost 70 percent of the worldwide capacity of hydrogen electrolisters, also reveals the same report.
An ecological island
According to an Xinhua report, Haião Island, which welcomes the Boao Forum, is “a pioneer in development with low carbon emissions”, namely the use of photovoltaic energy.
"On Dongyu Island, in Hainan province, southern China, the almost null carbon emissions demonstration zone is redefining harmony between humanity and nature-remodeling modern life through the integration of cutting-edge technology with sustainable development," he describes.
But there are more technological news, such as the use of "a simple QR code that unlocks a coffee carbon emissions experience, and where a robotic arm prepares coffee using clean energy." There is also the bet on recycling, as "an advanced recycling cube separates the materials, converting them into" carbon points ", which can be changed to ecological awards."
The area that welcomes the Boao Forum has a total area of ​​190 hectares, where a bet on “three key strategies” was made, namely the “renewal of ecological buildings, use of renewable energy and ecological transport”. The renewal of the zone for more sustainable bets will have begun in 2022, being proof of “how technological innovation and urban renewal can shape a future with low carbon emissions, paving the way for sustainable development, particularly in the tropical regions of the world,” says Xinhua.
Also according to the same report, "one of the main strengths of the area lies in energy production capacity", currently producing "about 32 million kWh of green electricity, almost double its search for 17 million kWh". In turn, "surplus energy is introduced into the network, contributing to an annual savings of 7 720 tons of negative carbon resources," he said to Xinhua Ouyang Qinglun, deputy director of the Cosco Shipping Boao Co. Department of Engineering.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Mud market | Retched contest to assign stalls</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/09/mercado-da-taipa-arrancou-concurso-para-atribuir-bancas/</link><description>Yesterday the public tender for 20 lightweight sales, coffee, cultural and creative products in the mud market began.

In addition to subsistence means, Ho Ion Sang highlights the importance of planning professional career and providing child care
 
Ho Ion Sang advocates the reinforcement of cooperation between the government and local associations to provide victims of domestic violence with more subsistence means. The subject is addressed through a interpelation written by the residents' deputy, in which greater cooperation between the government and local associations is requested.
In the document, Ho advocates the reinforcement of the “social assistance network” and the improvement of “support for the level of subsistence means of domestic violence and children”, which involves not only the availability of financial support, but also by “more oriented and diverse services, such as career planning, vocational training and child care”.
According to the deputy, in the current context, associations should assume a key role in helping victims in life after episodes of domestic violence, in cases where they need a network of support to rebuild their lives.
Ho Ion Sang is a deputy for the residents' association, one of the most supported by the government with public funds.
More cooperation
The reinforcement of cooperation between local associations and the government is not only intended to request more resources. Ho Ion Sang asks for the development of guidelines, promised by the executive for this year, who will define ways to deal with cases of domestic violence when there are children involved. In the questions sent to the government, the deputy recalls that the guidelines were completed in 2023, and that last year the authorities heard public services and associations. However, the executive's goal was to publicize and implement the guidelines throughout this year, without more information so far. Therefore, the deputy asks the government to reveal the calendar when they will be presented.
In written interplies, the deputy also considers that “cooperation with non -governmental organizations and consolidate resources from all parties involved” to “create a favorable atmosphere for the whole community to oppose and unanimously resist domestic violence”.
Regarding prevention, Ho Ion Sang praises the work carried out, with the approval of the legislation that made this a public crime, which has led to a gradual reduction of occurrences. However, it asks the executive not to make it easier for the efforts to combat crime to alert the population more to this phenomenon.</description><pubDate>2025-04-09 23:22:33</pubDate></item><item><title>Dsal | New job sessions this month</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/09/dsal-novas-sessoes-de-emprego-este-mes/</link><description>The Directorate of Services for Labor Affairs (DSAL) again organizes new employment pairing sessions in collaboration with the Macao Workers Association Federation (Faom).

With several schools linked to government -funded associations that present candidate lists for elections, cases of election campaign through students, as with the delivery of leaflets, are not uncommon. For this reason, Caeal highlighted the need for the directions to ensure that schools remain on the sidelines of the electoral act.
The chairman of the committee, Judge Seng Ioi Man, stressed in the session that "public schools must maintain a neutral position, and that their employees should also maintain a neutral position before the various application lists, during the execution of their tasks, not being able to proceed electoral advertising during the time or working space."

Ella Law recalled that Sam Hou Fai highlighted the guarantee of residents' work rights as one of their priorities of the mandate, leaving the hope that the government revises the number of labor authorizations granted to non -residents. In this chapter, law expects more incentives for places to take on head positions, especially in large companies.
In addition, Ella Lei wants the government to reinforce the fight against illegal workers, citing the complaints of residents that in construction, restoration, or drivers, it is normal for illegal workers and in recent years still enter other sectors such as conventions and exhibitions, tourism and filming.</description><pubDate>2025-04-09 02:23:58</pubDate></item><item><title>Housing | Request support for those in the waiting list</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/09/habitacao-pedido-apoio-para-quem-esta-em-lista-de-espera/</link><description>In the middle of the electoral pre-campaign, Nick Lei has insisted on the subject of housing. The deputy released yesterday a written interpellation where he asks for the return of the allowance for those who wait for a social housing fraction, and the reduction of waiting time for the delivery of a home
 
For more than three months from the beginning of the campaign for the next elections that will select the future cast of the Legislative Assembly, Nick Lei seems to have chosen one of his priorities: public housing.
After on Monday, the deputy linked to the Fujian community released a response from the Housing Institute to a written interpellation on economic housing, yesterday was the turn to address social housing.
Nick Law insists on the return of the subsidy to help pay the income to candidates waiting for a fraction. The so -called “residence allowance” was created in the second term of Edmund Ho in the government leadership, to help families who met the access criteria for a social housing, but who were on the waiting list, because there is no available apartments.
In the last round of the support, in 2022, the amount of the subsidy was 1,650 patacas per month, for aggregates with one or two members, and 2,500 patacas per month, for household aggregates with more than two people.
The deputy acknowledges that in the near future, the supply of social housing may satisfy the demand. But for now, there are those who have been waiting for a fraction for over two and a half years.
"It should be noted that families who expect social housing are all composed of economically disadvantaged residents. Although the government has ensured that the waiting for a fraction was reduced to a year after the implementation of the permanent candidacy mechanism, this continues not to reflect real wait between the various types of apartment typology," said the deputy.

More worthwhile
Nick Law sets the example of the social housing apartment candidates, which largely exceed the offer. But it admits that the blocks of this type of public housing in zone A of new landfills, which must be completed between 2026 and 2027, can help solve the situation by offering about 4,088 apartments, of which 3,276 are T1. In addition, also the Avenida Venceslau de Morais Social Housing Complex, the Mong Son Building will help to bridge the gaps on the side of the offer. This building consists of three blocks, with 24 to 35 floors, three floors in a basement, providing 885 T1 typology fractions and 705 T2 typology fractions, totaling 1,590 social housing fractions.
The deputy argues that the financial pressure caused by the lease market seriously affects the poorest families, especially compared to the annual rise of 3.9 percent of the income averages last year.
Another of the deputy's demands is the maximum guarantee that the government gave four years, between the moment a social housing candidacy is accepted and the delivery of a home. Nick Law would like this warranty period to be reduced.</description><pubDate>2025-04-09 02:22:16</pubDate></item><item><title>Order and Chaos do not exist</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/09/a-ordem-e-o-caos-nao-existem-2/</link><description>(Continuation of the edition of April 3)
America, China and Russia fear for their existence. In these degrees of self -conscience, it is only considered alive who is a great power. If we are reduced to a lower level, we are tempted to commit suicide (experienced sweetness of the Soviet Union). We let ourselves go. Hence the "great war" in several warm or warm theaters that if not suspended will become "total". The disorder opens holes that invite the ambitious. Old empires already diagnosed as being irreversible (Turkey, Japan), former colonies that rediscover as civilized states (India/Bharat), humiliated and offended nations due to the infringement of their neighbors (eg, Poland).
While the protagonists in the day before yesterday are struggling from the fake penultimate hegemony to the false couple France-Germany, confined to "Simul Stabunt Simul Cadent." The waves of chaos swallow neutral or neglected lands reduce the distances between the “three large”, elbow the elbow in the seas of China, Ukraine, soon in the arctic. The hegemonic transition flows from America to chaos. And then it will remain for a long time. A rival colossus does not dissolve overnight, especially if it is able to drag the rest of the world to the disaster. When your time comes, your last wish will be to prevent others from occupying your throne.
America is fighting with itself. Epic conflict, to which the esoteric verses of Theodor Däbler, Austrian of Trieste, which states that "the enemy is the figure of our own matter will apply/ And he will pursue us, and we to him, to the end." In the struggle for survival, America knows that its inner evil is healed towards the world, but only after restoring the natural order of things. We, Europeans ahead, the others behind or against. The new winning combination of uninhibited post liberal elites and techniques, anarchive hybrids, is convinced of this, reinforced by the vindictive enthusiasm of the middle-classes frustrated by globalization, the “invasion” of non-assimilated allergen in the WASP canon and the decline of their own lifestyle. This strange alliance found in Donald Trump his exuberant champion.
Prophet of the “common sense”. Brutal in logic and gestures. Incarnation of the “terrible simplifier”, the ideal type of demagogue violating rules evoked with horror by Swiss historian Jakob Burckhardt in the late nineteenth century. Inspired by the Republic of Plato would say that "justice is but the benefit of the strongest." Baptize itself as a "very stable genius." Chosen by God, who diverted the bullet with which the satanic "deep state" wanted to liquidate him. The story will say. However, let us notice that there is genius in its terribly simplified actions. To bring to the letter. The first act of the second Trump, subversive and man of the order, is very scenic. Frantic. America's disease requires dangerous healing. A nearly 80 -year -old president, with only four years in office ahead, starting from the principle that he will not eventually reinterpret the Constitution, inventing a third one has to worry.
He starts from where he can reap immediate rewards that is the American myth. His narrative extols the will and, therefore, the certainty of being great again. For Trump, wanting is power. Wanting is dreaming and dreaming. Reveal the “manifest fate 2.0” to its compatriots. New border required. Operational objective. Ergo, the mastery of the space to control the earth and to snatch the audience with the Martian legend told by Musk; Supremacy reinforced in AI to govern cyberspace, lead the technological revolution, reinvent the industry on unpublished, perhaps fantastic principles avoiding discovering them too early so as not to alienate the workers; Delete the Ukrainian and Middle East fires and prepare the wars of the future whose dawn we can barely glimpse.
Possibly without combating them, thanks to the restoration of the lost deterassion. The alpha and the omega of this narrative is the quick ads through social networks. Technology stars preside over the chapters of myth. It is the generals who lead the respective avant -garde on the technological fronts of strategic value. Almost autonomous powers that Trump intends to explore, control and master as they penetrate informally in the state's ruins. Announces a battle between Trumpian tribes by public and private skills and powers. Better, public-private, given the overlap of functions and responsibilities. Game without rules. Sooner or later, the confrontation between Trump and Musk, the most celebrated and powerful of the technological border oligarchs, which the president kicks or frustrated, yes, day no, seems inevitable.
A decisive confrontation, because without the technological star the Trumpian dream would become a nightmare. Trump, the revolutionary, rare but true where an individual's success or failure will affect the fate of the nation and the world. The proof of how deep and structural is the emotional collapse of Americans. The revolt of a court of filthy rich, bored by money and energized by power, destroyed the centered exhausted stablishment. The holograms of the Biden administration are enjoying an unmerited rest. While federal and blue bureaucracies are involved in a party guerrilla war with the support of the hard line. A low intensity civil war. The New York tycoon wants to cut the Gordian knot that is strangled to America which is the incompatibility between exceptionalism and universalism.
Complexio Oppositorum as he called Jung for containing the opposites within himself and enrolled by the founding parents in the genetic code of stars and stripes, which made the United States a unique specimen in the potential of the powers. Making America big again means opting for exceptionalism rather than universalism. Establish yourself unsurpassed at the top of the world as it is, and not redeem it as it should be. If they want to reaffirm themselves as number one, keeping the Chinese at a distance, they cannot consume in endless, often lost and, at best, repressed wars.
Nor turn other tyrannies into democracies, violate tribes into nations, transmute other people's misery into prosperity at the expense of their own half-lives.</description><pubDate>2025-04-09 23:53:25</pubDate></item><item><title>The psychology of attraction at first sight</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/09/a-psicologia-da-atracao-a-primeira-vista/</link><description>"Attraction at first sight" is a phenomenon that fascinates everyone. The romantic comedies portray her as an instant and uncontrollable moment between two people. It is now necessary to unravel the possible explanations behind this phenomenon, resorting to two major schools of thought: cognitive psychology-which develops empirical methodologies to test hypotheses on the subject-and the psychodynamic approach-that works with interpretative bases. Both perspectives build metaphors that help us interpret these processes. Thus, we can oscillate between two proposals: will at first glance be a product of deeply rooted unconscious mechanisms or, on the contrary, a posteriori romantic construction, based on sensory and cognitive processes?
Cognitive psychology suggests that "attraction at first sight" can result from rapid processing of sensory and emotional information. The human brain is programmed to recognize standards and categorize information efficiently, allowing us to evaluate someone in fractions of second, based on facial traits, expressions or body language. Studies on social perception confirm that we formulate immediate judgments about others. From a biological point of view, this phenomenon may be linked to activation of the dopaminergic system, responsible for the regulation of pleasure and reward. When we find someone we consider attractive, the brain releases dopamine, triggering a desire for proximity. In addition, investigation into pheromonas indicate that we are unconsciously attracted by partners whose immune system complements ours, favoring genetic diversity in descent.
On the other hand, the psychodynamic approach, rooted in Sigmund Freud's psychoanalysis, explains the attraction at first sight through unconscious mechanisms. From this perspective, past experiences - especially those of childhood - shape our standards of attraction. When we feel instantly attracted to someone, it may be because this person acts memories or emotions associated with primary linking figures such as parents or caregivers. Attraction does not focus on the other as a real person, but in the way he resonates within our unconscious structure of desire. The other can symbolize something we lack, something interdict or an emotional issue not yet resolved. This mechanism, known as projective identification, explains how we can feel a strong attraction to someone who unconsciously represents significant parts of our psychic history. According to this theory, we rarely fall in love with those who really are, but by the way we project in it our unresolved emotional needs. The attraction is therefore a meeting of unconscious, where both project family standards in each other.
Of course beliefs also shape romantic expectations. If we believe that instant attraction is a sign of destination, we tend to attribute to it emotional meaning. The impact of culture and social norms shows how the perception of “love at first sight” can be influenced by romanticed narratives. For example, in books, movies or advertising romanticizes the idea of ​​attraction at first glance, creating a narrative that leads people to idealize and expect intense and immediate emotional links. This cultural expectation can influence the way we interpret real encounters-if someone lives in tune with romantic ideals, it is more likely to attribute emotional meaning to an instant attraction, facing it as something "intended to happen" or "predestined".
Cognitive psychology faces the phenomenon more pragmatically, almost stripping it of its romanticism: it all depends on our mental processing and what we consider relevant. Psychoanalysis, on the other hand, articulates the cross between fantasy and reality, proposing that although the attraction at first glance is composed of projective and fanciful elements, they are not totally dissociated from the meeting itself. There is something significant in this dynamic; Otherwise, people would not fall in love. As a psychoanalyst would say, we are attracted to those who can nourish our psychic wounds-which later may reveal the cause of dysfunctions in the couple. There is an intangible domain that subtly communicates who we are, where we have come from and how we can complete.
In short, while neuroscience and cognitive psychology highlight automatic and hormonal reactions, psychodynamics emphasizes the role of unconscious and past experiences. Although cognitive and psychodynamic psychology can seem opposite-one focusing on conscious and observable processes and the other in unconscious and emotional mechanisms-there is potential for overlap, and recognizing it could make explanation more robust. The cognitive perspective on attraction, which emphasizes rapid and automatic judgments based on physical signals and emotional responses, can be understood as the initial and superficial processing that is complemented by unconscious processes.
But my proposal is another: show that the way we look at the phenomenon affects the way we live it. Each explanation can better adapt to each person's experiences. Is the attraction at first glance rooted in an authentic and deep desire, or is it an illusion fueled by the human need for connection and meaning? The answer may reside in each other's imagination and wealth. Ultimately, the way we interpret the phenomenon of “attraction at first sight” can be deeply influenced by the brain and unconscious mechanisms discussed, but also by the cultural narratives we internalize. Thus, experience will always be an intersection between what we feel and how we learn to feel.</description><pubDate>2025-04-09 02:52:48</pubDate></item><item><title>Hong Kong International Academy Against Corruption (II)</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/07/academia-internacional-de-hong-kong-contra-a-corrupcao-ii/</link><description>Last week, we debated the Independent Commission Against Corruption of Hong Kong (HKICAC) (Hong Kong Against Corruption Committee) and Hong Kong International Academy Against Corruption (HKIAAC) (HGO KONG ACADEMY AGAINST CORRUPTION) and we introduced their origins succinctly. Macao Commissioner against Corruption, (CCAC).
In 1975, during the Portuguese administration of Macao, the fight against corruption was carried out by the Judicial Police. In 1992, the then government of Macao created the High Commissioner against corruption and administrative illegality. Referring to Hong Kong's experience, which had become one of the most impollowing places in the world, when writing Macau's Basic Law, it was clearly stipulated that CCAC would have to be created.
The CCAC website underlines the committed work it develops to review the law and strengthen the fight against corruption. One of the most illustrative cases is that of Man Long:
“Investigating the case of corruption A to Man Long began in 2005, when during the investigation of a corruption case based on information available in the meantime, CCAC found that the then secretary for transport and public works was involved in suspicion of abuse of power. He will have accepted bribes of large construction entrepreneurs and the winners of major government works are indicated.”
(In April 2007, the first phase of the inquiry against Man Long was completed. It was found that, during the time of the secretary, his heritage reached a total of 800 million patacas, ie, 57 times higher than the remuneration of the position. Objects. On January 30, Tui ordered Man Long for 57 crimes of passive corruption, whitening, abuse of power and others, to the prison penalty of 27 years and the payment of compensation of 240,000 Patacas to the Government of the Government, being declared in favor of the government all assets from illicit acts.).
This shows that CCAC has achieved extraordinary results in its work to combat corruption.
In 2006, the International Association of Anti-Corruption Authorities (Iaaca) was created in Beijing. It is the first international anti-corruption organization in the world with agencies from various member countries. It aims to actively promote the “United Nations Convention against Corruption” and reinforce international cooperation between counterparts from various countries. Cao Jianming, Attorney General of China's Supreme Popular Attorney's Office, was elected president of IAACA twice, on November 5, 2010 and November 24, 2013. The mandate of the IAACA President is three years. On January 5, 2022, the Commission Commission Commission against Hong Kong Corruption, Ba Yunliu, was elected as a new president. Later, Ba Yunliu retired. On September 1, 2023, Hu Yingming assumed the position of president of IAACA.
IAACA has a “Federation Secretariat”, created by HKICAC on January 6, 2022 to support the HKICAC Commissioner in the exercise of his duties as president of IAACA. The main responsibility of the Federation Secretariat is to support or organize activities. HKIAAC is affiliated with the HKICAC International Cooperation and Institutional Affairs Division and performs part of the federation secretariat's duties.
Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee believes that, in addition to cooperating with China's work and anti-corruption policies, HKICAC also cooperates with organizations around the world to jointly promote the global anti-corruption cause. HKICAC can help improve the fight against corruption in Hong Kong, promote the region's unpolluted environment and promote the stability, integrity and rule of law of Hong Kong society.
Currently, HKICAC has already trained in over 70 countries. In February 2024, HKICAC coorganized a “International Anti-Corruption Course on Financial Investigation and Pursuit of Fugitives and Stolen Assets”, lasting nine days, in collaboration with the “Operational Network of Agencies for the Anti-Corruption Law of the United Nations Drug and Crime Law”.
In March 2024, HKICAC opened a five-day anti-corruption course for more than 90 employees from the “illegal enrichment office” in Mali, covering topics such as research techniques, integrity management and public education. In early April 2024, HKICAC sent staff to Kazakhstan in Central Asia to conduct courses to nearly 200 local anti-corruption agencies.
In May 2024, HKICAC signed a memo of cooperation with the United Nations and Crime Operational Network of Application Agencies. In May 2025, it assisted it in the writing of the “Prison Corruption Risk Management Guidelines”.
A HKICAC spokesman pointed out: “HKICAC values ​​the operability that combines theory with practice, actively fulfills its anti-corruption mission, build an international platform for integrity, promote the development of the anti-corruption cause globally, and unequivocally contributes to its advancement worldwide.”
HKICAC has provided several anti-corruption formations in many countries and worked hard to combat global corruption. These achievements were made under the leadership of China. From now on, HKICAC will not only continue to compete with this work, but its existence will speak for the history of China and Hong Kong.

It is an inquiry carried out by companies created to inquire with people something that is intended to have a widespread idea. Well, widespread is never possible.
Because most political polls are a bullshit. There are the most varied types of polls: commissioned by political parties, television channels and radio, newspapers and some simply by economic groups. Political polls in Portugal have been a crushing crush on the end result of elections. There was a year, where all the polls held with the respondents gave victory to the Socialist Party and who won the elections was the PSD. And the opposite has already happened.
The polls that have been released lately, in relation to the next early legislative elections and marked on May 18, have left the majority of the disoriented population. And why? Now, because the polls are a bullshit. Some polls have been carried out - in a population of millions of people - along with 500, 800 or 1000 people, with the aggravation of contacts to be made for fixed phones numbers.
And who has a landline today? A few old men and a little more. Now, a poll of this genre, incredibly commissioned by a television station, another radio and a daily newspaper, has any credibility? It does not have, but influences the electorate potential. And here is the Busis of the question. There are polls that only aim at the mental influence of voters.
There are polls for all tastes. It is even shameful. Certain polls we know that they are paid to birth for a certain political party and always present this party ahead. It is total manipulation. We have had other polls that are the total disparity.
Some give victory to the PSD-CDS coalition for six points ahead of the Socialist Party. Others present the PS victory with three percentage points about the PSD-CDS. There are polls that give up 12.3 percent while others provide a result to 18.5 percent populists. Obviously something is wrong. Even the Catholic University that always had the greatest credibility with the Portuguese regarding polls, so that this time did not miss, presents a technical draw between the PS and PSD-CDS. Most polls are manipulative of the voter's future vote.
The numerical difference between the different surveys, shows that it does not hit the boot with Perdigota. We remember perfectly what happened in the 2022 elections, when the socialists won the absolute majority with all the polls to give the PSD the victory? The PS turned out to be 5.5 percent than what the polls predicted and the PSD had 5.5 percent. The polls were manipulated to scare people and lead them to vote in a certain way.
The PS would never have had an absolute majority, if surveys such as intercampus and not only, they would not talk to a technical draw and a Taco-Taco between PS and PSD, which simply did not exist. A colossal error, a clamorous disadvantage between polls and what happened in reality, or results from a festival of incompetence, or it was a criminal strategy of general electorate manipulation, read a colossal scam. In the first case these surveys should never be hired again, in the second there would have to be license losses.
And in both cases, we suggest that one will end up with the dissemination of polls in both pre, in the middle of the election campaign. It is right in sight of all what is going on to the elections of May 18. Some poll companies are even manipulating the electorate, including the number of undecided. Some polls opine that there are still 18 percent of indecisions, others say the undecided are around 3 or 4 percent.
It is more than proven that in most cases we are facing bullshit polls. Because they manipulate, lie and obey those who order. On the other hand, we have party leaders who laugh at the results of some polls. It is well known that political parties order polls only for internal analysis. And in certain cases, there are parties that have well -held polls and with a vast number of respondents and know that the intention of the Portuguese vote is absolutely contrary to what is being disclosed by certain television channels and certain newspapers.
However, the Monarchical Popular Party, which was removed from AD, has judicially contested that the name Democratic Alliance (AD) continued to appear in the voting newsletters for May 18. And the court gave it reason and the PSD and the CDs were forbidden to use the acronym democratic alliance.
But, as in politics village is a constant, so the PSD and CDS leaders invented a maneuver, so that the Constitutional Court could not fail. And presented the denomination “AD-College PSD-CDS”. Okay, won the cleverness Saloia. It is that there are many more monarchical than voters in Portugal in Portugal. Even so, the PPM has already appealed in court to support that it is illegal to maintain the acronym AD.
This election campaign will be hard. Luís Montenegro will be confronted with all the cambalachians that are responsible for him. Pedro Nuno Santos will not be saved from being accused of inventing three airports to Lisbon overnight and having harmed the country with everything that happened in TAP. And André Ventura? Well, this one is losing voters in each passing month and today says one thing and tomorrow another. The credibility of yours arrives is gradually lowering, because you have not missed the cases and houses, such as deputy that stole bags, another that is suspected of pedophilia and so many other facts that have taken potential voters for other stops.</description><pubDate>2025-04-07 02:00:04</pubDate></item><item><title>Photography | IIM with a new edition of “A Discovery of Macao and Hengqin”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/09/fotografia-iim-com-nova-edicao-de-a-descoberta-de-macau-e-hengqin/</link><description>The Macao International Institute (IIM) again organizes a new edition of the “Macao and Hengqin discovery” photography contest, accepting images submission until September 26.

This is the history of the first air trip between Vila Nova de Mil-Fontes and Macau starring the airmen Sarmento Beires, Brito Pais and Manuel Gouveia
 
The Children's Festival Letters &amp; Company, promoted by the Portuguese Institute of the East (IPOR), hosts this Saturday the launch of the Chinese version of “The Adventurous Journey of the Fatherland”, a book by Filipa Brito Pais, teachers, telling the story of the first air trip between Portugal and Macau starring the Author, Brito Paisvô, and Menuel Macavô Gouveia. Last year the centenary of this trip was celebrated, and hence Filipa wanted to tell her to a younger audience. The work has illustrations by Leonor Almeida.
In a press release, Filipa Brito Pais describes that “as a teacher of the first cycle, I have been to several schools in Portugal and Macau to fulfill my memory duty to my uncle”. Thus, “the possibility of writing a children's book that would accompany me in the lectures I give, due to the lack of appropriate information to the younger audience, and has been successful in the more adult audience”.
“The adventurous trip of the homeland” has a preface by the president of the Portuguese Republic, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, as well as the support of several entities linked to Macau.
At a time when the version translated to Chinese is known, the work has already been presented to over 2500 students in schools and municipal libraries in Portugal. It was up to the translation of the work.
At the time of launch in Portugal, Filipa Brito Pais told HM that many stories of the trip had to be left out, but this is a tribute to heroes who were forgetting in Portuguese historiography.
“It does not portray all the steps, because it would be impossible for it to be for children. It is a book whose story is very reduced, even at the request of my editor, because I wanted to put all the adventures and adventures they lived. The story of writing on the plane screen in the match was one of the fact that Manuel Gouveia [the mechanic] was said to die. Another of the bath taken to cold water that was then boiling water, ”he said.
For the author, they are adventures "demonstrations of courage and perseverance, leadership ability," this is a book with a strong message, so that young people "do not give up their dreams."
Feed memory
In the same note sent to the newspapers, Filipa Brito Pais describes the fact that “these national heroes [have been] forgotten in history for political reasons”, namely by opposing one of the airmen to the 1926 military dictatorship. The fact that the dictatorial regime of the Estado Novo was instituted a few years later in Portugal in 1933, further contributed to this aerial achievement. To make the trip, several popular background capture campaigns were created, but the best known air route was the trip of Gago Coutinho and Sacadura Cabral.
"I had the honor of having been present in June 2024 in Macao and Hong Kong when the celebrations of the centenary of my uncle's trip, representing the Brito Pais family. I will now have the greatest honor of presenting the book in Chinese and honoring these three Portuguese heroes in the diaspora," he said.
“Brito Pais and Sarmento de Beires dreamed of flying and honoring the homeland and Camões, choosing the destination of Macao, which at that time was Portuguese land. Without financial support and with an old and heavy plane, they risked and flew over countries that until then no one had dared to fly.

The event takes place in the scope of the “Reflections on Afternoon” lectures, and has the moderation of Paulo Cardinal, jurist and teacher. Both teach at the University of Macao Law School.
The event aims to make known the premises of the book “The Legal Status of the Financial Action Task Force in the International Legal System”, released in January, and the conference on the “Evolution of the International Financial Financial Action Group (Gafi) legal status, based on the bold argument that Gafi gradually evolved into an international organization, addressing this issue of international law. and the law of international organizations, combining theory and practice, ”according to the author, cited by a FRC statement.
Gafi (FATF) is the worldwide organization responsible for setting international policies and standards in combating capital bleaching, financing terrorism and proliferation of weapons of massive destruction, and the occurrence of other threats to the integrity of the world financial system.
Years of Analysis
As a legal consultant in international law, the author has witnessed over two decades “gradual metamorphosis, which began to be a specialized technical organism, for a complex and multifaceted organization, whose legitimacy is impaired by the lack of clarity as to its legal position”.
The scope of the organization, and the long -reaching impact of its policies and measures, to respond to global trends and threats that pose a risk to the international financial system, as well as how members, non -members, international organizations and other interveners have accepted and implemented them, without a thorough examination (weights and counterweights) and without questioning their legal status, is the reflection that is placed.

How do you feel about presenting your work in Macau?
Unfortunately I was never in Macau. I was contacted about two or three years ago by Rita and João [Rita Machado and João Ó] to participate in a project, I saw the things they were developing, and that seemed very interesting to me. We had a conversation and from then on we knew that there was a hypothesis of doing a joint project in the future. But only now can we realize it.
What kind of jobs does this shower bring?
It is an interesting façade with a mosaic, where there is a showcase and we did a wallpaper installation, which is a kind of façade continuity, as if it were a distorted grid. We have after the LED fans with two globes that run in all directions in a chaotic way. It is a kind of street exhibition because it is in a showcase.
Is it to you a different way of presenting your work with the public?
I have already exposed in various museums and spaces, and exposed in a more classic way, so to say, with exhibitions. But I also did a lot of projects in the so -called public space, such as metro or train stations. That's why I'm now in Naples, because I'm working on a project for a huge metro station in partnership with an architect.
As an artist, how do you feel more comfortable showing your work? In a museum, or in a public space?
I like to work in both ways. It must be borne in mind that when you do a project in public space, people have no choice. They have to cross a metro station or a train station [and see the exposed project]. But when you go to a gallery or museum, it's a conscious decision of someone who knows he will confront the art exposed there. This is the main difference. Therefore, we have a different audience when we work in a public space, and we have to adjust our visual language to a specific situation.
It is considered one of the pioneers of computational art and the integration of a digital environment in art. How did you decide that this was the way to follow as an artist?
When I was just a young artist in 1984, I went to an office machines fair in Vienna. I remember when Apple's Macintosh was presented, the first computer that had an icon-based user interface, in graphic information. It was thus the first machine in which the user did not have to have any kind of programming about programming, one could use Macintosh quite intuitively. This was, of course, a paradigmatic change, and it was evident that it would change the way images are produced and how they are communicated. This was one of the aspects that influenced me. Another has to do with the fact that, in art history, computers have no presence at that time, that is, there was not much to do at that time, so the opportunity to create a kind of new visual language was quite good. These were the two main reasons that led me to choose this means as my main tool.
Actualmente, com a Inteligência Artificial (IA), há todo um novo universo que pode ser explorado artisticamente. 
Well, I believe it will change our lives at various levels, it will affect the entire social context. The internet was, by itself, a big change, and social networks also came to change a lot. AI is not just something with an impact on art, but in our entire lives.
What kind of messages are transmitted with your work?
There is no specific type of message, I would say. When we work with computers and use them as a visual tool we are linked to all other domains where this type of digital media plays a role. Therefore, it is an area that tells us something about a particular situation at a certain historical moment.

What expectations do you have about the reception of your work in Macau? And what influence can the territory bring to your work?
I start by saying that the visual language I use in my work has a very universal character. I work with some elements that can be read in any type of culture, such as the brain, the hands, the globe, tubes. All of these images do not have any kind of specific cultural connotation. I look forward to going to Macau so that I can realize the specific qualities of the territory. I assume that Macao is the result of a very complex situation due to historical circumstances, with the fact that it was a Portuguese colony with China which, at this moment, presents a powerful economic context. There are many influences that intersect there.
Throughout his career he has exposed in the main museums and galleries around the world. Did you expect this international recognition?
Above all, I think it is a privilege to have the possibility of working at so many different levels and with so many different cultural contexts. It is also a continuous process of learning.
Your work is very close to the abstract universe. How do you feel if the public does not understand what they want to convey, or even with negative criticism?
Of course I am not happy, but this is part of the work. You know, there are always different opinions, and that's how things are.
But do you understand that your work can focus on the abstract level, or am I doing a wrong analysis?
There are in fact certain elements in my visual language that present themselves with a kind of abstract tradition. But there are also many elements with connection to things we know, such as the brain or the globe. My work also communicates at different levels, but there are also more direct things, such as the facilities I do most directed to children, for example. Then the children react strongly. This means that information goes quite directly, because it is not something that can be said or explain to them, because children do not exactly have knowledge of art history.
What are the great influences on your art? Have these influences change over time?
An important aspect is what you can do with technology. I started working with computers in 1984, where there were graphic programs with a specific visual language. But there were very few devices to transfer the elements to other materials, such as screens or wallpapers. Therefore, they were fully analog transfer and production processes, at the level of photography or screen printing, for example. Throughout all these years technology has developed quickly and today any type of element transfer or production is digital, such as projecting computer animations, printing things for facades… It was important to observe all these technical possibilities and understand how I can use them and include in my visual language.</description><pubDate>2025-04-09 02:36:27</pubDate></item><item><title>Maintained imprisonment for an alcoholized man who assaulted ex-girlfriend</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/09/mantida-prisao-efectiva-para-homem-alcoolizado-que-agrediu-ex-namorada/</link><description>The last court (TUI) has decided to maintain a three-year and three-month imprisonment for legal cumulation, as well as driving inhibition for a year and six months to a man who assaulted his ex-girlfriend in his car when he was under the influence of alcohol, and was also driving when he was drunk. TUI also maintained the decision to pay compensation of 1,867 million Patacas, and the insurer should support 288 thousand patacas.
The case was passed on September 13, 2020, around 9:34 pm, when the man led to Macao Commercial Avenue, having parked at the door of the Fit Center Macau building, waiting for his ex-girlfriend to return home. Around 11:30 pm, the woman, when driving the car, saw that her ex-boyfriend was waiting for her and parked in the opposite ride.
The woman had been the victim of assault on the part of the man during the relationship, so she stopped the car and called a friend to ask for help. It was at this moment that the attacker got out of the car, approached the ex-girlfriend's car and hit him after doing a march reversal, "causing him to block the right front door, which could not be opened."
Then the man “left his vehicle and, with the key in hand, crashed violently in the glass window next to the driver of the vehicle” of the former partner, then retreated the car and beaten in the woman's car. That's when she got into her car and assaulted her, namely pressing her body, hitting her face with the key, and punched her and body punches.
Tui's judgment describes that the man "suddenly bit his left forearm and fingers of his left-handed hand, then moving to the rear seat, where he pulled his hair to prevent his escape, causing his hair loss." Some people who passed the scene helped the woman escape and immobilize the man.
Posttraumatic stress
At the time of the incident and aggression the man had a blood alcohol rate of 1.33 grams per liter, above the legal limit. Regarding the woman, she was subject to hospital treatment. "After the expert examination, it was found that it had suffered bruises and abrasions on the scalp, various bruises and abrasions on the face, cerebral concussion, right eye bruise, traumatic cataracts in the right eye, hemorrhage in the lower right eyelid, concussion in the right eye, severe hearing impairment in the right ear," the judgment describes.
In addition, aggressions have caused "the reduction of vision and asymmetry between the right and the left eye, obviously affecting its appearance and, at the same time, caused it to suffer from posttraumatic stress syndrome, which could need long-term treatment." It is also understood that the man "caused serious damage to the vehicle and damaged the Berma da Estrada Stone Floor."</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Tariffs | Suppliers resort to alternative markets</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/09/tarifas-fornecedores-recorrem-a-mercados-alternativos/</link><description>Macao has established trade agreements with Canada, Australia, Japan, and European and Southeast Asian countries that allow to minimize the effect of tariffs imposed by the White House, which came into force yesterday. The President Association of the Union of Suppliers of Macao states that from the end of May the effects will be unpredictable
 
The additional rate of Chinese products came yesterday, raising to 104 percent the total rate, implemented by the administration of Donald Trump, and to which Beijing also responded by raising the parade in the trade war that the White House declared to a vast range of countries and regions.
For now, in the short term, the president of the Macao Suppliers Association, IP Sio Man, considers that the tariffs imposed by the United States Government (USA) will not have an impact on the supply of products and prices practiced in Macao.
Speaking to the newspaper or Mun, the associative leader said that in recent years, Macau has signed commercial protocols with several countries that guarantee the diversification of imported products sources, which have resulted in the replacement of many US imported products. IP Sio Man reveals that, for example, part of the US -faced meat has been replaced by beef from Canada, Australia and New Zealand, as well as supplied by Japan and European countries.
Regarding fruits, the representative points out that the large majority is bought from suppliers from the interior of China.
For now, the containers who were loaded before April 5 and those already on the route to Hong Kong were only subject to a rate of 10 percent. However, IP Sio Man confessed to being difficult to predict what will happen to commercial connections with the US and prices when the load ships already arrive with charged products, something that should happen at the end of next month.
Route problems
The president of the Suppliers Association has an optimistic view of the commercial landscape, arguing that the countries and neighboring regions, especially from Southeast Asia, can look for low -tax markets such as Hong Kong and Macau to export their products and that this competition can lead to pricing down.
In addition to Trump's fares, IP Sio Man stressed the instability that has severely cut off maritime transport in the Red Sea, due to Israel and US offensive in Yemen and the attacks of the Huti rebels, which have attacked load ships. This situation affected the trade of goods from Portugal, with the sale of products such as olive oil, which took two months, twice the time, to circumvent the conflict zone. The main impact was felt at the level of fresh short products, such as cheeses, dairy products and premium meats, which became more expensive.
HM spoke to a Portuguese businessman who imports Portuguese products and who, due to delays in maritime transport, began to choose the airway. Despite the increase in transportation costs, Stock management forced looking for alternatives to the sea route, which takes three months to turn on Portugal to Macau.</description><pubDate>2025-04-09 23:34:16</pubDate></item><item><title>SPU | Open registration of residents for emergency simulacrum</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/09/spu-abertas-inscricoes-de-residentes-para-simulacro-de-emergencia/</link><description>Unit Police Services (SPU) receive, by the 22nd of this month, registrations for the simulacrum “Crystal Fish 2025”, which aims to “reinforce joint action for emergency response and raise awareness of the prevention of general public disasters”.

Dependent companies or with great revenues generated by the satellite casinos recognize that they are very concerned about the prospects of a closing wave at the end of the year. The position of several entrepreneurs was taken in statements to the newspaper or Mun.
Satellite casinos result from agreements between some independent dealers and companies, which explore various game spaces, as with Kam Pek or Bridge 16 casinos, a total of 11 casinos. In this model, the independent companies exploit casinos, but with workers, game tables and chips of the dealers, with whom they have an agreement and who make payments.
The last review of the game law established a period of three years to end this model, which ends later this year. As a result, dealers may choose to assume, by themselves, the exploration of these casinos or close the spaces.
Speaking to the newspaper or Mun, a resident with the nickname Lam, who is responsible for a software company, said half of the company's revenues derive from one of the satellite casinos. Without these revenues, the leader admits that the company will start losing money and that in this scenario there are only two hypotheses: paying the losses with money from their pocket, until the situation becomes unsustainable, or doing what nicknamed “cutting an arm”, the dismissal of about 30 to 40 percent of workers.
Lam also said that satellite casinos distribute a lot of money to small and medium enterprises by hiring services. However, if only the dealership survives, the local economy will feel an impact it has classified as deep.
Another businessman, with the nickname Sin, responsible for a cleaning company, traveled a similar scenario, and acknowledged that with the closure of the satellite casinos will say goodbye to the total of the total staff, which indicated to represent about 100 workers, due to lack of work.
Less transportation
The need to move forward with the dismissal of workers is also the scenario before Choi, according to the newspaper or Mun. The entrepreneur of a private personnel transport company said that it currently survives in the local market due to services rendered to the satellite casinos.
Choi acknowledged that 80 percent of the recipes come from these spaces and that in case of closing this volume of business will not be replaced. The businessman indicated that although Macau receives more tourists these have a very different profile. Among the differences, he pointed out that they are younger and do not move through this type of transport, first resorting to public transport.
The newspaper or Mun also spoke to another IP businessman, responsible for an advertising lighting product company. It employs between 20 and 30 workers and most services are provided to the satellite casinos. If they end, IP indicates that not only will your company close, as well as several other stores in the vicinity of casinos and depend on them.</description><pubDate>2025-04-09 23:27:36</pubDate></item><item><title>Fires | Minus 15 percent occurrences</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/09/incendios-menos-15-por-cento-de-ocorrencias/</link><description>In the first three months of the year there was a general decrease in the occurrences that implied the intervention of the Fire Department. Still, the authorities were called to intervene in 13,207 cases
 
In the first three months of the year the number of fires recorded by the Fire Department (CB) presented a 15.35 percent reduction with 215 occurrences compared to the same period. The first quarter figures of the year were presented yesterday at a press conference.
According to official data, between January and March this year there were fewer fires compared to the same period, when the number of fires had been 254 occurrences. Among the 215 fires, 155 were extinguished without resorting to the use of hoses. Last year, the number of fire extinguished without the need to turn on the hoses had been 204.
Regarding the fires of the first months of this year, 35 fireworks were due to situations of burnt food. Last year, this type of occurrences had contributed to 61 cases.
Among the other causes of fire occurrences are the oblivion of linked stoves, flames that are not fully extinguished, burning incense, candles and votive papers, short circuits in electrical installations and mechanical failures.
Despite the reduction of fires, in the first half were several occurrences in residential buildings that caused at least five injured. The numbers show that the general general of occurrences in which the Fire Department had to intervene presented a 6.32 percent reduction from 14,098 cases to 13,207 cases.
Less ambulances
Regarding data on ambulance exits there was a reduction in cases of 3.1 percent to 11,406 occurrences, which required the use of 12,221 vehicles, a reduction of 3.43 percent. In the same period, 11,774 occurrences were registered that required the departure of 12,655 emergency vehicles. About this difference, the Fire Department indicated that it was due to "mainly reducing cases of mild fever indisposition and breathing difficulties." "The general cases of relief dealt essentially with dizziness, abdominal pain, breathing difficulties, vomiting, fevers and various types of injuries," he was added.
Also in rescue operations there was a reduction of 3.3 percent, from 454 cases to 439 cases.
Finally, with regard to special services, a reduction of 29.01 percent, from 1,616 cases to 1,144 cases, a difference of 29.21 percent was found.</description><pubDate>2025-04-09 02:33:01</pubDate></item><item><title>AMCM | Securities Deposit and Settlement Center loses 7.18 million</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/09/amcm-central-de-deposito-e-liquidacao-de-valores-mobiliarios-perde-718-milhoes/</link><description>The Macao Securities Deposit and Settlement Center, controlled 100 percent by MSAR, continues to record successive losses. Since 2022, the company created to diversify the economy of Macau has never presented profits
 
Macao's central deposit and settlement company (MCSD) registered losses of 7.18 million patacas last year. This is the second consecutive year with loss of the company controlled 100 percent by the Monetary Authority of Macau (AMCM), which had presented losses of 6.7 million patacas in the previous year.
Created in 2021, MCSD emerged within the policy of the Ho IAT SENG government to diversify the economy in the field of finance and has as its functions the exploitation of financial infrastructure, central registration services, compensation, settlement and deposit of securities. Within these functions, MCSD has been supporting the obligation to be borrowed.
However, the company's numbers insist on continuing to have damage. In the first full year of operations in 2022, the company that has a corporate capital of 50 million Patacas, had losses of 3.9 million patacas. The following year, the damage rose to 6.7 million patacas and the latest data show a new negative record of 7.18 million patacas.
More revenues and expenses
Despite the negative scenario, revenues originated by contracts with participants in the financial market of Macau even registered an increase. Currently, on the MCSD portal, about 90 entities appear as “participants”. In 2024, revenues derived from participation contracts rose to 2.9 million patacas, when the previous year had been about 966,000 patacas.
In terms of the remaining revenues of last year, a 1 million patacas was calculated in interest, with the other services generated 11,300 patacas and the shift gains generating 721 patacas.
In terms of expenses there was also an increase to 11.2 million patacas by 2024, compared to 9.2 million patacas of 2023.
The highest cost was for the remuneration of workers from 3.1 million patacas to 4.6 million patacas. For this increase contributed the recruitment of five employees, totaling 13 workers at the end of 2024. The other major expense was due to pay the telecommunications post services that was 3.2 million patacas, below the cost of 3.3 million from the previous year.</description><pubDate>2025-04-09 02:31:16</pubDate></item><item><title>Commerce | Suppliers ask for autonomy to American products</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/09/comercio-fornecedores-pedem-autonomia-face-a-produtos-americanos/</link><description>To avoid the impact of US tariffs, the Macao suppliers' union association advocates greater gradual autonomy from imported products in America. The idea came from the association's president, IP Sio Man, according to the Chinese channel of Radio Macau.
According to IP, US dependence is negative because tariff policies are unpredictable and are constantly changing. The official indicated that last year, the value of products Macau exported to the US was 300 million patacas, while the value of imported products from the US was 70 billion patacas. On the other hand, IP Sio Man anticipated that the Macao government is unable to follow the interior in adopting retaliation policies against the US, so it should follow an alternative path.
But even though Macau follows the background policy, IP has devalued the case, considering that it will not have great impact, because in recent years, Macau has actively explored new markets and can import products from other regions to replace those of the US.</description><pubDate>2025-04-09 02:29:45</pubDate></item><item><title>Zelensky vs Zelensky</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/31/zelensky-vs-zelensky/</link><description>10/27/22
A renovated Ukrainian, with the same name of the president, guilty Zelensky about the extension of the conflict that destroyed his village. Zelensky, the village, who has never left his land, now lives mortified because his favorite gravedigger died in the bomber.
This Zelensky, the village, represents half the world that reproves the other Zelensky, the villain, for not wanting to negotiate with Putin.
Negotiate what? The invader enters us through the house, pies us the wife and daughter (cf. recent UN report on Ukraine violations in this “special operation”), an act that forced us to watch, and then we say: Alto there, we are for peace, but we have to negotiate: You have not said the name you want to give to children!
A peace that is not worthy is but a cessation of rights. As severe as Russophobia that Putin inflicts his people.

In a lunch with several guests I hear a friend, who declares himself a spiritist, explaining about the particularities of his belief, in a serene and balanced way, would even say, without "irrationalism". He discussed long and serenely, devoid of any fanatical proselytizing. “Here is someone to whom belief brought weighting!” I thought, a rare alliance.
However, at one point a phrase that horrify me. He says, “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!” And I enter the voracious fauces of holism. Because holismo has a pathological aspect like all good things, a side of shadow.
Two examples: In Hinduism there is less sensitivity to existential dramas, if that child suffers in this life this is only an expression of the strict karmic symmetry, an effect of the acts she committed in her previous life. In Africa it is not accepted that death may have been accidental, and many women are accused by the dead family of having caused her husband's death, in an act of manifest dementia, and, in the blatant majority of cases, in a huge injustice to his wife - madness that spreads and infiltrates the social fabric.
Buddhism has introduced compassion and Christianity to Caritas, trying to break with this logic, but in many other beliefs and religions the cage of causalities prevails over sensitivity to experience, the need to respond to the now.
It is a tremendous logic that transforms the world into a platonic stage, where we are just the shadows of something -an inextricable law -in a determinism that calcines all singularities, but strangely fascinates many.
The conquest of modernity has anchored in the conquest of chance and random, subtracting the incidences of a life to this fierce determinism that closed the world in a web. When the Renaissance freed the body from the influence of the stars, at this moment sexuality was relieved of guilt and individualism and their volition could emerge.
There is an unequivocal moral implication in the phrase “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!”, Which should work as a key to self-knowledge and self-judgment, but usually this phrase is managed to seek a reason for things abroad from us in the other. It is an alibi.
There is a holistic temptation in the world today, as in the Middle Ages there was a satanic temptation, without great reflection on its consequences. Because it is not enough we want to connect everything in a resonant chain of affection. Even the most unexpected: affection itself can kill.
I realize, thanks to this cultured, balanced, intelligent woman, that “the combat” moved at the beginning of this century. One of the great misconceptions of the twentieth century was the false dichotomy between "rationalism and irrationalism", a debate that extended to all fields, including art. First, rationality was confused (the positive side of reason) with rationalism (the pathological feature of reason), and articulated in this lack of discernment was confused irrationalism with freedom. Almost all the art of the twentieth century, with surrealism to the head, worked in this error. The fallacy still exists despite having consolidated the emergence of 'irrationalism' and the consequent relativist currents that followed it. Essentially much of what happened in the twentieth century, it turned around this shock between two paradigms: rationalism versus irrationalism.
Now, I see, the indetermination, chance, the random of the terrible temptation of the causal cage. Holism, in its pathological feature, can be the reductionism that is the way it puts the way as a new 'eschatological narrative'.
Is it "by chance" that the holism emerges at the moment when neo-liberalism and its cynical contempt for the human person besides all freedoms, all acquired rights?
Holistic consciousness has brought positively a greater ecological awareness but followed by scholastic rigor drifting reality under the blanket of a determinism that is much more than inconvenience: all great authoritarian ideologies are holistic.
My friend will know how to combine her holistic and transpersonal belief with the freedom and responsibility that every moment asks us - but how many will make the destruction, under a law that explains and encompasses everything?
How many will not be abandoned to what it is?
The awareness of the indeterminate brings tragic conscience, as the Greeks knew, but also brings the will and the courage of the decision. And of this we cannot abdicate.
In addition, as Drummond shows in Carlos Drummond de Andrade's poem “Quadrilha”:
"John loved Teresa who loved Raimundo/ who loved Maria who loved Joaquim who loved Lili/ who did not love anyone./ John went to the United States, Teresa to the convent,/ Raimundo died of disaster, Maria stayed to aunt,/ Joaquim suicide himself and Lili married J. Pinto Fernandes/ who had not entered the story."
Real always runs outside the track, in full exteriority to our concepts. This is what is worth a J. Pinto Fernandes at the exact moment we thought we had everything under control.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Nobel and others</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/17/do-nobel-e-outros/</link><description>9/10/22
Reading many people's reactions when the Nobel Prize in this year's literature was announced, I couldn't help but remind me of this repair of Jean-Pierre Siméon, in relation to another Nobel Prize: “An editor of a large national newspaper wrote five lines of indignation because the Nobel Prize for Literature, a complete stranger. But unknown to whom? How did not occur to this patented and paid literary columnist to do his work, that his apparent ignorance was a matter of incorrect professional conduct? Tranströmer was translated into many languages, it was available in French. »
There is always the choir of those who wait for the announcement of the prize to complain about not being invited to the jury of the prize, there is a subgroup of Irados that professes “never read and I will not bother to read”; It is an uncommon fauna, which inhabits social networks.
I don't always know all the winners-I was unaware of the existence of Louise Glück, who I find a great poet, or the Olga Tokarczuk, for example-but it only brings me the comfort of knowing that the world is not a soap opera where everyone knows each other and the joy of recognizing that the gauge of the world is not measured with my short measure and that on the contrary it gives me a new opportunity to face the unknown.
And perhaps the most cretin of reactions was the smart one who wrote, but there are still those who read French? Confirming only that today there is a new kind of ignorance that fires with a displeasure: the one who only read English.
I would also prefer that, in French, Pascal Quignard, Linda reads, or even Sollers, or, among the new ones, Mathias is awarded, but that does not take dignity to the work of Annie Ernaux (and it would be enough to have written the “Les Années”). There are books of her that I like less, like the vulgar "a simple passion," but this happens with almost every authors, they have a channel books and others that are like intervals in their itinerary. I advise reading a beautiful book of interviews with her, "L'Ecriture Comme un couteau".

Yesterday came an article in Maputo's morning “News”, realizing that the Pen Club narrative prize was assigned to my wife, Teresa Noronha, for her soap opera “Tornado”, which had already had the Maria Velho da Costa award.
The summary they made of the book does not even deserve comments, by pathetic, but what matters to highlight is the note of disqualification as to their "Mozambicanity" by calling it Luso-Mozambican. It is not inaccurate, but for those who know the context, it is a dirty touch.
Because finally, following the same logic, Adelino Timóteo should be called Tsonga-Mozambican, to Álvaro Taruma-Mozambican, and Macua-Mozambican to the writers who are from the north, etc., etc. Which is not reported to happen.
At the beyond moment, in the soap opera, she writes:
«Our color has never been dominant. In colonial time we were not white, we were ripped from monories, gone mugs, the pejorative term to speak of a son of Goes and Portuguese. In the postcolonial period, I was not black and if, in Lisbon, they took me by Brazilian or Cape Verdean, already in France were lost in cogitations of where they would be and amazed when they found out it was African. There I had to explain my DNA's wanderings before relying on moorms. It took me a long time to accept that it was so because yes, and that it was no curse that were so; On the contrary, I could even discover intense patterns of fantasy and freedom in this shrewd cloak that is our genealogy… »
In the current Mozambique it is white… and this is overlapping it soon to what it does or what it is.
It is sad, but as Naipaul warned, through these stops the race is everything and is soaked in it as deeply as, elsewhere, in religion.

Bruno Latour, an anthropologist who studied the sciences and their procedures and legitimations, law, technique and religions died and entertained themselves to turn the guts to the dogmas of the “modern”. For him the place, the expert's function, was more defined by the perplexity he embodied than for the supposed truth he would support him.
He proposed, as an alternative to the kinds of multiculturalism and his mistaken password "all different all the same", the return to "diplomacy", given precisely not from the presupposition that "we are unified because participants of the same nature" but simply that we "do not yet share an ordinary world"; It is necessary to deal frontally with the "abyss of disagreement" that separates us, rather than wanting to delude it.
And about politics said, disassessedly:
«If transparency is required from the politician, we kill him; If one requires fidelity to what the other was or he says, kills him; If a mimetic relationship is required between what the crowd wants and what its representative says, the representation is killed. These must, therefore, by definition, betray, deceive, modify, distort the word. Without this ability to double the word and betray, political language would not exist. I put the perfectly plausible hypothesis that political vocabulary will become as inaccessible as the religious language of the last twenty, three or fifty years. (in “UN Monde Pluriel plus Commun”). I believe it will be missed to decipher this frantically complex world that fit us.</description><pubDate>2022-10-17 02:18:03</pubDate></item><item><title>The yo -yo</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/30/o-fuxi/</link><description>O my friends, companions of these funerals trips to countries as old as the stars and the moon, and as strange as the profound interior of our disgraceful souls, - that startle still awaits us, what secret spells we will have to overcome, what horrors will rise to our dilated pupils of amazement and terror?
Increasingly close to our precarious existences, howling the war monster, which threatens to merge humanity with the earth, incessantly traveled by the squalid spectrum of hunger and the invisible evil of ten thousand pests.
O human human, who cries superior to his own nature, but then reveals to you, once and again, unable to simply order your existence and do not understand that you are possessed by the fickle wrath and are slave to your own ambition! Do not be content with the white jade or the light gold, there is no treasure that gives you your inextinguishable thirst for other men, animals and things; for in you an eternal anguish in you; in you crawl the expelled snakes; For you grows, powerful and impossible, the very fertile ivy of evil!
This is perhaps why on the mound they call the white deer, where one of the eight immortals in sacred mount was evolved through the skies to Penglai, inhabits the fuxa, a bird whose form resembles that of the rooster, although topped by a human head. What strange copulas, what monstrous amplexes, what terrible procedures will have occurred to make the existence of this animal sinister possible? We do not know, but it is enough for our exhausted mind to dare to raise an answer, so we soon feel the skin traveled by horrendous goose bumps and the heart trigger in paraded, which wild horse beaten by the night whip of fear, oblivious to reins and containment.
May men refrain from going through the Mount of the deer, because although there are riches capable of calming the most misunderstanding ambitions, if they have the disgraced fortunate to glimpse a fuxa, it will be immediately triggered the cultivated fields, because it will be beheaded the soft animals, for it will be sacrificed the best young man and destroyed superb from countries.
Fuxi emits a sound that resembles its name. If you hear it, dark night or clear day, goose way, for the path where you find you is the most right of the ways for misfortune!</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Procrastinators Club</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/29/clube-dos-procrastinadores/</link><description>Walking in rereading of Easter, because of an article I prepare, I give this excerpt, extracted from “the universal man”:
«Every man morally is one and absolute; But you have to live with your personality to mitigate. (…) Coexistence is only possible among people reduced to a negative or hollow presence, which is constantly giving in. Hence, the emptiness of society, a huge ghost composed of numerous deceased. An upper man is antisocial or criminal. Its destination is jail and desert.
He is in thinking about whether she reflects here about the political-social conditioning that gagging, and worse, in a sad country as Portugal was in the middle of the Estado Novo (and the book is from 1931) where any possibilities of spontaneity and frankness in human relations were coarcet, or only lends the behavior of men (oppressed) a metaphysical frame, a “essence”, from a presumption of each one in the presumption of each one be in isolation “one and absolute”. Sometimes, to an excess of spirituality (or longing), it adds to Pascoaes to lack the world. He is a great poet, but he is a poet who takes gray-Jewish ampoules and is therefore written amiiude on a programmatic furor, ceasing to have pores; There is often a glass between him and the real, the same one who made him wring the Ballet, 1921: “Everything is ghost. There are only clouds, clouds of voices, clouds of souls, afflictions and tragedies! Clouds and more clouds, appearances and more appearances! It is a divine lightning that pierces them, the instant appearance that arises and throws us to the ground, dazzled! »
Sometimes I would like to remind him, as Antonio Sérgio did in the article “Regeneration and Tradition, Moral and Economy”, which dedicated to Easter: “Easter, Easter my dear friend: You are a pure, excellent and noble poet, but also a victim of this social environment, like us all: this horrible isolation that you praise and I”.
"As a child, he stole two melos," says Jacinto do Prado Coelho, stole him from a nest, and throb his lifetime remorse for it. The person, few more mischief is known to him. Only in Álvaro de Campos sprouts a twinge of evil and obscenity: “Oh, and ordinary and dirty people who always seem the same,/ who employs profanity as usual words,/ whose children steal at the grocery door/ and whose daughters at eight years-and I think this is beautiful and I love him! -/ masturbate decent -looking men on the stairs. » (Ode triumphal).
Both poets beaten by a certain idea of ​​holiness, they were identical to the inability of breaking the siege of the skin with the overflow of the dike, the same curse of sublimating Eros's concrete ferocity with the mansuity of the verses.
Of course, they are the two "Bigger Than Life", but sometimes unnerves to watch, from my hostor's post at the Procrastinators Club, to the tantrums between them, just to see who occupies, in the internal organization, the place of president and treasurer.
Although a person has guessed more, for example, this he wrote in the least known martial ode and that is declining in the situation we live today, differently, with the heart in his hands:

G7+ is a forum in which member countries seek to influence global discourse on peace, stability and resilience, as well as define joint actions to achieve those objectives.
The Intergovernmental Organization was established on April 10, 2010, in Dili, and emerged with concern, shared by its Member States, that traditional development cooperation did not improve the situation of fragile nations.
"The purpose of this meeting, the sixth G7+ministerial meeting, is to reflect on the progress achieved during the 15th anniversary of its establishment," said G7+Secretary-General, Helder da Costa.
The meeting, which traditionally brings together the ministers of the finance, planning or economy of the Member States, will first join the heads of diplomacy in several countries because of “global politics”, to make a “reflection on the script for the coming years” and because G7+ has an “increasingly global voice”, said Helder da Costa.
The meeting, co-organized with the Timorese Foreign Ministry, begins exactly with an intervention by Timorese Prime Minister Xanana Gusmão about “safeguarding peace in turbulent times: the vision of G7+”.
The meeting will also make a presentation on the organization's path over the last 15 years and a debate on cooperation between the Member States. The G7+ has a Observer Statute to the UN General Assembly since December 2019 and in the community of Portuguese-speaking countries since July 2021.

"The ties between China and Spain maintain strategic stability and are based on the opening, cooperation and mutual benefit," said Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian yesterday at a press conference in Beijing, where the head of the Spanish government, Pedro Sánchez, has planned to start an official visit tomorrow.
The spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has described Spain as "an important European economy and a fundamental cooperation partner within the European Union."
The trip takes place in a period of climbing the trade war between China and the United States and after the Chinese Prime Minister, Li Qiang, spoke to the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen. The two leaders committed to defending free trade and reinforcing the role of the World Trade Organization (WTO).

XI, who did not mention the US President, urged his employees during a working meeting to improve relationships with neighboring countries “through proper management of differences”, with a view to “reinforcing ties in supply chains,” said the official news agency Xinhua.
China's relationships with neighboring countries are “at their best level in modern history” and at the same time Beijing is “in a crucial phase deeply interconnected with changes in regional dynamics and global developments,” he noted.
The Chinese leader argued that China's diplomacy with his neighbors will be based on the construction of a “shared community”, one of the most repeated phrases by Chinese Communist Party leaders (CCP) in which it is argued that prosperity is only sustainable if nations work together.
At the meeting, it was also stressed that China should reinforce its sense of responsibility and maintain a “neighboring, sincerity, mutual benefit and inclusion.
Difference management
It has also been underlined that China should "support countries in the region to maintain their own development pathways and correctly manage conflicts and differences."
"We must build a high -level interconnection network and reinforce cooperation in industrial and supply chains," added the Chinese leader, stressing the importance of "maintaining regional stability and cooperating in matters and law enforcement."
The Chinese leader has not made any reference to the United States and Beijing has been underlining so far that he will not give in to Trump's rates. Trump ordered on Tuesday the application of an additional 50 percent rate on Chinese products, raising total customs rates to 104 percent.
Beijing previously announced a 34 percent rate on US products, after Trump imposed a rate in the same percentage on Chinese products, and announced yesterday an increase of 50 percent at the imposed rate, now totaling an 84 percent tariff.
In the possible future negotiations between Beijing and Washington is also the future of Tiktok's application operations in the US, which Trump's government has demanded that it disconnect from its mother company, Chinese Bytedance, to be able to operate in US territory.
Plus 50 percent
China announced yesterday an additional 50 percent retaliation rate on imports from the United States to 84 percent, intensifying the trade war between the two largest economies in the world. The Chinese Ministry of Finance said the new rates apply beyond the 34 percent previously announced on US imports.

“The profit margin of the Chinese export sector is between 30 percent and 40 percent,” wrote Dan Wang, director for China of the reflection group ('Think Tank') Eurasia Group. "If the United States impose customs rates more than 35 percent, most of its profits will be eliminated. The fact that the rates are 70 percent or even 1000 percent makes no big difference, as it prevents China from negotiating directly with the United States," he argued.
Since his inauguration in January, Trump has applied an additional 20 percent overflow on Chinese products entering the United States. This surcharge should increase to 54 percent tomorrow.
In response, Beijing has announced that it will impose 34 percent rates on US products from Thursday. The president of the United States threatened on Monday to increase rates by another 50 percent if Beijing maintains his decision.
In the whole, the rates would go to about 115 percent, according to Su Yue, the main economist for China at Economist Intelligence Unit.
"In addition, all the conversations with China about the meetings they asked for us will be closed," Trump threatened.
Wang explained that although Chinese exporters are now facing the new reality of a permanent increase in export costs, this does not mean that exports will stop. On the contrary, it forces exporters to find new markets and reduce the shipping of goods directly to the US.
Alicia Garcia-Herrero, chief economist for the Asia Pacific region of the French investment bank Natixis, also minimized Trump's last threat.
"The US market is already closed to Chinese products, at least directly from China to the US, so [an additional 50 percent increase in tariffs] is not a [effective] threat," he said. The decision reflects the fact that the US was aiming at China more than any other country, which "already happened before China retaliated," he said.
Errors and blackmail
China threatened yesterday "to resolutely be contracted to safeguard its own rights and interests," in response to Trump's threat. In a statement, the Ministry of Commerce said the US imposition of the "so -called" reciprocal tariffs "to China is" completely unfounded and is a typical unilateral "bullying" practice.
"The countermeasures taken by China aim to safeguard their sovereignty, security and development interests and maintain the normal order of international trade. They are completely legitimate," read in the statement. "The US threat of increasing rates on China is a mistake on a mistake and once again exposes the blackmailer of the US. China will never accept it. If the US insists on this path, China will fight to the end," he said.</description><pubDate>2025-04-09 02:43:58</pubDate></item><item><title>Álvaro Barbosa, vice-rector of the University of São José: “Student visa is very limiting”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/07/alvaro-barbosa-vice-reitor-da-universidade-de-sao-jose-visto-de-estudante-e-muito-limitativo/</link><description>The University of São José continues the negotiation saga with the Chinese authorities to recruit students from the interior of China. Vice-rector Álvaro Barbosa expects, soon, the increase in master's students from 30 to 200. Regarding the internationalization of higher education, the official advocates changes in student visas to facilitate recruitment
 
Does the recruitment of students from the interior of China remain a matter pending to the University of Saint Joseph?
It is a process that is underway. We have had huge support from the Macao government in negotiations to obtain the quota for our university, and they have been tireless in the effort to try to resolve the issues raised by the central government. Many of the questions are legitimate and concern concerns that arise. We were granted a temporary quota of 30 students for masters ago over a probative period, which served to evaluate how we, as Western University, would host students from China. From China, there is this concern with the host of students in Macau. I think we have made a huge effort and the students who are there, included in this contingent, are quite satisfied.
Is this quota for masters just?
Yes. For a degree we do not have authorization yet. In this way, we are currently at the time we try to overcome this probative period in order to obtain a quota of about 200 students for masters. We are in the final phase of the evaluation process and everything has been doing well. We will have the possibility that, next academic year, expand this quota. That would be great, because for our university, to have a greater impact of our mission in Macao, it is essential to have access to students from mainland China. We cannot be a university in an integrated region in a country like China, and not contact with students from China.
Is it more difficult for USJ to compete with other universities, such as those of Hong Kong, by foreign students, outside China?
The issue of recruitment of international students has become a priority for Macao universities. In the last two or three years, it has become evident that this internationalization is very important. What difficulty is there? There is the issue related to student visas, as these visas currently do not allow students to do any kind of work, denying them that minimum local subsistence mechanism to be able to meet expenses. Nor is it contemplated the possibility of, when the student concludes his formation, to be in the territory and find work. What all countries and regions that are competitive in higher education do, such as Singapore, Hong Kong or Australia, is to have incentive policies. Allow students to work part -time, for example. In Hong Kong when a degree ends, the student can stay in the territory up to a maximum of two years to find a job. This kind of measures do not yet exist in Macau, but I think the government is pondering this possibility. From the moment the decision was made that the internationalization of higher education was important, this must be accompanied with the corresponding measures. The current student visa is extremely limiting and does not encourage the coming to Macao to study, only allows coming. This issue was not as present as it is now, but now there is a strategic policy of internationalization.
It is also a matter of survival for local universities.
Yes. Perhaps there is no greater example of a catalyst for the diversification of Macau's economy than higher education. We have ten institutions, 60,000 students in about 700,000 inhabitants. This is the potential of internationalization, to foster diversification.

And also the research that comes out of higher education.
The investigation, the dynamics of the work that is done. There are a number of vectors that higher education brings to a region or country, this happened to Portugal, for example, with the policy of doctoral scholarships for students from abroad, which completely changed the dynamics of higher education. Cape Verde developed thanks to the impact of higher education.
Then we need to make the system more flexible in Macau.
I don't know if it's a matter of having a holistic view of strategy. There may be an idea, but then it does not intervene in all the necessary dimensions to achieve a certain goal. But I am very optimistic. I believe this new student policy is a key step to be taken in Macau. The internationalization strategy followed by all these countries and regions I spoke, and were successful in capturing international students, was always the same. No need to invent much. First, one should increase the capacity and notoriety of universities, and then a policy of scholarships, which will enhance a student flow, creating a reference for the territory, so that studying there becomes a habit. After this flow of students for a few years, an image is already created and some scholarships can be removed, which students will continue to choose a particular territory to study in it. Australia has a huge higher education industry, for example, and I think that in Macau we just have to follow the same strategies. We do, at USJ, that a little.
How, in concrete terms?
We offer many scholarships, and in this sense the Diocese of Macao has helped us build this flow of international students that allow us to create this dynamic that we hope will be sustainable by itself in the future. I think the government is also doing this. There have always been scholarships in Macau, attributed mainly by the Macau Foundation, but this measure will be strengthened. Solving the student's visa issue, creating a scholarship incentive system for five to ten years, Macau will have a bright future as an international higher education destination. But we need to invest, continue, and it takes a few years.
USJ created the “Macau Hub” platform, in partnership with the Macau Scientific and Cultural Center (CCCM) in 2023. At what stage is this project?
This project has to do with our interest in developing a relationship dynamic of Lusophone countries centered in Lisbon in the area of ​​entrepreneurship, first. This cabinet we have at CCCM is not intended to offer training in Portugal, but we want to do something else. As we are positioned in the Great Bay and with Hengqin, where it is intended to activate a business ecosystem, we want to take advantage of the fact that we have relations with the Lusophone world to activate the access of the startups of Portugal, Brazil and Angola, above all, to the great bay and hengqin. We are trying to create a kind of incubator of transnational companies, in which we support the development of Lusophone businesses that want to settle in the large bay and also the reverse system. Strategically, for a university, it is absolutely fundamental to have a dynamic in the area of ​​entrepreneurship. Currently, more than half of our students do not want to go to the corporate world, but create their own businesses. Just as universities have to have employability solutions, they also have to have them for entrepreneurs, who are increasingly. So a university has to have a business incubator. My vision of the future for higher education goes around: a university, besides having a library and canteen, will also have its own business incubator. I would say that most students of management or economy courses dream of having their own business, especially in China. China is perhaps one of the most entrepreneurial countries in the world. The CCCM welcomes this initiative in Portugal, but we also work with the Portuguese Catholic University.
And concrete results, already have it?
We have a number of small initial projects that are starting now, and we also work with many business organizations. We have now negotiated a series of projects, and I think everything will develop very quickly, based on the manifestations of interest we have. We were in Angola in December and we have already aligned a series of initiatives, we also have projects with Brazil and Portugal.</description><pubDate>2025-04-07 22:56:36</pubDate></item><item><title>Adelina Moura, teacher and trainer: “The mobile phone is like a Swiss knife”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/07/adelina-moura-docente-e-formadora-o-telemovel-e-como-um-canivete-suico/</link><description>Graduated in the area of ​​educational technologies, Adelina Moura will conduct lectures to parents, students and teachers about the use of digital technologies in classrooms, within the “Letters &amp; Company” festival of the Portuguese Institute of the East. The teacher understands that prohibiting mobile phone in schools is not a solution
 
What are the challenges felt by teachers with the introduction of technologies in the classroom? Can the mobile phone actually be a complement to learning?
Yes. I've been saying this since 2005. The mobile phone can be an excellent learning tool, a means to motivate students and to enrich their learning. We have a kind of Swiss knife here, a very powerful equipment in the hands of the students and there is a school failure, because they do not work and help students enhance this equipment they have. What happens is that students learn in the worst way, in a destructed way, by attempt-rrove. There is a gap, as students are not alerted to the positive potential for mobile phone use. They face their mobile phones as a free time use, spending time on social networks and scrolling, and time consumes. It is essential that teachers are users, in their practices, mobile phones, and for the preparation of classes and other projects, to know how to prepare students. I consider that the school has lost several stages of students' preparation and awareness to use these equipment that lead to classes and with which schools have not spent any money. With the prohibition of bringing the mobile phone to the classroom we did not advance anything in this regard.
During the pandemic period, for example, the use of technologies, with distance learning, was quite enhanced.
But during the pandemic we also burned some steps regarding the use of digital by teachers, because before the pandemic many teachers did not believe or used. They thought it was a fashion and they saw no use in the use of mobile phones and other technologies. With the pandemic the use of these equipment proved that without them the situation of education would have been much worse. In these pandemic years, teachers have become more aware of the technologies that already exist and are available to anyone. With internet access on mobile phone, something that has existed since 2007 with the launch of the first iPhone, the e-learning system is enhanced and then we move to “Mobile Learning”, where you can learn anywhere and anytime with mobile devices. It is this reality that we see a little away from school.
And after the pandemic, how has it been?
I think we will take a few more steps towards digital literacy. With Artificial Intelligence (IA), it seems that we are as in the phase I created my first website in 1999 or email in 1995. We are at the beginning. But it is 30 years of technology where there have been many changes, and technology in fact goes on and if we immediately do not realize what we have available, we and students, we help create a moat that has happened in the past compared to digital. In the face of AI, if we do not look back and do not realize what was not done and should have been at school level, we are wasting time. Only a few years from now will people be alert to AI, and the gap is increasing. Hence it is very important to bet now, in this early stage, in the training of teachers, students and families.
Is there much ignorance of parents, removal from this reality?
We have parents who are from this century. That is, they were born with the existence of computers, internet, saw the appearance of the smartphone. But when they studied, the school did not talk about the potential of digital. So these former students came to society and did not bring this sensitivity to digital, to educate their children. We teachers, when we do digital training, are doing good to society because we are also preparing these young people for the future, because they will be parents and should be aware of educating their children. At school we do not only prepare for the job market, but for personal and family life. Hence teacher education is essential. The invitation I received from IPOR seems to me an excellent holistic view of everything, because the school includes several actors, connecting with society.
How should AI be introduced into the classroom?
We currently watch changes in search engines, in fact. We have search engines created from root to Age Age, for example. The best way to introduce AI into the classroom is to ask students and how they use it, and already resort to this tool. At the beginning of the academic year I always ask students to answer a questionnaire about their digital routines, and then I know more or less their practices. In 2023, when the chatgPT came out, I introduced AI in my classes, and realized that students were using this tool to deceive the teachers. Students have to realize that when using AI, they are falling into a certain trap because they are not learning. It is the law of the lowest effort, equal to the phase in which the internet emerged, when students selected, copied and sent to the teacher. We now have the problem that the answers are in Brazilian Portuguese, for example, and see as soon as I was used. We have, therefore, to dismantle this action in the heads and face them. I tell them that they are being intellectually dishonest and that they have not read the AI ​​response, for example. Since 2023, I feel that students, in the answers to this questionnaire I do, say they are afraid to use chatgpt because they are afraid of being caught by teachers. That is, it seems to have gained some conscience.
It will give these lectures in a different educational context in Asia, where the use of mobile phone can be earlier. How will you deal with these differences, or do you understand that the problems of using technology in the classroom are transversal?
It is a transverse question. Do we have to wonder if the use of a particular equipment and tool will make us wiser? It seems to me not, because we may have the equipment, but the use we make it varies a lot. I tell my students that they should be ashamed, because they have much easier access to content than in my time, when we truly had research and read in physical format. I tell them that with this technology they should all have a grade 20, and that they are wasting resources, being dishonest intellectually, because they sign works that are not theirs and do not read, even, they deliver. One of the works we have with students is to teach them how to make bibliographic references, refer to the sources. But I am an optimistic by nature, and I hope that in a decade, secondary education students who are fathers and mothers will be able to deal with these problems of social networks and increase fraud with their children. It is this “parents school” that the school can help create. We are in a moment with no return from digital, and forbidding is the most comfortable situation, but it is not the best to face reality. We have to use the right words to alert. We have in this time of alerts and consciences, encouraging the critical spirit of our students, which is little today.

Speaking to HM, the academic enhances the interconnection between tourism, economy and geography, and lists its possibilities, limitations and effects, including Macao
 
 
In this book it speaks of the concept of “spatial economy”, in connection with tourism and geography. How is this connection?
Economic geography combines the geographical context with economic processes, being studied the spatial distribution of economic activities. The economy of tourism is particularly sensitive to these geographical constraints, as they are the characteristics of each place that enhances the development of certain products or services. These characteristics widely exceed the physical aspects of the territory and also include culture, history, ways of life or even institutions and legal frameworks. The case of casino, something particularly important in Macao, is a good example of the importance of legal aspects to develop certain types of tourism. Economic geography has a wider scope than the spatial economy, more focused on strictly economic aspects. Being evident in tourism this relationship between economics and geography, this book establishes a double approach that systematizes the interdependence of these three aspects it refers. First explores how the concepts and theories of economic geography can apply to tourism. In the second half it makes the opposite route, discussing how the analysis of relevant problems of contemporary tourism justifies the use of economic geography. Examples are the degradation of local resources, environmental impacts, contribution to climate change, acceleration of gentrification processes or disturbance of community modes of life.
Can having an excessively -dependent economy of tourism constitute a problem or salvation?
The two things, and are both cases that economic geography can help to understand. The industrialization of economies is linked to the agglomeration processes of activities that reinforce each other when they reach a certain scale. This allows the massification of production and consumption, with reasonable costs. Contemporary industries, more associated with the integration of digital technologies and creative processes, are less clustered in specialized industrial development zones, but tend to focus on large cities and metropolitan areas. It also follows that rural areas, islands, or sites that have not followed industrialization processes, have more difficulty mobilizing investments, technologies or qualified people to innovate and develop new industries. In such cases, tourism often appears as the possible solution as it can be developed with incorporation of technology and relatively low knowledge. On the other hand, tourism consumption, not being essential to human life, is very sensitive to income fluctuations.
Can you give examples?
This was visible, for example, with the 2007/2009 international crisis. Tourism is also very vulnerable to safety problems or international epidemics, such as COVID-19 has demonstrated to the extreme. Economies too specialized in tourism are very vulnerable to external shocks and less resilient to crises. It is also visible that, being the tourist development often supported by intensive and weak labor services, the specialization in tourism can cause, in the long run, embarrassment in terms of population qualifications, the ability to innovate and integrate technology or to add value to the regional economy.
The book also speaks of “intelligent tourism” and “co-creation of experiences”, using the megados and IA. Is tourism definitely becoming more digital?
Social networks are fundamental instruments for new generations. However, they began to generalize the tools for planning or promotion of travel supported by artificial intelligence. The so-called “intelligent tourism” more generally designates the use of digital technologies to intensify information flows, consolidate the formation of networks and promote more informed and shared decision making, eventually contributing to the so-called “co-creation of experiences”. Tourism digitization has its origins in service distribution systems originally developed by airlines since the 1960s, but it would be the internet to accelerate and globalize digitization.
And social networks.
The emergence of social networks promoted the creation of a more interactive universe, potentially in real time and involving wide numbers of users and various types of supports. The generalization of the use of mobile phones permanently connected to the Internet, even on foreign travel, has further increased this potential for intensive and interactive use of data and information. This "co-creation", however, hides obvious imbalances of power.
Such as?
With regard to tourists, or consumer in general, it is usually the role of providing information, for example through social networks. This information is obtained, accumulated and marketed, sometimes without consent or even without knowledge, to eventually translate into the creation, adaptation or promotion of products and services. This process is particularly important in the case of tourism, because there is usually a long period between the decision to travel and the trip itself. This period of travel exploration and planning is used by tourist marketing companies to try to influence choices. This type of interaction also introduces a difference in the “spatiality” of the provision of tourist services, which are usually produced and consumed at the same time and in the same place, in a direct relationship between producer and consumer. The digitization of tourism anticipates most of these interactions and information flows and transfers them to large technological companies or marketing and distribution.
In a world where more and more travel, the routes are shorter and access to information is immense, how can countries and regions be competitive in the tourist offer?
Contemporary tourism lives in a highly competitive international environment. But just as there is a wide variety of destinations and offerings, there is also a wide range of preferences and consumption, what is called “hyper-personalization”, the result of such abundance of information and opportunity for interaction. The challenge that is placed on destinations is to identify the resources, products and services that can be adjusted to a particular group of consumers, to communicate effectively. This competitiveness greatly goes beyond the strict scope of tourist services because it also requires mobility and transportation services, varied infrastructure, safety, medical support, or easy communication. Anywhere you want to develop your tourist industry have to intervene about all these factors.
The book also addresses how “social processes” shape the development of tourism. In the case of China, for example, do you believe we are watching a change, which will have consequences for Macau?
It seems to me that Macau is in a highly privileged position to develop other forms of tourism. China is the largest issuing market in the world, the widespread rise of income in recent decades allows many million people to explore the opportunity to travel. Macao is a very close and distinct destination, with its historical and cultural particularities. For the Chinese population it was not easy to visit Macau and there is certainly a great interest.
How does the Great Bay project come in this?
The strategy that is being followed by integrating the Great Bay allows you to develop a cosmopolitan and diverse offer that can certainly attract Chinese tourists and other parts of the world. Moreover, these three areas have excellent hotel and tourism schools, which guarantee qualified personnel for tourism management and planning. The element of differentiation that Portuguese culture introduces in this context can certainly contribute to the success of the transition from a casinos focused on other forms that value culture and heritage more.
Is it possible to have sustainable tourism?
The problems and difficulties of tourism sustainability are more visible than in other sectors. This “spatiality” of tourism (where the consumer is obliged to move to the place of consumption) implies that the consequences of this consumption become more evident. These effects are less obvious when it comes to the unsustainability of industrial units or intensive forms of agriculture in relatively isolated areas. As mass reduction and investment reduction strategies also apply to tourism, the consequences of the environment or the quality of life of residents in destinations can be devastating. Sustainability implies a long -term perspective based on the idea that today's decisions do not imply future negative consequences. Sustainable practices depend on the control of the impacts that accumulate over time by individual and independent economic agents.
How can this control be done?
When a hotel or airline defines what ability to install on their services they may eventually estimate the impact that consumers will have on the local environment or economy. They will have more difficulties in anticipating that impacts will be generated in the next 10, 15 or 20 years to investment. And surely it will be impossible to measure how this impact accumulates the impacts caused by other service providers, now or in the future. In other words, although the idea of ​​sustainability is widespread accepted, economic agents do not have mechanisms or instruments in practice. Regulating the use of resources and territories by public entities with a more comprehensive and future perspective can contribute to the sustainability more effectively than the regulation associated with market dynamics, which in many cases has been revealed highly predatory. The Chinese economy is one of these examples and may eventually benefit from it.
And in the concrete case of Macau?
Macao has historically known problems: ultra-urbanized and polluted areas, with large energy consumption and waste production; Great concentration of tourists in a relatively small area of ​​great historical and cultural interest; Great dependence on the game, with the resulting imbalances in the appropriation of tourism benefits. The ongoing transition to new forms of tourism should better solve these problems and state regulation will certainly have better results than based on market dynamics.</description><pubDate>2025-04-02 23:28:16</pubDate></item><item><title>José Paulo Esperança, Associate Rector of the City of Macau University: “Languages ​​cannot be controlled”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/01/jose-paulo-esperanca-reitor-associado-da-universidade-cidade-de-macau-as-linguas-nao-podem-ser-controladas/</link><description>Co-author of the “New Atlas of the Portuguese Language”, with Luís Reto and Fernando Luís Machado, José Paulo Esperança reveals to HM that the work edited in 2016 and 2018 is being updated, especially due to the growing global value of the language. The Associate Rector and Professor of the City of Macao University suggests partnerships with Macau under the Editorial Project
 
Launched the “New Atlas of the Portuguese Language”, in co-authorship, about the global value of the language. Plan a new edition or update?
Undoubtedly. We are working in this regard, there was a recent conference in Macao and Professor Luís Reto, former Rector of ISCTE, presented some more current elements that were developed. He has worked on a very important issue, which is the role of Portuguese as a frank language, which was for a few centuries in Asia. The exchange between Dutch and the kingdom of Zion was made in Portuguese, because it was the common language used at that time, before English became the contemporary frank language. Therefore, there is a whole interesting story of Portuguese and the role it had in the first pinyins that existed, with the Chinese and the use of the [Roman] alphabet in Vietname. There are a number of elements that are not, therefore, very publicized, and the work of Atlas is the same, to disclose some economic dimensions of the language.
What are these dimensions?
One is the exchange of foreign trade and investment, which is very facilitated by the language. We also talk about migrations, tourism, students' exchange that is greatly influenced by linguistic proximity. Therefore, today we have a set of elements that are very interesting, and we hope to develop some more important partnerships with Macau.
As?
More at work, Professor Luís Reto is doing, which maintains an investigation team about the value of Portuguese. He has collaborated with the Portuguese Language Museum of São Paulo, for example. It is a museum space that was renewed after the fire that destroyed it. In addition, there is a project with Cascais City Council to develop such a structure, and we hope to do some works with Macau, in order to create three poles for the projection of the Portuguese language. As for Atlas' materials, we would like to have a continued update model, as this data is out of date very quickly. The work was edited in many languages, including Mandarin. This is the moment when we would like to give the book a more historical and deep dimension, with more knowledge about the teaching of Portuguese in the world.
What balance does this teaching do today?
Portuguese is developing a great deal of mother tongue and is effectively one of the most expanding languages ​​due to demographic growth in Africa, with countries such as Angola and Mozambique, which around 2050 will have populations of over 100 million inhabitants, each. The Portuguese thus consolidates itself as a language of the southern hemisphere, but much more from Africa, supplanting Brazil itself as the place of largest number of speakers of the language. All of this generates enormous potential, and this also occurs due to the great exchange of universities and internationalization of teaching. Today there is the possibility of Portuguese being a language of science, there is more publications in this language. This is a great challenge because English is the contemporary language of scientists. We want to contribute to all these dimensions, and Macau can also play an important role there. Macao is indeed a platform between China and Portuguese -speaking countries, and can play a significant role.
Is Macao an ideal place to train Portuguese teachers who do not have Portuguese as a mother tongue? Do you fear that the territory loses relevance in this matter before the offer of courses in the interior of China?
I see this question more as complementarity than competition. We have identified about 60 higher education institutions in China that have Portuguese courses, but I think Macau has very interesting conditions to start teaching from primary to secondary education so that children have been able to have learning from an early age. It does not mean that there are no young Chinese who began to learn their tongue in adolescence that they speak fantastically, which surprises me, but it is easier to start earlier and earlier. This will be easier in Macau. What is important is to create conditions for greater economic collaboration to many levels, such as joint research. In this respect, Macau has a very interesting opportunity. At the City of Macau University we are very interested in increasingly collaborating with researchers who visit us and work with our teams.
Can you give me examples?
Brazil is today one of China's great business partners. There is a lot of exchange in both directions, but one of the themes that is little studied, and in which I work hard, is the internationalization of Chinese companies. To what extent do these companies follow a model of internationalization similar to that of other countries that started this process earlier? I speak of the United States of America, the European countries, but also of Japan and others. China has, in fact, different models of presence in countries that are not yet well known, and this is important to realize, so that we know how to facilitate this process of exchange in a world that lives periods of some setback. It is very sad. I always remember a great economist of Portuguese origin, David Ricardo, who clearly explained how world trade is beneficial to everyone and how countries can take advantage of this situation. Therefore, applying tariffs, making such commercial barriers harms countries that are major exporters, such as China or Germany, and countries that today have a cultural export capacity, for example, and are not just importers.
In relation to the new Orthographic Agreement. It continues without a standardization in Macau. Does it worry it?
Languages ​​are dynamic and cannot be controlled. We think today in English, and we realize that there are almost incomprehensible ways to each other, such as the English one in Nigeria or Australia. Americans have difficulty realizing the Australians. In the nineteenth century, Portuguese from Portugal and Brazil were closer, then some disagreement emerged. There was an effort in Brazil to propose an orthographic agreement, and the Portuguese joined, resulting in a series of negotiations. There have always been resistances. I remember that Fernando Pessoa suggested the famous phrase “My homeland is the Portuguese language”. It was curiously a manifestation of some conservatism, because he thought Pharmacy had to continue writing with pH [Pharmacia]. In fact it did not make much sense. Portugal ended up seeking to impose a certain standardization based on the most genetic changes in the spelling agreement. It is not a process that has been running a hundred percent well, and has been universally adopted. African countries have become more defenders of Portuguese from Portugal. There is sometimes some confusion, but I understand that intercomprehension still remains, achieving a homogeneous language, more perhaps than English.

He is a man with a provocative speech, a corrosive, kind mood and a smile that leaves no one indifferent
Gitelles, we live in an intercultural land and the Gypsies - in particular - have lived about five centuries in Portugal. What is going on for Gypsy communities to remain “on the fringes” of the so -called society? 
The model of society remains to be changed. This is extremely stratified by placing people in subordinate places to privilege a violent minority. The white social structure is patriarchal and racist. What is called the "margin" of society is actually an intrinsic place to it, which belongs to it. In other words, Gypsy people have been included in this model of society since they discovered Europe and its kingdoms. The problem is the model of society that is maintained and the place to which they were relegated and how they were relegated: with violence, in inferior status against whites, without the right to human dignity, to constitute a family, to choose one's own language and religion, expropriated from any and all cultural and material law. A place built and maintained to this day by violence and genocidal and ethnicidal persecution. In 1463, a Gitano Vasco was drowned to an estate. In 1521, Gitans, or Gypsies, were already used as a reference for all that is considered bad in the model of society. The "counter-exemple" in the face of the white that would stand out for the positive. The 'angel' and the 'devil'; the 'other', the enemy; That against whom any attack and persecution is legitimate. Including the prohibition of defending, having weapons, any kind of goods, and the right of permanence.
And is this right to permanence that we still have nomadic gypsy communities within the country is denied?
Yes, no doubt. There are many ways to force nomadism: directly, prohibiting permanence and expelling with police or military force; indirectly, refusing public or private housing to Gypsy people, as they are Gypsy; and even through the gentrification process.
I read the result of an inquiry from the European Union Fundamental Rights Agency, which is said to be approximately 80% of the Gypsies responded to the risk threshold of poverty in their country; One in three Gypsies lives in a housing without channeled water; One in three Gypsies belongs to a family where someone hungry at least once the previous month; and 50% of Gypsies aged 6 to 24 do not attend school. Why does this happen like this? 
It is the historical persecution, which continues. There is no impoverishment that has no external cause. In this case, a political system of total expropriation and imposed on the basis of violence. Already in 1648, D John IV, the restorer, prohibited ‘Giving or Rent houses to Gypsies’. The same D John IV who got the kingdom of Portugal thanks to D. Jerónimo da Costa and his 250 knights. The same D. Jerónimo da Costa who had died to defend Portugal's independence from Castile. Gypsy, like his wife and children. Between prohibitions of permanence, “that do not enter Gypsies in the Kingdom and leave those who are” (D John III, 1526), ​​with expulsions, degred to the galleys, expropriation of goods and properties, imposed with stripping, mutilation and death, systematically performed to this day (still in 2011 Faro City Council wanted to ban Gypsies in the municipality).
The prohibition of working on others (no one employs Gypsy workers, and those who accept they do it in total precariousness, for poorly paid positions and without decent rights and conditions). They cannot be dependent on their own work, they cannot get investment means due to extreme expropriation. Are dependent on precariousness. If you want to know what it is like to live in pure neoliberalism, know the lives of Gypsies. Their reality is paradigmatic of the aggression and depletion to which the "gentlemen" are willing to go to their benefit.
Are you talking about economic and political power?
The group of political, social, cultural and economic power. The owner, the colonizer. This group that has been in power since it established the system of current domination. And that only makes sense within the hierarchically stratified sociopolitical model in which we live. Hence the need to end 'gentlemen' and institute a new model of society, healthy, free, without hierarchies or strata, whether of race, class or gender.
The model we live in leads to the Gypsy (and not only) community to economic exclusion, removing it from access to product consumption or excluding them from its production process; political exclusion associated with lack of access to information; To education and consequently the social exclusion that is seen in inequality of access to quality community areas such as restaurants, libraries, theater, cinema, concerts, health care, etc. How do you feel a gypsy child when you realize that it is not part of a whole? Children who are never represented, neither in movies, nor in books, nor in cartoons, not even in an announcement to eat cereals, for example? Is this a disaster for self-esteem, is a priori condemnation?
The question is that. Gypsy people are not “excluded from society”, by contrast, they are included in it. The problem is the existence of what is cynically called 'social exclusion', which term Orwellian, and there be under coercion, people. Which field of concentration and extermination. Incidentally, Nazi concentration camps are a more visual realization than called 'social exclusion' and, as here, were not a 'excluded' part of Nazi society, but rather its fundamental and characterizing structure. It is a place of violence, where people are maintained by violence, dedicated to their extermination, and designed so that few people can leave. And yet they resist. As in Nazi concentration camps.
And what you have listed as an example of 'consequence' of this 'exclusion', is actually the means by which this exclusion also happens and remains. Gypsy people are out of theaters, both as consumers and producers (but go to the cinema). They are out of school, education and the gym. Either as 'users' or as producers (but go to school and are on the basis of knowledge construction and academic and scientific debates).
Even in attacking Gypsy children's self -confidence, we talk about a maintenance mechanism of this situation. But Gypsy people respond very well: with Gypsy pride. Another resistance, another aggression. Gypsy people are thus included in society. In a place that belongs to this model of modern society. And they resist and contradict the power of domination and make a point of being in the city, in the cinema, in the theater, in the gym, in all spaces. With a lot of struggle and always resisting, but they are there. Social exclusion, more than a “place outside of society”, is part of its social structure.
Do you want to say that there is a collective resistance?
At work, already in a context of absolute precariousness, during the pandemic, Gypsy people rolled up sleeves and showed once again proactivity and creativity in adversity. They learned seeing and doing. And here, it is again the women who jump to the front line, face, learn to use digital tools with their daughters or children, and throw themselves into the network. And so they explore online sales as well as application by application (transportation or rehabs). In housing, in a context of pandemic in which the evictions were not locked - as they owed and dictated the law itself - residents did not fail to organize and fight unjust evictions and claim dignity in housing; associations of allied residents in their action with other housing and anti-racist struggle organizations.
It should also be noted how they reinvented and intensified to raise and distribute dietary goods and kits of masks/alcohol gel to the most expropriated people. Gypsies and non -Gypsies. In the anti-racist struggle, new movements emerged and their actions intensified by social networks. People who had never been organized or militated before began their first steps in activism, thickening this way of the organization and popular gypsy and anti-racist action. People forget, or do not want to value, but Gypsy action has helped determine results in the political dispute. Gypsy citizens mobilized in large and determined electoral results in the municipalities of 2017, both in Alentejo and in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area, even causing electoral earthquakes.
And even in the presidential, second place was resolved by a value equivalent to the estimated number of Gypsy voters. Apart from the non -Gypsy votes that were mobilized by the action of Gypsy voters. Gypsy people are even co-considering power in the spaces of opinion, local media, social networks and party and institutional political dispute. And most importantly, in the popular Ação and alliances with other social movements. We have never stopped fighting for all means and continuing to resist.
In contrast there are more and more hate speeches, from the far right in particular. What do you have to say about it?
To start these speeches are historical and European. Not even current and even less “of the far right”. These speeches have been adopted and rendered for a long time, even in 'democracy and freedom', by several representatives of the center right, conservatives, left center, liberal, liberal left, even representatives of the PCP. Anti-egana rhetoric has always worked in Portugal as it is the whiter rhetoric [white genesis]. That is, it allows you to create and give the "white" as the superior of all. And so please the white electorate who, when feeling well, pays off with his vote. Even if the policies implemented by their elected harm him even more.
Finally, did you like them to talk a little about your personal experience and how did you get to the activist?
I studied, fought for studies, made alliances, graduated, went in the labor market of the “formal precariousness”. I started my militant action and here I am today. We can transform this society a better. This certainty combined with the fact that the current one has so much suffering makes anyone want to have a transformist attitude. I wanted to be 'inventor' (physical engineer) and anti -racist militant. And through study (not necessarily schooling) and organization with others, in turn, with other studies, formations and visions, I learned how the world works and how it can be changed. But before transforming, we need to survive.
Hence two types of actions arise: transformative and survival. The struggle against hate discourse arises as survival, but his defeat will be a transformative victory. There is a lot that - like people who want a better world - we have to do, namely working to criminalize hatred speech; condemn and prohibit organizations with racist discourses and practices; denounce the racist institutional structure and logics that organize power and generate community resources. And in this sense, there have been various types of actions, of petitions, to manifestations. And we need more.
I, besides being a military man in the SOS Racism movement, participate in the “We came to stay” podcast, with Mamadou BA and Joseph da Silva. And if all goes well, we will soon start a new project. With friendly people, we also have the project “Gypsy Initiative”, dedicated to reflecting and promoting transformative movements. Essentially focused on educating against anti-agigarism, denouncing historical and continued genocide and working for a new society project. Also with new projects on the gutter. And finally, there are always voluntary actions without an organization, where I try to share what I found out about anti-egism and Roman history in schools and with interested people. In addition, there is still the struggle for housing, because the evictions did not stop during the pandemic. Due to housing and work precariousness, the subjects racialized especially the Roma nationals are the most vulnerable to COVID-19. There is essential to have actions in this area; Of all the struggles, this is the most structural, as it goes against one of the main enemies of a healthy society: the real estate speculation of this capitalist system, which places profit and goods above people and their humanization.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>FIRST RALENT PROOF FOR THE MACAU GP took place in Shanghai</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/25/primeira-prova-de-apuramento-para-o-gp-macau-decorreu-em-xangai/</link><description>The first determination test for the 72nd edition of the Macau Grand Prix took place last weekend at the International Shanghai Circuit. Integrated in the Formula 1 China Grand Prix Program, Chen Weian and Lichao Han won the two races that will serve to select competitors entitled to participate this year in the GT - Great Bay Cup -
 
The GT Cup-Great Bay Race joined the newly created SRO GT Cup, the latest GT competition launched in the interior of China, inspired by the GT4 class vehicles of the Macao Grand Prix. Thirty-three cars, six of them driven by Macau pilots, signed up for this debut-a record number of participants in a GT4 category in Asia category.
According to the organizer's statement, Sro Motorsports Group, “the total number of cars and the variety of builders have even exceeded the organizers' expectations for a championship that only began to be discussed in late November 2024. Since then, the Sro Asia team and their partner AAMC (Macau-China General Automobile Association) have worked tirelessly to make the series a reality before their debut.”
The event started in a troubled way. Due to a customs problem that affected several cars, more than a dozen competitors was unable to participate in the free training session on Friday. Fortunately, for this group of pilots, among which were included the pilots of the Kevin Leong Ian Veng, Kim Hou Lao and Un HA IP, the cars arrived at the circuit in time for Saturday's qualification.
Animated races and decision in Zhuhai
With three dozen cars, from ten different brands, on track, all with very balanced tasks, was attended by two animated races in the imposing Shanghai track. In the first 12 -lap race, the two Lotus Emi GT4 Officials, by Daniel Lu and Luo Kailuo, who departed from the first line of the grill, were overcome on track by the Chen Weian Audi R8 LMS GT4. In the second match of the weekend, Lichao Han, behind the wheel of the same Toyota GR GT4 who beat the GT Cup - Great Bay Race in 2024, triumphed ahead of Chen Weian and Lotus de Liu Kai Shun.
Macao pilots had no easy life on a track where they had little or no experience. The most rewarded of all, Kelvin Leong, abandoned in the second round of the first race, while Miguel Law, in Audi R8 LMS GT4, was the best of the riders of MSAR, ending in 19th place. In Sunday's race, Leong took his BMW M4 GT4 F82 to 11th place.
Up to 28 cars will be able to compete in the GT Cup - Great Bay Race, at the end of the season, on the streets of Macau. The places will be attributed based on the classification after the second round of the championship, scheduled for the Zhuhai Permanent Circuit, in a date yet to be announced.</description><pubDate>2025-03-25 01:20:30</pubDate></item><item><title>GP Macau | Fia introduces costly measure to GT world cup</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/21/gp-macau-fia-introduz-medida-onerosa-para-taca-do-mundo-de-gt/</link><description>The International Automobile Federation (FIA) announced on Tuesday afternoon a technical measure for the GT3 cars participating in the GT World Cup of the Macao Grand Prix, which will certainly have an impact on a race that is the event's headlord
 
To improve the Balance of Performance (BOP) - the method that balances the progress between all cars in the GT3 category - the FIA ​​decided to force the use of torque sensors, like what you already do in their championships, such as resistance worlds (WEC) and Rally Raid or Formula E. Torque sensors offer a very high precision in power measurement, allowing FIA ensures that the power of each car does not exceed the values ​​assigned by BOP and that external factors, such as atmospheric conditions, do not influence performance.
Although Sro Motorsports Group is co-organizer of this race, and having a bop recognized worldwide, in the last two years, the Macao Bop has been provided by the FIA ​​itself. Last year, the FIA ​​BOP was worth a series of criticisms, with teams and pilots-particularly from Audi, Porsche and Lamborghini, the main impaired-to publicly express their natural discontent with the difference in progress.
These sensors are installed in car transmission veins and represent the most effective tool for measuring wheel power, being individually attributed by the BOP process to each car model that participates in the world's most prestigious “sprint” race for GT3 class machines. According to FIA, the decision to make torque sensors mandatory after consultations with the brands involved in the GT3 technical working group.
Costs will shoot
For a race that has several private teams, this measure will be expensive, as these sensors exceed half a million patacas per car, and the teams need to have another same spare reserve system. This, given that most teams that participate in the MSar test do not use torque sensors in their cars in any competition, and cannot amortize the brutal investment.
"From the experience I had in Qatar, it is noted that there is a difference between several builders in the way it generates this technology. An extra support team is needed to monitor and maximize performance without exceeding the stipulated limits," he told HM Duarte Alves, the experienced track engineer with the official Ford team in the first WEC season in the Arab country.
"A good example is the difficulty and time needed for a builder who enters as a newcomer. An illustrative case is Mercedes-AMG, which is facing growth pains while developing its own systems," said Duarte Alves. “In more flat circuits, the management of these systems is simpler. In places like Macau, where 'torque peaks' will always be frequent, it will be a real challenge for the engineers of these systems!”
Confident
Immune to all this, the FIA ​​chooses a speech directed to builders, forgetting that most of the starting grid is made up of private competitors.
Lutz Leif Linden, chairman of the FIA ​​GT commission, said the institution that represents “made this decision in consultation with the builders”, adding that, to the international federation, “this means even more justice and improved control of BOP values, which is particularly important in such a prestigious and media event, in such a demanding circuit, where the long -speed straight lines contrast with tight curves and narrow ”.
Fabrice Van Ertvede, FIA speed technical manager, stressed the idea that "our goal, as a regulatory entity, is to ensure total equity for all participants." The implementation of torque sensors “is an extremely effective tool for achieving this goal, allowing us to align very different cars in parameters such as pure power, but also at full speed, a crucial factor in a circuit like the guide circuit.”
Despite the difficulties that Mercedes-AMG encountered with this system last month, Fabrice Van Ertvede praises that “the builders we hope to see in Macau this year are already familiar with this innovation, through their experience in the FIA's LMGT3 LMGT3 class, and the decision to adopt torque sensors resulted from the dialogue we kept with them.”
This is the second news that the FIA ​​introduces in the mashed race, having announced last month that the second qualification segment will have a super pole format, with each pilot to go to the track individually for a total of two qualification laps. The eighth edition of the FIA ​​GT World Cup will take place from November 13 to 16, as part of the 72nd edition of the Macao Grand Prix.</description><pubDate>2025-03-21 17:11:10</pubDate></item><item><title>GT Cup Right-Great Bay Race decides on Pingtan</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/09/apuramento-da-taca-gt-corrida-da-grande-baia-decide-se-em-pingtan/</link><description>The second test of the GT Cup - Race of the Great Bay of the 72nd edition of the Macao Grand Prix will not be played at the Zhuhai International Circuit, as initially planned, but at the International Circuit of Lago Ruyi, in the Pingtan tourist region in Fuzhou.
Sro Cup's debut season calendar was finally defined yesterday, with the official announcement of confirmation that Pingtan's semi-permanent circuit will host the third and fourth rounds of the GT4 cars on June 28 and 29. Pingtan thus joins Shanghai, Beijing and Macau in this year's calendar of the championship launched by Sro Asia in partnership with the Macau-China General Automobile Association (AAMC).
The Pingtan track replaces Zhuhai, which was on the provisional calendar released in January, but could not confirm his event. This new date is also no coincidence, as the Sro GT Cup event will be part of the Pingtan-Macau cultural activities scheduled for June.
Pingtan's picturesque - which combines modern and coastal urban scenarios - remains widely unknown outside China. Inaugurated in 2022, the circuit has two strokes that incorporate existing public roads on the island of Pingtan, sections built from root and permanent boxes. Both SRO GT Cup races will take place in the 2.9 -kilometer circuit and 14 curves, already used by national championships such as China Endurance Championship (CEC) and the Chinese Formula 4 Championship.
Promising start
The 2025 Sro Cup season has spectacularly tore with 33 cars - GT4's largest grill ever gathered in Asia - to play two Formula 1 China Grand Prix Races last month. Integrated in the F1 official program, Chen Weian (Audi) and Lichao Han (Toyota) won the two races that will serve as the basis for the selection of competitors entitled to participate this year in the GT Cup - Great Bay Race.
Up to 28 cars will be able to compete in the GT Cup - Great Bay Race, which takes place at the end of the season, on the streets of Macau. The places will be assigned based on the classification after this second round, scheduled for Pingtan. In the dispute for a vacancy were in Shanghai six pilots of the MSAR: Kevin Leong Ian Veng, Miguel Lei, Cheng Tou Wong, Wai Ming Fok, Kim Hou Lao and Un Hous IP.
Charles enters the right foot
Still in the GT events, but in Australia, Macao pilot Charles Leong Hon Chio won the two races of the Lamborghini Super Trofeo Asia inaugural journey in Sydney. The young rider of the territory, behind the wheel of SJM Theodore Racing's Lamborghini Huracán EVO2, has authored the two races played at Sydney Motorsport Park with authority, team with Irish Alex Denning.
Following a sensational season opening, the Lamborghini Super Trofeo Asia returns to the action next month, with the second round on the stage of the China Grand Prix, the International Shangoi Circuit, from May 16 to 18. After finishing second in 2024, Charles Leong is determined to win the title of the Italian brand competition in Asia in 2025.</description><pubDate>2025-04-09 23:47:39</pubDate></item><item><title>MOTOR EMBALISM | Leong repeats Lamborghini trophy with Theodore</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/02/automobilismo-leong-repete-trofeu-lamborghini-com-a-theodore/</link><description>The Lamborghini Super Trofeo Asia starts this weekend in Australia. The monomocrete competition of the prestigious super -sports builder will have, once again, with a representation of the MSAR. Charles Leong Hon Chio will be again at the service of SJM Theodore Racing.
After last season Charles Leong and SJM Theodore Racing fought for the Pro class title to the last race, this duo will continue in 2025. However, the winner of the Macao 4 Grand Prix of Formula 4 by 2020 and 2021 will not form a team with Japanese Miki Koyama. Beside his side, the Macau pilot will now have young Irish Alex Denning, who last year competed at the European Series GT4 and will make his debut on Asian tracks.
Also new is in the SJM Care Team Theodore Racing, which is no longer Iron Lynx-a structure that, since 2021, controls Prema Powertaam ​​through Swiss company DC Racing Solutions Ltd. The relationship of Iron Lynx with Lamborghini Squadra Corso, an entity responsible for the Italian brand, deteriorated dramatically at the end of last year Due to a conflict related to the FIA ​​Endurance World Championship program (WEC). As a result, Iron Lynx has abandoned all activities with the brand of Sant'Agata Bolognese globally.
Given this scenario, to ensure technical assistance to its Lamborghini Huracán Super Trofeo Evo 2, SJM Theodore Racing will feature this season with the services of DW Evans GT, the team that, last year, won the Team Championship and the Asian trophy class, with the English-based English and co-owner of the team, Dan Wells.
There is no coincidence with the GP
The Lamborghini Super Trofeo Asia intends to keep its momentum by 2025, with a calendar composed of six events in six different countries. The season will start, for the first time, in Australia, with the historic Sydney Motorsport Park to receive the first double round. Then the competition heads for Shanghai, China, for the second round on the weekend from June 16 to 18, marking its return to the calendar in 2024 after a four -year absence. Japan will be the host of the third round two weeks later, at the iconic Fuji track, while the Inje Speedium in South Korea enters the calendar in late July.
After having previously hosted the opening round of the season, Sepang, Malaysia, passes to September in 2025, occupying the fifth round of the calendar. The sixth and last race will take place at the Misano Circuit in Italy, together with the Lamborghini world finals. For the first time in several years, the event will not coincide with the Macao Grand Prix, competing in the previous weekend.
Absence of figure
Pro--class winner in 2024, along with Chinese Jason Fangping Chen, André Couto will not be present in this year's edition of the Lamborghini Super Trofeo Asia. Madness Racing Team, whereby the Portuguese territory pilot competed last season, abandoned the trophy and has not yet defined his sports project for 2025. For this first race in the championship in Australia, there are twenty -three cars that will be driven by thirty -nine pilots.</description><pubDate>2025-04-02 23:01:40</pubDate></item><item><title>Iame Asia finals of Karting back in December</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/11/finais-da-iame-asia-de-karting-voltam-em-dezembro/</link><description>The Macao Karting International Award will receive again, from December 11 to 14, the Iame Asian finals. Like last year, the coloane karting race will give invitations to the very coveted world end of Iame in 2026.
Organized by the Institute of Sport, Macau-China General Automobile Association (AAMC), Otk Kart Asia and Iame Asia, the 2024 event brought back the international spirit to one of the largest competitions of the sport on the Asian continent. Coloane's karting received several races and different categories of Iame Series Asia, recovering the international prestige of an event that has been the scene of the Cik-Fia World Championship events.
Pilots from the interior of China, Singapore, Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Japan, India, Sri Lanka, Australia, New Zealand, Sweden, Italy, France, Austria, the United States of America, Brazil, Hong Kong, and, of course, Macao, filled the track from the mashes in 2024 for four days of intense Competition, something that has not been seen for several years.
After the success of the previous edition, the formula is repeated this year. Singapore's organization again chooses Coloane's karting for its biggest event of the season, confirming the presence of the usual categories: Cadet, Junior, Senior and Master.
Thank you Macau!
The Iame (Italian American Motor Engineering) is one of the world's leading engine manufacturers for Karting. Founded in 1968 by Bruno Grana, the company is headquartered in Italy and is one of the references in Karting Internacional, having bet strongly in the Asian market in recent years. The presence in Macau is part of this strategy of growth and expansion.
The announcement of the return to the territory was made on social networks: “After an incredible debut in 2024, we are back with the Macao International International Award and the Iame Asia final for another epic confrontation! The city of emotions at high speed and legendary races will be the stage for the best pilots in Asia and the world!
Satisfied with the reception in 2024, Iame Asia organizers took the opportunity to leave a "huge thanks to AAMC and the Macao government for their continuous support and confidence to make it possible!"
In addition to the Macao test, the 2025 calendar of Iame Series Asia includes three events in Malaysia and three events in Thailand. However, for the first time, last weekend of March, the Iame Asia Cup will be held at the International Shanghai Circuit Karting.</description><pubDate>2025-03-11 01:04:32</pubDate></item><item><title>Return to GIC | Local tests return to Zhaoqing</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/10/regresso-ao-gic-provas-locais-voltam-a-zhaoqing/</link><description>The dates for the Macao of Tourism Car Championship (MTCs in the English acronym) were made known on the past Friday by the General Automóvel Association of Macau-China (AAMC) through a newsletter. The competition for local pilots and decides to find out the Macao Grand Prix in November will again return to the Guangdong International Circuit (GIC).
After a year when the MTCS headed to the Zhuzhou International Circuit in Hunan province, AAMC listened to most of the territory pilots and chose to make these important races closer to the main interveners' house - the pilots. In recent years, the circuit of the surroundings of Zhaoqing has been the preferred stage for the realization of these races, due to the proximity and the fact that it serves as an operational basis to most teams.
The first of the two events scheduled for the 2025 MTCS is scheduled from 18 to 20 April, while the second round is scheduled from 16 to 18 May. The AAMC newsletter says that "all riders must go through a selection process before they can participate in the 72nd edition of the Macao Grand Prix - Macau Touring Car Challenge."
Registration, for the competition that joins the Toyota Gr86 (ZN8) and the Subaru BRZ (ZD8), are open until March 29 and after the end of the registration period, "all applications will be subject to AAMC approval, which reserves the final right to accept or reject any registration."
The technical regulation was also published, as was officially confirmed the use of tires of the Italian brand Pirelli, which belongs to the Chinese conglomerate Sinochem, as had already happened on the last edition of the Macao Grand Prix.
Confirmation of the Great Bay
AAMC also confirmed the two findings for the GT Cup - Great Bay Race (GT4), which will be concomitant with the new Chinese Championship Sro GT Cup. The first race will be played from March 21 to 23, at the International Circuit of Shanghai, in the Formula 1 China Grand Prix. Zhuhai International. Also here Pirelli will be the only tire supplier.
These two tests will be determined for the big holiday party on the guide circuit, and it is defined that only 28 cars will be accepted on the starting grid in the mashed race. The 72nd edition of the Macau Grand Prix runs from November 13 to 16.</description><pubDate>2025-03-10 04:17:32</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
