"It is true that we recognize the lack of medical care and this may have led to the death of our patient, who had been hospitalized for almost a week," Vidal de Jesus Lopes, director of the HNGV diagnostic and therapeutic support service.
Vidal de Jesus explained that the HNGV management has already received the report of doctors and nurses who have been service at night, and will create an independent team to investigate the case. "The patient died due to bleeding, but it is necessary to find out whether that was what caused death or if there was another reason," he said.
According to the patient's family, an 81 -year -old man has always been assisted by trainees of the medical school. "It is true that there was a failure on our part, because our senior professionals should have supervised better. We will correct it," the hospital director acknowledged.
The director of HNGV's diagnostic and therapeutic support service also stated that hospital staff always serve patients with “care, dedication and sense of responsibility”. "We recognize that any action of interns should be supervised by senior professionals. For the future, we take this responsibility and we will work so that situations like this do not repeat," he said.
Vidal de Jesus also lamented that often patients already reach the hospital with very complicated health situations for which treatment is no longer possible.</description><pubDate>2025-04-15 06:30:28</pubDate></item><item><title>USA | Operators can be required to sell casinos</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/14/eua-operadoras-podem-ser-obrigadas-a-vender-casinos/</link><description>An analyst of the game told Lusa that China could force US operators to sell casinos in Macao, in retaliation, if Washington Force the sale of Tiktok and ports on the Panama Canal
Game consultant Igamix founder Ben Lee expressed fear on the impact of “current friction” between China and the United States due to the Tiktok video platform and the ports operated by the Hong Kong Ck Hutchison group in Panama.
"If China adopts the same retaliation strategy it has been employing," the possibility that US game companies are forced to sell operations in Macau to Chinese entrepreneurs "go up some levels," Ben Lee said. "I think after the US threatening to remove the Chinese actions from the bags," everything is on the table, "added the Igamix analyst, citing the secretary of the Treasury, citing the secretary of the Treasury, American.
On Wednesday, Scott Bessent, in an interview with Fox Business broadcaster, refused to remove the possibility of forcing Chinese companies to abandon the United States bags: "This decision will be from President Trump."
Creditsights' executive director Nicholas Chen recalled Lusa that new concessions can be terminated “by threat to national or mashed security” or “reasons of public interest”. "However, what would constitute such a threat was not explicitly defined by the authorities," said Creditsights expert, who is part of the Fitch Financial Notation Agency group.
"We have not seen any nomination, to date, that the governments of Macao or China will be aiming at US -based Macao game operators for national security reasons," Chen added. On the other hand, he admitted to being worrying in February in Macao as a "foreign opponent" of the United States, imposing restrictions on investment by local companies.
Larger fish
Vitaly Umansky, an analyst at the Seaport Research Partners consultancy company, told Lusa to be “quite skeptical” about any risks to Macau. "There are much larger targets to hunt in China if China really wanted to score a position," said the expert. Chinese authorities “have been after a variety of US companies in mainland China, who believe they are sensitive points for the Beijing government, especially technology and health,” he recalled.
Already Ben Lee believes that, instead of changing the terms of the concessions, the Macao government could introduce new laws “that restrict repatriation” or money transfers from local subsidiaries to mother companies in the United States. Vitaly Umnsky doubts that this could happen, warning that Macau could lose the image as "a suitable environment for investments from abroad entrepreneurs."
Vitaly Umansky is sure that the operators “will invest everything they have promised,” but admitted that there is doubts about “when it will be invested and what”. "There have been numerous obstacles. The [Macao] government has been slow in project approval and has not made available more land to be developed," he lamented.</description><pubDate>2025-04-14 13:10:20</pubDate></item><item><title>Traffic | Authorities prepare measures for Easter holidays</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/15/transito-autoridades-preparam-medidas-para-ferias-da-pascoa/</link><description>Given the arrival of Easter holidays that implies more visitors in the territory, the direction of services for traffic affairs (DSAT) has prepared a series of traffic management measures and buses with the public security police, customs services, hotels and carriers of transfers.

Macao's displaced dust for a northeast monsoon led the Meteorological and Geophysical Services (SMG) to appeal to the population to avoid leaving home. Throughout the day, air quality levels were varying, but for most of the time they remained at levels classified as dangerous.
"Under the influence of a dust storm brought by a northeast monsoon, and due to weak wind and unfavorable meteorological conditions for the dispersion of atmospheric pollutants, it is expected that the concentration of pollutants will remain at high levels for a period of time," SMGs were explained by the alerts issued to the population.
"SMG advise the population, especially people who suffer from heart or respiratory disease, pregnant, children and the elderly, to avoid strenuous activities and outdoor activities, especially in areas of intense traffic," he was added.
Regarding the general population, around noon, it was indicated to reduce “strenuous activities and the time of outdoor permanence”.
According to the authorities' analysis, the different pollutants recorded different levels of concentration throughout the day, a factor that also depends on the place where the measurement is made. However, around 12:35 pm, the concentration of particles 2.5, also known as fine particles, ranged from 74 to 81 micrograms per cubic meter. The World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines indicate that healthy levels of PM2..5 should not be above an average of 5 microgram per cubic meter throughout the year. In addition, the WHO indicates daily exposure to a value of 15 microgram per cubic meter, should not exceed more than four days.
High values
Regarding PM10 particles, around 12:35 pm, concentration levels ranged from 272 to 368 micrograms per cubic meter. According to WHO, the healthy limit value of the average daily concentration of these particles is 50 micrograms per cubic meter and the annual limitation value is 20 micrograms per cubic meter.
At the level of nitrogen dioxide the recommended maximum levels are 25 micrograms per cubic meter per day and 10 micrograms per cubic meter per year. The measurement of SMG at 12:35 pm yesterday, which was based on the values ​​of the previous hour, indicated a concertation of 39.1 to 88.9 micrograms per cubic meter.
It was not only at Misrem that the impact of the dusts displaced by the monsoon was felt. Yesterday morning, Hong Kong appeared identified by the portal IQAIR.com as the place with the fourth worst concentration of air pollutants worldwide. Raehk was only outdated at the worst air quality level by Shenzhen, the neighboring city of the interior of China, Nova Deli in India and Lahore, Pakistan.
Around noon, Hong Kong fell to sixth place, having been overtaken by the Chinese cities of Guangzhou and Chongqing, which also had a large concentration of pollutants in the air.</description><pubDate>2025-04-15 06:07:52</pubDate></item><item><title>COVER CLASS | Sam hu fai expects “consensus” to decide</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/15/cheque-pecuniario-sam-hou-fai-espera-consenso-para-decidir/</link><description>There may be changes in the pecuniary reimbursement program, but it is not known when or how. Sam Hou Fai said it was necessary more consensus in society, but indicated that part of the budget value for the check can be applied to the local economy
 
The pecuniary reimbursement program will be changed, but Sam Hou Fai was no use yesterday, at the Press Conference on the Governing Action Lines Report (LAG) for this year, no details on what this change will be, regarding formats, values ​​and if residents living outside Macao will continue to receive support.
In order to know what will happen is necessary consensus, he said. "I can't respond more detailed about the [check assignment] conditions. At this time, the government's goal is to give 10,000 patacas to permanent residents and 6,000 for non-permanent. For more details I have to have the consensus of society," he said.
Sam Hou Fai left, however, some considerations about any formats to be adopted by the authorities. "We have been this plan for 17 years, and if we keep it in old format, or if it will be necessary to reform, it depends on the consensus we get in society. We can deposit the money in the bank or use a certain amount to inject the economy, so that it will be more dependent on the real life situation."
The chief executive pointed out that, in budgetary terms, “this year will not be easy”, as “very high regular expenses, of 150 billion, and tax revenues of the game of the order of 93.1 billion are foreseen. In addition, the ruler recalled the highest stability of the current inflation rate in 2008, when the pecuniary reimbursement program was created.
"I remember that in 2008 the financial crisis and the inflation rate were issues faced at the time. The inflation rate was 9.4 percent, but now it is more relieved. The pecuniary checks are a measure of support and not regulated by law. In society there have been voices that this plan has a part that is not fair and has to change," he said.
“Because it is an annual measure, it is necessary to launch the administrative regulation, and if not released, it is a sign that there will be no cash checks. When I perform the regulation I will take into account the different social situations. I have only four months as chief executive and need to hear more opinions. If we keep the model of the ten thousand patacas is easy, because we have residents working in the large bay. 183 days, continue to have support. ”
Dwelling
Asked about the management of economic housing, Sam Hou Fai made it clear that the government will only complete the fractions that are under construction and suspend new projects, given the reduction of demand from residents.
"There is a slowdown due to economic adjustment after pandemic and the price of housing in neighboring regions. Currently, ten thousand fractions are under construction, whose work ends in 2026, and the remaining projects are suspended. We will not plan to resume the works, because economic housing is something that is related to the supply of land and the private market. assured.
Remembering the current international economic conjuncture, Sam Hou Fai said that "this is not the right time to decide the construction of more economic housing."
Yes, there may be an adjustment so that families can change home depending on the needs. "We will study mechanisms so that households have other options. Singles can already have a family and need another type of house. We think more about families on waiting list, ensure a balance and ponder various situations," he said.
Intermediate housing is not even mentioned in this lag report. "We do not mention this plan because of the economic situation of Macau, because it takes a balance between private housing, intermediate and economic. The demand for economic housing has lowered," he said.
Taxis like “Mark Six”
Regarding entry into the platform market like Uber or Chinese Didi, Sam Hou Fai promised to study “a platform to call taxis”, admitting the lack of offer on holidays and weekends.
“During my campaign I talked to foreign trade chambers who told me that taking a taxi in Macau is as difficult as winning Mark Six.
Tourism | Sam Hou Fai wants more flights abroad
Sam Hou Fai also commented on the future official visit to Portugal, also referring to the possibility of moving to Spain “to start exchanges”. "Our secretary has recently been moved to Spain to participate in a conference of great wingspan, and we will develop the projects in this direction, integrating ourselves in the Great Bay and Hengqin," said the ruler, explaining that more connection flights to other markets, especially Asian, is necessary. "Southeast Asia is a very important market. For Portugal the situation is more complicated in terms of flights, but for Southeast Asia is possible. We can encourage the creation of more flights to these countries."
Portugal | Sam Hou Fai visit after the legislatures
Sam Hou Fai gave more data about his official trip to Portugal, the first of his term. “I hope the visit will happen after LAG, in the first half, perhaps after the legislative elections [on May 18], when the situation is more stable. Then it will be an opportune moment for the visit that is a good testimony of the good relations between Macau and Portugal.” Asked about the Portuguese's difficulties in obtaining the residence, Sam Hou Fai said he contacted Secretary Wong Sio Chak on the matter. "I was told that there was no change in the administrative regulation, and I noticed that, according to the Basic Law, the rights remain unchanged. We have Portuguese jurists working in the government and doctors, and also at the Portuguese Macao School there are teachers. We have no problem."</description><pubDate>2025-04-15 05:42:08</pubDate></item><item><title>AL | Sam Hou Fai launches support for birth, but warns for budget revenues</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/15/al-sam-hou-fai-lanca-apoio-a-natalidade-mas-alerta-para-receitas-orcamentais/</link><description>In his first lines of government action, Sam Hou Fai announced the creation of a new “childhood subsidy” that will assign up to 18,000 patacas per year to permanent residents under three years. However, it warned of economic difficulties
 
In the first lines and government action he presented to the population of Macau, Sam Hou Fai announced the creation of a new childhood allowance that will assign a maximum and 18,000 patacas per year to children under three years. In the Legislative Assembly, the Chief Executive revealed the creation of a new social support and the updating of others, underlined that the government places the well-being of the population as the great priority.
Although it has only mentioned the “mitigation of population concerns” such as the third priority of the government's policies, behind other aspects such as the diversification of the economy and the efficiency of governance in the MSAR, Sam ensured that the population is the first priority: “The well-being of the population is fundamental. This government will persist in placing the interests of the population first and, taking into account the subjects related to their daily life, to solve the real problems.

Economics warnings
At the economy level, although without ever mentioning the new trade war between the United States and China, the chief executive warned that the Economy of the MSAR will not pass unscathed, although it can count on the interior market. "We have witnessed, in recent years, the aggravation of unilateralism and protectionism, the insufficiency of dynamics prone to world economic growth, as well as the increase of unforeseen events and uncertainties," he said.
"Deep and complex changes in the internal and external environment have already manifested and will persist, so Macau, as a microeconomic strongly turned outside, could not be immune to the resulting impacts," he added. "For all this, we should not underestimate any threats and challenges, before, we must always be aware of the risks and a sense of warning, so that we are prepared to act against all potential threats," he warned.

In the same session it was mentioned that the money is attributed to residents “who meet the requirements”, so it remains to know what these requirements will be.
Focus on terrorism
In the lag presented yesterday by Sam Hou Fai National Security had a lower prominence in the face of the speeches of Ho IAT SENG. Still, it has been indicated that for this year the reformulation of the State Security Defense Commission will be studied and new laws will be thought of to combat terrorism.

The President of the General Assembly of Apomac - Association of Retirees, Reformed and Pensioners of Macao claims to have no hope of solving the problems of the Portuguese in Macau related to the consulate, proof of life or extension of the validity of passports. This is how Jorge Fão commented yesterday's meeting with the Secretary of State for Portuguese Communities, José Cesário.
"He [Cesário] knows what our concerns are, but they are not resolved, because Portugal has a very weak economy, not a rich country, and the Portuguese living outside Portugal, and especially outside Europe, have dies of problems. And Portugal cannot solve these problems," Jorge Fão told HM when asked about the presentation of the problems of the Portuguese community. "He knows the problems better than anyone, worked many mandates as deputy and secretary of state, knows better than any secretary of state the situation. But, the problems have been solved so far?" He asked.
Jorge Fão recognized that he lost hope after successive governments of Portugal. "I never hope to solve the problems. I have already lost the desire to wait, in fact I lost confidence, faith and lost everything," he admitted. "Whoever, I think Portugal is very turned in and out, the Portuguese from Macau, Canada or Brazil, or wherever, just to acquire the nationality takes years. If there is a Portuguese child born abroad, to acquire Portuguese nationality only the procedure takes three years," he exemplified.

With “beards”
The associative leader explained that the problems with greater impact go through the waiting time in the processes of recognition of Portuguese nationality, the increase in the validity of the passport from five to 10 years, the proof of life for the reformed that does not work and always has to be repeated, a “old -fashioned” computer system in the consulate of Portugal, as well as lack of personnel and wage updates to the workers of the consulate.
Jorge Fão guarantees that these problems mentioned yesterday at the meeting with José Cesário, but were not new. "These problems have all beards," he said.
In turn, the secretary, according to Fão, left no promises of resolution: "He does not promise, because he knows what the situation is like. How will he make promises if this is not just about him?" He said. "When a government does not work, it cannot be expected to be a secretary of state to work the rest," he said.
With Portugal having new elections for the Assembly of the Republic on May 18, and with José Cesário leading the AD list, currently in power, in the circle outside of Europe, Fão indicated that the matter was little approached, but that he did not fail to tell Cesário that he considers him favorite. "He has not touched much in his [electoral] program, but I think he is prepared for what comes from the electoral act. I think he is convinced that he will win, and probably will," he said. "I am not seeing the existence of another strong competitor. To this day it has not yet appeared," he said.</description><pubDate>2025-04-14 14:30:36</pubDate></item><item><title>Press | AJM concerned with lack of communication</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/14/imprensa-ajm-preocupada-com-falta-de-comunicacao/</link><description>The Macao Journalists Association indicates that Sam Hou Fai has implemented a new communication model, which is essentially from preventing the rulers from being the target of questions by the media
 
The Macao Journalists Association (AJM) is concerned about Sam Hou Fai's policy and communication, which accuses that "significantly reduced the number of opportunities for journalists to directly interview the chief executive, secretaries and other rulers." The position was taken through a statement issued yesterday, where it is pointed out that 90 percent of government information result from communications, without any chance of raising questions.
"AJM is seriously concerned about the fact that such a passive and regressive communication approach can become the new normal," he was nominated. “Once again, we appeal to the Government of Misrem that honor his promise of respect for press freedom, taking concrete measures: dialogue with the public and the media with more confidence, so that the community has a better understanding of their policy and vision,” was asked.
AJM also regrets that journalists have ceased to be invited to cover some events that were normally covered, such as official visits to the deepened cooperation zone between Guangdong and Macao, or traditional visits by the Chief Executive during the fourth day of the Lunar New Year. In relation to the latter, the association indicates that the government only invited “two media” with connections close to the executive.
Irrational refusal
In the statement, the AJM also addresses the situation of the media in places that are being barred from the press conferences organized by the government.
"The government continues to refuse, irrationally, that local monthly magazines and the media in line make it covered some types of official events. Namely, these exclusions often occur at events involving high employees," he was criticized. “The Social Communication Office has been trying to justify these discriminatory practices with unconvincing explanations, such as the 'limited space' available at various event places to accommodate the press, and even advised journalists to 'watches the event' transmission 'instead of personally attending. Such answers raise serious doubts about the integrity of employees and their understanding of the role of journalism, and reflect a lack of knowledge of the rules, International for an open government, eventually undermining the credibility and public image of the MSAR, ”was defended.
The Association thus asks the Executive to respect the Press Law: “AJM reiterates that what journalists need is neither discourses nor pressuated press, but of adequate mechanisms for performing reports on site, where journalists can listen to the voices of all stakeholders, interact directly with the decision makers and obtain a clear understanding of the logic and guidance of current public policies”, was published.</description><pubDate>2025-04-14 14:29:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Timor-Leste | Reference Hospital opens inquiry into the death of sick</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/15/timor-leste-hospital-de-referencia-abre-inquerito-a-morte-de-doente/</link><description>The Guido Valadares National Hospital (HNGV) in Dili acknowledged the lack of assistance to a patient who died on Sunday at that hospital in Timor-Leste and will open an inquiry.
"It is true that we recognize the lack of medical care and this may have led to the death of our patient, who had been hospitalized for almost a week," Vidal de Jesus Lopes, director of the HNGV diagnostic and therapeutic support service.
Vidal de Jesus explained that the HNGV management has already received the report of doctors and nurses who have been service at night, and will create an independent team to investigate the case. "The patient died due to bleeding, but it is necessary to find out whether that was what caused death or if there was another reason," he said.
According to the patient's family, an 81 -year -old man has always been assisted by trainees of the medical school. "It is true that there was a failure on our part, because our senior professionals should have supervised better. We will correct it," the hospital director acknowledged.
The director of HNGV's diagnostic and therapeutic support service also stated that hospital staff always serve patients with “care, dedication and sense of responsibility”. "We recognize that any action of interns should be supervised by senior professionals. For the future, we take this responsibility and we will work so that situations like this do not repeat," he said.
Vidal de Jesus also lamented that often patients already reach the hospital with very complicated health situations for which treatment is no longer possible.</description><pubDate>2025-04-15 06:30:28</pubDate></item><item><title>USA | Operators can be required to sell casinos</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/14/eua-operadoras-podem-ser-obrigadas-a-vender-casinos/</link><description>An analyst of the game told Lusa that China could force US operators to sell casinos in Macao, in retaliation, if Washington Force the sale of Tiktok and ports on the Panama Canal

"If China adopts the same retaliation strategy it has been employing," the possibility that US game companies are forced to sell operations in Macau to Chinese entrepreneurs "go up some levels," Ben Lee said. "I think after the US threatening to remove the Chinese actions from the bags," everything is on the table, "added the Igamix analyst, citing the secretary of the Treasury, citing the secretary of the Treasury, American.
On Wednesday, Scott Bessent, in an interview with Fox Business broadcaster, refused to remove the possibility of forcing Chinese companies to abandon the United States bags: "This decision will be from President Trump."
Creditsights' executive director Nicholas Chen recalled Lusa that new concessions can be terminated “by threat to national or mashed security” or “reasons of public interest”. "However, what would constitute such a threat was not explicitly defined by the authorities," said Creditsights expert, who is part of the Fitch Financial Notation Agency group.
"We have not seen any nomination, to date, that the governments of Macao or China will be aiming at US -based Macao game operators for national security reasons," Chen added. On the other hand, he admitted to being worrying in February in Macao as a "foreign opponent" of the United States, imposing restrictions on investment by local companies.
Larger fish
Vitaly Umansky, an analyst at the Seaport Research Partners consultancy company, told Lusa to be “quite skeptical” about any risks to Macau. "There are much larger targets to hunt in China if China really wanted to score a position," said the expert. Chinese authorities “have been after a variety of US companies in mainland China, who believe they are sensitive points for the Beijing government, especially technology and health,” he recalled.
Already Ben Lee believes that, instead of changing the terms of the concessions, the Macao government could introduce new laws “that restrict repatriation” or money transfers from local subsidiaries to mother companies in the United States. Vitaly Umnsky doubts that this could happen, warning that Macau could lose the image as "a suitable environment for investments from abroad entrepreneurs."
Vitaly Umansky is sure that the operators “will invest everything they have promised,” but admitted that there is doubts about “when it will be invested and what”. "There have been numerous obstacles. The [Macao] government has been slow in project approval and has not made available more land to be developed," he lamented.</description><pubDate>2025-04-14 13:10:20</pubDate></item><item><title>Traffic | Authorities prepare measures for Easter holidays</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/15/transito-autoridades-preparam-medidas-para-ferias-da-pascoa/</link><description>Given the arrival of Easter holidays that implies more visitors in the territory, the direction of services for traffic affairs (DSAT) has prepared a series of traffic management measures and buses with the public security police, customs services, hotels and carriers of transfers.

"To describe an event that lasted just a few hours, which was not violent, and immediately agree to describe the request for dissolution of the National Assembly as an insurrection (…) it seems legally unfounded," he said before the central court of Seoul, which after two preliminary hearings began to judge the case, which could result in a Yoon Suk Yeol conviction or even the death penalty.
Untited by the Constitutional Court on April 4, after being suspended from office in mid -December, Yoon now faces criminal accusations. Despite the heavy penalties to which he was subject, he is free, and his pre-trial detention was annulled by procedural reasons on March 8.
Like all defendants, the former head of state had to start by saying his name, date of birth and home. The incriminating accusation Yoon Suk Yeol of “wanting to provoke a revolt, with the aim of overthrowing the constitutional order”, noting that the martial law was prepared in advance and that orders were given to the army to cut electricity and depart the parliament windows.
Yoon, former Attorney General, elected head of state in 2022, began to refute the point charges by point. Most experts expect the process to be long, making comparisons with former President Park Geun-Hye, who was dismissed in March 2017, but whose final conviction for influence trafficking and corruption was only rendered by the Supreme Court in January 2021.
"The veredict in the first instance should be issued around August, but the case involves about 70,000 pages of evidence and numerous witnesses. If the court considers it necessary, the trial may be extended," France-Pressure Law agency told Mini Kyoung-Sic.
Look back
Among others, the court will hear the testimony of two army officers cited by the prosecutors, one of whom claimed to have received orders from their superiors "to withdraw deputies gathered at the National Assembly to impose martial law."
On the night from December 3 to 4, 2024, Yoon Suk Yeol imposed the martial law unexpectedly, sending the army to block the opposition -dominated parliament. However, a few hours later, a high number of deputies managed to meet to vote for the survey of martial law, in a crisis that caught the country by surprise.
If convicted, Yoon will be the third former South Korean president to be convicted of an insurrection after Chun Doo-Hwan and Roh Tae-Woo in 1996 by a coup in 1979.
According to lawyer Min Kyoung-website, the court may apply to Yoon the jurisprudence of Chun and ROH trial, as its actions "also involved the coercive use of the Armed Forces."</description><pubDate>2025-04-15 06:29:02</pubDate></item><item><title>Restoration and retail with recipe breaks in February</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/11/restauracao-e-retalho-com-quebras-de-receitas-em-fevereiro/</link><description>In February, retail trade volume suffered a 28.2 percent reduction in annual terms, measured by the volume of electronic payments.

Trying to save the history of his great traditions, to phenomenology, Heidegger does not escape an idealistic waste, as if the things of the world belonged to her, history, and his one-way course, Bragança de Miranda tells us.
For Benjamin, in his search for a tangible surface of time -contaminated objects, what was concerned was surely the haptic drilling we found in Caravaggio and Fontana - the latter bringing to the artistic object a clearly performative gesture and - as in everything that happens in here and now - capable of recreating or inspiring chaos on such artistic things. Things that no longer offer themselves in a harmonious course and do not belong - neither history nor aesthetics, but to the world like the stones or words that jump to us from the mouth.
Somehow surpassing the Barthiano Punctum, Benjamin's dialectical image escapes the “historicity” that offers itself as a sacred altar where the things of art
They are eternalized - teleologically - in another world where the conditions of the world do not feel - where it is supposed that nothing is lost, ruin, or transforms into the essence of things, and of works, in this case of the work of art.
What matters to Benjamin echoes disturbingly in Duchamp, because in the shift between the past, the present and the future, the things done beings that capture in the act of making their power, is that the possibility of belonging to a certain time, expands in the gesture in which the work affects its own historicity, and can be read at any time. It indicates the possibility of your time and the power of your reception at any time. It is a kronotopic and anmorphic boomerangue. Infixed from the moment it is fixed. As Benjamin said, he seize something, the moment the danger shines, is fatal. However, he referred to the power of myth, which here promisedly belong to those who venture to steal fire to the gods-punishment is the esventtation and cannibalism of others, and can read in the world, in the universe, in the universe, and that we do not know the limits, although we can guess them.
For Benjamin, therefore, things and works done by artists can only ecist in an image that sparkles as a star, which is seen according to the conditions and the means, and which is part of a network, a puzzle, or, better, taking advantage of its own essayist methodical - in a constellation.
I love to remember the geometry of the sky to know where the largest bear is the smaller bear. Looking at the sky, this huge ecran of moving images, images that appear and disappear on the huge skin of the world, because we no longer see beyond it, even knowing that there is more. That there is an entire universe of possibilities. We, who do and those who come, touch or enjoy the performance and effects of doing, are - how to say - the bowels within this huge body that is the world.
And we wish to repeat it on our small gestures of artists, and have both impact and the extraordinary show of heaven, the shadows, the sea… and how do we do it? Seeking to create images that express time in your space, without contaminating themselves for it. Leaving it loose. Allowing us to doubt our acts that are no longer eternal or belong to history, but they are part of an incredible file of possibilities: we can all do, but not all have the effect of affecting the world and somehow causing inconvenience.
From the collection of possibility, the file of all times and spaces, of all dreams and ways of making, of all sensitivities comes the inflamed object of originality-the one whose form we do not yet recognize, the one who re-crack, dearrange, alters… He who invites a time to sit to play plaid with another time. And such a sharing of the sensitive, of which Rancière tells us, is difficult. As difficult as we have the same image of the world.
I believe these things - which few come because they do not recognize the new aspect, and that contemporary in the immense liberation of exclusionary norms, can have any form, leads us to a reversal of Gestalt's theory: it is no longer possible to share anything - not even the world and its grand skin, the blue sky of Bataille. Ricoeur's great evil devours the eyes of the corpses and the possible image is that of a survival kit in the absence of a nuclear war pavorods on the world.
As Agamben warns us, the contemporary gesture starts from the urgency to respond. What answer bring us images of all time if we believe there is no survival kit for art? She is always changing - touched by the grace of the appearance, she is decaying like everything inside the world. Like light… that today we tear to the machine and technique in an agive aesthetic commotion to see when the world gets around the existence.
What remains, for now, is the hammer, to the shiver of time, without the wicked truth, very nietzschianly acting that we all try to do our part, knowing the look of the look that all sees. Increasingly aware that things of art cannot escape you after the bruschiness of your birth, in disturbing objects that increasingly interfere with the state of things, remembering a wonderful Wenders movie, the artists authors, those who affect and alter the appearance of the appearance of the work of art, such as Duchamp, are real estate travelers who drop objects-image that speaks. Shout. Fight. Fly to the sky. They fall and explode politically the land where we live where all that exists is the image - this is the constant matter that emanates from the act of doing things - artistic or not.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>PAULO MAIA AND CARMO</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/autor/paulomaiaecarmo/</link><description>Zhong Kui, the student's patron is often represented on a strange creature that, observed from the tail, has a fish tail that becomes a dragon, a composite designated to.
In imperial examinations, from the Tang dynasty to the Song, between 618 and 1279, the candidates who studied for the imperial exam, after completing it awaited the result on a staircase where the figure of one of these fantastic creatures was carved. What was first, the first to step on the head of Ao, originated a saying to indicate a successful feat-Duzhan aotou, "seize the head of Ao."
The descendants of the emperor, during the Qing Dynasty designated in Manchu A-G, were not subject to this examination, but their study regime was no less demanding. Since three in the morning studying, among others the four books and the five classics, without vacation, with only five days free a year.
One of the most brilliant heirs of this dynasty was Aisin-Tei Hongli, which between 1735-95 would occupy the throne of the dragon son with the name Qianlong. An episode of his biography confirms him when he impressed his powerful grandfather, Emperor Kangxi (1654-1722). He was then twelve years old when he first found him at the Pony Pavilion of the former Yuanmingyuan Summer Palace, the "Garden of the Perfect Brightness." At the time he recited by color the poem of Zhou Dunyi (1017-1073) in praise of the lotto, the flower that is born for beauty, indifferent to the sludge from where it comes.
When in turn became emperor, the grandson remembered the grateful meeting with his grandfather named two places where he took place; The Peonial Garden Pavilion began to "the moon emerging, the clouds move away", and the place where he studied with him, "wind and pines between a myriad of valleys." Usually it also remembered the place by ordering the glorious morning painting during Guxian, the third lunar month (ink and silk color, 179.4 x 106.2 cm, at the National Palace Museum in Taipei).
Yu Xing (1736-1795), born in the Yushan Hill in Changshu (Jiangsu), the author of this panel, was a painter of the qianlong court who had distinguished in thorough paintings from flowers, plants, insects and fish. In a horizontal roll that made under the theme fish and algae (paint and color on paper, 28.5 x 157.8 cm, sold on Sotheby's), Qianlong wrote a poem proving his appreciation:
Green algae like jade
scattered throughout the lake
and fish swimming free between algae.
This scene makes me think
in the uselessness of our life.
Observing the fish having fun
gives me a great joy.
The classic Zhuangzi states, without explaining the reason for words, that the life of the fish is really jublishing. And who knows if it is not this joy that is figured in the persistent representation of a fish that will fly, light and powerful as a dragon.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>ANA CRISTINA ALVES</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/autor/ana-cristina-alves/</link><description>* Assistant and coordinator researcher at the Macau Scientific and Cultural Center

The old silk routes
Two routes connected the Han Dynasty to the West from the second century BC. The South and North Route, both extended from Chang 'an/XI's to the West, the North through Central Asia, the Caspian Sea, and the South, led to the Mediterranean, Genoa and Venice, Irah and Iraq.  Historically, the old silk route divided into four periods:
From the second century BC to the 6th century, having as high points the diffusion of the Buddhism and emergency of Islam;
2) From the beginning of the seventh century to the late tenth century, the highlight being the diffusion of porcelain;
3) From the eleventh century to the fifteenth century, with the heyday of the diffusion of Islamic and Hindu religions and tax trade in East Asia, the relics of the wreck and 7 trips of Admiral Zheng He (鄭和), between 1405-1431, as well as the emergence of multicultural communities such as Guangzhou, Malaca (Malásia) and Galle (Sri Lanka);
4) mid -century. XV to the nineteenth, with emphasis on the exchange of porcelain goods, peppers and spices, globalization of routes and diffusion of Catholicism, and the predominance of other routes, such as those opened by the Portuguese in the Atlantic to the Pacific, through the Indian Indian, especially the Cape Route. This route started in the 15th and 16th centuries in Lisbon reached India, China and Japan, particularly Nagasaqui, and beyond, Timor, in a project that begins to be outlined by D. João II in 1487, being fulfilled by D. Manuel 1, with the fleet led by Vasco da Gama that would lead to India, near Calecute on May 17, 1498. Farther, Macao, where we established between 1555 and 1557, with scholars, such as Eduardo Kol de Carvalho, who advocate the interesting thesis of ensuring the Route of Japan, opened from 1543 and guaranteed by the Nau do Trato, which made the connection between India and Japan, having elected Macau for the necessary commercial interplay of the Portuguese silk, the territory of this trade Macao in 1557, the base the Portuguese founded on the Chinese coast to support the tract ”(Carvalho, 2018, 77).
For these channels of the old chinese silk routes, silk, lacquer, porcelain and tea arrived in Europe, being transmitted to China glass, gems or precious stones, certain fruits and dry fruits, especially grapes, guavas, cucumbers, as well as other vegetables, for example, garlic and carrots. In addition to agricultural exchanges, also Chinese technological inventions such as gunpowder, the manufacture of paper, impression and compass, or the circulation of ideas and, above all, those that made up religious philosophies. Then, with a sea route of the Portuguese silk, between the 15th and 16th centuries the trade globalized entirely, everything changed and negotiated, transmitted and influenced.
II
The new silk route, including the 21st century sea
If the term “Route of Silk” dates back to the ancient Greek geographers and, in particular, Marinus, already “silk sea route”, is from the twentieth century, an alliance arising in a covenant between the French synologist Édouard Chavannes (1865-1918) and the Japanese with their maritime porcelain trade studies in the 1960s.
The Chinese begin to mention the “sea silk route” in 1974, first with the scholar Jao Tsung-i (饒宗頤, 1917-2018), then explicitly with Chen Yan (陳炎) “Silk Maritime Route” (丝绸之路) from 1980.
The “renewed” version that was born in 2013, announced in Kazakhstan, as a track and route (一带一路) at the initiative of the current Chinese president, XI Jinping (习近平), based on the principle of connectivity, aims to connect Asia, Europe and Africa through land and maritime routes.
The six land corridors well and briefly systematized by Professor Fernanda Ilhéu in “The Last Silk Route that History Knowed and the New Silk Route that History will know” (Ilhéu, 2018: 145) are:
China-Mongolia-Russia;
2) China-Pakistan;
3) China-Bangladesh-India- Myanmar;
4) China-Peninsula of Indochina;
5) New European Earth Bridge;
6) China-Central Western, Central Hands.
They converge all tracks to Europe, Duisburg, Germany, including the sea, of great importance to China, as 90% of Chinese trade is performed by this way. Of course China aims to ensure its sources of energy supply, either oil and natural gas, to which a hub from some central Asian countries, such as Turquemenistan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Russia, “being China since 2014 the largest world importer” (ibidem).
Also according to data provided by Fernanda Ilhéu, since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, she was preparing her way to become an increasingly international economy, reaching in 2010 the Statute of Second World Economy (Ilhéu, 2018, 147).  The country to maintain this statute, or perhaps even overcome it, needs to continue with its plan of 4 or 5 modernizations, maintaining the connection abroad for this purpose, that is, the Going Out policy has to continue. Thus transit a first phase of globalization, that of direct exports and foreign direct investment abroad (IDEE), for a second phase of globalization, as stressed Ilhéu (2018, 149) in the form of mergers and acquisitions in Asia, Europe and Africa, as well as in the Americas or Oceania.
Then comes a new sea route from the silk that extends from Chongqing to Fuzhou in southern China, passes through Malaca in Malaysia, goes to Mombaça in Kenya (branch to Cape Verde and Santos in Brazil), heads to the Chinese African military base in Djibouti, then to the port of Pyreu in Greece (Ramifications for Madrid and Sines and Brazil), for Venice) Italy and Rotterdam in the Netherlands (branches for Panama and South American countries).
Places related to the silk sea route within China are the coastal regions of Hebei, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, Hainan and Macao Special Administrative Region, as well as the Huang-Bohai seas, Changjiang River Basin, East China Sea and Taiwan's Strait, Senior China Sea, Japan archipelago, Korea Peninsula, which is the plaque of East Asia.
However, a new sea silk route begins to draw, the polar silk route, which would suppose China, Norway, and Groelândia, into Arctic, to facilitate trade between Asia, Europe and America. The Arctic Route comes out of Shanghai passes through Alaska crosses the North Pole to Denmark to Rotterdão, and from there he can go to the land, passing to China, or using the Rotterdam Silk Route goes to Pyreu, crosses the Suez Channel, Momba, Kolkata (India), Malaca Strait, Jakarta to Zhanjiang (China).
The evolution of the new silk route in the next decade will depend on the growth of the Chinese economy, which according to Thiago Codongo, commercial manager of China Link, will have to grow more than 6% per year to support support and investments, such as the ones they have done in Angola, Venezuela, Pakistan and Mongolia, all these countries with great debts to China.
As Professor Carlos Gaspar (2020) saw in The World of Tomorrow: Contemporary Geopolitics, China performs through the initiative of the Track and Route (Bri) of its various silk corridors, terrestrial, maritime and polar, a strategy of political, economic, cultural and technological connectivity.  Notable advances in mobile telecommunications are distinguished here, such as the 5G network and also in port and rail infrastructure. Moreover, it has the control of Darwin's main marine ports in the Pacific, Hambantotta in Indian, Pyreu in the Mediterranean, Kirkenes in the Arctic, having built in Kazakhstan the dry port of Khorgos, as well as the dry port of Duisburg in Germany.
Note that these routes are essentially commercial and their impact on foreign trade is immense, developing from the purchase and acquisition of ports. Also according to Thiago Codongo, "for China it is also much more interesting to have the maritime control of several seas, lakes and narrows that are important to their goods, both to acquire and to sell." Among these ports are: the aforementioned port of Pireu in Greece (60%); Many African ports among which the largest, the port of Djibouti, close to Ethiopia in Northeast African, built by the Chinese, as well as ports in Ethiopia and Uganda, and in many other African countries, including Guinea, Angola and Mozambique. China has provided help, in terms of construction of concrete infrastructure, to the underprivileged countries, and the building of Addis Ababa in Ethiopia is to be highlighted.  Also about ports, stand out in Brazil, the port of Paranaguá (90%), in the state of Paraná.
According to an investigation by journalist Cecilia Barría, in 2021 were about 115 ports in more than 60 countries, besides having seven of the top ten ports in the world, namely: 1) Shanghai; 2) Ningbo-Zhoushan; 3) Shenzhen; 4) Qingdao; 5) Guangzhou; 6) Tianjin and 7) Hong Kong. According to the latest data provided by Zongyuan Zoe Liu of August 26, 2024, the country has 129 port projects, of which 115 will be active, including ports in which it will have greater or lesser participation, or up to 17 with total or majority possession, the 14 remaining possession will have been suspended or canceled, such as Porto Khalifa in the Arab Emirates.
Also according to the data presented by Zongyuan Zoe Liu, the country is investing in ports with high regular transport connectivity rates, indicated in parenthesis: South Korea (640); Singapore (586); United States (504); Malaysia (486); Japan (423); Vietname (403); United Kingdom (381); Netherlands (380); Hong Kong (376); Belgium (343); India (342); Taiwan (340);  Germany (305), United Arab Emirates (296); Italy (286); Türkiye (283); Thailand (267); France (263); Morocco (263) (https://www.cfr.org/tracker/china-oveseas-ports)
Hit the fear that the Chinese strategy of port acquisition is double, military and commercial, and that in case of widespread conflict, port companies can be used by the Chinese government and, above all, by the popular liberation army marine ships. And examples are exempt: Port of Singapore, of giving Salaam in Tanzania, Pyreu in Greece, Haifa in Israel, Veracruz in Mexico, or Balboa in Panama, the latter near major naval bases.  It is recalled that relatively, for example, to the Panama Canal, the country was present in two ports, Colón and Balboa. Another highly strategic port for China is Freeport in Bahamas, Caraíbe.
There is also another relevant issue, the financial debts of certain countries of fragile economy towards China, some examples to take into account are: Sri Lanka who leased their port for 99 years as compensatory mode of their debt, well -mentioned very indebted countries: Angola, Mongolia, Pakistan and Venezuela.
Among Important Ports in South America, one stands out in Peru, near Lima, the 100% private multipurpose port terminal and detained by Cosco Shipping (China Ocean Shipping Company). It will also refer to the Rio Grande Multipurpose Port in Argentina.
Chinese property in the port sector is mainly in the following companies: 1) Cosco, state; China Merchants, state and 3) Hutchinson Ports, private. In the port control strategy are involved companies such as Cosco (Ports of Pireu and Hamburg) and Shanghai International Port Group (Porto Israelita de Haifa). In Portugal they operate Cosco, through the EuroNave do Porto Maritime Agency, located in Matosinhos and there are also investments related to the Port of Sines, such as the Calb Electric Cars Battery Factory, as well as interest in the expansion of this port.
The memorandum of bilateral understanding celebrated between China and Portugal in 2018, there are 17 agreements, of which the first is relative to the so -called Silk Route, in its terrestrial and maritime aspects, emphasizing in this bilateral cooperation “connectivity” and “electric mobility” 1.
According to Yuan Peng, vice president of the Institute of Contemporary International Relations The New World Order, according to the Chinese view of the world, is characterized by a concentric circle structure, belonging to China three rings: the inner ring of 14 countries with border with China; The intermediate ring of neighboring sea countries, the areas of the East Pacific, Indian Ocean and the Middle East, including Central Asia and Russia, and the outer ring to which Africa, Europe, America and the two poles belong.
The big question is to know if the domain of seas is equivalent to that of the world, which in the space age does not seem to be the case, although China has been rivaling the United States in this domain, and not only in the quality of the second largest economic power, ambitions are equally political wishing to offer a counterpart to a long -dominated unipole.  Nowadays and, above all, in the nundo of tomorrow, as Professor Carlos Gaspar emphasizes, the political ambitions of both Russia and China favor a multipolar geostrategic framework, at least BI or Tripolar, with three great powers in a prominent place: the United States, Russia and China. If these last two powers came into a lasting connection, which does not seem to be the case, there would be an alternative to American power by the Euroasatic axis. However, China needs to consolidate its position as the main Asian power, linking East Asia to South Asia, being currently the main economic partner of asian countries as important as South Korea, Philippines and Thailand, among others.
That China wants to offer itself as a peaceful alternative to the hegemonic power of the United States, there seems to be no doubt, even by the insistent cultivation of a policy of neutrality in the country led by President XI Jinping.
There is yet another important aspect to emphasize: the initiative of track and route (bri) with its maritime and terrestrial links, arises following an internal movement of China in relation to its development and reaction to “a century of humiliation”, the nineteenth of the two wars of opium.
When in the middle of the twentieth century, in 1949, the CCP seized power in China began the first cycle of power of the “New Age”, as Professor Carlos Gaspar2, Mao Zedong's Maoism, was well noted in the unification of the Chinese state, to which the country's second economic flowering cycle was followed by Deng Xiaoping, culminating in the 100th anniversary of the CCP in CCP 2021, the third cycle followed, after 2013, with the rise of President XI Jinping, who seeks to fully realize the goal of erecting China to the category of great power, this possibly widely developed or even completed in 2049 to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the arrival of the CCP to power. China's Renaissance as great power and, perhaps, until reunification with Taiwan.
Finally, it remains to be known how we will all be connected, if the good of a new world order and a shared future, if the autocratic command of a dominant power over the rest. Invoking the goodness of intent, I believe we will not attend the emergence of a new imperial power with connections to all corners of the globe, assisted by the misuse of new technologies, but before a connectivity of a network that extends network for economic reasons, respecting the sovereignty of the remaining states, which will avoid internal political interference, practicing a policy of strict neutrality, which They privilege humanity and harmony, as well as other constant virtues: rites, wisdom, trust and justice.

In imperial examinations, from the Tang dynasty to the Song, between 618 and 1279, the candidates who studied for the imperial exam, after completing it awaited the result on a staircase where the figure of one of these fantastic creatures was carved. What was first, the first to step on the head of Ao, originated a saying to indicate a successful feat-Duzhan aotou, "seize the head of Ao."
The descendants of the emperor, during the Qing Dynasty designated in Manchu A-G, were not subject to this examination, but their study regime was no less demanding. Since three in the morning studying, among others the four books and the five classics, without vacation, with only five days free a year.
One of the most brilliant heirs of this dynasty was Aisin-Tei Hongli, which between 1735-95 would occupy the throne of the dragon son with the name Qianlong. An episode of his biography confirms him when he impressed his powerful grandfather, Emperor Kangxi (1654-1722). He was then twelve years old when he first found him at the Pony Pavilion of the former Yuanmingyuan Summer Palace, the "Garden of the Perfect Brightness." At the time he recited by color the poem of Zhou Dunyi (1017-1073) in praise of the lotto, the flower that is born for beauty, indifferent to the sludge from where it comes.
When in turn became emperor, the grandson remembered the grateful meeting with his grandfather named two places where he took place; The Peonial Garden Pavilion began to "the moon emerging, the clouds move away", and the place where he studied with him, "wind and pines between a myriad of valleys." Usually it also remembered the place by ordering the glorious morning painting during Guxian, the third lunar month (ink and silk color, 179.4 x 106.2 cm, at the National Palace Museum in Taipei).
Yu Xing (1736-1795), born in the Yushan Hill in Changshu (Jiangsu), the author of this panel, was a painter of the qianlong court who had distinguished in thorough paintings from flowers, plants, insects and fish. In a horizontal roll that made under the theme fish and algae (paint and color on paper, 28.5 x 157.8 cm, sold on Sotheby's), Qianlong wrote a poem proving his appreciation:
Green algae like jade
scattered throughout the lake
and fish swimming free between algae.
This scene makes me think
in the uselessness of our life.
Observing the fish having fun
gives me a great joy.
The classic Zhuangzi states, without explaining the reason for words, that the life of the fish is really jublishing. And who knows if it is not this joy that is figured in the persistent representation of a fish that will fly, light and powerful as a dragon.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Today Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/autor/hoje-macau/</link><description>The Guido Valadares National Hospital (HNGV) in Dili acknowledged the lack of assistance to a patient who died on Sunday at that hospital in Timor-Leste and will open an inquiry.

Vidal de Jesus explained that the HNGV management has already received the report of doctors and nurses who have been service at night, and will create an independent team to investigate the case.

"Flowers of Gray" ends the trilogy of works dedicated to Macau, composed of "flowered by mistake the angry roses" and "Nomadic Words"
 
It was ten years that translated into many words. So many, who gave three books, “they were mistakenly flowered to the angry roses”, clearly reference to Camilo Pessanha; “Nomadic Words” and now “Gray Flowers”. Dora Nunes Gago's new poetry book, a teacher and former director of the Portuguese Department of Macao (one), also refers to Macau who lasts in his memory and, therefore, translates into words.
With the seal of Humus, the book has just left Portugal, resulting from the "many poems" written by Dora Nunes Gago during the period in Macao, an experience that turned her into an published and award -winning author.
Writing poetry in these years of teaching and experience the East turned out to be the way found to deal with Macau's reviliations and their dynamics. “Perhaps because it is a shorter record, a way to capture moments, of crystallizing them, in the midst of all the bullshit and surprises that Macau dresses. Maria Ondina Braga referred to the work“ Statue de Sal ”, written in Macao, around 1963, that Macau is 'sleep of sleep and poetry'. Hm.
“Gray Flowers” ​​is called because he went to seek inspiration from a poem by Natália Correia: “(…) young people oblivious to the pulcitude of the body in celebration / pass me as cypresses of cypresses / And the youth gray flower is an edge / strike me by opening vacuums of wild flowers (…) / the gallop in a teeth foam.”
Dora Nunes Gago selected the “surviving poems” of the remaining two titles of the trilogy. “There were those who were lost, between changes, travel, blocks and lost notebooks.” Like the whole macao's own revocation.
In "Gray Flowers," the territory "is represented by rituals, the symbolic times like the Chinese New Year, which is that festive time when the world is reborn and inventing itself." There are also elements that become poetry such as the dumplings, the temples, the island of Hengqin, where the author lived in the days she taught at one.
“The territory is present in the images, but also in the solitude and silence that inhabits the poems, all of them very short. In this book, my obsession with synthesis culminated,” he describes.
Each book, a message
There are poems that speak for themselves, others who need to be explained. And speaking of the trilogy he has written in recent years, Dora Nunes Gago refers to the first, where the pessanha symbolism is sought and where he denotes "the first look at Asia and Macao."
Here there is no poetry, but 24 tales, "many of them inspired by witnessed stories, heard or read in newspapers." Already the award -winning “Nomadic Words”, winner of the Grand Travel Literature Prize Maria Ondina Braga last year, contains 50 chronicles. "It was the way to find a guiding thread to unite various experiences and learning that had a conductive thread for my life."
Behold, in the last book of the trilogy, 55 poems, organized into three parts, namely “exhibitions, permanences and returns” are gathered. They are “a synthesis of all my route,” he says. “Gray Flowers” ​​is “Perhaps the most autobiographical book of the three, as it is rooted in multiple feelings, in a kind of instantaneous ones that configured my days,” says the author.
From the preface, by Maria João Cantinho, it is read that the first of the trilogy, “flowered by mistake the Brave roses” is “a book of brief stories, whose title was taken from loan to a beautiful verse (and a poem) of the melancholy Camilo Pessanha, in Clepsidra”. While "nomadic words" brings together chronic chronicles that are born "from his experience in Macao, as well as his traveler and adventurous aspect, as the Teotónio Almeida needed very praised." In turn, in the third, Dora Gago "changes the record and we find ourselves in the face of poetic and sensitive writing, built by brief poems," he reads.
Maria João Cantinho also understands that the poem “Destiny” is one of the most beautiful in “Flowers of Gray”: “In the crazy run / of the abandoned / lonely Galgo of existing, lick the wounds of death / in the skin of the poem.”
Here, it is described “poetic writing is presented as vertigo (‘ in the crazy race ’) driven by a allegorical impetus, in which the presence of death emerges”, where “fate is certainly this disadvantaged race in which death surrounds the living and only the poem can save or redeem those”, considers Maria João Cantinho.
For this, "Dora Nunes Gago's writing contains a reflective dimension, addressing topics such as the creation or passage of time, among many others, and using a rich, vocabulary and prosodic level language in the search for effects that accentuate the tension of the poem."
“Exiles”, the first part of the work, starts with “beginning”, a simple name for a short poem: “I follow the memory footprints / inscribed in the sand of time / and I am a ship / anchored without leme / no breath”. Perhaps marked by longing and distance, we find “absence”: “They dance solemn ashes / Silvando Winds of Saudade, / Heavens / Spelled / In Blood / Solitude.”
And as this book is made of comings and goings, the work ends with "return", as if it was a timeline: "Returning the house / tattooing hills and valleys / in the retina, / watering the flowers of gray / reborn / in stony cracks / of hope."
Dora Nunes Gago is a native of São Brás de Alportel and is currently a teacher at the Setúbal Polytechnic Institute. About “Nomadic Words”, the Jury of the Grand Prix of Travel Literature Maria Ondina Braga, granted by the Portuguese Writers Association (APE), considered it to be a “work of varied and rich observations concerning the places where the reports of great sensory livelihood, which do not lack the intimate look at places and people designating as 'Génie du Lieu' ”.
"In a prose of great fluidity, eavized of reflections where perceptions, memories, culture, literature and history are intersected, the author has been able to lead a reading reading from the first pages, whose rhythm and interest can maintain throughout the considerable extension of the work," said the same jury.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>LAG 2025 | Checks, economy and great bay should be sam hu fai bets</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/09/lag-2025-cheques-economia-e-grande-baia-devem-ser-apostas-de-sam-hou-fai/</link><description>The government lines for this year are presented on Monday, marking the debut of Sam Hou Fai in one of the most anticipated moments of the local political calendar. Game recipes and economic predictions should be on the table, according to José Sales Marques and Lou Shenghua. The future of pecuniary checks may be another matter to be in attention
 
Sam Hou Fai has been in the government for almost five months and is preparing to present, next Monday, his first report of the Governing Action Lines (LAG) for this year. Great expectations often reside in the amounts of pecuniary checks, the values ​​attributed to social support and other budgetary predictions, especially after the territory has been through a hard economic period with Covid-19.
LAG 2025 should focus on these themes, and Macao's integration into the various regional cooperation projects, such as Hengqin Island or the Great Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Bay. Fulfilling the annual tradition of local politics, Sam Hou Fai made the usual round of auscultations to local associations, in order to know his opinions on the main measures to take.
Listened to by HM, economist José Sales Marques expects clarity in the policies announced at the economic level. "I would like to see these LAG bring greater clarity on economic policies and the vision for the future of MSAR. I speak of structural measures that encourage the trust of the private investor, and that also realize such reforms of public administration to increase efficiency and effectiveness," he said.
Sales Marques also said that "I would like to clearly see Macao's positions and priorities in his relationship with countries and regions of the world, including measures that lead to deepen the role of Sino-Midfone and Multicultural Dialogue Platform."
Lou Shenghua, a political analyst and professor at Macao Polytechnic University (UPM), said the main ideas presented will be in accordance with what Sam Hou Fai presented in the electoral program. "The tonic can be placed in improving the effectiveness of governance, moderate economic diversification, the construction of the Hengqin cooperation zone and the issues related to the subsistence means of people," said the analyst, stressing that "citizens may be more concerned with subsistence -related issues."
And what program presented Sam Hou Fai in September last year, when it was glimpsed that he would be the only candidate for the position of Chief Executive? A program that has as its “maximum objective to meet citizens' expectations for a better life” and the “fundamental orientation of implementing the principle of a country, two systems” in a full, correct and firm way ”. The importance of national security was not forgotten, referring to the need for defense “of sovereignty, security and interests of the country's development”. About the sin, Sam Hou Fai said he wanted to erect a "macao based on the rule of law, dynamic, cultural and happy."
The then only candidate to head the government promised to improve the government's governing capacity. "We will strive to raise the capacity and level of governance of MSAR, the change in the concepts of governance, the optimization of the form of governance, the persistence of macao governance in accordance with the law, and the deepening of the reform of public administration and the legal system."
Thus, he said "optimizing forms of governance, giving greater importance to the role of advisory bodies, experts and academics, and love associations of the country and Macao, widely listening to the opinions and suggestions of various sectors, different industry branches and various social strata." It remains to be seen if the lag will bring these tin aspects to the field of actions and concrete measures.
MATE
On Monday, the agenda continues as usual in the presentation of a report of the lag. First Sam Hou Fai will go to the Legislative Assembly, from 15h, make a general presentation to the deputies of political and budgetary issues essential for this year, following a press conference.
The next day, it is a day of debate in the hemicycle on the same report, then followed the sectoral debates with all secretaries until the 30th of this month.
One of the political themes that have been in the DAY ORDER is the value of pecuniary checks and whether or not they are attributed to residents living outside Macao. There are analysts to defend the reformulation of the program, but Sales Marques recalls that "the amount expected for pecuniary checks in the budget discussion for 2025 is 10,000 patacas for permanent residents."
“Predicted budget revenues were based on calculation a gross revenue forecast of 240 billion patacas to an average of 20 billion per month. It turns out that the effective revenues obtained until the end of the first quarter of this year were short, with a deviation of less than four billion. be hit. ”
Given these less optimistic predictions, referred to by the Secretary himself for the economy and finance, Tai Kin IP last week, Sales Marques believes that, if there are adjustments in the checks, will be "small". "As for the distribution method, I predict that it remains the same," he said.
Lou Shenghua believes that "the pecuniary reimbursement plan may change." "In terms of amount, it is likely to maintain the value of ten thousand patacas per resident, but regarding the form, it can be attributed to consumer valleys," he said.
Last day 1, Secretary Tai Kin IP said the budget accounts are still short of expected. "We noticed that in the first three months of 2025 the gross revenues of the games reached 57.66 billion patacas, remaining the value almost unchanged in annual terms, not yet reaching the expected monthly average of 20 billion patacas."
Thus, it was left the warning that "this year's financial revenues may not be as optimistic as it is expected", and it is necessary to "seriously study the future economic situation and persist in the management of financial resources with prudence."
Game and other stories
Regarding the game sector, which has continued to have a predominant weight in the economy, Sam Hou Fai confirmed a month ago that concessionaires and satellite casinos have until the end of the year to prepare the transition to a subconsers' exploration model. It will be in the "hands" of the dealers to decide whether or not to explore these casinos directly.
For Sales Marques, this dossier “worries several sectors of society, not only about the use of its workers, but also for the repercussion that will close in the areas of the city where they are, especially in retail and restoration trade, small trade in general”.
Thus, "it will be prudent to avoid great shocks in the current conjuncture." "Everything will be done to regularize these units under the law in force, without provoking their immediate closure," he added.
Lou Shenghua hopes to “have room for negotiation about the distribution of revenues between the satellite casinos and the dealers”.
Despite the concerns that reside in the unemployment of these people, Sam Hou Fai advanced in March to TDM that these fears can be removed. "I know that satellite casinos workers are distributed to the game companies, so operators have the responsibility of absorbing them or having plans for these workers," he said.
Laws for I want you
Given the history of Sam Hou Fai in court, as it has presided over the court of last instance since the establishment of the MSAR, some new measures can be expected in the area of ​​law.
Sales Marques deposits expectations in the creation of new regulations “that are more facilitators to the operation of the economy”, quite “more favorable to the competitive business environment of this Great Bay region, namely as to the hiring of qualified human resources, conditions offered to their stay and that of their families and less bureaucratic administratives”.
Lou Shenghua believes it could, in fact, “pay more attention to legal reform,” although it should be in accordance with government policies and follow the pace of times, not being reformed just because yes, ”he said.</description><pubDate>2025-04-09 02:19:47</pubDate></item><item><title>Book | Mark O'Neill tells the history of Europeans in the early days of Hong Kong</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/01/livro-mark-oneill-conta-a-historia-dos-europeus-nos-primordios-de-hong-kong/</link><description>“Europeans in Hong Kong” is the 18th and new book by British writer and journalist Mark O'Neill, who lives in the neighboring region. At HM, he confesses that he began to write the history of the Irish, but the project eventually expanded. As such, it focused on the stories of Europeans who left their brand in Hong Kong, including Portuguese
 
Hong Kong, the city of banking, finance and commerce, a worldwide warehouse for centuries and a gateway to China. It has been the neighboring region throughout the time, since its institution, in 1841. Hong Kong has always been an international territory populated by Europeans of various nationalities, much more than the British who administered the territory until 1997.
It was missing to tell its story, and British author and journalist Mark O'Neill, residing in Hong Kong since the late 1970s, now has it now with “European Europeans in Hong Kong], which even includes a chapter about the Portuguese.
In another work that has just left the newsstands, the author confesses to HM who began to write the history of the Irish in Hong Kong, whose contribution to the "was huge" territory. This work was not published, being born later the idea of ​​doing something bigger.
“I chose the figures that made the greatest contributions, especially at the religious level, or teachers, writers, great figures in the business world and those whose legacies still last,” he confessed.
Mark O'Neill points out that the great contribution of Europeans in the neighboring region took place in the educational area, but not only. "The most lasting contribution was given by schools, universities, hospitals, homes of elderly, social assistance institutions and some companies. Although they are entities that are currently managed, largely, by people from Hong Kong, were founded and fueled by Europeans."
The author explains that the most impressive story associated with the legacy of the French arises on the cover of the book. "In the nineteenth century, the French nuns adopted tens of thousands of Chinese girls who had been abandoned and gave them a good life. Without them, girls would have died or worked as child labor, maids or prostitutes," he said.
Another house
Asked about the new perceptions that the book can bring to the general public, Mark O'Neill understands that he is today "familiar with the history of British in Hong Kong, but not with the history of continental Europe."
Thus, the author says he hopes that "the book will help them understand their history, especially their contribution."
In general terms, "in the early decades [of the Hong Kong Foundation], Europeans were, above all, business men and missionaries, both Catholic and Protestants." Then the region grew “as a great Asian city and, from the 1950s, the community expanded.” "Currently, we have architects, engineers, musicians, teachers, restaurant owners, doctors, lawyers, art and people experts in all the domains of life," said the author.
Another prominent figure in “Europeans in Hong Kong” is the Jesuit Hungarian Father Laszlo Ladany, considered the “China's greatest observer in the world for thirty years”, and Anders Nelson, “Swedish singer and long-standing resident in Hong Kong, well known to local inhabitants”, describes the introduction of the work.
“Most people think that Hong Kong was built by the Chinese during their 150 years of British dominance, which is not entirely accurate. As the reader will discover, many of the schools, social assistance institutions, buildings and companies in the city were founded and managed by people from Europe (defined here as 'east of calais'). They forced it, ”is described in the same introduction.
Mark O'Neill also describes that the Hong Kong cemeteries contain traces of this presence, as "Europeans have enjoyed the city and their people more than their homeland." The European presence increased in the neighboring region from 1949, when the People's Republic of China is founded, as "the new Chinese government closed the doors to foreigners, with the exception of a small number of people from other socialist countries." Thus, "eager to remain in China and in the Chinese world, many Europeans have moved from mainland China to Hong Kong," he is mentioned.
The Macaense Legacy
The fourth chapter is entirely dedicated to the Portuguese and Macaense Hong Kong community, regarded as a “pillar of society” for many years. “For 150 years, the Portuguese were, after the British, the largest non-Chinese community in Hong Kong,” reads the work, which draws the profile of five personalities and describes two social clubs where the community was.
Regarding the personalities, the example of José Pedro Braga, the first Portuguese to be part of the Legislative Council, between 1927 and 1937; Sir Roger Lobo, member of the Executive Council between 1967 and 1985; and Commander Arnaldo de Oliveira Sales, first president of the urban council between 1973 and 1981.
"The Portuguese played a key role in the government, in banks, the liberal professions and the commercial companies. They lived here for many generations. Most of the expatriates were only the time of their mission; when they renovated, departed and returned to Britain or another country in Europe. book.
Regarding the origin of this community, it is described as a “mixed race”, or macanese, but also Portuguese with Asian origins. “Its history dates back to hundreds of years, in the early days of Portuguese trade and exploitation. In the 16th century, Portugal established commercial warehouses and religious missions in Goa, Malaca, Macau and Nagasaki. The Portuguese settlers married local women, creating a mixed root population in India, Malaysia, China and Japan. In 1639, the Japanese government expelled all foreigners and foreigners and isolated the country from the rest of the world. ”
Macao emerges closely linked to this community, as it became, in the mid-16th century, “the basis of Portugal in East Asia” after the Dutch blocked Goa and won Malacca.
"The Macanese began to form as a cohesive community-sharing ties with Portugal, the Catholic religion, a common language and kitchen and a feeling of distinction from the Portuguese colonials and their Chinese neighbors. They were the only people in Macao who spoke Portuguese and Cantonese, giving them a role of intermediaries essential for the proper functioning of government and business," he is explained.
The fact that “the Hong Kong foundation has devastated the economy of Macao” made many macanese began to move from weapons and luggage to a much more brightly saving zone. After all, "just 66 kilometers away [Hong Kong] was the best deep water port in southern China within laws, administration and military protection in the largest empire in the world."</description><pubDate>2025-04-01 23:22:33</pubDate></item><item><title>AL | Sam Hou Fai launches support for birth, but warns for budget revenues</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/15/al-sam-hou-fai-lanca-apoio-a-natalidade-mas-alerta-para-receitas-orcamentais/</link><description>In his first lines of government action, Sam Hou Fai announced the creation of a new “childhood subsidy” that will assign up to 18,000 patacas per year to permanent residents under three years. However, it warned of economic difficulties
 
In the first lines and government action he presented to the population of Macau, Sam Hou Fai announced the creation of a new childhood allowance that will assign a maximum and 18,000 patacas per year to children under three years. In the Legislative Assembly, the Chief Executive revealed the creation of a new social support and the updating of others, underlined that the government places the well-being of the population as the great priority.
Although it has only mentioned the “mitigation of population concerns” such as the third priority of the government's policies, behind other aspects such as the diversification of the economy and the efficiency of governance in the MSAR, Sam ensured that the population is the first priority: “The well-being of the population is fundamental. This government will persist in placing the interests of the population first and, taking into account the subjects related to their daily life, to solve the real problems. More pressing, with a view to responding to their aspirations for a quality life, ”he promised.
As part of this policy, Sam Hou Fai has announced the support changes that are mainly intended to promote the increase in the birth rate and to support the elderly population or with special needs.
At birth, the big news was the creation of the “childhood assistance subsidy” that will assign to each permanent resident child up to three years old an amount of 1,500 patacas per month, which can reach a maximum of 18 thousand patacas per year. This incentive is added an increase of 1,082 patacas from the birth subsidy, which rises from current 5,418 patacas to 6,500 patacas. Also the marriage subsidy is increased by 78 patacas, 2,122 patacas to 2,220 patacas.

At the level of support for the elderly, the elderly subsidy is increased by 1,000 patacas, rising from the maximum annual amount of 9,000 to 10,000 patacas.
At the same time, the pension for the elderly is updated from a monthly amount of 3,740 per month to 3,900 patacas per month, a difference of 160 patacas per month.

Another of the news is an update of health valleys, which will rise to 700 patacas, when they are currently 600 patacas.
Economics warnings
At the economy level, although without ever mentioning the new trade war between the United States and China, the chief executive warned that the Economy of the MSAR will not pass unscathed, although it can count on the interior market. "We have witnessed, in recent years, the aggravation of unilateralism and protectionism, the insufficiency of dynamics prone to world economic growth, as well as the increase of unforeseen events and uncertainties," he said.
"Deep and complex changes in the internal and external environment have already manifested and will persist, so Macau, as a microeconomic strongly turned outside, could not be immune to the resulting impacts," he added. "For all this, we should not underestimate any threats and challenges, before, we must always be aware of the risks and a sense of warning, so that we are prepared to act against all potential threats," he warned.
Sam Hou Fai also acknowledged that the current revenues are below the expected and that there may be a need to have a reformulation of the mashed budget in force.
In terms of economy support, the government leader has announced a bank credit interest bonus plan for small and medium enterprises, which will allow entrepreneurs to obtain up to 4 percent of loan interest rates for three years, a maximum of 5 million patacas. The maximums of bonusted total loans cannot exceed 10 billion patacas.
Checks with “Requirements”
In yesterday's presentation, Sam Hou Fai said that the amounts paid in the pecuniary checks will remain, ensuring that the pecuniary reimbursement program should be changed, without being announced which. "After the hell of the opinions of all sectors of the company, the improvement of a monetary regime will be performed, using savings in expenses to increase the welfare of residents and promote the development of the community economy." In the same session it was mentioned that the money is attributed to residents “who meet the requirements”, so it remains to know what these requirements will be.
Focus on terrorism
In the lag presented yesterday by Sam Hou Fai National Security had a lower prominence in the face of the speeches of Ho IAT SENG. Still, it has been indicated that for this year the reformulation of the State Security Defense Commission will be studied and new laws will be thought of to combat terrorism. In the context of nationalism, framed in the chapter of national security, it was explained that the government will further support associations considered as patriotic, while events will be organized to celebrate the 80th anniversary of the War Victory against Japan.
Cash reform
At the public administration level, the Chief Executive announced that he will submit a proposal to reformulate the Institute for Municipal Affairs. The bill must enter the Legislative Assembly by the end of the year.

During Paulo Rangel's visit, it was also announced that Sam Hou Fai should visit Portugal during the summer
 
He met with Sam Hou Fai, with counselors from the Portuguese communities, associative representatives, Portuguese educational institutions and entrepreneurs. Thus was the visit of Paulo Rangel, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Portugal, in the short visit to the MSAR, which took place on Friday. There are no passages in the Portuguese School of Macau (EPM) and the Consulate General of Portugal in the territory. In the late afternoon, Paulo Rangel also moved to Hong Kong to visit the exhibition “Lusas Stories”, dedicated to the Portuguese community of the territory, patent at the Hong Kong History Museum. In China, Paulo Rangel was present at the Boao Forum in Haião.
In an interview with TDM, the minister assured that Portugal's relations with China remain good, denying that the country's position in the European Union's position (EU) can represent some kind of obstacle.
"Anyone who thinks that Portugal's presence in the EU is harmful to Portugal's relationship with China, does not realize Portugal's relationship with China and does not realize the role of Portugal in the international picture. I realize that some people do not understand, but honestly we have to see it as more value. And this is seen like this," he said.
One of the voices that criticized Portugal's position in relation to stories such as the issue of Huawei and Rede 5G was Amelia António, lawyer and president of the House of Portugal in Macau.
“My expectation is not high. I would like you minister, after visiting China, to say something friendly, as relationships have been very loose. I would like to see this relationship resumed as usual and also that we were not as followers of the EU positions, so fiercely, because we have very special interests and we have a very large Portuguese community. It should not be lost sight of, ”he told Paulo Rangel to Macao.
The EPM question
In the interview given to TDM, Paulo Rangel also commented on the issue of EPM, stressing the points that were not on the agenda, namely the works of expansion of the facilities.
"This question has not yet been addressed. There are, in fact, several issues that have to be detailed and resolved, and one or the other that have not yet been put on the table. We know that there is search for it, but and I am being totally transparent, it is a question that is not yet on the table."
According to Lusa, Paulo Rangel also announced that the government increased financial support to the EPM, returning to the legally expected level after 11 years of cuts.
"We just replaced the Portuguese contribution to the Portuguese School of Macao, which (…) had suffered a huge cut," Rangel said on Friday.
The Portuguese State holds the majority (51 percent) of the capital of the EPM foundation, but since 2014 that Lisbon only contributed with 10 percent of school expenses, a decision taken under the Portuguese financial rescue program. EPM financing “is now at legal levels again and is the first time at the end of 11 years,” he said.
Shortly thereafter, the chief of Portuguese diplomacy told reporters that "there was no reason, honestly, to have this cut and he remained." "We have increased five times this value [of EPM financing], so this is something that is highly significant from the commitment we have."
"There are governments that really give importance to Macau and China and there are others who do not give, this is something that has to be said," lamented the minister, pointing his finger at the previous executive of the Socialist Party. The replacement of financing “is undoubtedly an important help” for EPM, which Rangel described as having a key role for Portugal in Macau.
"We also have pleased ... that there have never been so many Portuguese students - and now I speak of students from the Chinese community - as there are today in multiple schools," added the leader. "It means that also the special administrative region [of Macau] has encouraged Portuguese teaching and knowledge of Portuguese, and this is something that can only bring good relations between the two sides," added Rangel.
SAM in Portugal
From the meeting with Sam Hou Fai, which also took place on Friday, some ideas and opinions on “bilateral exchange and cooperation in the judicial, economic-commercial, education, among others,” says an official note from the Social Communication Office.
Sam Hou Fai led to the meeting topics such as “the most current development of the deepened cooperation zone between Guangdong and Macau in Henqing”, and remembered that “Paulo Rangel is the first foreign ministerial guardian he receives after the executive's head of the executive, a fact that reflects the good relations between Macao and Portugal with a longtime history”.
The head of the executive also pointed out that after December 20, 1999, Macau, "with strong support from the central government, has insisted on maintaining the principle of" a country, two systems ", preserving the continental legal system, traditional culture and customs, as well as actively maintaining the connection and foster relations with Portugal."
The ruler also said that "Macao has deepened the role of bridge and platform between China and Lusophone countries, continuously boosting the establishment of friendly relationships in the various areas of bilateral cooperation."
Another novelty of this meeting was the information, advanced by Sam Hou Fai himself, which “expects to visit Portugal in the near future” without, however, a concrete date has been announced.
Rangel announced that the chief executive of Macao is expected to visit Portugal "immediately before August or in September." "There is clearly here also an alignment of the priorities that is highly symbolic," said the diplomat, on the fringes of a meeting with the Portuguese community in Macau.
Asked about the restrictions to Portuguese in accessing the resident status, Rangel said he spoke with Sam Hou Fai "on all the issues that are relevant to the relationship between Portugal and the MSAR." "But, as it is a dialogue that is underway, I have a duty to give the opportunity we can, with the questions that have been raised from one part and the other, now we have space and time to build solutions," he added.
Rangel said that the "follow -up of dialogue" with Sam Hou Fai will take place at a meeting of the Portugal -Raem Joint Commission, "which will be organized in principle in the second semester here in Macao."
Paulo Rangel also said, in an interview with TDM, that the visit of Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, president of the Portuguese Republic, “will happen a little later”, precisely due to the marking of new elections in the country. Initially, the aim was that Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa came to Macao in June to commemorate Portugal, Camões and Portuguese communities. The visit should take place in the following months of summer, predicted Paulo Rangel.
Encounters and mismatches
Paulo Rangel also had a meeting with local associative representatives, including with the Portuguese communities counselor. Francisco Mannhão, president of the Macao Retirees, Reformed and Pensioners Association (Apomac), took the opportunity to talk about the bureaucracy that still exists in the relationship with the Caixa Geral de Retirement (CGA).
"To dispatch a survival pension process takes six months and then the correspondence goes back and forth. Macao benches do not have Iban, and this, for example, delays the whole process. Whenever a process goes to CGA, they insist that they do not have the number of IBAN and NIF [Fiscal Identification Number], that most of the widows receiving survival pensions, do not have in Portugal." exemplified.
Mannão also compliments to the Portuguese politician. "For a short time he was here, he showed concern. I liked the presence of the minister." In addition, Francisco Mannão stressed that “in a good time the Portuguese government appointed Alexandre Leitão to Consul”, also recalling the good work of the previous Portuguese consul, Vítor Sereno. "The consulate has never been as well functioned as now. The criticism made to our consul are unfair. There were our associates who told me to have been admired for making a marking and was attended the next day," he said.
More bet on the language
Another important point of Rangel's visit was the promise of the reinforcement of Mandarin teaching in Portugal. "With the Chinese authorities I made a point of saying that we will be very committed to teaching Chinese in Portugal."
In the Chinese capital, Rangel met with Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, before meeting with Chinese vice-minister, Ding Xuexiang, on Hailão Island, where the Boao Forum took place.
"The situation today is much better than it was 20 years ago ... We have, in fact, a formation that we did not have at all," said Paulo Rangel. The formation of fluent people in Mandarin “is also decisive for our future”, but “it is not enough for the challenges we have ahead,” he warned.

The president of the House of Portugal in Macau associates this article with the position of Lisbon in the issue of 5G
 
It is another visit of a Portuguese ruler to Macau, but Paulo Rangel's first as Minister of Foreign Affairs of the executive of Luis Montenegro, at a time when the country is preparing to go to votes in May after the dissolution of the Assembly of the Republic.
After a journey through China, Paulo Rangel will meet with local associative leaders in order to perceive existing problems related to the Portuguese community.
At HM, Amelia António, president of the House of Portugal in Macau (CPM), argues that the difficulties of obtaining residence by Portuguese should be one of the pressing matters. “My expectation is not high. I would like the Minister, after visiting China, to say something friendly, as relationships have been very loose. I would like to see this relationship resumed as usual and also that we were not as followers of the positions of the European Union (EU) so fierce, because we have very special interests and we have a very large Portuguese community. of the EU, and this should not be lost sight of. ”
Amelia António highlights the position that Portugal adopted in the case of Rede 5G and Huawei, but also “the development that occurred in relation to the coming of Portuguese to Macau, subject to Blue Card”. “I have the feeling that everything comes following this EU policy against China. Portugal must have a position to safeguard these interests.”
Speaking to Lusa, the official made similar complaints. "We are here, we suffer the consequences of these relationships [between Portugal and China], good or bad. We had very close relations for a long time, which changed with Covid. I have not seen things again as they were, and I think it was important that Mr. Minister explains what is the position," he said that Portugal does not have to "align faithfully with everything in Europe and, above all,"
Before the pandemic, he recalled the official, there was “permanent communication” and “much exchange” between the Portuguese and Chinese authorities.
Today is noticeable a “hardening regarding the Portuguese” in macao immigration, Maria Amelia António declared, but not being able to affirm categorically whether the position is related to “this removal” between China and the West.
Macao authorities have not accepted new requests for residence in the territory for Portuguese for the “exercise of specialized technical functions”, allowing for justification of family reunion or previous connection to the territory.
Also Miguel de Senna Fernandes, lawyer and president of the Macanese Association, regrets the situation of the assignment of the BIR. "I would like the government of the Portuguese Republic to take into account the Portuguese community in the territory, which faces some difficulties regarding the possibility of obtaining the residence. It is a topic that may be addressed between the Portuguese State and the MSAR, to be greater flexibility to allow the Portuguese community to have greater accessibility to the right of residence, as existed before."
For the causal, "Misrere does not have to randomly assign more homes, but it is something that corresponds only to my desire." "Of course, that Mand has its reasons and Macau is different, and there are other communities that are interested in staying in the territory. The Portuguese community, due to greater historical connection that has to the territory, is still another community, among others. As Portuguese we are, we would like to have greater flexibility," he admitted.
The EPM case
Another point that Amelia António and Miguel de Senna Fernandes want to see approached on Paulo Rangel's visit is the situation at the Portuguese School of Macau (EPM) and the lack of teachers. "I think you should see the school and make a little more awareness of the situation, although the EPM is not from its area. As a member of the government it is important to realize that this situation has been poorly conducted, because in Portugal has been gone after some conversations that have little to do with reality and only harm. If he realized a little more of the situation, it would not be bad," said Amelia António.
Already Miguel de Senna Fernandes says that it is time for the Portuguese executive to stop looking at the school as another Portuguese educational institution abroad. “EPM is always a recurring question, and it all depends on how the Portuguese state looks at school: if you look like any Portuguese school spread around the world, this is a mistake. There is no possible comparison, because the EPM emerged in a very special context.”
However, to Lusa agency, Jorge Neto Valente, president of the EPM foundation, was categorical: the school “has nothing to peddling” to Paulo Rangel. "There is no whimper, we have nothing to do, we have nothing to demand, everything is normal," he said.
The lawyer and president of the founding of the EPM said Rangel hoped "take a correct perception of the school, what it is for, the goals he has." “It's always good to have direct knowledge, it's much better than in papers,” said Neto Valente. "We have to account that the school is fulfilling the role that is expected to play," added the leader, recalling that the Portuguese State holds the majority of the capital of the EPM foundation.
Still on the EPM universe, Miguel de Senna Fernandes, who also leads the Macanese Instruction Promoting Association (Apim), suggested a close look at the Chinese teaching in the EPM.
"I have always advocated that Cantonese must have status. Because students, when they leave school, are in a singing world. This with all the merit that can have teaching in Mandarin," he said. "It is an issue that should be posed. It is a delicate question, because we are talking about an official language," he added, referring to Mandarin, an official language in China.
The official, also vice president of the EPM foundation, admits that this is not a question that generates consensus -"many parents do not agree with this view" -but stresses that the learning of Cantonese "is a vehicle of integration", as it is the dominant language in the territory.
Yes to the electronic vote
Also to Lusa several associative leaders defended the transition to electronic vote, stressing embarrassment in the current options for emigration. "As long as it is not advanced without being tested, I am fully in agreement. The future is this and we have to point out," said the president of the CPM.
In legislative elections, the Portuguese abroad have the possibility of exercising the right to vote in person or by post, while in presidential and European, the vote is in person.
In choosing correspondence, the government sends the address indicated in the census notebook the voting report and two envelopes, one of green and one white, which must be returned to the Ministry of Internal Affairs after filling.
The electronic option “can offer greater security”, defended Maria Amelia António. "With the consulates to work badly, in order to have few employees, with their work, and in countries where they are far from the places where people live, it is very difficult for people to vote personally. There has also been a lot of failures in the guarantees of receiving vote [via mail]," he added.
The electronic choice is a longstanding claim of the Portuguese Communities Council (CCP). Rui Marcelo, president of the Regional Council of the Portuguese Communities of Asia and Oceania, who has a meeting scheduled with the Portuguese Foreign Minister, said that the “theme is already part of the CCP agenda“ a few years ago and has been approached several times and with several governments ”.
"With the advancement of technology and the possibility of implementing security systems that can ensure vote safety - which happens today through the provision of services in other areas of the government also - the conditions are created so that we can eventually evolve into a situation where it can obviously be a complement, but not a substitute," he noticed.
In February, the Portuguese Parliament approved a resolution proposed by the PSD to test the electronic vote in emigration. The President of the Portuguese Republic, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, suggested in December a pilot electronic voting experience in the circles of emigration.
The head of Portuguese diplomacy arrives in Macau today after passing by Beijing and Haikou, in the province of Haião, where he was present at the Boao Forum.
In Macao, Paulo Rangel has scheduled meetings with the head of local government, Sam Hou Fai, as well as the counselors of the Portuguese communities, associative representatives, educational institutions and entrepreneurs. Visit the EPM and the Consulate General of Portugal in the territory.
In the late afternoon, MNE goes to Hong Kong to visit “Lusas Stories”, an exhibition dedicated to the Portuguese community at the Hong Kong History Museum.

Francisco Mannão competes again for president, Jorge Fão for the General Assembly and Daniel Mendonça to the Fiscal Council. Mannão suggests the creation of a “satellite city” only for the elderly and calls for pensions update
 
Increasing the elderly pensions would be "gold on blue." In the meantime, Francisco Mannão continues to fight for this and other flags designed to improve the lives of older residents, again leading the candidate list for the management of Apomac - Macao's retirees, retirees and pensioners association, which take place tomorrow.
The list is unique and the faces have little or nothing difference from previous years: Jorge Fão continues to lead the General Assembly, while Daniel Mendonça competes for the Fiscal Council. There is only one new name in the position of Member of the Fiscal Council.
"It is very difficult to find people available to do this volunteer work. Jorge and I would like to find someone who could replace us, because we are for a long time in this association. We are elderly, but we have energy. As long as we have strength on the legs to walk, we are walking and trying to do our best by Apomac," Francisco Mannhão told HM.
Jorge Fão highlights the fact that Apomac has been about to celebrate 25 years since the foundation, noting that there is, in fact, a leadership problem that if not solved can culminate in the disappearance of the association. "We are not seeing the emergence of another list of younger and younger people, so that we offer our services for another term and so on, as far as possible. There is a leading problem at Apomac and in other associations. The Apomac issue is more serious, because we have been standing for 24 years, we will celebrate in May."
Satellite city and pensions
In a list that will lead the association by 2028, the motto is “we are elderly but energetic”, reads in the action program.
At the first point, it is indicated that the team's objective is "to monitor the government's policy and the Macau Foundation, with a view to adjusting the needs of our action program throughout this three -year term." In addition, they intend to "provide the necessary support to members so that they can enjoy the benefits awarded by the Government of MSAR and other official entities."
One of the requests on the list to the government led by Sam Hou Fai is the increase in pensions, which is currently 3,740 patacas. It would be for the association would be the update to four thousand monthly patacas.
"It would be good for the government of MSar to pay the pension monthly to the elderly, the pecuniary compensation and the old age, instead of having to wait every three months to receive the pension for the elderly, seven months to receive the pecuniary compensation and ten months to receive old age. Hm.
Another idea left by Francisco Mannão is from the construction of a satellite city only for elderly dwellings, in what would be a larger project against residence for the elderly already built by the executive, in the area of ​​sand black.
"I liked the Government of MSA to build a satellite city for the elderly. I worry a lot because there are many living alone, and with the construction of this satellite city they no longer have problems of loneliness, and could live with each other, and can provide services common to all. The construction of high buildings is good, but for the elderly it is not that good," he defended.
Still, Mannão assures that being elderly in Macau is much easier than in Hong Kong. “Nowadays, in Macau, the elderly live quite well, because there are many social support attributed to this group of people.
Sufficient resources
Asked about the essential points to make Apomac a larger association, Francisco Mannhão says that “they have enough”, but lames the closure of the clinic where they were provided to the elderly health care.
"Of course we had the plan to be able to develop our headquarters more, but due to the lack of the allowance we had to end our clinic. In this context, we had a program to develop this area that had to be abandoned, and that would benefit our associates. We tried to organize more lectures about health, because the senior group needs to know more about disease and health affairs, something that can generate great concerns."
In political terms, Francisco Mannhão, who was even a candidate for deputy to the Legislative Assembly, says that Apomac is an advocate of the principle of “one country, two systems”, thought by Beijing to the regions of Macau and Hong Kong. "We agree with the national policy of 'a country, two systems', so that Macau can be a paradise for us. So far we have been quite well in Macau, we have no problems, but we would like this principle to continue."
A lot of bureaucracy
One of the services provided by Apomac goes through bureaucratic support to the elderly in communication with the General Retirement Caixa (CGA), in the case of former civil servants who receive the reform of Portugal, or the Macao Pension Fund.
"The communication with CGA has improved a little, but the bureaucratic part is still very difficult to deal with on the part of our associates. Not long ago one of our associates has waited more than three years for an amount of an amount that was improperly charged," said Francisco Mannão.
Jorge Fão, in turn, stressed that Apomac is also popular with non -partners, including from the Chinese community, to treat various issues, such as requests for subsidies or funeral -related paperwork.
Still looking at the Action program, Apomac's list also aims to “organize more sightseeing tours to mainland China, making known its culture and success of the country”, as well as the promotion of “more coexistence, so that members join periodically”. Much sought after by the dining service, since in Apomac some dishes of macanese gastronomy can be eaten, the list wants to "improve the management of the canteen whenever possible."
Asked if many elderly from Macau want to pass the renovation in China one day, at a time when regional integration is increasingly a reality, Francisco Mannão admits yes, although many “prefer to stay in the territory, as they have their life rooted here, being used to the uses and customs of Macao”. "The Government of MSA has been doing a lot of work so that they can join the great bay," he said.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>COVER CLASS | Sam hu fai expects “consensus” to decide</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/15/cheque-pecuniario-sam-hou-fai-espera-consenso-para-decidir/</link><description>There may be changes in the pecuniary reimbursement program, but it is not known when or how. Sam Hou Fai said it was necessary more consensus in society, but indicated that part of the budget value for the check can be applied to the local economy
 
The pecuniary reimbursement program will be changed, but Sam Hou Fai was no use yesterday, at the Press Conference on the Governing Action Lines Report (LAG) for this year, no details on what this change will be, regarding formats, values ​​and if residents living outside Macao will continue to receive support.
In order to know what will happen is necessary consensus, he said. "I can't respond more detailed about the [check assignment] conditions. At this time, the government's goal is to give 10,000 patacas to permanent residents and 6,000 for non-permanent. For more details I have to have the consensus of society," he said.
Sam Hou Fai left, however, some considerations about any formats to be adopted by the authorities. "We have been this plan for 17 years, and if we keep it in old format, or if it will be necessary to reform, it depends on the consensus we get in society. We can deposit the money in the bank or use a certain amount to inject the economy, so that it will be more dependent on the real life situation."
The chief executive pointed out that, in budgetary terms, “this year will not be easy”, as “very high regular expenses, of 150 billion, and tax revenues of the game of the order of 93.1 billion are foreseen. In addition, the ruler recalled the highest stability of the current inflation rate in 2008, when the pecuniary reimbursement program was created.
"I remember that in 2008 the financial crisis and the inflation rate were issues faced at the time. The inflation rate was 9.4 percent, but now it is more relieved. The pecuniary checks are a measure of support and not regulated by law. In society there have been voices that this plan has a part that is not fair and has to change," he said.
“Because it is an annual measure, it is necessary to launch the administrative regulation, and if not released, it is a sign that there will be no cash checks. When I perform the regulation I will take into account the different social situations. I have only four months as chief executive and need to hear more opinions. If we keep the model of the ten thousand patacas is easy, because we have residents working in the large bay. 183 days, continue to have support. ”
Dwelling
Asked about the management of economic housing, Sam Hou Fai made it clear that the government will only complete the fractions that are under construction and suspend new projects, given the reduction of demand from residents.
"There is a slowdown due to economic adjustment after pandemic and the price of housing in neighboring regions. Currently, ten thousand fractions are under construction, whose work ends in 2026, and the remaining projects are suspended. We will not plan to resume the works, because economic housing is something that is related to the supply of land and the private market. assured.
Remembering the current international economic conjuncture, Sam Hou Fai said that "this is not the right time to decide the construction of more economic housing."
Yes, there may be an adjustment so that families can change home depending on the needs. "We will study mechanisms so that households have other options. Singles can already have a family and need another type of house. We think more about families on waiting list, ensure a balance and ponder various situations," he said.
Intermediate housing is not even mentioned in this lag report. "We do not mention this plan because of the economic situation of Macau, because it takes a balance between private housing, intermediate and economic. The demand for economic housing has lowered," he said.
Taxis like “Mark Six”
Regarding entry into the platform market like Uber or Chinese Didi, Sam Hou Fai promised to study “a platform to call taxis”, admitting the lack of offer on holidays and weekends.
“During my campaign I talked to foreign trade chambers who told me that taking a taxi in Macau is as difficult as winning Mark Six.
Tourism | Sam Hou Fai wants more flights abroad
Sam Hou Fai also commented on the future official visit to Portugal, also referring to the possibility of moving to Spain “to start exchanges”. "Our secretary has recently been moved to Spain to participate in a conference of great wingspan, and we will develop the projects in this direction, integrating ourselves in the Great Bay and Hengqin," said the ruler, explaining that more connection flights to other markets, especially Asian, is necessary. "Southeast Asia is a very important market. For Portugal the situation is more complicated in terms of flights, but for Southeast Asia is possible. We can encourage the creation of more flights to these countries."
Portugal | Sam Hou Fai visit after the legislatures
Sam Hou Fai gave more data about his official trip to Portugal, the first of his term. “I hope the visit will happen after LAG, in the first half, perhaps after the legislative elections [on May 18], when the situation is more stable. Then it will be an opportune moment for the visit that is a good testimony of the good relations between Macau and Portugal.” Asked about the Portuguese's difficulties in obtaining the residence, Sam Hou Fai said he contacted Secretary Wong Sio Chak on the matter. "I was told that there was no change in the administrative regulation, and I noticed that, according to the Basic Law, the rights remain unchanged. We have Portuguese jurists working in the government and doctors, and also at the Portuguese Macao School there are teachers. We have no problem."</description><pubDate>2025-04-15 05:42:08</pubDate></item><item><title>Press | AJM concerned with lack of communication</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/14/imprensa-ajm-preocupada-com-falta-de-comunicacao/</link><description>The Macao Journalists Association indicates that Sam Hou Fai has implemented a new communication model, which is essentially from preventing the rulers from being the target of questions by the media
 
The Macao Journalists Association (AJM) is concerned about Sam Hou Fai's policy and communication, which accuses that "significantly reduced the number of opportunities for journalists to directly interview the chief executive, secretaries and other rulers." The position was taken through a statement issued yesterday, where it is pointed out that 90 percent of government information result from communications, without any chance of raising questions.
"AJM is seriously concerned about the fact that such a passive and regressive communication approach can become the new normal," he was nominated. “Once again, we appeal to the Government of Misrem that honor his promise of respect for press freedom, taking concrete measures: dialogue with the public and the media with more confidence, so that the community has a better understanding of their policy and vision,” was asked.
AJM also regrets that journalists have ceased to be invited to cover some events that were normally covered, such as official visits to the deepened cooperation zone between Guangdong and Macao, or traditional visits by the Chief Executive during the fourth day of the Lunar New Year. In relation to the latter, the association indicates that the government only invited “two media” with connections close to the executive.
Irrational refusal
In the statement, the AJM also addresses the situation of the media in places that are being barred from the press conferences organized by the government.
"The government continues to refuse, irrationally, that local monthly magazines and the media in line make it covered some types of official events. Namely, these exclusions often occur at events involving high employees," he was criticized. “The Social Communication Office has been trying to justify these discriminatory practices with unconvincing explanations, such as the 'limited space' available at various event places to accommodate the press, and even advised journalists to 'watches the event' transmission 'instead of personally attending. Such answers raise serious doubts about the integrity of employees and their understanding of the role of journalism, and reflect a lack of knowledge of the rules, International for an open government, eventually undermining the credibility and public image of the MSAR, ”was defended.
The Association thus asks the Executive to respect the Press Law: “AJM reiterates that what journalists need is neither discourses nor pressuated press, but of adequate mechanisms for performing reports on site, where journalists can listen to the voices of all stakeholders, interact directly with the decision makers and obtain a clear understanding of the logic and guidance of current public policies”, was published.</description><pubDate>2025-04-14 14:29:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Tariffs | Authorities accompany impact on tourism</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/14/tarifas-autoridades-acompanham-impacto-no-turismo/</link><description>Donald Trump's fares do not yet decrease the optimism of tourism services in the face of the number of tourists to reach the MSAR. However, if the situation changes, the authorities are ready to respond with other forms of promotion
 
Macau's Director of Tourism Services (STD), Maria Helena de Senna Fernandes, said the region is aware of the potential impact on the confidence of the Chinese tourists of the tariffs imposed by the United States.
United States President Donald Trump announced a 90-day suspension of what he called “reciprocal tariffs,” including a 10 percent base tariff for all countries except for China, which imposed total 125 percent tariffs. However, yesterday, it was made public that several countries and regions will not be affected by tariffs.
“At the moment we are observing what is happening. Of course we have to always be very attentive,” admitted Senna Fernandes.
Hours earlier, the Macao Study Center and the Department of Economics of the University of Macao (one) rode the forecast for the region's economic growth in 2025 to 6.8 percent, 1.1 percentage points than in the previous forecast, made in January.
Project coordinator and economist Kwan Fung said the low review is due to the decline in the consumption of visitors and the "US world tariffs," something that "has an indirect impact on Macao's economy."
Kwan said the rates will "affect the growth of all economies, especially the consumption of mainland tourists."
Macau Chan Chi Shing's study center has warned that tariffs will have a “huge impact on the Chinese economy” and may force many factories and companies to close doors, which would lead fewer people to visit the region.
 
Analyze
The STD director said that "not yet" fears a reduction in the number of tourists in Macao, but admitted that "the situation can change."
"If necessary, we have to adjust our promotion. So far, we are continuing with our promotion, which we had already planned," explained Senna Fernandes.
The new government leader, Sam Hou Fai, will present today its first lines of government action for the year 2025.
But Senna Fernandes said that in the tourism sector the priority will continue to be “capturing international tourists”, participating in fairs abroad and organizing activities in the territory.
The STD director recalled that Macau will host in June the semi -semi -sectional meeting of the European Confederation of Travel Agency Associations and Tourist Operators and, in December, the Annual Congress of the Portuguese Association of Travel and Tourism Agencies (APAVT).
APAVT is still organizing a European delegation, with “about 20 people”, which will participate in the 13th International Expo of Tourism (Industry) of Macao (Mite), April 25 to 27, said Senna Fernandes.
Portugal will have its own space in Mite, which will also include, for the first time, the “Coffee Station” section, to “highlight the characteristics of Portuguese -speaking countries,” said the leader.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>USA | Operators can be required to sell casinos</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/14/eua-operadoras-podem-ser-obrigadas-a-vender-casinos/</link><description>An analyst of the game told Lusa that China could force US operators to sell casinos in Macao, in retaliation, if Washington Force the sale of Tiktok and ports on the Panama Canal
Game consultant Igamix founder Ben Lee expressed fear on the impact of “current friction” between China and the United States due to the Tiktok video platform and the ports operated by the Hong Kong Ck Hutchison group in Panama.
"If China adopts the same retaliation strategy it has been employing," the possibility that US game companies are forced to sell operations in Macau to Chinese entrepreneurs "go up some levels," Ben Lee said. "I think after the US threatening to remove the Chinese actions from the bags," everything is on the table, "added the Igamix analyst, citing the secretary of the Treasury, citing the secretary of the Treasury, American.
On Wednesday, Scott Bessent, in an interview with Fox Business broadcaster, refused to remove the possibility of forcing Chinese companies to abandon the United States bags: "This decision will be from President Trump."
Creditsights' executive director Nicholas Chen recalled Lusa that new concessions can be terminated “by threat to national or mashed security” or “reasons of public interest”. "However, what would constitute such a threat was not explicitly defined by the authorities," said Creditsights expert, who is part of the Fitch Financial Notation Agency group.
"We have not seen any nomination, to date, that the governments of Macao or China will be aiming at US -based Macao game operators for national security reasons," Chen added. On the other hand, he admitted to being worrying in February in Macao as a "foreign opponent" of the United States, imposing restrictions on investment by local companies.
Larger fish
Vitaly Umansky, an analyst at the Seaport Research Partners consultancy company, told Lusa to be “quite skeptical” about any risks to Macau. "There are much larger targets to hunt in China if China really wanted to score a position," said the expert. Chinese authorities “have been after a variety of US companies in mainland China, who believe they are sensitive points for the Beijing government, especially technology and health,” he recalled.
Already Ben Lee believes that, instead of changing the terms of the concessions, the Macao government could introduce new laws “that restrict repatriation” or money transfers from local subsidiaries to mother companies in the United States. Vitaly Umnsky doubts that this could happen, warning that Macau could lose the image as "a suitable environment for investments from abroad entrepreneurs."
Vitaly Umansky is sure that the operators “will invest everything they have promised,” but admitted that there is doubts about “when it will be invested and what”. "There have been numerous obstacles. The [Macao] government has been slow in project approval and has not made available more land to be developed," he lamented.</description><pubDate>2025-04-14 13:10:20</pubDate></item><item><title>Alert for lower consumption of tourists with devaluation of Renminbi</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/11/alerta-para-menor-consumo-de-turistas-com-desvalorizacao-do-renminbi/</link><description>The president of the Tourist Industry Association, Andy Wu, estimates that the consumption of tourists visiting Macau may be reduced due to the devaluation of Renminbi. The position of the representative and entrepreneur of the sector arises following the recent breach of the Renminbi exchange rate, which has reached the lowest point since 2010, leading to the US dollar indexed currencies, such as Pataca and the Hong Kong dollar, become more expensive in the exchange rate. In the background, the currency front in the Washington and Beijing trade war made Macau even more expensive for Chinese tourists. According to yesterday's exchange rate a Renminbi was worth 1.09 Patacas.
However, Andy Wu faces the volume of tourists verified during the prolonged weekend of the Cheng Ming holiday as a good indicator that the number of visitors, which was above 130,000 a day, is not being affected by the trade war.
Speaking to the newspaper or Mun, the associative leader added that Macau, as a tourist city, always faces foreign exchange variables that influence the local economy on a large scale. As such, at this time, Chinese tourists can adopt a more prudent posture when opening their wallet.
The official highlights the increase in pressure on the turnover of the retail sector sector, which has faced a deep crisis since the end of the pandemic, forcing various support measures launched by the government.
On the other hand
Another possible hard blow to Macao's economy, originated by the devaluation of Renminbi, is the fact that products, travel and stays in China have become cheaper for residents of Macau and Hong Kong.
Regarding Easter holidays and Labor Day at the end of April and early May, Andy Wu expects Hong Kong tourists to compensate for the possible lack of visitors from the interior of China, where Easter is not celebrated and is not a holiday.
However, May 1st is a golden week with five days of holidays in China. During this period, Andy Wu foresees the annual increase of visitors compared to the same period as 2024.</description><pubDate>2025-04-11 17:21:20</pubDate></item><item><title>Economy | Growth reviewed down to 6.8%</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/11/economia-crescimento-revisto-em-baixa-para-68/</link><description>The Macao Macroeconomic Research Group foresees that the territory will suffer from Donald Trump's fares, not directly, but because they can lead to interior tourists to control the University of Macao (one) yesterday has made a low overview of gross domestic growth forecast to 6.8 percent. The review was made to take into account the new barriers to world trade, and, in particular, against China, imposed by the United States.
Previously, the forecast of the Macao Macroeconomic Research Group foresaw a 7 percent growth of gross domestic product throughout this year. According to the newspaper or Mun, in the presentation of the forecast, which took place yesterday, Kwan Fung, leader of the group, admitted that this forecast is "relatively conservative".
The academic also explained that the review is due to the fact that the US tariff imposition policy contributes to a reduction in the volume of trade worldwide and will affect the growth of the world economy. In this scenario, Kwan acknowledges that it is inevitable that the MSAR economy be affected by these developments.
However, according to the academic, the “direct” impact on local economy will be “relatively small”, because tariffs have as its main target the market of goods, a type of trade regarded as “reduced” in the MSAR.
Casinos invest less
The researchers also explained that the effect of tariffs will be felt in the masters directly, due to the impact on the interior economy.
Therefore, investigators have foreseeing consequences as a lower consumer capacity of the Chinese population, which with less money, will spend less on travel to Macao. By this way, Macau's macroeconomic research group admits that Macao residents can also suffer from the consequences.
According to the Chinese channel of Radio Macau, Kwan Fung also stated that the rates will have an impact on game dealers, which should be felt at the willingness to invest. On the other hand, the academic acknowledged that concessionaires may become less attractive to investors.
In the forecast of growth, researchers were based on a scenario in which service exports will grow 6.8 percent throughout the year, private consumption 3.8 percent and there will be an inflation 0.7 percent.
At the level of unemployment, academics expect a general rate of 1.7 percent, with unemployment among residents to be 2.3 percent. At the same time, current administration current revenues of the 116.8 billion Patacas are expected.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Mud market | Retched contest to assign stalls</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/09/mercado-da-taipa-arrancou-concurso-para-atribuir-bancas/</link><description>Yesterday the public tender for 20 lightweight sales, coffee, cultural and creative products in the mud market began.

The biggest challenge of the chief executive is to build a positive narrative about Macao in the government line report, so that citizens can have a feeling of gain, happiness and security.
Telling a story well and doing something well done are two distinct concepts of two different levels. For example, when a seller tries a customer to buy a car, he will discuss the superiority of quality and vehicle performance that, in addition, will be very appealing. However, when the buyer finally uses the car may see that what the seller said was a beautiful story. The saying “practice is the only test to the truth” remains valid.
I appreciate the honesty of the current secretary for the economy and finance, which made it clear that the revenues of the 2025 fiscal year may not come to expect expectations. After Macao was released from the Covid-19 pandemic, the full recovery of his economy is dependent on the efforts of the current RAE government.
Faced with the current situation of Macao, the RAE government cannot use the apologies of the complexity and motility of the international scenario and the existence of several unstable internal factors to dodge their responsibilities. After all, under the guiding principle “Macau governed by patriots”, the weak governance of Macau is a problem of those in power. Thus, I hope that in your first report of the governance line lines, Sam Hou Fai can really outline a way to carry out the main points proposed in its political program during the election campaign, including: “work, oriented to people's subsistence”, “distribution of revenue,“ urban development, oriented to people's subsistence ”and“ safeguarding safety, crucial to people ”.
By effectively using Macao's institutional advantages as a platform for business opportunities, the MSAR government can write a new chapter in the practice of “a country, two systems” and transform Macau into a happy city.
The presentation of the “Report of the Governing Action Lines for the Financial Year 2025” is of great importance to Macau. The 15th National National Games of R.P. of China are also an important event of this year, which Macau will organize and host in conjunction with Guangdong and Hong Kong, but even more important will be the elections for the 8th Legislative Assembly of MSAR, scheduled for September 14.
As in 2025 there will be elections for the Hong Kong Legislative Council and the Legislative Assembly of MSAR, it is important to be successful, particularly the choice of MSAR Legislative Assembly, elected by direct suffrage, to demonstrate the success of the realization of the concept “a country, two systems”, which “Hong Kong is governed by Hong Kong people”. and "Macao is governed by Macao people" and by the guiding principle "Hong Kong governed by Patriots" and "Macau ruled by patriots." The story about the elections for the 8th Legislative Assembly of MSAR should not only be well told, but must also be well executed to obtain the confidence of the central government.
Because you receive a concert does not mean that the public will attend, because it depends on who acts. For the election of deputies for direct suffrage to the 2025 Legislative Assembly, I provide for more than 14 lists of applications, considering the efforts currently developed by various associations and the inclusion of list of candidates for the election of deputies for direct suffrage to the 2021 Legislative Assembly that were not elected. Permanent residents of the Special Administrative Region of Macau have the right to elect and be elected, under the law. These rights are guaranteed to them by the Macao Basic Law.</description><pubDate>2025-04-11 18:26:14</pubDate></item><item><title>Order and Chaos do not exist</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/09/a-ordem-e-o-caos-nao-existem-2/</link><description>(Continuation of the edition of April 3)
America, China and Russia fear for their existence. In these degrees of self -conscience, it is only considered alive who is a great power. If we are reduced to a lower level, we are tempted to commit suicide (experienced sweetness of the Soviet Union). We let ourselves go. Hence the "great war" in several warm or warm theaters that if not suspended will become "total". The disorder opens holes that invite the ambitious. Old empires already diagnosed as being irreversible disarmament (Turkey, Japan), former colonies that rediscover as civilized states (India/Bharat), humiliated and offended nations due to the infringement of their neighbors (eg Poland).
While the protagonists in the day before yesterday are struggling from the fake penultimate hegemony to the false couple France-Germany, confined to "Simul Stabunt Simul Cadent." The waves of chaos swallow neutral or neglected lands reduce the distances between the “three large”, elbow the elbow in the seas of China, Ukraine, soon in the arctic. The hegemonic transition flows from America to chaos. And then it will remain for a long time. A rival colossus does not dissolve overnight, especially if it is able to drag the rest of the world to the disaster. When your time comes, your last wish will be to prevent others from occupying your throne.
America is fighting with itself. Epic conflict, to which the esoteric verses of Theodor Däbler, Austrian of Trieste, which states that "the enemy is the figure of our own matter will apply/ And he will pursue us, and we to him, to the end." In the struggle for survival, America knows that its inner evil is healed towards the world, but only after restoring the natural order of things. We, Europeans ahead, the others behind or against. The new winning combination of uninhibited post liberal elites and techniques, anarchive hybrids, is convinced of this, reinforced by the vindictive enthusiasm of the middle-classes frustrated by globalization, the “invasion” of non-assimilated allergen in the WASP canon and the decline of their own lifestyle. This strange alliance found in Donald Trump his exuberant champion.
Prophet of the “common sense”. Brutal in logic and gestures. Incarnation of the “terrible simplifier”, the ideal type of demagogue violating rules evoked with horror by Swiss historian Jakob Burckhardt in the late nineteenth century. Inspired by the Republic of Plato would say that "justice is but the benefit of the strongest." Baptize itself as a "very stable genius." Chosen by God, who diverted the bullet with which the satanic "deep state" wanted to liquidate him. The story will say. However, let us notice that there is genius in its terribly simplified actions. To bring to the letter. The first act of the second Trump, subversive and man of the order, is very scenic. Frantic. America's disease requires dangerous healing. A nearly 80 -year -old president, with only four years in office ahead, starting from the principle that he will not eventually reinterpret the Constitution, inventing a third one has to worry.
He starts from where he can reap immediate rewards that is the American myth. His narrative extols the will and, therefore, the certainty of being great again. For Trump, wanting is power. Wanting is dreaming and dreaming. Reveal the “manifest fate 2.0” to its compatriots. New border required. Operational objective. Ergo, the mastery of the space to control the earth and to snatch the audience with the Martian legend told by Musk; Supremacy reinforced in AI to govern cyberspace, lead the technological revolution, reinvent the industry on unpublished, perhaps fantastic principles avoiding discovering them too early so as not to alienate the workers; Delete the Ukrainian and Middle East fires and prepare the wars of the future whose dawn we can barely glimpse.
Possibly without combating them, thanks to the restoration of the lost deterassion. The alpha and the omega of this narrative is the quick ads through social networks. Technology stars preside over the chapters of myth. It is the generals who lead the respective avant -garde on the technological fronts of strategic value. Almost autonomous powers that Trump intends to explore, control and master as they penetrate informally in the state's ruins. Announces a battle between Trumpian tribes by public and private skills and powers. Better, public-private, given the overlap of functions and responsibilities. Game without rules. Sooner or later, the confrontation between Trump and Musk, the most celebrated and powerful of the technological border oligarchs, which the president kicks or frustrated, yes, day no, seems inevitable.
A decisive confrontation, because without the technological star the Trumpian dream would become a nightmare. Trump, the revolutionary, rare but true where an individual's success or failure will affect the fate of the nation and the world. The proof of how deep and structural is the emotional collapse of Americans. The revolt of a court of filthy rich, bored by money and energized by power, destroyed the centered exhausted stablishment. The holograms of the Biden administration are enjoying an unmerited rest. While federal and blue bureaucracies are involved in a party guerrilla war with the support of the hard line. A low intensity civil war. The New York tycoon wants to cut the Gordian knot that is strangled to America which is the incompatibility between exceptionalism and universalism.
Complexio Oppositorum as he called Jung for containing the opposites within himself and enrolled by the founding parents in the genetic code of stars and stripes, which made the United States a unique specimen in the potential of the powers. Making America big again means opting for exceptionalism rather than universalism. Establish yourself unsurpassed at the top of the world as it is, and not redeem it as it should be. If they want to reaffirm themselves as number one, keeping the Chinese at a distance, they cannot consume in endless, often lost and, at best, repressed wars.
Nor turn other tyrannies into democracies, violate tribes into nations, transmute other people's misery into prosperity at the expense of their own half-lives.</description><pubDate>2025-04-09 23:53:25</pubDate></item><item><title>The psychology of attraction at first sight</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/09/a-psicologia-da-atracao-a-primeira-vista/</link><description>"Attraction at first sight" is a phenomenon that fascinates everyone. The romantic comedies portray her as an instant and uncontrollable moment between two people. It is now necessary to unravel the possible explanations behind this phenomenon, resorting to two major schools of thought: cognitive psychology-which develops empirical methodologies to test hypotheses on the subject-and the psychodynamic approach-that works with interpretative bases. Both perspectives build metaphors that help us interpret these processes. Thus, we can oscillate between two proposals: will at first glance be a product of deeply rooted unconscious mechanisms or, on the contrary, a posteriori romantic construction, based on sensory and cognitive processes?
Cognitive psychology suggests that "attraction at first sight" can result from rapid processing of sensory and emotional information. The human brain is programmed to recognize standards and categorize information efficiently, allowing us to evaluate someone in fractions of second, based on facial traits, expressions or body language. Studies on social perception confirm that we formulate immediate judgments about others. From a biological point of view, this phenomenon may be linked to activation of the dopaminergic system, responsible for the regulation of pleasure and reward. When we find someone we consider attractive, the brain releases dopamine, triggering a desire for proximity. In addition, investigation into pheromonas indicate that we are unconsciously attracted by partners whose immune system complements ours, favoring genetic diversity in descent.
On the other hand, the psychodynamic approach, rooted in Sigmund Freud's psychoanalysis, explains the attraction at first sight through unconscious mechanisms. From this perspective, past experiences - especially those of childhood - shape our standards of attraction. When we feel instantly attracted to someone, it may be because this person acts memories or emotions associated with primary linking figures such as parents or caregivers. Attraction does not focus on the other as a real person, but in the way he resonates within our unconscious structure of desire. The other can symbolize something we lack, something interdict or an emotional issue not yet resolved. This mechanism, known as projective identification, explains how we can feel a strong attraction to someone who unconsciously represents significant parts of our psychic history. According to this theory, we rarely fall in love with those who really are, but by the way we project in it our unresolved emotional needs. The attraction is therefore a meeting of unconscious, where both project family standards in each other.
Of course beliefs also shape romantic expectations. If we believe that instant attraction is a sign of destination, we tend to attribute to it emotional meaning. The impact of culture and social norms shows how the perception of “love at first sight” can be influenced by romanticed narratives. For example, in books, movies or advertising romanticizes the idea of ​​attraction at first glance, creating a narrative that leads people to idealize and expect intense and immediate emotional links. This cultural expectation can influence the way we interpret real encounters-if someone lives in tune with romantic ideals, it is more likely to attribute emotional meaning to an instant attraction, facing it as something "intended to happen" or "predestined".
Cognitive psychology faces the phenomenon more pragmatically, almost stripping it of its romanticism: it all depends on our mental processing and what we consider relevant. Psychoanalysis, on the other hand, articulates the cross between fantasy and reality, proposing that although the attraction at first glance is composed of projective and fanciful elements, they are not totally dissociated from the meeting itself. There is something significant in this dynamic; Otherwise, people would not fall in love. As a psychoanalyst would say, we are attracted to those who can nourish our psychic wounds-which later may reveal the cause of dysfunctions in the couple. There is an intangible domain that subtly communicates who we are, where we have come from and how we can complete.
In short, while neuroscience and cognitive psychology highlight automatic and hormonal reactions, psychodynamics emphasizes the role of unconscious and past experiences. Although cognitive and psychodynamic psychology can seem opposite-one focusing on conscious and observable processes and the other in unconscious and emotional mechanisms-there is potential for overlap, and recognizing it could make explanation more robust. The cognitive perspective on attraction, which emphasizes rapid and automatic judgments based on physical signals and emotional responses, can be understood as the initial and superficial processing that is complemented by unconscious processes.
But my proposal is another: show that the way we look at the phenomenon affects the way we live it. Each explanation can better adapt to each person's experiences. Is the attraction at first glance rooted in an authentic and deep desire, or is it an illusion fueled by the human need for connection and meaning? The answer may reside in each other's imagination and wealth. Ultimately, the way we interpret the phenomenon of “attraction at first sight” can be deeply influenced by the brain and unconscious mechanisms discussed, but also by the cultural narratives we internalize. Thus, experience will always be an intersection between what we feel and how we learn to feel.</description><pubDate>2025-04-09 02:52:48</pubDate></item><item><title>Hong Kong International Academy Against Corruption (II)</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/07/academia-internacional-de-hong-kong-contra-a-corrupcao-ii/</link><description>Last week, we debated the Independent Commission Against Corruption of Hong Kong (HKICAC) (Hong Kong Against Corruption Committee) and Hong Kong International Academy Against Corruption (HKIAAC) (HGO KONG ACADEMY AGAINST CORRUPTION) and we introduced their origins succinctly. Macao Commissioner against Corruption, (CCAC).
In 1975, during the Portuguese administration of Macao, the fight against corruption was carried out by the Judicial Police. In 1992, the then government of Macao created the High Commissioner against corruption and administrative illegality. Referring to Hong Kong's experience, which had become one of the most impollowing places in the world, when writing Macau's Basic Law, it was clearly stipulated that CCAC would have to be created.
The CCAC website underlines the committed work it develops to review the law and strengthen the fight against corruption. One of the most illustrative cases is that of Man Long:
“Investigating the case of corruption A to Man Long began in 2005, when during the investigation of a corruption case based on information available in the meantime, CCAC found that the then secretary for transport and public works was involved in suspicion of abuse of power. He will have accepted bribes of large construction entrepreneurs and the winners of major government works are indicated.”
(In April 2007, the first phase of the inquiry against Man Long was completed. It was found that, during the time of the secretary, his heritage reached a total of 800 million patacas, ie, 57 times higher than the remuneration of the position. Objects. On January 30, Tui ordered Man Long for 57 crimes of passive corruption, whitening, abuse of power and others, to the prison penalty of 27 years and the payment of compensation of 240,000 Patacas to the Government of the Government, being declared in favor of the government all assets from illicit acts.).
This shows that CCAC has achieved extraordinary results in its work to combat corruption.
In 2006, the International Association of Anti-Corruption Authorities (Iaaca) was created in Beijing. It is the first international anti-corruption organization in the world with agencies from various member countries. It aims to actively promote the “United Nations Convention against Corruption” and reinforce international cooperation between counterparts from various countries. Cao Jianming, Attorney General of China's Supreme Popular Attorney's Office, was elected president of IAACA twice, on November 5, 2010 and November 24, 2013. The mandate of the IAACA President is three years. On January 5, 2022, the Commission Commission Commission against Hong Kong Corruption, Ba Yunliu, was elected as a new president. Later, Ba Yunliu retired. On September 1, 2023, Hu Yingming assumed the position of president of IAACA.
IAACA has a “Federation Secretariat”, created by HKICAC on January 6, 2022 to support the HKICAC Commissioner in the exercise of his duties as president of IAACA. The main responsibility of the Federation Secretariat is to support or organize activities. HKIAAC is affiliated with the HKICAC International Cooperation and Institutional Affairs Division and performs part of the federation secretariat's duties.
Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee believes that, in addition to cooperating with China's work and anti-corruption policies, HKICAC also cooperates with organizations around the world to jointly promote the global anti-corruption cause. HKICAC can help improve the fight against corruption in Hong Kong, promote the region's unpolluted environment and promote the stability, integrity and rule of law of Hong Kong society.
Currently, HKICAC has already trained in over 70 countries. In February 2024, HKICAC coorganized a “International Anti-Corruption Course on Financial Investigation and Pursuit of Fugitives and Stolen Assets”, lasting nine days, in collaboration with the “Operational Network of Agencies for the Anti-Corruption Law of the United Nations Drug and Crime Law”.
In March 2024, HKICAC opened a five-day anti-corruption course for more than 90 employees from the “illegal enrichment office” in Mali, covering topics such as research techniques, integrity management and public education. In early April 2024, HKICAC sent staff to Kazakhstan in Central Asia to conduct courses to nearly 200 local anti-corruption agencies.
In May 2024, HKICAC signed a memo of cooperation with the United Nations and Crime Operational Network of Application Agencies. In May 2025, it assisted it in the writing of the “Prison Corruption Risk Management Guidelines”.
A HKICAC spokesman pointed out: “HKICAC values ​​operability that combines theory with practice, actively fulfills its anti-corruption mission, builds an international platform for integrity, promotes the development of the anti-corruption cause globally, and unequivocally contributing to its advancement worldwide.”
HKICAC has provided several anti-corruption formations in many countries and worked hard to combat global corruption. These achievements were made under the leadership of China. From now on, HKICAC will not only continue to compete with this work, but its existence will speak for the history of China and Hong Kong.

With the city as a background, the show brings together black and white images of everyday moments that evoke a sense of nostalgia and family memories
 
In the exhibition “Déjà Vu”, each image captured by António Leong's objective acts as “a portal, apprehending fleeting and stagnant moments that resonate the essence of Macau. These images bring us memories of past incidents, meetings and personal narratives in which Macau serves as a backdrop. This is how Creative Macau describes the photography exhibition of António Leong “Déjà Vu”, which will be evident to the public between April 24 and May 12.
“Each photograph of this collection has captivated my attention for long periods, inspiring a deep sense of admiration and calm. It is a pleasure to be able to share with the public the comfort they provided me. I sincerely hope that they can also experience their greatness,” says the photographer, quoted by a statement from Creative Macau.
The face and contours captured in the photographs of “Déjà vu” contrast with a game of shadows and light. "The lines, shapes and silhouettes used aim to convey the supernatural nature of these themes in the context of our contemporary world," adds the photographer.
The organization of the event describes the exhibition of António Leong as an evocation of “nostalgia through a series of black and white photographs, capturing silent narratives that took place in Macao in recent years”.
From the internet to the gallery
António Leong's relationship with photography is a longtime passion, coupled with the fascination of the aesthetics of the city that saw him born. Macau's cultural dualities have been one of the photographer's inspiring muses, which began to share images on social networks, namely on the Facebook page that created in 2012 - Antonius Photoscript.
The online exhibition has opened it to doors and opportunities to participate in various photographic exhibitions that promote Macao tourism worldwide, but also to cooperate with different charity organizations and artists in various types of photographic activities. Time and experience led him to participate in acts as an instructor and speaker, sharing his techniques and photographic experiences.
In 2021, António Leong and the Macao Cultural Catholic Association presented together the exhibition “discovering the beauty of everyday life”, and in 2024 presented “Via Pulchritudinis: Macao Catholic World Heritage.”
Creative Macau enhances the fundamental role of photography in the documentation of reality without prejudice, where the aesthetics of the image is significantly shaped by the perspectives and angles chosen by those who take the photography. In this show that it will be evident to the public from April 24, the feeling of Déjà Vu is “uninterruptedly evoked through the clicks of the photographer's Chamber Lens'. “From the intricate details of architecture to the vibrant tapestry of people's daily interactions, images can incorporate both familiarity nostalgia and the enthusiasm of the city's discovery,” he is added.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Alice Im's photography exhibition opens today at The Parisian</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/11/exposicao-de-fotografia-de-alice-im-inaugura-hoje-no-the-parisian/</link><description>The third floor of The Parisian shopping center in Cotai will today be the scene of the opening ceremony of three exhibitions. “Dreamscape Macao-Solo Exhibition of Alice Im”, “Poetic Shadows: Macao’s Rhythms in Contemporary Art” and “The Spirit of China”.

Macao's displaced dust for a northeast monsoon led the Meteorological and Geophysical Services (SMG) to appeal to the population to avoid leaving home. Throughout the day, air quality levels were varying, but for most of the time they remained at levels classified as dangerous.
"Under the influence of a dust storm brought by a northeast monsoon, and due to weak wind and unfavorable meteorological conditions for the dispersion of atmospheric pollutants, it is expected that the concentration of pollutants will remain at high levels for a period of time," SMGs were explained by the alerts issued to the population.
"SMG advise the population, especially people who suffer from heart or respiratory disease, pregnant, children and the elderly, to avoid strenuous activities and outdoor activities, especially in areas of intense traffic," he was added.
Regarding the general population, around noon, it was indicated to reduce “strenuous activities and the time of outdoor permanence”.
According to the authorities' analysis, the different pollutants recorded different levels of concentration throughout the day, a factor that also depends on the place where the measurement is made. However, around 12:35 pm, the concentration of particles 2.5, also known as fine particles, ranged from 74 to 81 micrograms per cubic meter. The World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines indicate that healthy levels of PM2..5 should not be above an average of 5 microgram per cubic meter throughout the year. In addition, the WHO indicates daily exposure to a value of 15 microgram per cubic meter, should not exceed more than four days.
High values
Regarding PM10 particles, around 12:35 pm, concentration levels ranged from 272 to 368 micrograms per cubic meter. According to WHO, the healthy limit value of the average daily concentration of these particles is 50 micrograms per cubic meter and the annual limitation value is 20 micrograms per cubic meter.
At the level of nitrogen dioxide the recommended maximum levels are 25 micrograms per cubic meter per day and 10 micrograms per cubic meter per year. The measurement of SMG at 12:35 pm yesterday, which was based on the values ​​of the previous hour, indicated a concertation of 39.1 to 88.9 micrograms per cubic meter.
It was not only at Misrem that the impact of the dusts displaced by the monsoon was felt. Yesterday morning, Hong Kong appeared identified by the portal IQAIR.com as the place with the fourth worst concentration of air pollutants worldwide. Raehk was only outdated at the worst air quality level by Shenzhen, the neighboring city of the interior of China, Nova Deli in India and Lahore, Pakistan.
Around noon, Hong Kong fell to sixth place, having been overtaken by the Chinese cities of Guangzhou and Chongqing, which also had a large concentration of pollutants in the air.</description><pubDate>2025-04-15 06:07:52</pubDate></item><item><title>Encounter | Apomac without hope of seeing problems solved</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/14/encontro-apomac-sem-esperanca-de-ver-problemas-resolvidos/</link><description>The President of the Apomac General Assembly, Jorge Fão, received José Cesário, Secretary of State for Portuguese Communities, but admits that problems such as the extension of passports to 10 years or the implementation of an effective system to do the life will continue without solution
 
The President of the General Assembly of Apomac - Association of Retirees, Reformed and Pensioners of Macao claims to have no hope of solving the problems of the Portuguese in Macau related to the consulate, proof of life or extension of the validity of passports. This is how Jorge Fão commented yesterday's meeting with the Secretary of State for Portuguese Communities, José Cesário.
"He [Cesário] knows what our concerns are, but they are not resolved, because Portugal has a very weak economy, not a rich country, and the Portuguese living outside Portugal, and especially outside Europe, have dies of problems. And Portugal cannot solve these problems," Jorge Fão told HM when asked about the presentation of the problems of the Portuguese community. "He knows the problems better than anyone, worked many mandates as deputy and secretary of state, knows better than any secretary of state the situation. But, the problems have been solved so far?" He asked.
Jorge Fão recognized that he lost hope after successive governments of Portugal. "I never hope to solve the problems. I have already lost the desire to wait, in fact I lost confidence, faith and lost everything," he admitted. "Whoever, I think Portugal is very turned in and out, the Portuguese from Macau, Canada or Brazil, or wherever, just to acquire the nationality takes years. If there is a Portuguese child born abroad, to acquire Portuguese nationality only the procedure takes three years," he exemplified.

With “beards”
The associative leader explained that the problems with greater impact go through the waiting time in the processes of recognition of Portuguese nationality, the increase in the validity of the passport from five to 10 years, the proof of life for the reformed that does not work and always has to be repeated, a “old -fashioned” computer system in the consulate of Portugal, as well as lack of personnel and wage updates to the workers of the consulate.
Jorge Fão guarantees that these problems mentioned yesterday at the meeting with José Cesário, but were not new. "These problems have all beards," he said.
In turn, the secretary, according to Fão, left no promises of resolution: "He does not promise, because he knows what the situation is like. How will he make promises if this is not just about him?" He said. "When a government does not work, it cannot be expected to be a secretary of state to work the rest," he said.
With Portugal having new elections for the Assembly of the Republic on May 18, and with José Cesário leading the AD list, currently in power, in the circle outside of Europe, Fão indicated that the matter was little approached, but that he did not fail to tell Cesário that he considers him favorite. "He has not touched much in his [electoral] program, but I think he is prepared for what comes from the electoral act. I think he is convinced that he will win, and probably will," he said. "I am not seeing the existence of another strong competitor. To this day it has not yet appeared," he said.</description><pubDate>2025-04-14 14:30:36</pubDate></item><item><title>Astronomy | Brazil wants to help Macau's reference laboratory</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/11/astronomia-brasil-quer-ajudar-laboratorio-de-referencia-de-macau/</link><description>The Brazilian National Institute of Space Research (INPE) wants to help the State Reference Laboratory for Chinese Lunar and Planetary Science in Macao, exploiting asteroids, yesterday told Lusa an astronomer.
IP Wing-huen, a member of the Academic Committee of the Macao University of Science and Technology Laboratory (Must), revealed that the institution invited Inpe and received a positive response.
“We came into contact with Brazilian planetary scientists and asked if they would be interested in working with us about asteroids. (…) They are very interested,” IP explained.
In addition to Brazil, the Macao laboratory, known as SklPlanets, also wants to cooperate with researchers in Portugal, taking advantage of the presence in the must of Portuguese Marta Filipa Simões, Professor of Astrobiology.
“I spoke to the rector [of Must] Lee [Hun-Wei]. He said there is a window we could open for cooperation” with Brazil and Portugal, defended IP Wing-huen, who grew up in Macao.
"Macau has its own historical heritage, which cannot be reproduced by any other city anywhere else in China and is something to explore," said the astronomer, referring to the Portuguese administration of the region.
IP, which received in 2020 the Gerard P. Kuiper career prize of the American Astronomy Society, spoke on the sidelines of a lecture at Must about the efforts to explore asteroids.
Other flights
The scientist revealed that the SklPlanets laboratory is considering participating in the mission of the European space probe Ramses, which will “try to land and travel” at Asteroid Apophis, which is expected to pass by Earth in 2029.
Astronomers have ruled out any risk that Apophis hit the planet over the next hundred years, because “we have been accompanying it for decades, because, when it comes to asteroids, having time is very important,” said IP.
The investigator recalled that in early February, local press said China began gathering a planetary defense team following the discovery of a large asteroid that could reach Earth within seven years.
This after the European Space Agency (ESA) estimated 2.2 percent the probability that the Asteroid 2024 YR4 reaches the Earth by 2032, placing it at the top of the agency's risk list.
Weeks later, ESA descended the likelihood of impact to 0.002 percent, but set the likelihood of an impact on the moon at 1.7 percent, which remains “very low”.
"Earth can only be hit by a significant asteroid in 100 years or a thousand years, but how early we detect them, better," said IP.
In addition to detection, the astronomer stressed the importance of planetary defense missions such as Dart of the US Aerospace Agency, NASA, which in 2022 intended in an asteroid.
“We have to experience how to get away from Earth, because asteroids are usually surrounded by smaller objects, it's almost like hitting a sandbag,” IP explained.</description><pubDate>2025-04-11 17:59:58</pubDate></item><item><title>Restoration and retail with recipe breaks in February</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/11/restauracao-e-retalho-com-quebras-de-receitas-em-fevereiro/</link><description>In February, retail trade volume suffered a 28.2 percent reduction in annual terms, measured by the volume of electronic payments.

The data were released by Health Services (SS), in the context of the statistics of the reimbursement program in the treatment of medically assisted procreation.
According to the Chinese channel of Radio Macau, Chio Weng, the head of the Administration Department of the Conde de São Januário Hospital Center indicated that 240 candidates passed in the preliminary clinical evaluation. They will now be sent to Macau Union Hospital for the second phase of evaluation.
SS estimates that there are about 200 cases of infertility and sterility per year. Currently, only Kiang Wu Hospital offers in vitro fertilization service, but it is expected that Macau Union Hospital also offers the service in the second half of this year.
As part of the subsidy of this program, each couple can receive medically assisted procreation services for a maximum period of two cycles, limiting the “in vitro” fertilization techniques-first generation or intracticoplasmic injection of second generation (ICSI) sperm injection (IVF). The scope of rate exemption covers the assessment of infertility in the external consultation of infertility, the IVF / ICSI cycle and the diagnosis and treatment of the respective complications.</description><pubDate>2025-04-11 17:31:28</pubDate></item><item><title>Zelensky vs Zelensky</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/31/zelensky-vs-zelensky/</link><description>10/27/22
A renovated Ukrainian, with the same name of the president, guilty Zelensky about the extension of the conflict that destroyed his village. Zelensky, the village, who has never left his land, now lives mortified because his favorite gravedigger died in the bomber.
This Zelensky, the village, represents half the world that reproves the other Zelensky, the villain, for not wanting to negotiate with Putin.
Negotiate what? The invader enters us through the house, pies us the wife and daughter (cf. recent UN report on Ukraine violations in this “special operation”), an act that forced us to watch, and then we say: Alto there, we are for peace, but we have to negotiate: You have not said the name you want to give to children!
A peace that is not worthy is but a cessation of rights. As severe as Russophobia that Putin inflicts his people.

In a lunch with several guests I hear a friend, who declares himself a spiritist, explaining about the particularities of his belief, in a serene and balanced way, would even say, without "irrationalism". He discussed long and serenely, devoid of any fanatical proselytizing. “Here is someone to whom belief brought weighting!” I thought, a rare alliance.
However, at one point a phrase that horrify me. He says, “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!” And I enter the voracious fauces of holism. Because holismo has a pathological aspect like all good things, a side of shadow.
Two examples: In Hinduism there is less sensitivity to existential dramas, if that child suffers in this life this is only an expression of the strict karmic symmetry, an effect of the acts she committed in her previous life. In Africa it is not accepted that death may have been accidental, and many women are accused by the dead family of having caused her husband's death, in an act of manifest dementia, and, in the blatant majority of cases, in a huge injustice to his wife - madness that spreads and infiltrates the social fabric.
Buddhism has introduced compassion and Christianity to Caritas, trying to break with this logic, but in many other beliefs and religions the cage of causalities prevails over sensitivity to experience, the need to respond to the now.
It is a tremendous logic that transforms the world into a platonic stage, where we are just the shadows of something -an inextricable law -in a determinism that calcines all singularities, but strangely fascinates many.
The conquest of modernity has anchored in the conquest of chance and random, subtracting the incidences of a life to this fierce determinism that closed the world in a web. When the Renaissance freed the body from the influence of the stars, at this moment sexuality was relieved of guilt and individualism and their volition could emerge.
There is an unequivocal moral implication in the phrase “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!”, Which should work as a key to self-knowledge and self-judgment, but usually this phrase is managed to seek a reason for things abroad from us in the other. It is an alibi.
There is a holistic temptation in the world today, as in the Middle Ages there was a satanic temptation, without great reflection on its consequences. Because it is not enough we want to connect everything in a resonant chain of affection. Even the most unexpected: affection itself can kill.
I realize, thanks to this cultured, balanced, intelligent woman, that “the combat” moved at the beginning of this century. One of the great misconceptions of the twentieth century was the false dichotomy between "rationalism and irrationalism", a debate that extended to all fields, including art. First, rationality was confused (the positive side of reason) with rationalism (the pathological feature of reason), and articulated in this lack of discernment was confused irrationalism with freedom. Almost all the art of the twentieth century, with surrealism to the head, worked in this error. The fallacy still exists despite having consolidated the emergence of 'irrationalism' and the consequent relativist currents that followed it. Essentially much of what happened in the twentieth century, it turned around this shock between two paradigms: rationalism versus irrationalism.
Now, I see, the indetermination, chance, the random of the terrible temptation of the causal cage. Holism, in its pathological feature, can be the reductionism that is the way it puts the way as a new 'eschatological narrative'.
Is it "by chance" that holism emerges at the moment when neo-liberalism and its cynical contempt for the human person besides all freedoms, all acquired rights?
Holistic consciousness has brought positively a greater ecological awareness but followed by scholastic rigor drifting reality under the blanket of a determinism that is much more than inconvenience: all great authoritarian ideologies are holistic.
My friend will know how to combine her holistic and transpersonal belief with the freedom and responsibility that every moment asks us - but how many will make the destruction, under a law that explains and encompasses everything?
How many will not be abandoned to what it is?
The awareness of the indeterminate brings tragic conscience, as the Greeks knew, but also brings the will and the courage of the decision. And of this we cannot abdicate.
In addition, as Drummond shows in Carlos Drummond de Andrade's poem “Quadrilha”:
"John loved Teresa who loved Raimundo/ who loved Maria who loved Joaquim who loved Lili/ who did not love anyone./ John went to the United States, Teresa to the convent,/ Raimundo died of disaster, Maria stayed to aunt,/ Joaquim suicide himself and Lili married J. Pinto Fernandes/ who had not entered the story."
Real always runs outside the track, in full exteriority to our concepts. This is what is worth a J. Pinto Fernandes at the exact moment we thought we had everything under control.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Nobel and others</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/17/do-nobel-e-outros/</link><description>9/10/22
Reading many people's reactions when the Nobel Prize in this year's literature was announced, I couldn't help but remind me of this repair of Jean-Pierre Siméon, in relation to another Nobel Prize: “An editor of a large national newspaper wrote five lines of indignation because the Nobel Prize for Literature, a complete stranger. But unknown to whom? How did not occur to this patented and paid literary columnist to do his work, that his apparent ignorance was a matter of incorrect professional conduct? Tranströmer was translated into many languages, it was available in French. »
There is always the choir of those who wait for the announcement of the prize to complain about not being invited to the jury of the prize, there is a subgroup of Irados that professes “never read and I will not bother to read”; It is an uncommon fauna, which inhabits social networks.
I don't always know all the winners-I was unaware of the existence of Louise Glück, who I find a great poet, or the Olga Tokarczuk, for example-but it only brings me the comfort of knowing that the world is not a soap opera where everyone knows each other and the joy of recognizing that the gauge of the world is not measured with my short measure and that on the contrary it gives me a new opportunity to face the unknown.
And perhaps the most cretin of reactions was the smart one who wrote, but there are still those who read French? Confirming only that today there is a new kind of ignorance that fires with a displeasure: the one who only read English.
I would also prefer that, in French, Pascal Quignard, Linda reads, or even Sollers, or, among the new ones, Mathias is awarded, but that does not take dignity to the work of Annie Ernaux (and it would be enough to have written the “Les Années”). There are books of her that I like less, like the vulgar "a simple passion," but this happens with almost every authors, they have a channel books and others that are like intervals in their itinerary. I advise reading a beautiful book of interviews with her, "L'Ecriture Comme un couteau".

Yesterday came an article in Maputo's morning “News”, realizing that the Pen Club narrative prize was assigned to my wife, Teresa Noronha, for her soap opera “Tornado”, which had already had the Maria Velho da Costa award.
The summary they made of the book does not even deserve comments, by pathetic, but what matters to highlight is the note of disqualification about their "Mozambicanity" by calling it Luso-Mozambican. It is not inaccurate, but for those who know the context, it is a dirty touch.
Because finally, following the same logic, Adelino Timóteo should be called Tsonga-Mozambican, to Álvaro Taruma-Mozambican, and Macua-Mozambican to the writers who are from the north, etc., etc. Which is not reported to happen.
At the beyond moment, in the soap opera, she writes:
«Our color has never been dominant. In colonial time we were not white, we were ripped from monories, gone mugs, the pejorative term to speak of a son of Goes and Portuguese. In the postcolonial period, I was not black and if, in Lisbon, they took me by Brazilian or Cape Verdean, already in France were lost in cogitations of where they would be and amazed when they found out it was African. There I had to explain my DNA's wanderings before relying on moorms. It took me a long time to accept that it was so because yes, and that it was no curse that were so; On the contrary, I could even discover intense patterns of fantasy and freedom in this shrewd cloak that is our genealogy… »
In the current Mozambique it is white… and this is overlapping it soon to what it does or what it is.
It is sad, but as Naipaul warned, through these stops the race is everything and is soaked in it as deeply as, elsewhere, in religion.

Bruno Latour, an anthropologist who studied the sciences and their procedures and legitimations, law, technique and religions died and entertained themselves to turn the guts to the dogmas of the “modern”. For him the place, the expert's function, was more defined by the perplexity he embodied than for the supposed truth he would support him.
He proposed, as an alternative to the kinds of multiculturalism and his mistaken password "all different all the same", the return to "diplomacy", given precisely, not from the presupposition that "we are unified because participants of the same nature" but simply reveal that we "do not yet share an ordinary world"; It is necessary to deal frontally with the "abyss of disagreement" that separates us, rather than wanting to delude it.
And about politics said, disassessedly:
«If transparency is required from the politician, we kill him; If one requires fidelity to what the other was or he says, kills him; If a mimetic relationship is required between what the crowd wants and what its representative says, the representation is killed. These must, therefore, by definition, betray, deceive, modify, distort the word. Without this ability to double the word and betray, political language would not exist. I put the perfectly plausible hypothesis that political vocabulary will become as inaccessible as the religious language of the last twenty, three or fifty years. (in “UN Monde Pluriel plus Commun”). I believe it will be missed to decipher this frantically complex world that fit us.</description><pubDate>2022-10-17 02:18:03</pubDate></item><item><title>The yo -yo</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/30/o-fuxi/</link><description>O my friends, companions of these funerals trips to countries as old as the stars and the moon, and as strange as the profound interior of our disgraceful souls, - that startle still awaits us, what secret spells we will have to overcome, what horrors will rise to our dilated pupils of amazement and terror?
Increasingly close to our precarious existences, howling the war monster, which threatens to merge humanity with the earth, incessantly traveled by the squalid spectrum of hunger and the invisible evil of ten thousand pests.
O human human, who cries superior to his own nature, but then reveals to you, once and again, unable to simply order your existence and do not understand that you are possessed by the fickle wrath and are slave to your own ambition! Do not be content with the white jade or the light gold, there is no treasure that gives you your inextinguishable thirst for other men, animals and things; for in you an eternal anguish in you; in you crawl the expelled snakes; For you grows, powerful and impossible, the very fertile ivy of evil!
This is perhaps why on the mound they call the white deer, where one of the eight immortals in sacred mount was evolved through the skies to Penglai, inhabits the fuxa, a bird whose form resembles that of the rooster, although topped by a human head. What strange copulas, what monstrous amplexes, what terrible procedures will have occurred to make the existence of this animal sinister possible? We do not know, but it is enough for our exhausted mind to dare to raise an answer, so we soon feel the skin traveled by horrendous goose bumps and the heart trigger in paraded, which wild horse beaten by the night whip of fear, oblivious to reins and containment.
May men refrain from going through the Mount of the deer, because although there are riches capable of calming the most misunderstandings, if they are fortunately fortunate to glimpse a fuxa, it will be immediately triggered a war, the best animals will be beheaded. superb from countries.
Fuxi emits a sound that resembles its name. If you hear it, dark night or clear day, goose way, for the path where you find you is the most right of the ways for misfortune!</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Procrastinators Club</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/29/clube-dos-procrastinadores/</link><description>Walking in rereading of Easter, because of an article I prepare, I give this excerpt, extracted from “the universal man”:
«Every man morally is one and absolute; But you have to live with your personality to mitigate. (…) Coexistence is only possible among people reduced to a negative or hollow presence, which is constantly giving in. Hence, the emptiness of society, a huge ghost composed of numerous deceased. An upper man is antisocial or criminal. Its destination is jail and desert.
He is in thinking about whether she reflects here about the political-social conditioning that gagging, and worse, in a sad country as Portugal was in the middle of the Estado Novo (and the book is from 1931) where any possibilities of spontaneity and frankness in human relations were coarcet, or only lends the behavior of men (oppressed) a metaphysical frame, a “essence”, from a presumption of each one in the presumption of each one be in isolation “one and absolute”. Sometimes, to an excess of spirituality (or longing), it adds to Pascoaes to lack the world. He is a great poet, but he is a poet who takes gray-Jewish ampoules and is therefore written amiiude on a programmatic furor, ceasing to have pores; There is often a glass between him and the real, the same one who made him wring the Ballet, 1921: “Everything is ghost. There are only clouds, clouds of voices, clouds of souls, afflictions and tragedies! Clouds and more clouds, appearances and more appearances! It is a divine lightning that pierces them, the instant appearance that arises and throws us to the ground, dazzled! »
Sometimes I would like to remind him, as Antonio Sérgio did in the article “Regeneration and Tradition, Moral and Economy”, which dedicated to Easter: “Easter, Easter my dear friend: You are a pure, excellent and noble poet, but also a victim of this social environment, like us all: this horrible isolation that you praise and I”.
"As a child, he stole two melos," says Jacinto do Prado Coelho, stole him from a nest, and throb his lifetime remorse for it. The person, few more mischief is known to him. Only in Álvaro de Campos sprouts a twinge of evil and obscenity: “Oh, and ordinary and dirty people who always seem the same,/ who employs profanity as usual words,/ whose children steal at the grocery door/ and whose daughters at eight years-and I think this is beautiful and I love him! -/ masturbate decent -looking men on the stairs. » (Ode triumphal).
Both poets beaten by a certain idea of ​​holiness, they were identical to the inability of breaking the siege of the skin with the overflow of the dike, the same curse of sublimating Eros's concrete ferocity with the mansuity of the verses.
Of course, they are the two "Bigger Than Life", but sometimes unnerves to watch, from my hostor's post at the Procrastinators Club, to the tantrums between them, just to see who occupies, in the internal organization, the place of president and treasurer.
Although a person has guessed more, for example, this he wrote in the least known martial ode and that is declining in the situation we live today, differently, with the heart in his hands:
«Ode martial

"It is true that we recognize the lack of medical care and this may have led to the death of our patient, who had been hospitalized for almost a week," Vidal de Jesus Lopes, director of the HNGV diagnostic and therapeutic support service.
Vidal de Jesus explained that the HNGV management has already received the report of doctors and nurses who have been service at night, and will create an independent team to investigate the case. "The patient died due to bleeding, but it is necessary to find out whether that was what caused death or if there was another reason," he said.
According to the patient's family, an 81 -year -old man has always been assisted by trainees of the medical school. "It is true that there was a failure on our part, because our senior professionals should have supervised better. We will correct it," the hospital director acknowledged.

"To describe an event that lasted just a few hours, which was not violent, and immediately agree to describe the request for dissolution of the National Assembly as an insurrection (…) it seems legally unfounded," he said before the central court of Seoul, which after two preliminary hearings began to judge the case, which could result in a Yoon Suk Yeol conviction or even the death penalty.
Untited by the Constitutional Court on April 4, after being suspended from office in mid -December, Yoon now faces criminal accusations. Despite the heavy penalties to which he was subject, he is free, and his pre-trial detention was annulled by procedural reasons on March 8.
Like all defendants, the former head of state had to start by saying his name, date of birth and home. The incriminating accusation Yoon Suk Yeol of “wanting to provoke a revolt, with the aim of overthrowing the constitutional order”, noting that the martial law was prepared in advance and that orders were given to the army to cut electricity and depart the parliament windows.
Yoon, former Attorney General, elected head of state in 2022, began to refute the point charges by point. Most experts expect the process to be long, making comparisons with former President Park Geun-Hye, who was dismissed in March 2017, but whose final conviction for influence trafficking and corruption was only rendered by the Supreme Court in January 2021.
"The veredict in the first instance should be issued around August, but the case involves about 70,000 pages of evidence and numerous witnesses. If the court considers it necessary, the trial may be extended," France-Pressure Law agency told Mini Kyoung-Sic.
Look back
Among others, the court will hear the testimony of two army officers cited by the prosecutors, one of whom claimed to have received orders from their superiors "to withdraw deputies gathered at the National Assembly to impose martial law."
On the night from December 3 to 4, 2024, Yoon Suk Yeol imposed the martial law unexpectedly, sending the army to block the opposition -dominated parliament. However, a few hours later, a high number of deputies managed to meet to vote for the survey of martial law, in a crisis that caught the country by surprise.
If convicted, Yoon will be the third former South Korean president to be convicted of an insurrection after Chun Doo-Hwan and Roh Tae-Woo in 1996 by a coup in 1979.
According to lawyer Min Kyoung-website, the court may apply to Yoon the jurisprudence of Chun and ROH trial, as its actions "also involved the coercive use of the Armed Forces."</description><pubDate>2025-04-15 06:29:02</pubDate></item><item><title>Xi says protectionism does not take anywhere, before Asian ride</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/15/xi-diz-que-proteccionismo-nao-leva-a-lado-nenhum-antes-de-periplo-asiatico/</link><description>Chinese President Xi Jinping considers that protectionism “leads nowhere” and that a trade war “will not produce winners,” the local press said before the leader visits Vietname.
Xi will hold this week a journey through Southeast Asia to reinforce his country's business relations and try to reinforce confidence in China as a trusted partner, unlike the United States, who have launched a global commercial offensive. The Chinese president will move to Vietname, Malaysia and Cambodia, where he will meet with his counterparts, according to the Chinese Foreign Ministry. These are the first international visits of Xi Jinping this year.
"Our two countries should firmly safeguard the multilateral commercial system, the stability of global industrial and supply chains and an international opening and cooperation environment," wrote Chinese leader in the Vietnamese newspaper Nhan Dan, according to the China official news agency.
"A commercial war and a tariff war do not produce winners, and protectionism leads nowhere," he said.
The visit of the Chinese president occurs at a time when the Asian country is trying to emerge as a stable partner in contrast to the United States, whose President Donald Trump launched a commercial offensive with new customs fixed at 145 percent over Chinese products, excluding some exemptions. This measure shook the world markets and led Beijing to retaliate.
Vietnam is negotiating a 46 percent reduction in US tariffs, which, after the 90-day temporary suspension announced by Trump, could take effect from July.
Xi Jinping arrived yesterday at Vietnam, where he should stay two days, on his first trip to the neighboring country since December 2023.
The two countries maintain strong economic relations. However, they are regularly disturbed by territorial disputes in the Southern Sea of ​​China, particularly due to competing claims of the Paracels archipelago. China claims almost all of the southern sea islets, while the other coastal countries (Philippines, Vietname, Brunei, Malaysia) have rival claims.
It's talking
Xi Jinping guaranteed in an article published in a Vietnamese newspaper that Beijing and Hanoi are able to resolve these disputes through dialogue. “We must manage disputes properly and safeguard peace and stability in our region,” wrote XI. "With our vision, we are fully capable of correctly resolving maritime issues through consultations and negotiations," he said.
Xi underlined the need for Beijing and Hanoi to “reinforce coordination” in various sectors, such as education, agriculture, infrastructure and technology. During his visit, the second in less than 18 months, the two countries will sign about 40 bilateral agreements on a wide range of issues.
China has been Vietnam's main commercial partner for over two decades and, by 2024, bilateral trade has exceeded $ 260 billion (228 billion euros), according to official data.
In recent years, Vietnam, the once USA historical enemy, has approached Washington with the aim of diversifying its exports, the country's main economic engine. During Trump's first term (2017-2021), many companies moved from China to Vietname to avoid the tariffs imposed by the United States on Chinese products.</description><pubDate>2025-04-15 06:24:45</pubDate></item><item><title>Tariffs | Beijing asks Washington Fair dialogue and based on respect</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/15/tarifas-pequim-pede-a-washington-dialogo-justo-e-baseado-no-respeito/</link><description>China has stated that Donald Trump's fares harm the international economic and commercial order and appealed to Washington to "solve problems through a fair dialogue based on mutual respect." Despite everything, Chinese exports rose 12.4 percent in March
 
"We urged the United States to immediately correct their wrong approach and to resolve business differences through dialogue," Lin Jian's Ministry of Foreign Ministry spokesman said yesterday.
Lin stated that "the US puts its interests ahead of the common good of the international community, which is a typical example of tariff intimidation." The spokesman reiterated that "in a trade war no one wins" and that "protectionism offers no way out."
The trade war triggered by Trump intensified on April 2, with the announcement of "reciprocal tariffs" against the rest of the world, a measure rectified one week later, in the face of the fall of markets and the increase in US debt financing cost.
But while softening his offensive with most countries, applying a widespread 10 percent tariff, he decided to increase rates on China, which are now set by 145 percent. However, this weekend, Washington has decided to exempt many Chinese technological products. Trump said on Sunday that semiconductor rates will be implemented “in the near future” and will announce the rates later this week as part of his trade war.
On Sunday, China classified the exemption of tariffs on certain Chinese electronic products such as "a small step" for the United States to "correct their wrong practice" and urged Washington to "completely cancel" rates.
For Beijing, US tariffs "not only violate economic and basic market laws, but also ignore complementary cooperation and the offer relationship-search among countries."
Orders and Orders
China exports increased 12.4 percent in March, in homologous terms, as companies rushed to complete orders before the tariffs imposed by the President of the United States, Donald Trump.
Imports fell 4.3 percent, according to data released by China's customs administration.
According to the same source, exports from the world's second largest economy increased 5.8 percent over the first three months of the year, compared to the same period last year, while imports fell 7 percent.
China's commercial surplus with the United States was $ 27.6 billion in March, with Chinese exports increased by 4.5 percent. In the first quarter of the year, the Asian country registered a surplus of $ 76.6 billion in trade with the US.
Given the rates applied by the White House to Chinese products, it should be noted that the highest increases in exports were to Southeast Asian countries, which saw imports from China jump almost 17 percent in March, in relation to the same period. Exports to Africa increased more than 11 percent.
Chinese President Xi Jinping left yesterday to Vietnam (see secondary text), as part of a journey that also includes Malaysia and Cambodia, aiming to reinforce commercial ties with other Asian countries that also face heavy tariffs, although last week Trump delayed their application for 90 days. China's exports to Vietnam increased almost 17 percent last month, compared to March last year, while imports fell 2.7 percent.
Liu Daliang, spokesman for the Chinese customs administration, said China faces a "complex and severe external situation," but "the sky will not fall."
Asked about the fall of Chinese imports, Liu told journalists that China has been in a row for 16 consecutive years the second largest importer in the world, increasing its quota of global imports from about 8 to 10.5 percent. "Currently and in the future, China's import space is huge and the big Chinese market will always be a great opportunity for the world," he said.</description><pubDate>2025-04-15 06:22:35</pubDate></item><item><title>Timor-Leste | Dili receives interministerial meeting of G7+</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/09/timor-leste-dili-recebe-reuniao-interministerial-do-g7/</link><description>The capital of Timor-Leste will receive tomorrow and Saturday the sixth ministerial meeting of the G7+ that will first join the heads of the organization's diplomacy, which marks 15 years of existence. G7+ is a forum in which member countries seek to influence global discourse on peace, stability and resilience, as well as define joint actions to achieve those objectives.
The Intergovernmental Organization was established on April 10, 2010, in Dili, and emerged with concern, shared by its Member States, that traditional development cooperation did not improve the situation of fragile nations.
"The purpose of this meeting, the sixth G7+ministerial meeting, is to reflect on the progress achieved during the 15th anniversary of its establishment," said G7+Secretary-General, Helder da Costa.
The meeting, which traditionally brings together the ministers of the finance, planning or economy of the Member States, will first join the heads of diplomacy in several countries because of “global politics”, to make a “reflection on the script for the coming years” and because G7+ has an “increasingly global voice”, said Helder da Costa.
The meeting, co-organized with the Timorese Foreign Ministry, begins exactly with an intervention by Timorese Prime Minister Xanana Gusmão about “safeguarding peace in turbulent times: the vision of G7+”.
The meeting will also make a presentation on the organization's path over the last 15 years and a debate on cooperation between the Member States. The G7+ has a Observer Statute to the UN General Assembly since December 2019 and in the community of Portuguese-speaking countries since July 2021.

"The ties between China and Spain maintain strategic stability and are based on the opening, cooperation and mutual benefit," said Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian yesterday at a press conference in Beijing, where the head of the Spanish government, Pedro Sánchez, has planned to start an official visit tomorrow.
The spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has described Spain as "an important European economy and a fundamental cooperation partner within the European Union."
The trip takes place in a period of climbing the trade war between China and the United States and after the Chinese Prime Minister, Li Qiang, spoke to the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen. The two leaders committed to defending free trade and reinforcing the role of the World Trade Organization (WTO).
Sánchez will be received in Beijing by Chinese President Xi Jinping and will have meetings with the Prime Minister, Li Qiang, to diversify export markets, reinforce economic ties with Asia and face global challenges such as climate change and war in Ukraine.</description><pubDate>2025-04-09 23:45:46</pubDate></item><item><title>EU | Chamber of Commerce in China says companies should rethink strategies</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/09/ue-camara-de-comercio-na-china-diz-que-empresas-devem-repensar-estrategias/</link><description>The European Union Chamber of Commerce in China said yesterday that the customs of 104 percent imposed by the United States on Chinese products "require a strategic rethink of business models and supply chains."

XI, who did not mention the US President, urged his employees during a working meeting to improve relationships with neighboring countries “through proper management of differences”, with a view to “reinforcing ties in supply chains,” said the official news agency Xinhua.
China's relationships with neighboring countries are “at their best level in modern history” and at the same time Beijing is “in a crucial phase deeply interconnected with changes in regional dynamics and global developments,” he noted.
The Chinese leader argued that China's diplomacy with his neighbors will be based on the construction of a “shared community”, one of the most repeated phrases by Chinese Communist Party leaders (CCP) in which it is argued that prosperity is only sustainable if nations work together.
At the meeting, it was also stressed that China should reinforce its sense of responsibility and maintain a “neighboring, sincerity, mutual benefit and inclusion.
Difference management
It has also been underlined that China should "support countries in the region to maintain their own development pathways and correctly manage conflicts and differences."
"We must build a high -level interconnection network and reinforce cooperation in industrial and supply chains," added the Chinese leader, stressing the importance of "maintaining regional stability and cooperating in matters and law enforcement."
The Chinese leader has not made any reference to the United States and Beijing has been underlining so far that he will not give in to Trump's rates. Trump ordered on Tuesday to apply an additional 50 percent rate on Chinese products, raising total customs rates to 104 percent.
Beijing previously announced a 34 percent rate on US products, after Trump imposed a rate in the same percentage on Chinese products, and announced yesterday an increase of 50 percent at the imposed rate, now totaling an 84 percent tariff.
In the possible future negotiations between Beijing and Washington is also the future of Tiktok's application operations in the US, which Trump's government has demanded that it disconnect from its mother company, Chinese Bytedance, to be able to operate in US territory.
Plus 50 percent
China announced yesterday an additional 50 percent retaliation rate on imports from the United States to 84 percent, intensifying the trade war between the two largest economies in the world. The Chinese Ministry of Finance said the new rates apply beyond the 34 percent previously announced on US imports. The rates come in today.</description><pubDate>2025-04-09 23:42:13</pubDate></item><item><title>Álvaro Barbosa, vice-rector of the University of São José: “Student visa is very limiting”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/07/alvaro-barbosa-vice-reitor-da-universidade-de-sao-jose-visto-de-estudante-e-muito-limitativo/</link><description>The University of São José continues the negotiation saga with the Chinese authorities to recruit students from the interior of China. Vice-rector Álvaro Barbosa expects, soon, the increase in master's students from 30 to 200. Regarding the internationalization of higher education, the official advocates changes in student visas to facilitate recruitment
 
Does the recruitment of students from the interior of China remain a matter pending to the University of Saint Joseph?
It is a process that is underway. We have had huge support from the Macao government in negotiations to obtain the quota for our university, and they have been tireless in the effort to try to resolve the issues raised by the central government. Many of the questions are legitimate and concern concerns that arise. We were granted a temporary quota of 30 students for masters ago over a probative period, which served to evaluate how we, as Western University, would host students from China. From China, there is this concern with the host of students in Macau. I think we have made a huge effort and the students who are there, included in this contingent, are quite satisfied.
Is this quota for masters just?
Yes. For a degree we do not have authorization yet. In this way, we are currently at the time we try to overcome this probative period in order to obtain a quota of about 200 students for masters. We are in the final phase of the evaluation process and everything has been doing well. We will have the possibility that, next academic year, expand this quota. That would be great, because for our university, to have a greater impact of our mission in Macao, it is essential to have access to students from mainland China. We cannot be a university in an integrated region in a country like China, and not contact with students from China.
Is it more difficult for USJ to compete with other universities, such as those of Hong Kong, by foreign students, outside China?
The issue of recruitment of international students has become a priority for Macao universities. In the last two or three years, it has become evident that this internationalization is very important. What difficulty is there? There is the issue related to student visas, as these visas currently do not allow students to do any kind of work, denying them that minimum local subsistence mechanism to be able to meet expenses. Nor is it contemplated the possibility of, when the student concludes his formation, to be in the territory and find work. What all countries and regions that are competitive in higher education do, such as Singapore, Hong Kong or Australia, is to have incentive policies. Allow students to work part -time, for example. In Hong Kong when a degree ends, the student can stay in the territory up to a maximum of two years to find a job. This kind of measures do not yet exist in Macau, but I think the government is pondering this possibility. From the moment the decision was made that the internationalization of higher education was important, this must be accompanied with the corresponding measures. The current student visa is extremely limiting and does not encourage the coming to Macao to study, only allows coming. This issue was not as present as it is now, but now there is a strategic policy of internationalization.
It is also a matter of survival for local universities.
Yes. Perhaps there is no greater example of a catalyst for the diversification of Macau's economy than higher education. We have ten institutions, 60,000 students in about 700,000 inhabitants. This is the potential of internationalization, to foster diversification.

And also the research that comes out of higher education.
The investigation, the dynamics of the work that is done. There are a number of vectors that higher education brings to a region or country, this happened to Portugal, for example, with the policy of doctoral scholarships for students from abroad, which completely changed the dynamics of higher education. Cape Verde developed thanks to the impact of higher education.
Then we need to make the system more flexible in Macau.
I don't know if it's a matter of having a holistic view of strategy. Pode haver uma ideia, mas depois não se intervém em todas as dimensões necessárias para atingir um certo objectivo. But I am very optimistic. Acredito que essa nova política para estudantes é um passo chave a ser tomado em Macau. The internationalization strategy followed by all these countries and regions I spoke, and were successful in capturing international students, was always the same. No need to invent much. First, one should increase the capacity and notoriety of universities, and then a policy of scholarships, which will enhance a student flow, creating a reference for the territory, so that studying there becomes a habit. After this flow of students for a few years, an image is already created and some scholarships can be removed, which students will continue to choose a particular territory to study in it. Australia has a huge higher education industry, for example, and I think that in Macau we just have to follow the same strategies. We do, at USJ, that a little.
How, in concrete terms?
We offer many scholarships, and in this sense the Diocese of Macao has helped us build this flow of international students that allow us to create this dynamic that we hope will be sustainable by itself in the future. I think the government is also doing this. There have always been scholarships in Macau, attributed mainly by the Macau Foundation, but this measure will be strengthened. Solving the student's visa issue, creating a scholarship incentive system for five to ten years, Macau will have a bright future as an international higher education destination. But we need to invest, continue, and it takes a few years.
USJ created the “Macau Hub” platform, in partnership with the Macau Scientific and Cultural Center (CCCM) in 2023. At what stage is this project?
This project has to do with our interest in developing a relationship dynamic of Lusophone countries centered in Lisbon in the area of ​​entrepreneurship, first. This cabinet we have at CCCM is not intended to offer training in Portugal, but we want to do something else. As we are positioned in the Great Bay and with Hengqin, where it is intended to activate a business ecosystem, we want to take advantage of the fact that we have relations with the Lusophone world to activate the access of the startups of Portugal, Brazil and Angola, above all, to the great bay and hengqin. We are trying to create a kind of incubator of transnational companies, in which we support the development of Lusophone businesses that want to settle in the large bay and also the reverse system. Strategically, for a university, it is absolutely fundamental to have a dynamic in the area of ​​entrepreneurship. Currently, more than half of our students do not want to go to the corporate world, but create their own businesses. Just as universities have to have employability solutions, they also have to have them for entrepreneurs, who are increasingly. So a university has to have a business incubator. My vision of the future for higher education goes around: a university, besides having a library and canteen, will also have its own business incubator. I would say that most students of management or economy courses dream of having their own business, especially in China. China is perhaps one of the most entrepreneurial countries in the world. The CCCM welcomes this initiative in Portugal, but we also work with the Portuguese Catholic University.
And concrete results, already have it?
We have a number of small initial projects that are starting now, and we also work with many business organizations. We have now negotiated a series of projects, and I think everything will develop very quickly, based on the manifestations of interest we have. We were in Angola in December and we have already aligned a series of initiatives, we also have projects with Brazil and Portugal.</description><pubDate>2025-04-07 22:56:36</pubDate></item><item><title>Adelina Moura, teacher and trainer: “The mobile phone is like a Swiss knife”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/07/adelina-moura-docente-e-formadora-o-telemovel-e-como-um-canivete-suico/</link><description>Graduated in the area of ​​educational technologies, Adelina Moura will conduct lectures to parents, students and teachers about the use of digital technologies in classrooms, within the “Letters &amp; Company” festival of the Portuguese Institute of the East. The teacher understands that prohibiting mobile phone in schools is not a solution
 
What are the challenges felt by teachers with the introduction of technologies in the classroom? Can the mobile phone actually be a complement to learning?
Yes. I've been saying this since 2005. The mobile phone can be an excellent learning tool, a means to motivate students and to enrich their learning. We have a kind of Swiss knife here, a very powerful equipment in the hands of the students and there is a school failure, because they do not work and help students enhance this equipment they have. What happens is that students learn in the worst way, in a destructed way, by attempt-rrove. There is a gap, as students are not alerted to the positive potential for mobile phone use. They face their mobile phones as a free time use, spending time on social networks and scrolling, and time consumes. It is essential that teachers are users, in their practices, mobile phones, and for the preparation of classes and other projects, to know how to prepare students. I consider that the school has lost several stages of students' preparation and awareness to use these equipment that lead to classes and with which schools have not spent any money. With the prohibition of bringing the mobile phone to the classroom we did not advance anything in this regard.
During the pandemic period, for example, the use of technologies, with distance learning, was quite enhanced.
But during the pandemic we also burned some steps regarding the use of digital by teachers, because before the pandemic many teachers did not believe or used. They thought it was a fashion and they saw no use in the use of mobile phones and other technologies. With the pandemic the use of these equipment proved that without them the situation of education would have been much worse. In these pandemic years, teachers have become more aware of the technologies that already exist and are available to anyone. With internet access on mobile phone, something that has existed since 2007 with the launch of the first iPhone, the e-learning system is enhanced and then we move to “Mobile Learning”, where you can learn anywhere and anytime with mobile devices. It is this reality that we see a little away from school.
And after the pandemic, how has it been?
I think we will take a few more steps towards digital literacy. With Artificial Intelligence (IA), it seems that we are as in the phase I created my first website in 1999 or email in 1995. We are at the beginning. But it is 30 years of technology where there have been many changes, and technology in fact goes on and if we immediately do not realize what we have available, we and students, we help create a moat that has happened in the past compared to digital. In the face of AI, if we do not look back and do not realize what was not done and should have been at school level, we are wasting time. Only a few years from now will people be alert to AI, and the gap is increasing. Hence it is very important to bet now, in this early stage, in the training of teachers, students and families.
Is there much ignorance of parents, removal from this reality?
We have parents who are from this century. That is, they were born with the existence of computers, internet, saw the appearance of the smartphone. But when they studied, the school did not talk about the potential of digital. So these former students came to society and did not bring this sensitivity to digital, to educate their children. We teachers, when we do digital training, are doing good to society because we are also preparing these young people for the future, because they will be parents and should be aware of educating their children. At school we do not only prepare for the job market, but for personal and family life. Hence teacher education is essential. The invitation I received from IPOR seems to me an excellent holistic view of everything, because the school includes several actors, connecting with society.
How should AI be introduced into the classroom?
We currently watch changes in search engines, in fact. We have search engines created from root to Age Age, for example. The best way to introduce AI into the classroom is to ask students and how they use it, and already resort to this tool. At the beginning of the academic year I always ask students to answer a questionnaire about their digital routines, and then I know more or less their practices. In 2023, when the chatgPT came out, I introduced AI in my classes, and realized that students were using this tool to deceive the teachers. Students have to realize that when using AI, they are falling into a certain trap because they are not learning. It is the law of the lowest effort, equal to the phase in which the internet emerged, when students selected, copied and sent to the teacher. We now have the problem that the answers are in Brazilian Portuguese, for example, and see as soon as I was used. We have, therefore, to dismantle this action in the heads and face them. I tell them that they are being intellectually dishonest and that they have not read the AI ​​response, for example. Since 2023, I feel that students, in the answers to this questionnaire I do, say they are afraid to use chatgpt because they are afraid of being caught by teachers. That is, it seems to have gained some conscience.
It will give these lectures in a different educational context in Asia, where the use of mobile phone can be earlier. How will you deal with these differences, or do you understand that the problems of using technology in the classroom are transversal?
It is a transverse question. Do we have to wonder if the use of a particular equipment and tool will make us wiser? It seems to me not, because we may have the equipment, but the use we make it varies a lot. I tell my students that they should be ashamed, because they have much easier access to content than in my time, when we truly had to do research and read in physical format. I tell them that with this technology they should all have a grade 20, and that they are wasting resources, being dishonest intellectually, because they sign works that are not theirs and do not read, even, they deliver. One of the works we have with students is to teach them how to make bibliographic references, refer to the sources. But I am an optimistic by nature, and I hope that in a decade, secondary education students who are fathers and mothers will be able to deal with these problems of social networks and increase fraud with their children. It is this “parents school” that the school can help create. We are in a moment with no return of digital, and forbidding is the most comfortable situation, but it is not the best to face reality. We have to use the right words to alert. We have in this time of alerts and consciences, encouraging the critical spirit of our students, which is little today.

Speaking to HM, the academic enhances the interconnection between tourism, economy and geography, and lists its possibilities, limitations and effects, including Macao
 
 
In this book it speaks of the concept of “spatial economy”, in connection with tourism and geography. How is this connection?
Economic geography combines the geographical context with economic processes, being studied the spatial distribution of economic activities. The economy of tourism is particularly sensitive to these geographical constraints, as they are the characteristics of each place that enhances the development of certain products or services. These characteristics widely exceed the physical aspects of the territory and also include culture, history, ways of life or even institutions and legal frameworks. The case of casino, something particularly important in Macao, is a good example of the importance of legal aspects to develop certain types of tourism. Economic geography has a wider scope than the spatial economy, more focused on strictly economic aspects. Being evident in tourism this relationship between economics and geography, this book establishes a double approach that systematizes the interdependence of these three aspects it refers. First explores how the concepts and theories of economic geography can apply to tourism. In the second half it makes the opposite route, discussing how the analysis of relevant problems of contemporary tourism justifies the use of economic geography. Examples are the degradation of local resources, environmental impacts, contribution to climate change, acceleration of gentrification processes or disturbance of community modes of life.
Can having an excessively -dependent economy of tourism constitute a problem or salvation?
The two things, and are both cases that economic geography can help to understand. The industrialization of economies is linked to the agglomeration processes of activities that reinforce each other when they reach a certain scale. This allows the massification of production and consumption, with reasonable costs. Contemporary industries, more associated with the integration of digital technologies and creative processes, are less clustered in specialized industrial development zones, but tend to focus on large cities and metropolitan areas. It also follows that rural areas, islands, or sites that have not followed industrialization processes, have more difficulty mobilizing investments, technologies or qualified people to innovate and develop new industries. In such cases, tourism often appears as the possible solution as it can be developed with incorporation of technology and relatively low knowledge. On the other hand, tourism consumption, not being essential to human life, is very sensitive to income fluctuations.
Can you give examples?
This was visible, for example, with the 2007/2009 international crisis. Tourism is also very vulnerable to safety problems or international epidemics, such as COVID-19 has demonstrated to the extreme. Economies too specialized in tourism are very vulnerable to external shocks and less resilient to crises. It is also visible that, being the tourist development often supported by intensive and weak labor services, the specialization in tourism can cause, in the long run, embarrassment in terms of population qualifications, the ability to innovate and integrate technology or to add value to the regional economy.
The book also speaks of “intelligent tourism” and “co-creation of experiences”, using the megados and IA. Is tourism definitely becoming more digital?
Social networks are fundamental instruments for new generations. However, they began to generalize the tools for planning or promotion of travel supported by artificial intelligence. The so-called “intelligent tourism” more generally designates the use of digital technologies to intensify information flows, consolidate the formation of networks and promote more informed and shared decision making, eventually contributing to the so-called “co-creation of experiences”. Tourism digitization has its origins in service distribution systems originally developed by airlines since the 1960s, but it would be the internet to accelerate and globalize digitization.
And social networks.
The emergence of social networks promoted the creation of a more interactive universe, potentially in real time and involving wide numbers of users and various types of supports. The generalization of the use of mobile phones permanently connected to the Internet, even on foreign travel, has further increased this potential for intensive and interactive use of data and information. This "co-creation", however, hides obvious imbalances of power.
Such as?
With regard to tourists, or consumer in general, it is usually the role of providing information, for example through social networks. This information is obtained, accumulated and marketed, sometimes without consent or even without knowledge, to eventually translate into the creation, adaptation or promotion of products and services. This process is particularly important in the case of tourism, because there is usually a long period between the decision to travel and the trip itself. This period of travel exploration and planning is used by tourist marketing companies to try to influence choices. This type of interaction also introduces a difference in the “spatiality” of the provision of tourist services, which are usually produced and consumed at the same time and in the same place, in a direct relationship between producer and consumer. The digitization of tourism anticipates most of these interactions and information flows and transfers them to large technological companies or marketing and distribution.
In a world where more and more travel, the routes are shorter and access to information is immense, how can countries and regions be competitive in the tourist offer?
Contemporary tourism lives in a highly competitive international environment. But just as there is a wide variety of destinations and offerings, there is also a wide range of preferences and consumption, what is called “hyper-personalization”, the result of such abundance of information and opportunity for interaction. The challenge that is placed on destinations is to identify the resources, products and services that can be adjusted to a particular group of consumers, to communicate effectively. This competitiveness greatly goes beyond the strict scope of tourist services because it also requires mobility and transportation services, varied infrastructure, safety, medical support, or easy communication. Anywhere you want to develop your tourist industry have to intervene about all these factors.
The book also addresses how “social processes” shape the development of tourism. In the case of China, for example, do you believe we are watching a change, which will have consequences for Macau?
It seems to me that Macau is in a highly privileged position to develop other forms of tourism. China is the largest issuing market in the world, the widespread rise of income in recent decades allows many million people to explore the opportunity to travel. Macao is a very close and distinct destination, with its historical and cultural particularities. For the Chinese population it was not easy to visit Macau and there is certainly a great interest.
How does the Great Bay project come in this?
The strategy that is being followed by integrating the Great Bay allows you to develop a cosmopolitan and diverse offer that can certainly attract Chinese tourists and other parts of the world. Moreover, these three areas have excellent hotel and tourism schools, which guarantee qualified personnel for tourism management and planning. The element of differentiation that Portuguese culture introduces in this context can certainly contribute to the success of the transition from a casinos focused on other forms that value culture and heritage more.
Is it possible to have sustainable tourism?
The problems and difficulties of tourism sustainability are more visible than in other sectors. This “spatiality” of tourism (where the consumer is obliged to move to the place of consumption) implies that the consequences of this consumption become more evident. These effects are less obvious when it comes to the unsustainability of industrial units or intensive forms of agriculture in relatively isolated areas. As mass reduction and investment reduction strategies also apply to tourism, the consequences of the environment or the quality of life of residents in destinations can be devastating. Sustainability implies a long -term perspective based on the idea that today's decisions do not imply future negative consequences. Sustainable practices depend on the control of the impacts that accumulate over time by individual and independent economic agents.
How can this control be done?
When a hotel or airline defines what ability to install on their services they may eventually estimate the impact that consumers will have on the local environment or economy. They will have more difficulties in anticipating that impacts will be generated in the next 10, 15 or 20 years to investment. And surely it will be impossible to measure how this impact accumulates the impacts caused by other service providers, now or in the future. In other words, although the idea of ​​sustainability is widespread accepted, economic agents do not have mechanisms or instruments in practice. Regulating the use of resources and territories by public entities with a more comprehensive and future perspective can contribute to the sustainability more effectively than the regulation associated with market dynamics, which in many cases has been revealed highly predatory. The Chinese economy is one of these examples and may eventually benefit from it.
And in the concrete case of Macau?
Macao has historically known problems: ultra-urbanized and polluted areas, with large energy consumption and waste production; Great concentration of tourists in a relatively small area of ​​great historical and cultural interest; Great dependence on the game, with the resulting imbalances in the appropriation of tourism benefits. The ongoing transition to new forms of tourism should better solve these problems and state regulation will certainly have better results than based on market dynamics.</description><pubDate>2025-04-02 23:28:16</pubDate></item><item><title>José Paulo Esperança, Associate Rector of the City of Macau University: “Languages ​​cannot be controlled”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/01/jose-paulo-esperanca-reitor-associado-da-universidade-cidade-de-macau-as-linguas-nao-podem-ser-controladas/</link><description>Co-author of the “New Atlas of the Portuguese Language”, with Luís Reto and Fernando Luís Machado, José Paulo Esperança reveals to HM that the work edited in 2016 and 2018 is being updated, especially due to the growing global value of the language.

Launched the “New Atlas of the Portuguese Language”, in co-authorship, about the global value of the language. Plan a new edition or update?
Undoubtedly. We are working in this regard, there was a recent conference in Macao and Professor Luís Reto, former Rector of ISCTE, presented some more current elements that were developed. He has worked on a very important issue, which is the role of Portuguese as a frank language, which was for a few centuries in Asia. The exchange between Dutch and the kingdom of Zion was made in Portuguese, because it was the common language used at that time, before English became the contemporary frank language. Therefore, there is a whole interesting story of Portuguese and the role it had in the first pinyins that existed, with the Chinese and the use of the [Roman] alphabet in Vietname. There are a number of elements that are not, therefore, very publicized, and the work of Atlas is the same, to disclose some economic dimensions of the language.
What are these dimensions?
One is the exchange of foreign trade and investment, which is very facilitated by the language. We also talk about migrations, tourism, students' exchange that is greatly influenced by linguistic proximity. Therefore, today we have a set of elements that are very interesting, and we hope to develop some more important partnerships with Macau.
As?
More at work, Professor Luís Reto is doing, which maintains an investigation team about the value of Portuguese. He has collaborated with the Portuguese Language Museum of São Paulo, for example. It is a museum space that was renewed after the fire that destroyed it. In addition, there is a project with Cascais City Council to develop such a structure, and we hope to do some works with Macau, in order to create three poles for the projection of the Portuguese language. As for Atlas' materials, we would like to have a continued update model, as this data is out of date very quickly. The work was edited in many languages, including Mandarin. This is the moment when we would like to give the book a more historical and deep dimension, with more knowledge about the teaching of Portuguese in the world.
What balance does this teaching do today?
Portuguese is developing a great deal of mother tongue and is effectively one of the most expanding languages ​​due to demographic growth in Africa, with countries such as Angola and Mozambique, which around 2050 will have populations of over 100 million inhabitants, each. The Portuguese thus consolidates itself as a language of the southern hemisphere, but much more from Africa, supplanting Brazil itself as the place of largest number of speakers of the language. All of this generates enormous potential, and this also occurs due to the great exchange of universities and internationalization of teaching. Today there is the possibility of Portuguese being a language of science, there is more publications in this language. This is a great challenge because English is the contemporary language of scientists. We want to contribute to all these dimensions, and Macau can also play an important role there. Macao is indeed a platform between China and Portuguese -speaking countries, and can play a significant role.
Is Macao an ideal place to train Portuguese teachers who do not have Portuguese as a mother tongue? Do you fear that the territory loses relevance in this matter before the offer of courses in the interior of China?
I see this question more as complementarity than competition. We have identified about 60 higher education institutions in China that have Portuguese courses, but I think Macau has very interesting conditions to start teaching from primary to secondary education so that children have been able to have learning from an early age. It does not mean that there are no young Chinese who began to learn their tongue in adolescence that they speak fantastically, which surprises me, but it is easier to start earlier and earlier. This will be easier in Macau. What is important is to create conditions for greater economic collaboration to many levels, such as joint research. In this respect, Macau has a very interesting opportunity. At the City of Macau University we are very interested in increasingly collaborating with researchers who visit us and work with our teams.
Can you give me examples?
Brazil is today one of China's great business partners. There is a lot of exchange in both directions, but one of the themes that is little studied, and in which I work hard, is the internationalization of Chinese companies. To what extent do these companies follow a model of internationalization similar to that of other countries that started this process earlier? I speak of the United States of America, the European countries, but also of Japan and others. China has, in fact, different models of presence in countries that are not yet well known, and this is important to realize, so that we know how to facilitate this process of exchange in a world that lives periods of some setback. It is very sad. I always remember a great economist of Portuguese origin, David Ricardo, who clearly explained how world trade is beneficial to everyone and how countries can take advantage of this situation. Therefore, applying tariffs, making such commercial barriers harms countries that are major exporters, such as China or Germany, and countries that today have a cultural export capacity, for example, and are not just importers.
In relation to the new Orthographic Agreement. It continues without a standardization in Macau. Does it worry it?
Languages ​​are dynamic and cannot be controlled. We think today in English, and we realize that there are almost incomprehensible ways to each other, such as the English one in Nigeria or Australia. Americans have difficulty realizing the Australians. In the nineteenth century, Portuguese from Portugal and Brazil were closer, then some disagreement emerged. There was an effort in Brazil to propose an orthographic agreement, and the Portuguese joined, resulting in a series of negotiations. There have always been resistances. I remember that Fernando Pessoa suggested the famous phrase “My homeland is the Portuguese language”. It was curiously a manifestation of some conservatism, because he thought Pharmacy had to continue writing with pH [Pharmacia]. In fact it did not make much sense. Portugal ended up seeking to impose a certain standardization based on the most genetic changes in the spelling agreement. It is not a process that has been running a hundred percent well, and has been universally adopted. African countries have become more defenders of Portuguese from Portugal. There is sometimes some confusion, but I understand that intercomprehension still remains, achieving a homogeneous language, more perhaps than English.

José Paulo Esperança is a doctorate in Economics from the European University Institute and was president of the ISCTE Department of Finance and Accounting - University Institute of Lisbon. The “New Atlas of the Portuguese Language”, with editions in 2016 and 2018, contains “a large set of indicators that reinforce the idea of ​​the growth of teaching, speakers and the written use of Portuguese in the world”, having been the target of a series of recent initiatives in Macao.
One of them took place on March 17, at the Rui Cunha Foundation, with a session of the “Roda de Ideas” cycle, entitled “The Potential of the Portuguese Language in the Contemporary World”, which was attended by the former ISCTE Rector, Luís Reto, and José Paulo Hope himself.

He is a man with a provocative speech, a corrosive, kind mood and a smile that leaves no one indifferent
Gitelles, we live in an intercultural land and the Gypsies - in particular - have lived about five centuries in Portugal. What is going on for Gypsy communities to remain “on the fringes” of the so -called society? 
The model of society remains to be changed. This is extremely stratified by placing people in subordinate places to privilege a violent minority. The white social structure is patriarchal and racist. What is called the "margin" of society is actually an intrinsic place to it, which belongs to it. In other words, Gypsy people have been included in this model of society since they discovered Europe and its kingdoms. The problem is the model of society that is maintained and the place to which they were relegated and how they were relegated: with violence, in inferior status against whites, without the right to human dignity, to constitute a family, to choose their own language and religion, expropriated from any and all cultural and material law. A place built and maintained to this day by violence and genocidal and ethnicidal persecution. In 1463, a Gitano Vasco was drowned to an estate. In 1521, Gitans, or Gypsies, were already used as a reference for all that is considered bad in the model of society. The "counter-exemple" in the face of the white that would stand out for the positive. The 'angel' and the 'devil'; the 'other', the enemy; That against whom any attack and persecution is legitimate. Including the prohibition of defending, having weapons, any kind of goods, and the right of permanence.
And is this right to permanence that we still have nomadic gypsy communities within the country is denied?
Yes, no doubt. There are many ways to force nomadism: directly, prohibiting permanence and expelling with police or military force; indirectly, refusing public or private housing to Gypsy people, as they are Gypsy; and even through the gentrification process.
I read the result of an inquiry from the European Union Fundamental Rights Agency, which is said to be approximately 80% of the Gypsies responded to the risk threshold of poverty in their country; One in three Gypsies lives in a housing without channeled water; One in three Gypsies belongs to a family where someone hungry at least once the previous month; and 50% of Gypsies aged 6 to 24 do not attend school. Why does this happen like this? 
It is the historical persecution, which continues. There is no impoverishment that has no external cause. In this case, a political system of total expropriation and imposed on the basis of violence. Already in 1648, D John IV, the restorer, prohibited ‘Giving or Rent houses to Gypsies’. The same D John IV who got the kingdom of Portugal thanks to D. Jerónimo da Costa and his 250 knights. The same D. Jerónimo da Costa who had died to defend Portugal's independence from Castile. Gypsy, like his wife and children. Between prohibitions of permanence, “that do not enter Gypsies in the Kingdom and leave those who are” (D John III, 1526), ​​with expulsions, degred to the galleys, expropriation of goods and properties, imposed with stripping, mutilation and death, systematically performed to this day (still in 2011 Faro City Council wanted to ban Gypsies in the municipality).
The prohibition of working on others (no one employs Gypsy workers, and those who accept they do it in total precariousness, for poorly paid positions and without decent rights and conditions). They cannot be dependent on their own work, they cannot get investment means due to extreme expropriation. Are dependent on precariousness. If you want to know what it is like to live in pure neoliberalism, know the lives of Gypsies. Their reality is paradigmatic of the aggression and depletion to which the "gentlemen" are willing to go to their benefit.
Are you talking about economic and political power?
The group of political, social, cultural and economic power. The owner, the colonizer. This group that has been in power since it established the system of current domination. And that only makes sense within the hierarchically stratified sociopolitical model in which we live. Hence the need to end 'gentlemen' and institute a new model of society, healthy, free, without hierarchies or strata, whether of race, class or gender.
The model we live in leads to the Gypsy (and not only) community to economic exclusion, removing it from access to product consumption or excluding them from its production process; political exclusion associated with lack of access to information; To education and consequently the social exclusion that is seen in inequality of access to quality community areas such as restaurants, libraries, theater, cinema, concerts, health care, etc. How do you feel a gypsy child when you realize that it is not part of a whole? Children who are never represented, neither in movies, nor in books, nor in cartoons, not even in an announcement to eat cereals, for example? Is this a disaster for self-esteem, is a priori condemnation?
The question is that. Gypsy people are not “excluded from society”, by contrast, they are included in it. The problem is the existence of what is cynically called 'social exclusion', which term Orwellian, and there be under coercion, people. Which field of concentration and extermination. Incidentally, Nazi concentration camps are a more visual realization than called 'social exclusion' and, as here, were not a 'excluded' part of Nazi society, but rather its fundamental and characterizing structure. It is a place of violence, where people are maintained by violence, dedicated to their extermination, and designed so that few people can leave. And yet they resist. As in Nazi concentration camps.
And what you have listed as an example of 'consequence' of this 'exclusion', is actually the means by which this exclusion also happens and remains. Gypsy people are out of theaters, both as consumers and producers (but go to the cinema). They are out of school, education and the gym. Either as 'users' or as producers (but go to school and are on the basis of knowledge construction and academic and scientific debates).
Even in attacking Gypsy children's self -confidence, we talk about a maintenance mechanism of this situation. But Gypsy people respond very well: with Gypsy pride. Another resistance, another aggression. Gypsy people are thus included in society. In a place that belongs to this model of modern society. And they resist and contradict the power of domination and make a point of being in the city, in the cinema, in the theater, in the gym, in all spaces. With a lot of struggle and always resisting, but they are there. Social exclusion, more than a “place outside of society”, is part of its social structure.
Do you want to say that there is a collective resistance?
At work, already in a context of absolute precariousness, during the pandemic, Gypsy people rolled up sleeves and showed once again proactivity and creativity in adversity. They learned seeing and doing. And here, it is again the women who jump to the front line, face, learn to use digital tools with their daughters or children, and throw themselves into the network. And so they explore online sales as well as application by application (transportation or rehabs). In housing, in a context of pandemic in which the evictions were not locked - as they owed and dictated the law itself - residents did not fail to organize and fight unjust evictions and claim dignity in housing; associations of allied residents in their action with other housing and anti-racist struggle organizations.
It should also be noted how they reinvented and intensified to raise and distribute dietary goods and kits of masks/alcohol gel to the most expropriated people. Gypsies and non -Gypsies. In the anti-racist struggle, new movements emerged and their actions intensified by social networks. People who had never been organized or militated before began their first steps in activism, thickening this way of the organization and popular gypsy and anti-racist action. People forget, or do not want to value, but Gypsy action has helped determine results in the political dispute. Gypsy citizens mobilized in large and determined electoral results in the municipalities of 2017, both in Alentejo and in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area, even causing electoral earthquakes.
And even in the presidential, second place was resolved by a value equivalent to the estimated number of Gypsy voters. Apart from the non -Gypsy votes that were mobilized by the action of Gypsy voters. Gypsy people are even co-considering power in the spaces of opinion, local media, social networks and party and institutional political dispute. And most importantly, in the popular Ação and alliances with other social movements. We have never stopped fighting for all means and continuing to resist.
In contrast there are more and more hate speeches, from the far right in particular. What do you have to say about it?
To start these speeches are historical and European. Not even current and even less “of the far right”. These speeches have been adopted and rendered for a long time, even in 'democracy and freedom', by several representatives of the center right, conservatives, left center, liberal, liberal left, even representatives of the PCP. Anti-egana rhetoric has always worked in Portugal as it is the whiter rhetoric [white genesis]. That is, it allows you to create and give the "white" as the superior of all. And so please the white electorate who, when feeling well, pays off with his vote. Even if the policies implemented by their elected harm him even more.
Finally, did you like them to talk a little about your personal experience and how did you get to the activist?
I studied, fought for studies, made alliances, graduated, went in the labor market of the “formal precariousness”. I started my militant action and here I am today. We can transform this society a better. This certainty combined with the fact that the current one has so much suffering makes anyone want to have a transformist attitude. I wanted to be 'inventor' (physical engineer) and anti -racist militant. And through study (not necessarily schooling) and organization with others, in turn, with other studies, formations and visions, I learned how the world works and how it can be changed. But before transforming, we need to survive.
Hence two types of actions arise: transformative and survival. The struggle against hate discourse arises as survival, but his defeat will be a transformative victory. There is a lot that - like people who want a better world - we have to do, namely working to criminalize hatred speech; condemn and prohibit organizations with racist discourses and practices; denounce the racist institutional structure and logics that organize power and generate community resources. And in this sense, there have been various types of actions, of petitions, to manifestations. And we need more.
I, besides being a military man in the SOS Racism movement, participate in the “We came to stay” podcast, with Mamadou BA and Joseph da Silva. And if all goes well, we will soon start a new project. With friendly people, we also have the project “Gypsy Initiative”, dedicated to reflecting and promoting transformative movements. Essentially focused on educating against anti-agigarism, denouncing historical and continued genocide and working for a new society project. Also with new projects on the gutter. And finally, there are always voluntary actions without an organization, where I try to share what I found out about anti-egism and Roman history in schools and with interested people. In addition, there is still the struggle for housing, because the evictions did not stop during the pandemic. Due to housing and work precariousness, the subjects racialized especially the Roma nationals are the most vulnerable to COVID-19. There is essential to have actions in this area; Of all the struggles, this is the most structural, as it goes against one of the main enemies of a healthy society: the real estate speculation of this capitalist system, which places profit and goods above people and their humanization.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>FIRST RALENT PROOF FOR THE MACAU GP took place in Shanghai</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/25/primeira-prova-de-apuramento-para-o-gp-macau-decorreu-em-xangai/</link><description>The first determination test for the 72nd edition of the Macau Grand Prix took place last weekend at the International Shanghai Circuit. Integrated in the Formula 1 China Grand Prix Program, Chen Weian and Lichao Han won the two races that will serve to select competitors entitled to participate this year in the GT - Great Bay Cup -
 
The GT Cup-Great Bay Race joined the newly created SRO GT Cup, the latest GT competition launched in the interior of China, inspired by the GT4 class vehicles of the Macao Grand Prix. Thirty-three cars, six of them driven by Macau pilots, signed up for this debut-a record number of participants in a GT4 category in Asia category.
According to the organizer's statement, Sro Motorsports Group, “the total number of cars and the variety of builders have even exceeded the organizers' expectations for a championship that only began to be discussed in late November 2024. Since then, the Sro Asia team and their partner AAMC (Macau-China General Automobile Association) have worked tirelessly to make the series a reality before their debut.”
The event started in a troubled way. Due to a customs problem that affected several cars, more than a dozen competitors was unable to participate in the free training session on Friday. Fortunately, for this group of pilots, among which were included the pilots of the Kevin Leong Ian Veng, Kim Hou Lao and Un HA IP, the cars arrived at the circuit in time for Saturday's qualification.
Animated races and decision in Zhuhai
With three dozen cars, from ten different brands, on track, all with very balanced tasks, was attended by two animated races in the imposing Shanghai track. In the first 12 -lap race, the two Lotus Emi GT4 Officials, by Daniel Lu and Luo Kailuo, who departed from the first line of the grill, were overcome on track by the Chen Weian Audi R8 LMS GT4. In the second match of the weekend, Lichao Han, behind the wheel of the same Toyota GR GT4 who beat the GT Cup - Great Bay Race in 2024, triumphed ahead of Chen Weian and Lotus de Liu Kai Shun.
Macao pilots had no easy life on a track where they had little or no experience. The most rewarded of all, Kelvin Leong, abandoned in the second round of the first race, while Miguel Law, in Audi R8 LMS GT4, was the best of the riders of MSAR, ending in 19th place. In Sunday's race, Leong took his BMW M4 GT4 F82 to 11th place.
Up to 28 cars will be able to compete in the GT Cup - Great Bay Race, at the end of the season, on the streets of Macau. The places will be attributed based on the classification after the second round of the championship, scheduled for the Zhuhai Permanent Circuit, in a date yet to be announced.</description><pubDate>2025-03-25 01:20:30</pubDate></item><item><title>GP Macau | Fia introduces costly measure to GT world cup</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/21/gp-macau-fia-introduz-medida-onerosa-para-taca-do-mundo-de-gt/</link><description>The International Automobile Federation (FIA) announced on Tuesday afternoon a technical measure for the GT3 cars participating in the GT World Cup of the Macao Grand Prix, which will certainly have an impact on a race that is the event's headlord
 
To improve the Balance of Performance (BOP) - the method that balances the progress between all cars in the GT3 category - the FIA ​​decided to force the use of torque sensors, like what you already do in their championships, such as resistance worlds (WEC) and Rally Raid or Formula E. Torque sensors offer a very high precision in power measurement, allowing FIA ensures that the power of each car does not exceed the values ​​assigned by BOP and that external factors, such as atmospheric conditions, do not influence performance.
Although Sro Motorsports Group is co-organizer of this race, and having a bop recognized worldwide, in the last two years, the Macao Bop has been provided by the FIA ​​itself. Last year, the FIA ​​BOP was worth a series of criticisms, with teams and pilots-particularly from Audi, Porsche and Lamborghini, the main impaired-to publicly express their natural discontent with the difference in progress.
These sensors are installed in car transmission veins and represent the most effective tool for measuring wheel power, being individually attributed by the BOP process to each car model that participates in the world's most prestigious “sprint” race for GT3 class machines. According to FIA, the decision to make torque sensors mandatory after consultations with the brands involved in the GT3 technical working group.
Costs will shoot
For a race that has several private teams, this measure will be expensive, as these sensors exceed half a million patacas per car, and the teams need to have another same spare reserve system. This, given that most teams that participate in the MSar test do not use torque sensors in their cars in any competition, and cannot amortize the brutal investment.
"From the experience I had in Qatar, it is noted that there is a difference between several builders in the way it generates this technology. An extra support team is needed to monitor and maximize performance without exceeding the stipulated limits," he told HM Duarte Alves, the experienced track engineer with the official Ford team in the first WEC season in the Arab country.
"A good example is the difficulty and time needed for a builder who enters as a newcomer. An illustrative case is Mercedes-AMG, which is facing growth pains while developing its own systems," said Duarte Alves. “In more flat circuits, the management of these systems is simpler. In places like Macau, where 'torque peaks' will always be frequent, it will be a real challenge for the engineers of these systems!”
Confident
Immune to all this, the FIA ​​chooses a speech directed to builders, forgetting that most of the starting grid is made up of private competitors.
Lutz Leif Linden, chairman of the FIA ​​GT commission, said the institution that represents “made this decision in consultation with the builders”, adding that, to the international federation, “this means even more justice and improved control of BOP values, which is particularly important in such a prestigious and media event, in such a demanding circuit, where the long -speed straight lines contrast with tight curves and narrow ”.
Fabrice Van Ertvede, FIA speed technical manager, stressed the idea that "our goal, as a regulatory entity, is to ensure total equity for all participants." The implementation of torque sensors “is an extremely effective tool for achieving this goal, allowing us to align very different cars in parameters such as pure power, but also at full speed, a crucial factor in a circuit like the guide circuit.”
Despite the difficulties that Mercedes-AMG encountered with this system last month, Fabrice Van Ertvede praises that “the builders we hope to see in Macau this year are already familiar with this innovation, through their experience in the FIA's LMGT3 LMGT3 class, and the decision to adopt torque sensors resulted from the dialogue we kept with them.”
This is the second news that the FIA ​​introduces in the mashed race, having announced last month that the second qualification segment will have a super pole format, with each pilot to go to the track individually for a total of two qualification laps. The eighth edition of the FIA ​​GT World Cup will take place from November 13 to 16, as part of the 72nd edition of the Macao Grand Prix.</description><pubDate>2025-03-21 17:11:10</pubDate></item><item><title>GT Cup Right-Great Bay Race decides on Pingtan</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/09/apuramento-da-taca-gt-corrida-da-grande-baia-decide-se-em-pingtan/</link><description>The second test of the GT Cup - Race of the Great Bay of the 72nd edition of the Macao Grand Prix will not be played at the Zhuhai International Circuit, as initially planned, but at the International Circuit of Lago Ruyi, in the Pingtan tourist region in Fuzhou.
Sro Cup's debut season calendar was finally defined yesterday, with the official announcement of confirmation that Pingtan's semi-permanent circuit will host the third and fourth rounds of the GT4 cars on June 28 and 29. Pingtan thus joins Shanghai, Beijing and Macau in this year's calendar of the championship launched by Sro Asia in partnership with the Macau-China General Automobile Association (AAMC).
The Pingtan track replaces Zhuhai, which was on the provisional calendar released in January, but could not confirm his event. This new date is also no coincidence, as the Sro GT Cup event will be part of the Pingtan-Macau cultural activities scheduled for June.
Pingtan's picturesque - which combines modern and coastal urban scenarios - remains widely unknown outside China. Inaugurated in 2022, the circuit has two strokes that incorporate existing public roads on the island of Pingtan, sections built from root and permanent boxes. Both SRO GT Cup races will take place in the 2.9 -kilometer circuit and 14 curves, already used by national championships such as China Endurance Championship (CEC) and the Chinese Formula 4 Championship.
Promising start
The 2025 Sro Cup season has spectacularly tore with 33 cars - GT4's largest grill ever gathered in Asia - to play two Formula 1 China Grand Prix Races last month. Integrated in the F1 official program, Chen Weian (Audi) and Lichao Han (Toyota) won the two races that will serve as the basis for the selection of competitors entitled to participate this year in the GT Cup - Great Bay Race.
Up to 28 cars will be able to compete in the GT Cup - Great Bay Race, which takes place at the end of the season, on the streets of Macau. The places will be assigned based on the classification after this second round, scheduled for Pingtan. In the dispute for a vacancy were in Shanghai six pilots of the MSAR: Kevin Leong Ian Veng, Miguel Lei, Cheng Tou Wong, Wai Ming Fok, Kim Hou Lao and Un Hous IP.
Charles enters the right foot
Still in the GT events, but in Australia, Macao pilot Charles Leong Hon Chio won the two races of the Lamborghini Super Trofeo Asia inaugural journey in Sydney. The young rider of the territory, behind the wheel of SJM Theodore Racing's Lamborghini Huracán EVO2, has authored the two races played at Sydney Motorsport Park with authority, team with Irish Alex Denning.
Following a sensational season opening, the Lamborghini Super Trofeo Asia returns to the action next month, with the second round on the stage of the China Grand Prix, the International Shangoi Circuit, from May 16 to 18. After finishing second in 2024, Charles Leong is determined to win the title of the Italian brand competition in Asia in 2025.</description><pubDate>2025-04-09 23:47:39</pubDate></item><item><title>MOTOR EMBALISM | Leong repeats Lamborghini trophy with Theodore</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/02/automobilismo-leong-repete-trofeu-lamborghini-com-a-theodore/</link><description>The Lamborghini Super Trofeo Asia starts this weekend in Australia. The monomocrete competition of the prestigious super -sports builder will have, once again, with a representation of the MSAR. Charles Leong Hon Chio will be again at the service of SJM Theodore Racing.
After last season Charles Leong and SJM Theodore Racing fought for the Pro class title to the last race, this duo will continue in 2025. However, the winner of the Macao 4 Grand Prix of Formula 4 by 2020 and 2021 will not form a team with Japanese Miki Koyama. Beside his side, the Macau pilot will now have young Irish Alex Denning, who last year competed at the European Series GT4 and will make his debut on Asian tracks.
Also new is in the SJM Care Team Theodore Racing, which is no longer Iron Lynx-a structure that, since 2021, controls Prema Powertaam ​​through Swiss company DC Racing Solutions Ltd. The relationship of Iron Lynx with Lamborghini Squadra Corso, an entity responsible for the Italian brand, deteriorated dramatically at the end of last year Due to a conflict related to the FIA ​​Endurance World Championship program (WEC). As a result, Iron Lynx has abandoned all activities with the brand of Sant'Agata Bolognese globally.
Given this scenario, to ensure technical assistance to its Lamborghini Huracán Super Trofeo Evo 2, SJM Theodore Racing will feature this season with the services of DW Evans GT, the team that, last year, won the Team Championship and the Asian trophy class, with the English-based English and co-owner of the team, Dan Wells.
There is no coincidence with the GP
The Lamborghini Super Trofeo Asia intends to keep its momentum by 2025, with a calendar composed of six events in six different countries. The season will start, for the first time, in Australia, with the historic Sydney Motorsport Park to receive the first double round. Then the competition heads for Shanghai, China, for the second round on the weekend from June 16 to 18, marking its return to the calendar in 2024 after a four -year absence. Japan will be the host of the third round two weeks later, at the iconic Fuji track, while the Inje Speedium in South Korea enters the calendar in late July.
After having previously hosted the opening round of the season, Sepang, Malaysia, passes to September in 2025, occupying the fifth round of the calendar. The sixth and last race will take place at the Misano Circuit in Italy, together with the Lamborghini world finals. For the first time in several years, the event will not coincide with the Macao Grand Prix, competing in the previous weekend.
Absence of figure
Pro--class winner in 2024, along with Chinese Jason Fangping Chen, André Couto will not be present in this year's edition of the Lamborghini Super Trofeo Asia. Madness Racing Team, whereby the Portuguese territory pilot competed last season, abandoned the trophy and has not yet defined his sports project for 2025. For this first race in the championship in Australia, there are twenty -three cars that will be driven by thirty -nine pilots.</description><pubDate>2025-04-02 23:01:40</pubDate></item><item><title>Iame Asia finals of Karting back in December</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/11/finais-da-iame-asia-de-karting-voltam-em-dezembro/</link><description>The Macao Karting International Award will receive again, from December 11 to 14, the Iame Asian finals. Like last year, the coloane karting race will give invitations to the very coveted world end of Iame in 2026.
Organized by the Institute of Sport, Macau-China General Automobile Association (AAMC), Otk Kart Asia and Iame Asia, the 2024 event brought back the international spirit to one of the largest competitions of the sport on the Asian continent. Coloane's karting received several races and different categories of Iame Series Asia, recovering the international prestige of an event that has been the scene of the Cik-Fia World Championship events.
Pilots from the interior of China, Singapore, Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Japan, India, Sri Lanka, Australia, New Zealand, Sweden, Italy, France, Austria, the United States of America, Brazil, Hong Kong, and, of course, Macao, filled the track from the mashes in 2024 for four days of intense Competition, something that has not been seen for several years.
After the success of the previous edition, the formula is repeated this year. Singapore's organization again chooses Coloane's karting for its biggest event of the season, confirming the presence of the usual categories: Cadet, Junior, Senior and Master.
Thank you Macau!
The Iame (Italian American Motor Engineering) is one of the world's leading engine manufacturers for Karting. Founded in 1968 by Bruno Grana, the company is headquartered in Italy and is one of the references in Karting Internacional, having bet strongly in the Asian market in recent years. The presence in Macau is part of this strategy of growth and expansion.
The announcement of the return to the territory was made on social networks: “After an incredible debut in 2024, we are back with the Macao International International Award and the Iame Asia final for another epic confrontation! The city of emotions at high speed and legendary races will be the stage for the best pilots in Asia and the world!
