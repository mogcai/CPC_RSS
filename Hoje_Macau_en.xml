The Centaline real estate agency director foresees the continuation of the fall, estimating a depreciation of 10 percent, and calls for new measures to support the sector
 
The real estate market continues to suffer, with sales to levels that do not compare with the period before pandemic and prices falling. And, according to the director of the Centaline Real Estate Agency, Roy Ho, the sector has not yet hit the bottom.
According to official data released by the Directorate of Statistics and Census Services, in the first quarter of 2025 the price of autonomous fractions for housing descended 5.5 percent compared to the last three months of last year. The fall was more pronounced in annual terms, with the homes devalued 15.5 percent.
Roy Ho expects the market to continue to fall into the near future, estimating a descent of about 10 percent. Speaking to the Exmooo newspaper, the businessman revealed concerns about the negative tendency of the evolution of the real estate market. "There are currently factors that support the recovery of the sector, or the climb of prices. The transactions that are made at this time result, basically, the cheapest prices," he lamented.
Following this slope, Roy Ho foresees that next quarter, between May and July, will reach the market for discount offers for new housing, a factor that can be decisive for the price of fractions to be “lighter” during this period.
It should be noted that in the first two periods of this year, the housing purchase market was dominated by the sale of fractions in new buildings. The agency's director stressed that price variation can range a lot, depending on the sales variation of new or second -hand apartments, which are naturally cheaper.
Market response
The official also argues that if the price of housing to debut is cut, statistical data will reflect a decrease in sales of used fraction. Given this scenario, and although it does not predict price breaks in the order of 30 to 50 percent, if new dwellings have more competitive prices, Roy Ho considers that the highest devaluations should be verified in properties located in more degraded buildings.
The entrepreneur also points to the possibility of buyers, who can offer a higher entry value, are in favorable conditions to negotiate more competitive prices with owners who need funds urgently.
Regarding policies to boost the sector, Roy Ho understands that the Macao government should go beyond tax exemptions and launch a house exchange allowance, similar to what was done by several Chinese city provinces and Hong Kong.</description><pubDate>2025-05-20 01:51:28</pubDate></item><item><title>Parking | Payments for Half -Time Extended</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/20/estacionamento-pagamentos-por-meia-hora-alargados/</link><description>The measure had been first applied in April, experimentally, in the public park of the Mong Son Building, but will now cover Qingmao Parks, Macau Union Hospital, Public Health Specialty Building and Residence for the elderly
 
From March 28, the payment of parking for half -hour periods will be extended to the public parks of the Qingmao Border Post, the Macau Union Hospital, the Public Health Specialty Building and the residence for the elderly of Avenida do Nordeste. The announcement was made yesterday through a statement from the Directorate of Service for Traffic Affairs (DSAT).
This is a payment model that has been defended for years by several deputies and that began to be applied experimentally on 1 April in the public parking lot of the Mong Son building. According to this model, users only need to pay half an hour of parking, where even this parking time need. It is a form of payment that contrasts with other parking lots, where it is necessary to pay for at least one hour, regardless of the parking time is much lower.
"After a comprehensive assessment of the current use of public parking parks in Macao and driver parking habits, from May 28, four public parking parks in Macau will adopt the collection system for half an hour," was justified in DSAT's statement. "This direction of services hopes that this measure will allow more efficient use of parking resources in public parking parks and accelerate the turnover of vacancies, continuing to monitor the operation of these parking parks and evaluate society's opinions on the charging model," he was added.
In Qingmao, half an hour during the day will cost 5 patacas, and go down to 4 patacas at night. In the remaining parking lots, half an hour costs 4 patacas during the period of day, dropping to 2 patacas during the night. DSAT also admits “at the right time” to extend this payment model to more public parking lots.
Price reduction
In addition to the half -hour parking period, parking prices for motorcycles and mopeds will be halved to "with the aim of encouraging motorcyclists to use public parking parks." The changes cover the public parks of the Macau Union Hospital, the public health specialty building and the residence for the elderly of Avenida do Nordeste.
With these changes, the prices, after the reduction, will ride to 1 level for every half hour, during the period of day, and go down to 50 graves, for every half hour, during the night.</description><pubDate>2025-05-20 01:48:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Central Social Security | Confirmed assignment of 7 thousand patacas</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/20/previdencia-central-confirmada-atribuicao-de-7-mil-patacas/</link><description>The Chief Executive yesterday confirmed the distribution of 7,000 Patacas this year as an extraordinary office of budgetary balances of the non -compulsory central social security regime. The guarantee took the form of an order signed by Sam Hou Fai, published yesterday in the Official Bulletin
 
"A 7,000 patacas amount of 7,000 Patacas is awarded in 2025, as an extraordinary division of budget balances, to the holder of the individual account of the non -compulsory central pension regime that fulfills the legal requirements." This is how the Chief Executive made the distribution of the support yesterday, through an order published in the official bulletin, something that had already announced during the presentation of the government lines for this year. The order came into force yesterday.
It is recalled that the government led by Ho Iat Seng has suspended the assignment of support, intended for elderly residents, for three years marked by the crisis born of the Covid-19 pandemic. At the time, the executive justified the measure with the lack of financial balances due to the descent of tax revenues, while the economy of the territory was paralyzed by measures to combat pandemic.
How and when
Extraordinary Budget Balances sharing has begun to add support to the Social Assistance Network of elderly residents and the social security regime. The recipients of the 7,000 patacas are permanent residents over 65 years old who meet the requirements for assignment of support and are registered on the lists to receive the money.
Last year, the funds began to be distributed to the first beneficiaries on September 25. The first group that received the 7,000 patacas last year consisted of over 82,000 people. However, in total, according to social security fund data, the universe of support beneficiaries was almost 390,000 people.
It is recalled that the MSAR has closed the third quarter of this year with a higher public account surplus than the government forecast for the entire year 2025, according to the announcement of the finance services of late April. In the first three months, the surplus reached 9.25 billion patacas, 11.8 percent than in the same period as 2024.</description><pubDate>2025-05-20 01:43:27</pubDate></item><item><title>Macau | Democratic Alliance hits socialists on a night of national victory</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/20/macau-alianca-democratica-bate-socialistas-em-noite-de-vitoria-nacional/</link><description>AD has won the face-to-face elections in Macao, with 43.5 percent of the votes, and will remain the main political force in the Assembly of the Republic.

The deputy defended yesterday in the Legislative Assembly more transparency in the dissemination of data and prevention measures in the area of ​​mental health
 
In the interventions period before the order of yesterday's Plenary Session of the Legislative Assembly (AL), Ron Lam accused the government of following a “ostrich policy” in relation to mental health, referring to a kind of policy that hides true problems. "I ask the government to abandon the current ostrich policy and proactively create specific and objective mechanisms, to publicize the social communication the essential information about suicide cases," said the deputy.
In the same question, the deputy suggested that the executive "continue to provide gross data in publications and statistical studies, so that society and the sectors concerned to become aware and pay attention to mental health and suicide", arguing that it is necessary to "define clear objectives to reduce the number of suicides."
Regarding the government's response, the deputy pointed out that "the services responsible for its execution, through interdepportal collaboration and the reinforcement of the investment, must ensure that people have sufficient access to support, in order to actually lock suicide."
The deputy did not fail to make concrete criticism of the current performance, arguing that "the information currently disclosed by the government is limited." "For example, the numbers of suicide deaths released by health services (SS) are quarterly and through press notes, with data classified according to sex, Macao residence and ages. As this data is not complete, it is not possible to make an analysis and comparison, and society can no longer discuss this topic," he said.
The criticism also goes to the Directorate of Youth Education and Development Services (DSEDJ), because "it never responds to a student's suicide issues, that is, it simply does not disclose them." In addition, “according to some people in the area of ​​psychology, in previous SS reports on the 'health behavior in macao student health behavior', data on secondary school students' self -harm acts were included, but in the recent report these data were eliminated,” said the legislator.
It is the fault of the economy
During the debate dedicated to the vote, in the specialty, the change to the general staff of private school teachers, Ron Lam presented the latest statistical data that demonstrate the growing trend of suicide deaths in recent years, noting that "according to some voices, if economics and society remain in an adverse society, the problem of suicide is likely to be more serious."
In oral interpellation, data already advanced by Wong Sio Chak, secretary for security, is cited for 91 suicide deaths last year, "with the rate reaching 13.6 per 100,000 people, a significantly higher than 9 to 10 people." Also according to the deputy, "the suicide rate in Macau increased 44 percent in the space of 10 years, compared to the 9.4 cases recorded in 2015", and "the situation of young people also deserves attention".
In 2024, "4 cases of suicide were reported between 5 and 14 years, more than one case for the first time in the last 10 years, and 9 cases between 15 and 24 years, which is the largest number in the last 10 years." "This demonstrates that it is pressing attention and dealing with the suicide problem in Macau," he said.</description><pubDate>2025-05-20 01:36:15</pubDate></item><item><title>Technology | Xiaomi invests strong in a manufacture of own chips</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/20/tecnologia-xiaomi-investe-forte-em-fabrico-de-chips-proprios/</link><description>Chinese technology founder Xiaomi, Lei Jun, said yesterday that the company will invest about 6,170 million euros in the development of its own chips in the next decade.

"The Russian War in Ukraine affects fundamental European interests. China has a responsibility for world peace," the Ministry of German Foreign Affairs wrote. The message was released after a call between German diplomacy heads, Johann Wadephul, and China, Wang Yi, according to France-Presse (AFP) news agency.
Although the first contact since the inauguration of the Friedrich Merz executive centered on the “German-chinese relations”, the Ukrainian issue was also discussed, government spokesman Christian Wagner said at a press conference.

China is a crucial commercial partner for Germany, but it has long been spared by the Germans. During the mandate of the previous chancellor, Olaf Scholz, Berlin hardened the tone in the face of increased geopolitical tensions and the growing economic rivalry between Beijing and the European Union.

In the epitome of its speed, this trait was designated Feiba, the "flying white", which left only the traces of the brush passage.

May 2025
In Chinese proverbial lessons I discovered great affinities between spontaneous Chinese popular philosophy, which runs from mouth to mouth, and the Christian proverbial wisdom, also made so that believers, in every corner of the globe, could memorize, repeat and disseminate.
Nothing like the other's knowledge to bring and dispel prejudice, being one of the most usual that Chinese are extremely pragmatic and cold. But when we come across proverbs such as “love others as yourself,” in a direct translation and faithful to the original “爱人如己” (ài Rú Rú Jǐ), such leads us to think twice, it seems not to be here just a matter of respect, uncharged and formal, but rather a strong feeling for the other, not any, only a deep affection, of those we understand well that we are good, we will be well, we will be well, we will be well, we will be better. Then he runs a love of the Christian way for China without Christ ever been. Such finding can lead us to the assumption of the existence of universal structures, not only logical, including as regards affections, therefore sentimental. After all, selfishness may not be a dominant tendency, there is everything: selfish, aggressive and competitive people, as others will be naturally altruistic, compassionate and cooperatives, ready to recognize the universality of the feeling of love, which crosses borders rather than erecting them, bringing people closer to the most diverse social classes, ethnic groups, geographies, as in "love has no borders", in a direct translation "" (Àiqíng wú jiējí zhī fēn), here is particularly emphasized social borders.
The content of the message gains full sense when one realizes that love to oneself takes place in a culture that many consider wrong and prejudiced only to focus on the whole, in the community.  Attention to the person, the particular and the style and feeling of each, lives, in philosophies such as Taoist for centuries with the valorization of the collectivity, this ultimate tendency manifestly inculcated and worked by Confucianism.  Love to itself, care for the individual body and mind, is emphasized in the so -called Proverbial “well -understood love and virtue must begin with us”, which has the following correspondence in Chinese “爱德从己起” (to Cong Jǐ qǐ).
Anyone who imagines that in proverbial wisdom there is only place to praise and sing relational love, since the Chinese do not have any religious philosophy that chants spiritual love above all, in the Christian way of St. Augustine, will be surprised to find the following proverb "where there is no other gentleman", that in a direct translation of the Chinese is "the love above all" 爱情至上 爱情至上 爱情至上ZHì Shàng).
If in doubt, there is another saying of complementary meaning and in which the idea of ​​the integrity and unity of this powerful affection, which moves mountains in the Christian sense, when it reads 爱情专一 （（（（iqíng zhuān yī）, in a possible translation "love cannot be broken", "one person cannot have a heart in two parts at the same time."
From a psychological point of view, the acceptance of the other in loving terms will have to be complete, so their tastes, affections, relationships, and objects cannot be rejected, as is clear from the lesson "Who loves Beltrão, loves their dog", in a relative correspondence for "爱屋及乌" (ài wū jí wū), which in a literal translation would be "love the house and the crums."
As is well known, proverbs are susceptible to various interpretations, so they say polysemic, but if they are perspective as a whole, and only then as pieces of a puzzle, there seems to be many doubts with regard to the proverb philosophy and psychology of Chinese love, which is echoed in the country's scholarly philosophies.
In Chapter 67 of the Book of the road and virtue (《道德经》), also known by the name of the Patriarch of Taoism, Lazi (老子), is the first of the three guiding virtues of the Wise Way, love, as you can read in the translation of Claudia Ribeiro (2004, 139):
I have three treasures
What entesouro and retains:
The first is love (CI),
The second frugality,
The third is not daring to be the vanguard of the world.
(…)
For love,
In combat, it triumphs,
And in defense it is firm.
The sky will come to aid
And, with love, will protect
(我有三寶/寶而持之/一曰慈/二曰儉/三曰不敢為天下先 (……) 夫慈以戰則勝//以守則固/以慈衛之 1)
It is noted that while in proverbial philosophy the synogram used for love is 爱/愛 2 (AI), in the scholarly philosophy of the Patriarch of Taoism the term employment is 慈 (CI), that is, love with a strong relational and spiritual burden; Although they are different words, both refer to love, the first concerns the most physical and concrete feeling, centered on the heart of the person and the clutches that hold it;  The second to that most relational and general indicates that love comes from inside the heart (内心 nèixīn), where it has the roots, emerging like any plant. However, the truth is that both terms focus on people, or rather in their hearts, affectionate connection with others, such a strong connection that draws the attention of heaven (天 tiān), maximum impersonal power, it ensures victory on all battle fronts, whether in the forefront or rear, when fighting and defended itself for love.
Already the patriarch of Confucianism, Confucius (孔子), in the Chapter Twelve, later entitled the deep face, of the Analects (論語 • 颜渊第十二 ， 22) defines the main virtue of the school, benevolence or humanity, (仁 Rén) as an act of love to others, maintaining the term of the traditional vernacular 爱 (AI): “Fan Chi asked what was the benevolence was what answered, "love people". " (樊遲問仁 ， 子曰 「愛人 3。 ”) It is in this context of love of neighbor, that one of the main maxims of Confucian philosophy must be understood, which arises in the same chapter (論語 • 颜渊第十二 ， 2)“ Do not make the others what they do not want for you ”(己所不欲勿施於人 jǐ suǒ bù yù shunk yú rén).
The essentials in Confucian philosophy will then guarantee love of others in terms of respect or humanity towards others, in order to ensure the normal functioning of society, without extreme sacrifices or exaggerated explorations, given to the proverb containment of confusion in relation to feelings, they are important and useful but should not extravate the boundaries of rationality, that is, even the best of them, will have to be measured, controlled and ritualized in the name of harmony collective. Therefore, the love that moves friendships, especially intellectuals, is the most praised, as we remembered at the end of this chapter (論語 • 颜渊第十二 ， 24):
Zeng Zi stated: “A gentleman resorts to knowing to make friends and friends to cultivate benevolence4” (曾子曰：君以文會友 ， 以友輔仁。)
Finally, also the Buddhist philosophy, especially from the Chan (禅 Chán) or Zen meditation line, praises the love of humanity, but indirectly, drawing attention to the heart and the identification of Buddha with the heart, the way of the Daoxin Patriarch (道信) and its maximum proverbially known “the heart is Buddha and Buddha is the heart” (非心不问佛 ， 问佛不非心 fēi xīn bùwèn fu, wèn fi bù fēi xīn). Here you come to love indirectly, only an enlightened heart can love the Buddha, as it is not surprising in the picture of this philosophy, after all what is Buddha but the very love that expresses itself not in a selfish, sick, self -centered heart, but in a heart capable of establishing relationships, healthy, altruistic and without empty, but not indifferent to the other?  This confirms it the social and humanitarian actions of Via Mahayana Buddhism, which was accepted in China and unfolds in collective works such as the construction of educational institutions, hospitals, centers of social solidarity, in a proselytist action at all similar to the history of the Christian Church and its missionaries around the world.

"The Holy See is available for enemies to meet and look in their eyes," Leo XIV told Vatican to speak at the representatives of the 23 Catholic churches of the East.
The Pope said it is necessary that "peoples can rediscover the hope and dignity to which they are entitled," the dignity of peace. "The people want peace and I, with my heart, say to the leaders of the people: We find, we speak, negotiate! War is never inevitable, weapons can and should be silenced, because they do not solve problems, but increase them," he said.
The US Pope's appeal appears on the eve of possible negotiations in the Turkish city of Istanbul about the Russian War against Ukraine. It is also unknown if today's conversations can include a meeting between Russian presidents, Vladimir Putin, and Ukrainian, Volodymyr Zelensky. Other wars have caused suffering in other latitudes, such as the Middle East, Africa or Asia.
First-hand
Leo XIV said in the Paul VI room, before thousands of people who moved to the jubilee of countries such as Syria, Ukraine, Lebanon and Iraq, which the oriental churches know "firsthand the horrors of war."
"To the point that Pope Francis has called martyrs to your churches," he said, quoted by the Spanish news agency Efe. "It is true: from the Holy Land to Ukraine, from Lebanon to Syria, from the Middle East to Tigray [Ethiopia] and to the Caucasus, so much violence," he lamented.
The Pope, applauded by the hearing, said the horror of war and "of the massacres of so many young lives" should cause outrage, "because in the name of military conquest people die."
He asked him to pray for peace, which he described as "reconciliation, forgiveness, courage to turn the page and start over." “For this peace to differ, I will do everything within my reach,” he promised. "The church will not get tired of repeating:" May weapons shut up, "he said.
Leo XIV said that others are not enemies, but human beings, "they are not bad people to hate, but people to dialogue." The Pope has asked to escape "from the typical manichaeist visions of violent narratives, which divide the world between good and bad."
Leo XIV prayed for the oriental and Latin Christians, who, especially in the Middle East, "resist their lands, stronger than the temptation to abandon them." He also launched a new appeal to be given to Christians the opportunity to remain where they live "with all the rights necessary for a safe existence."
Robert Prevost, 69, born in the United States, but with double American and Peruvian nationality, leads the Catholic Church since May 8, under the name of Leo XIV.

"Now that we have a new Latin American Pope should be given an example in all Latin American episcopades that, by decision and by the Pope, there can be no double standard" among the various Catholic hierarchies around the world, "said Argentine Sebastián Cuattromo, from the adult collective for the rights of the child.
On the day the Pope made the first Sunday greeting in St. Peter's Square, praying Regina Caeli, a group of victims joined the square to ask the Vatican to impose common rules on the whole church.
Cuattromo, 42, set an example of what is happening "in the first world societies and Latin America that acts as a Vatican backyard, where the same [repair] demands are not felt, such as they are felt before European public opinion."
"As a survivor of childhood sexual abuse within the Catholic Church, with other companions survivors of this crime, we hope that the Pope will make an explicit mention of this question and an explicit reference to what he intends to do about it to pay off very large debts that, in our opinion, the Catholic Church still has to the victims," ​​said Cuattromo.
“We victims broke the taboo, silence, denial, concealment, with our struggles, with a huge sacrifice, and reached a level of visibility in public opinion,” which forced the church to face the problem.
Therefore, the global group of victims subscribed to a petition already delivered, in which they require “a true zero tolerance law that is established as canonical law”, which would “imply the immediate expulsion of the religious life of anyone involved in these acts”.
Moreover, they propose a “Truth Commission that should not be directed by the Vatican, but by international human rights organizations with the United Nations standards and with which the Vatican would have to fully cooperate, freeing all the archives he has on the subject”.
Finally, the victims intend a “justice process for the victims, where, among other things, there are concrete actions of reparation and justice for survivors around the world”, with the costs supported by the Church's own goods.

In the first person
In his particular case, Sebastian Cuattromo filed an action against a religious from a Catholic school of Buenos Aires for sexual abuse and won the process in 2012, even before the election to the Pope of then Cardinal Bergoglio, archbishop of the Argentine capital. "Then the city's Catholic hierarchy was against the victims and supported the school, which intended to silence the victims of this offense through a private economic agreement," he recalled.
"They made us feel a profound underestimation of the severity of the crime we were talking about," because, at that moment, "I was a young man who was fighting in solitude, with many doubts, with a lot less, with much anguish and felt an absolute lack of empathy and, instead, deep arrogance," he explained.
After Francis' election, "I invited him publicly and privately to meet with the victims of his country, especially those who had bad experiences," but the Pope "never had the courage or sensitivity of calling us."
For the new Pope, who is also accused of having ignored abuse complaints when he was a prior of the Augustinhos, Cuattromo expects Leo XIV to “assume this theme personally” and to be willing to “go to the last consequences”. Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost, 69, was elected Pope on Thursday after two days of Conclave, in the Vatican City, and took the name of Leo XIV.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Osaka 2025 | Japanese architect Kengo Kuma considers it to be friendly with architecture</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/12/osaka-2025-arquitecto-japones-kengo-kuma-considera-ia-amiga-da-arquitectura/</link><description>Japanese architect Kengo Kuma states in an interview with Lusa that she wanted to show the uniqueness between Portugal and Japan in the Portuguese Pavilion project at Expo 2025 Osaka and considers AI (artificial intelligence) friendly to architecture.
Asked if Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a friend or enemy of architecture, Kengo Kuma opts for the first option. "Yes, it's a friend", because in fact in the design process "we are working with AI".
Artificial intelligence “is a very strong team between us” and “we like to work” with this technology, he says. “We wanted to show the relationship with the ocean in Portugal,” says Kengo Kuma, when asked what was the project's inspiration. Portugal participates in Expo Osaka with the theme “Ocean, Blue Dialogue” and is located in the “Empowering Lives” zone, in a lot with 1,836.75 square meters, being close to the Japan Pavilion.
The Kuma Kuma project expresses the dynamics of the ocean moment, using 9,972 suspended cables weighing more than 60 tons, and recycled networks to create a perennial effect and exposed to natural elements such as sun and wind, according to the organization.
Sea connections
The life of Portugal and Japan is “very linked to the ocean”, in the sense that “we eat fish, we travel a lot through the oceans and history and life are closely linked to the ocean,” adds the architect. There is this “uniqueness of Portugal and Japan and we want to show” this similarity between the two countries.
The volume of the Portugal Pavilion is characterized by a scenic facility that symbolizes the upper square suspended as a wave.
"This design is very, very new to the history of art. We have long tried to use lines as a resource for navigation. With these lines, we try to show the beauty of natural phenomena," in the sea "we see natural light and breeze," he explains.
“We tried to bring this kind of natural phenomenon to the Expo, perhaps the first attempt in the history of the expo to bring its own nature to the pavilion,” says the architect. About what will happen to the pavilion after finishing the Expo, the architect says he wants to bring the diversity of the project (which includes cables of various diameters and lengths) to different places.
“I want to bring this diversity to different places” and “now we are planning to work with some artists” about it. Kengo Kuma said that the Slaughterhouse Project in Porto is completing and has two more projects in Portugal.
The architect says he loves the side of the big cities in Portugal, but also the mountainous side and the ocean of the country. “We want to enjoy the diversity of Portugal,” he says.
Create Memories
Asked how can the more sustainable architecture become currently become, Kengo Kuma considers that "the most important for sustainability is to leave the memory of architecture forever." That is, "architecture, life, basically, are not so permanent."
However, “we can leave the memory of architecture forever, which is the connection between architecture and humanity” and this “is the most important for sustainability,” he says. Used to comment on the controversy around his choice to project the Portuguese pavilion, the architect points out that he has an international office working in Portugal.
"Maybe that's why we were invited," he concludes. Regarding the challenges that architecture currently faces, Kengo Kuma states that its cost is increasing “dramatically” and that everyone wants to reduce it.
"But at the same time, people want to create a new monument" for this pillar. "And the cost and monumentality must walk together" today. Expo 2025 runs since April 13 and runs until October 13 on the artificial island of Yumeshima, located on the edge of Osaka, Kansai, Japan.</description><pubDate>2025-05-12 04:03:32</pubDate></item><item><title>Study | Foreign language students increasingly use AI</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/19/estudo-alunos-de-linguas-estrangeiras-usam-cada-vez-mais-a-ia/</link><description>A study by academics at Macao Polytechnic University concludes that 80 percent of a sample of 25 Portuguese students “regularly uses” artificial intelligence as a study tool. The authors of the study warn of the need for combination with traditional teaching and teacher education methods
 
To what extent is Artificial Intelligence (AI) being used by Chinese students to learn foreign languages, and how is this use done? A study developed by academics and teachers at Macao Polytechnic University (UPM) Vanessa Amaro and Manuel Pires concludes that the use is growing.
The work, entitled “Artificial and Natural: Interconnections and Balances in Ple”, published in the scientific journal “Millenium - Journal of Education, Technologies and Health”, concludes that, from a sample of 25 undergraduate students in UPM, “80 percent uses the AI. Lusophone ”.
Students concerned attend the third and fourth year of the course and were chosen because they have “a more advanced level of dominance of the Portuguese language and greater experience with different pedagogical approaches, including the use of technologies in teaching”.
In addition, "most participants were aged between 21 and 24 years, from various provinces in the interior of China (about 70 percent) and Macao", and "had prior experience in the use of AI tools for linguistic learning."
In general terms, the work points out that AI is increasingly important “in the learning of PLE [Portuguese as a foreign language]”, and that “the analysis of student interactions with AI for foreign languages ​​is critical to ensuring that technological solutions are worked based on their needs and expectations”.
It also states that the 25 students interviewed assume "a positive attitude towards the integration of AI in the learning of Portuguese, recognizing both significant advantages and its limitations." "A recurring theme was the need to maintain the balance between the use of AI and human interaction, highlighting the desire for language teaching open to new technologies, but without compromising the benefits of interpersonal relationships," the authors point out.
Tongue
If 80 percent of the students often resort to AI, what are the purposes of this use? The study points out that AI can support “the training of pronunciation, especially in the context of autonomous learning”. "Many have highlighted the neutrality of generated voices, which avoids regional influences, as an effective resource for developing correct habits in oral production." One student referred to the authors of the study that "the AI ​​voice is adjusted, there is no accent of any region and, therefore, it is good for students to train oral understanding with various types of texts beyond the materials given by the teacher in class."
In addition to pronunciation training, AI tools are also widely used for information research on Portuguese -speaking countries. “Students have recognized that these tools save time and allow more direct access to relevant content,” says the work, which highlights a student's response: “Help me to look for information about current trends in Brazil or Portugal, because books and information on the internet are dispersed and require many more time and much more time.”
However, it is stressed, based on the experience of both teachers, "that excessive use of AI tools has contributed to the significant reduction in the development of critical skills between students."
“More and more work, both written and oral, lack analytical depth, presenting advanced lexical and grammatical structures that do not correspond to the actual level of student proficiency. This disadvantage suggests a superficial relationship with study materials, where reflective effort and autonomous thinking are often replaced by the AMA automatically generated answers,” he concludes.
Complementarity is needed
According to Vanessa Amaro and Manuel Pires, the study allows us to conclude that “the integration of AI in foreign language teaching is an irreversible trend, but it requires a structured and careful pedagogical approach”.
"Most students [interviewed] recognized the importance of adapting language teaching into current technological reality, stressing the need to incorporate the AI ​​in a planned way. The balance between traditional methods and the use of new technologies is critical to ensuring effective learning," is concluded.
One of the students even defended that it is necessary to have a balance between AI and traditional methods, ”because“ language learning can be better and more interesting through AI, but it lacks the ability to create ideas and imagination, as well as the intercultural aspects of language learning ”.
Thus, for the students inquired, “the presence of the teacher, as a mediator of knowledge, is seen as essential, especially in the specific context of Macau, where there is no linguistic immersion during the learning process of Portuguese”.
Human interaction is, in addition to the “transmission of linguistic content, the ability to interpret cultural, social and emotional aspects, something that was going, despite its technical efficiency, cannot replicate”.
Vanessa Amaro and Manuel Pires also highlight the fact that “AI ethical and pedagogical challenges in teaching are complex and multifaceted”. This is because "data privacy is a central concern, as many AI tools collect personal information that can be used for purposes that users are unaware of." Moreover, “the risk of algorithmic bias can be a pertinent issue, because if the algorithms produce results that are systematically incorrect, biased or unfair, it can accentuate difficulties and inequalities in learning and require extra care in its use and regulation,” is indicated.
The authors also consider that "the excessive dependence of AI can compromise human interaction, essential for the development of social and cultural skills present in educational processes."
Given that "in the teaching of foreign languages ​​there seems to be several speeds in the integration of AI, with higher education institutions that do so gradually and even with enough reservations, as well as those that are most developed and proactive in the way they embrace these technologies", it is necessary to "foster dialogue and cooperation between the various teaching agents to understand the potential of AI".</description><pubDate>2025-05-19 02:27:04</pubDate></item><item><title>Startups | Portugal interested in the SINO-LUSOPHONE TECHNOLOGY FUND</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/09/startups-portugal-interessado-no-fundo-sino-lusofono-de-tecnologia/</link><description>A delegation from Macao, with government representatives and local startups, is in Portugal to meet with leaders of Portuguese companies and participate in the SIM conference, which ends today in Porto. During the visit, a protocol was signed that signs the Portuguese interest in the new Sino-Lusophone Technology Fund, managed by Heng Qin Group's state-owned company Zhuhai
 
Several macao startups are represented on a trip to Portugal this week, and whose delegation also includes representatives of the Directorate of Economics and Tourism Development Services (DSEDT) and the Macao, China and Portuguese -speaking countries Association (AEIMCP). The objective is to strengthen ties with the entrepreneurship ecosystems of Lisbon and Porto and reinforce Portugal's interest in the new Sino-Lusophone Technology Fund designed to support startups, which will be managed by Heng Qin Group's Zhuhai state company.
In this sense, a protocol between AEIMCP and the nascent Value, “Portuguese company with extensive investor capture” and also “accelerating small business growth (SME) and startups in Portugal and Portuguese-speaking countries, focused on innovation and cutting-edge technology”, is signed on Monday, in Lisbon, in Lisbon, in Lisbon.
The protocol signed on Monday signs the highest Portuguese access to the new Sino-Lusophone Technology Fund. The document was signed as part of a visit from the Macau Group to Lispolis - Lisbon Technological Pole.
The nascent Value thus becomes a “exclusive agent for investor capture services in Portugal, focusing on the involvement of investors in the background” SINO-LUSOPHONE, whose official name is “from Heng Qin Sino-Maluso Technology and Innovation Investment LPF”. This “promotes investments in high quality science and technology innovation companies in Portuguese -speaking countries”, explains the same note.
Thus, this protocol will allow AEIMCP, as a connecting entity between Portugal and the Fund via Macau, and the nascent Value, “reinforce its commitment to support startups, promote transfronhoring investment and create new opportunities for collaboration between Macau, Portugal and other Portuguese -speaking countries”.
Quoted by the same note, AEIMCP's Marco Duarte Rizzolio, said this new agreement shows how the entity, which also organizes the “929 Challenge” contest, is committed to “creating bridges for the global startup growth, facilitating the entry of Portuguese startups into the Chinese market through Macao, as well as the expansion of Chinese startups to Portugal and Europe”.
In turn, Rui Ferreira said that “the signing of this protocol is an important milestone for connecting innovation ecosystems and promoting synergies between macao startups and Portuguese investors”. "We are confident that this partnership will bring significant results for both sides," he added.
At HM, Rui Ferreira explained that the signature of the protocol represents the culmination of a work of about a year.
“We want to promote a model of welcoming startups and companies from Macao that want to enter Europe through Portugal, as well as in Portuguese-expression countries, and vice versa, that is, to place, through Macau, companies of these territories, but always through Portugal, in the East, in order to obtain easier connections with the Chinese market.”
Thousand Visits
Macao's group visited several essential points of the Portuguese entrepreneurship sector. In addition to the visit to Lispolis, considered the “key moment to foster dialogues between Deep Tech startups and potential investors, consolidating Macau's vision as an innovation and entrepreneurship hub with global range”, the entourage passed through the unicorns factory in Lisbon, and the PWC consultant.
Marco Duarte Rizzolio explained to HM the benefits to Macao from the journey through Portugal. “In addition to the interest in the Sino-Lusophone Fund and its preparation, as it will be released soon, our focus has also been the startups. On the visit to Lispolis macao startups made a pitch [attempted investment tarning], presented their products and had a networking session with other startups. Immersion in the Entrepreneurship Ecosystem in Portugal. ”
According to Marco Duarte Rizzolio, Macao's entourage only took to Portugal to startups with a more advanced business phase, namely Zence Object, founded by Calvin Sio and obtained a $ 2.5 million financing from the Alibaba Group entrepreneurs to the Great Bay area. Zence Object uses patented technology to transform organic waste, namely tea leaves, into alternative plastic and paper products. The idea is that these recycled and transformed products can be used on a daily basis, such as home or decorating utensils.
"There are startups in Macau who are very advanced in terms of business and we have brought to Portugal. We want to explore new opportunities for internationalization, so that they explore other markets, as these startups already have some development. We want to create partnerships, so that these representatives realize what the market is like and explore possible customers," said the representative of AEIMCP.
By unbeaten paths
Macao's entourage is today in Porto to participate in “SIM Conference” [Startups &amp; Investment Matching], where “it will have its own stand to present projects and connect with investors and possible customers”. This event was organized by the Entity Startup Portugal, which invited to be present.
Also today will be signed another protocol, this time between the association that organizes the contest “929 Challenge” and Startup Portugal. The idea is, according to Marco Duarte Rizzolio, “stimulate the connection of the Portugal ecosystem with Macau and help in the process of internationalization of the startups on both sides, both the Portuguese who are intended for the great bay, through Macau, both the macao startups that go to Portugal”.
The official has no doubt that what is lacking in knowledge is left in interest. “There is a great interest in China, but at the same time there is a great ignorance. The startup ecosystem in Portugal is much more linked to Europe. When we talk to the unicorns factory, it has been told that there was a great interest in the Macao and China market, but that these visits to Portugal were lacking. It is growing a lot in technology and artificial intelligence, with the launch of DeepSeek, for example. ”
According to Rui Ferreira, the presence of the delegation of Macao in “Yes Conference” will allow access to “privileged and wider contacts”, as it is a national event. "With this visit we have been able to do two things: starting the relationship with AEIMCP more formally and helping Macao companies know of partners and investors. We also want to bet on the work for the future Sino-Musso fund, to prepare companies with investment potential," he said.
For Rui Ferreira, the Macao market has the potential “to be used as a business exchange platform, thanks to linguistic connection, and there is conditions in the territory to establish all the part of reception, support and exchange with China entities and create an ecosystem”. In addition, “it will be interesting Macao to make a specialized innovation hub in strategic areas”, which in this case is technology. Highlight for the fact that the visit also had the organization of the Macao Sino-Lusophone Platform Association for sustainable development.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Literature | The interest of linguist Hugo Schuchardt in Patuá de Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/07/literatura-o-interesse-do-linguista-hugo-schuchardt-no-patua-de-macau/</link><description>Hugo Schuchardt had a genuine interest in Luso-Asian Creole languages, with particular emphasis on Patuá, spoken by the Macaense community. The linguist, who was born in 1842, was the subject of a lecture conducted by researcher Hugo Cardoso, linked to the University of Lisbon
 
Porto, 1883. José Leite de Vasconcelos writes a letter to the German linguist Hugo Schuchardt who had been developing studies, albeit at a distance, about the languages ​​spoken in Asia originated in Portuguese, the so -called Creoles. The letter, written according to the spell agreement of the time, however digitized and today to keep the Archive of the University of Graz, Austria, comes in the context of Schuchardt's own requests to Vasconcelos Milk on the Creole that was then spoken in Macao, known as Patuá.
“My respectable friend: I can only respond to you today. Here in Porto there are no books that say, but I wrote to Lisbon to my friend Vianna and he replied that the Balsmanha does not appear, and that in Macao's story there comes nothing about the dialect port. From Macau. Usual.
I have already asked for information about the Creoles, but I have not yet got anything; This study also interests me about regarding Portuguese. I look forward to the 2 new booklets that promises me. (…) Without anymore I am a friend, J. Vasconcelos Leite, Porto, S. Victor, 25 ”.
Hugo Schuchardt's interest in Luso-Asian Creole has been studied by Hugo Cardoso, a researcher and professor at the Faculty of Letters of the University of Lisbon (FLUL), a Creole specialist who developed investigation at the University of Macao.
O académico conduziu recentemente uma palestra na Biblioteca Nacional, em Lisboa, sobre o linguista nascido em Gotha, na Alemanha, em 1842 e falecido em Graz, Áustria, em 1927, sendo considerado um dos mais importantes linguistas dos finais do século XIX e primórdios do século XX. The session was called “Hugo Schuchardt and the search for the Luso-Asian Creole”.
Despite Schuchardt's interest on Macao's Creole, he did not publish any academic work on the subject, as he told HM Hugo Cardoso. "Schuchardt did not publish any work on Macau. However, when he covered his correspondence, it is clear that Macau was also on his radar, since he discusses the Macao Creole with several of his correspondents, including Vasconcelos milk and Gonçalves Viana," he said.
After the German linguist, Hugo Cardoso highlights, “there were actually several people who leaned over Macau Creole, including Danilo Barreiros, José dos Santos Ferreira (Adé), Graciete Batalha, Ana Maria Amaro and, more recently, Prof. Raúl Gaião and Prof. Mário Pinharanda Nunes”. Also noteworthy is the study of Marie Arana-ward "about the Creole spoken by the descendants of Macanese in Hong Kong."
This is another change of correspondence with Vasconcelos milk, dated December 28, 1889, in which books and dictionaries about Portuguese and Chinese are mentioned. “Exmo. Friend: I hurried to respond to your ticket, since you are in a hurry. What I know from China-Portuguese is as follows: J. A. Gonçalves,-Portuguese Dictionary and China-Portuguese. Macau 1831;-China art, Alphabeto and Grammatica. (…) I estimate you to have good shoes. Friend thanks, José Leite de Vasconcellos ”.
The role of rabbit
Hugo Cardoso, whose doctoral thesis is called “The Indo-Portuguese Language of Diu”, former territory of the so-called Portuguese India along with Goa and Damão, spoke at the National Library of Hugo Schuchardt's Studies around this Creole and also the language of Batávia/Tugu in Indonesia.
For the professor at FLUL, pioneering in the study of the Creoles is an expression that rhymes with Schuchardt. The German linguist was "absolutely pioneering in this domain, not only in the study of the Luso-Sasitive Creole or even the Portuguese Lexical Base Creoles globally, but in the study of Creole languages ​​in general" and, for this reason, is "a larger figure in the history of linguistics."
Hugo Cardoso also points out that "as regards the Portuguese lexical base creoles, before him, there had been some activity, especially by Adolfo Coelho, who, in 1881, had published" Romanesque or Neo-Latin dialects in Africa, Asia and America, "in which he was a caught in various Portuguese-based Creole." However, in this work, Adolfo Coelho refers only to three Luso-Asiatic Creole: “Ceylon's (at Sri Lanka), Malaca and Macau's-giving some examples that he could get from previous publications (such as Macau's Ta-Ss-Yang-Kuo magazine)”.
The academic has no doubt that “Hugo Schuchardt was surely inspired by Rabbit's work, but his efforts to obtain primary data from many other Asian places greatly expanded the cartography of the Luso-Asian Creole and resulted in the first published news and the first grammatical descriptions of many of them (such as Diu, Cananor, Mahé, Mangolor, Mangar, Mangar etc.) ”.
Future inspirations
According to Hugo Cardoso, the German linguist left works that inspired future academics and many materials from the personal archive. "One effect of his work was to inspire other agents to develop similar work: there stands out the figure of Sebastião Rodolfo Dalgado, who led his own research and made his own publications about the Indo-Portuguese Creoles that Schuchardt had not approached, about Damão, Bombaim, Ceylon and Negapath."
In the case of José de Leite Vasconcelos, who wrote the letter cited at the beginning of this text, "it also corresponded with Schuchardt and reveals, in his linguistic studies, the impact of Schuchardt's work."
Asked by HM about the possible interconnections between the Creole of IUD, Batávia and Macao, Hugo Cardoso states that there are "continuities between the various Luso-Asian Creole, but also many differences." "The Batávia/Tugu Creole is the one that most resembles Creole de Macao, for example, at the Lexicon level. But this is understandable because it has already shown that Macao Creole has an important historical connection with the Creole that developed in Southeast Asia, in particular Malaca."
According to an academic article by Hugo Cardoso himself written in partnership with Tjerk Hagemeijer and Nélia Alexandre, entitled “Portuguese Lexical Base Creoles”, these “were, in most cases, oral languages ​​to the nineteenth century, when the first collections of oral traditions, texts and translations began to emerge, being linked“ to maritime expansion in Africa and Asia, the result of the contact, the result of the contact, the result of the contact, the result of the contact between the contact. Portuguese and different African and Asian languages ​​”.
Also according to the same article, "some of these Crioulos, namely in Asia, were extinguished, having only recorded from the transition from the nineteenth century to the twentieth century. With the exception of the Creole of Alta Guinea, the vitality of the living Portuguese Creole is generally decreasing."
In the case of Creoles of Portuguese origin in the southern Asia area, they emerged from the arrival of Vasco da Gama to Calecute, India, in 1498, especially from the phase in which the entire base of the Portuguese empire the East focuses on Goa. According to the same academic article, several Creole were developed, the so-called “Indo-Portuguese” in coastal areas of India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Burma. "Currently, its presence is much reduced: they survive those of IUD, Damão, Korlai, Cananor and Sri Lanka (Ceylon) - which, despite having, has once been used all over the island, is currently restricted to the cities of Batticaloa and Trinchomalee," is highlighted in the article. The author draws attention to the extinction in 2010 of the Vaipim Creole, in Cochim, due to the "death of what seems to have been the last fluent speaker in this region." There are then the Southeast Asia and East Asia Creole, which includes Macao. Patuá is currently “spoken with native fluency only by some people in Macau and the Macanese diaspora”, is mentioned.</description><pubDate>2025-05-07 01:19:43</pubDate></item><item><title>PME | Events promoted by Melco generated $ 1 million</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/06/pme-eventos-promovidos-pela-melco-geraram-1-milhao-de-dolares/</link><description>Melco Resorts claims to have generated about $ 1 million for small and medium -sized local businesses through events promoted last year. In the 2024 sustainability report, the game operator also highlights the results in terms of waste management and energy spending
 
The Melco Resorts &amp; Entertainment Sustainability Report has just been published last year, which highlights the gains obtained by small and medium -sized (SMEs) with the events promoted by the operator. With regard to the “community engagement and investment” part, it is read that “more than $ 1.02 million for local companies and [NGO] non-governmental organizations in Macao through 21 SME events, with 603 SME and NGO participants” were generated. In addition, in the volunteering area, Melco points out that "about 3,600 participants offered their time and effort in more than 359 volunteering initiatives," "more than $ 17.42 million that were donated to decent causes in our communities."
Quoted by the report, Lawrence Ho, Melco's president and executive director, says that "21 Heart of House initiatives and community events have generated more than $ 1 million for local companies in Macao, providing 603 SMEs and NGO opportunities to connect, expand and grow." According to the official, last year were "in -depth partnerships with PME and NGO".
Regarding the relationship with local SMEs, Melco also highlights the connection with the supply chain, because “86 percent of acquisitions arose from local companies in Macao”, and of this total, “59 percent were local SME acquisitions”. Similar scenario occurred in the other operators that Melco holds in Cyprus and Manila, with local acquisitions around 40 and 76 percent, respectively.
Regarding the company's training actions, Melco says it has invested on average "582 US dollars per full -time worker in learning and development activities, which is equivalent to an average of 38 hours of training." In this context, “100 percent of colleagues participated in training actions”, can be read. In addition, "over 758,000 participants have attended more than 1,400 courses offered by" Melco Learning Academy ", which is equivalent to over 870,000 hours of learning." Also noteworthy is that, in all Melco projects, "women represent 23 percent of the boards of business and 32 percent of the higher paintings."
The report also tells that “63 percent of positions at the vice-presidency level, or above this post, were filled from local communities, increasing to 70 percent in Macao”, can read.
All for the environment
Another of the areas highlighted in Melco's sustainability report concerns environmental policies. One of the areas that is “in progress” is the energy consumption, in order to obtain more reasonableness of consumption. "In 2024, despite an increase of 39 percent in terms of the number of visitors and the rise of 19 percent in the occupation rate of the hotel rooms, along with the addition of a property and a new resort integrated into our portfolio, the energy intensity increased by 10 percent from 2023, but was 19 percent lower than our year of reference 2019."
One of the “achieved” objectives is the energy efficiency measures, which “since 2018 has resulted in an annualized savings of more than 62.5 million kWh, an increase of 9 percent compared to 2023”. Another "achieved" goal concerns the installation of "over 25,000 photovoltaic panels on all properties in Macau, Manila and Cyprus, generating about 10,000 kWh annually." Thus, in the properties of Melco "the electricity consumption from renewable sources increased by 72 percent compared to 2023".
Regarding the group's means of transportation, “buses, electric and hybrid vehicles represent 55 percent of our combined fleet, with loading stations, an increase of 25 percent compared to 2023”.
In terms of materials and waste management, Melco says it has avoided plastic spending in the order of 13.2 million bottles, thanks to the installation of “the Nordaq water filtering system that serves almost every hotel rooms in Melco's integrated resorts”.
In addition, the example of the City of Dreams venture in Manila is presented where “a circular economy system was established in which food waste is decomposed on site, and the excess donated to a local fifth to cultivate some of the vegetables served to guests”.
In terms of water consumption, the report indicates that “despite the increase in the number of visitors and the hotel occupancy rate”, “total water consumption and water intensity increased only 6 and 2 percent compared to 2023, respectively, and were 6 and 30 percent lower, respectively, to the 2019 reference year”. However, this is a goal that, according to the company, is still "in progress".
Another objective highlighted in the report was the “annual economy of over 510,820 cubic meters of water through water efficiency measures, an increase of 10 percent compared to 2023 ″.
"As we invest in people and communities, we continue to derive environmental efforts with the same determination. (…) The intensity of energy and water consumption, as well as greenhouse gas emissions, remained significantly below our 2019 base line, even adding a new property and an integrated resort," says Lawrence Ho.
The entrepreneur also referred to the increase "of the amount of valuable materials diverted through recycling and composting in global operations - 58 percent over last year." “In our restoration spaces we also fight food waste, with the 'clean dish challenge' to contribute to a 9 percent reduction in waste in the Macao and Manila restoration areas.”
“Mentality change”
For Lawrence Ho, greater sustainability in Melco requires "a change of mindset" verified in "small actions that, on scale, can have a significant impact."
Regarding the supply chain of the group's integrated hotels and resorts, good results are also highlighted. "Although the numbers do not always show exponential heels, our focus on responsible supply remains unwavering, 18 percent of all seafood bought by weight to be sustainable sources, and 100 percent of our food and drink points in Macao and Manila to serve eggs of outdoor chickens," he reads.
There is thus "an effort that reflects a deeper ambition to incorporate sustainability into acquisitions," said Lawrence Ho, who added that "more than one service, hospitality has to do with the experience it creates, the people it supports and the impact it leaves."
“Every year, Melco challenges himself to go further, believing that luxury and responsibility are not opposite forces, but partners in progress, which is reflected in the way we defend strong governance, we manage our environmental impact, we support our people and communities and lead the responsible game. This commitment to progress shaped our approach in 2024, as a year of recalibration in which we continue to strengthen operations, operations, rekindle the impetus and ensure that our integrated resorts remain at the forefront of excellence, ”he concluded.</description><pubDate>2025-05-06 00:08:47</pubDate></item><item><title>Traffic | Government advances with review of 42 treadmills</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/20/transito-governo-avanca-com-revisao-de-42-passadeiras/</link><description>The Directorate of Services for Traffic Affairs (DSAT) is proceeding to “Integral Review” of 42 intersections where there are sites in the Black Areia and Iao Hon.

The guarantee took the form of an order signed by Sam Hou Fai, published yesterday in the Official Bulletin
 
"A 7,000 patacas amount of 7,000 Patacas is awarded in 2025, as an extraordinary division of budget balances, to the holder of the individual account of the non -compulsory central pension regime that fulfills the legal requirements." This is how the Chief Executive made the distribution of the support yesterday, through an order published in the official bulletin, something that had already announced during the presentation of the government lines for this year. The order came into force yesterday.
It is recalled that the government led by Ho Iat Seng has suspended the assignment of support, intended for elderly residents, for three years marked by the crisis born of the Covid-19 pandemic. At the time, the executive justified the measure with the lack of financial balances due to the descent of tax revenues, while the economy of the territory was paralyzed by measures to combat pandemic.
How and when
Extraordinary Budget Balances sharing has begun to add support to the Social Assistance Network of elderly residents and the social security regime. The recipients of the 7,000 patacas are permanent residents over 65 years old who meet the requirements for assignment of support and are registered on the lists to receive the money.
Last year, the funds began to be distributed to the first beneficiaries on September 25. The first group that received the 7,000 patacas last year consisted of over 82,000 people. However, in total, according to social security fund data, the universe of support beneficiaries was almost 390,000 people.
It is recalled that the MSAR has closed the third quarter of this year with a higher public account surplus than the government forecast for the entire year 2025, according to the announcement of the finance services of late April. In the first three months, the surplus reached 9.25 billion patacas, 11.8 percent than in the same period as 2024.</description><pubDate>2025-05-20 01:43:27</pubDate></item><item><title>Trade War | Frederico Maistece Visit by Xia Baolong</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/20/guerra-comercial-frederico-ma-enaltece-visita-de-xia-baolong/</link><description>The president of the Macao Commercial Association, Frederico MA, considers that the visit to Macao of the Hong Kong and Macau affairs office director with the Council of State, Xia Baolong, brought confidence to the “social sectors” of the territory, at a time of great concern and economic uncertainty due to commercial war between Washington and Beijing.

Given these requests, Frederico MA has ensured that entrepreneurs will accelerate economic diversification and hengqin development.</description><pubDate>2025-05-20 01:41:54</pubDate></item><item><title>Economy | Deputy defends SME Promotion Law</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/20/economia-deputado-defende-lei-de-promocao-de-pme/</link><description>Deputy José Chui Sai Peng defended in yesterday's debate of the Legislative Assembly the elaboration of a new proposal for the Small and Medium Enterprises (SME).

The PS followed, with 28.5 percent of the votes and the arrival, which totaled 10.4 percent
 
The Democratic Alliance (AD) won the face -to -face vote at the Portuguese Consulate in Macao, within the 2025 Legislative Elections, to choose the new Constitution of the Assembly of the Republic of Portugal. With 133 of the 233 registered in the consulate to vote in person, the election had a participation rate of 57.1 percent, resulting in an abstention rate of 42.9 percent.
The list led by the Prime Minister Luís Montenegro brought together a total of 58 votes, among the 133 voters, which represented a proportion of 43.5 percent of the voters.
In second place was the Socialist Party (PS) with 38 votes, which meant a proportion of 28.5 percent, followed by the arrival (CH), with 14 votes, a proportion of 10.4 percent.
In fourth place, with six votes, was the list of Free (L), Rui Tavares, with a proportion of 4.5 percent of the votes, followed by the lists of the liberal initiative (IL) and Unit Democratic Coalition (CDU), each with five votes, equivalent to 3.8 percent for each list.
Among the forces that also gathered votes include the Left Block (BE), with two votes (1.5 percent), and reacting to include recycling (RIR), with a vote (0.8 percent). In addition to the votes in the parties there were also four blank votes, a proportion of 3 percent. The face -to -face votes must also be added to the remaining votes of the emigration of the circle outside Europe, and will result in the election of two deputies.
Inside
At national level, and at a time when the results of the circles of emigration are missing, AD was the winner of the electoral night, electing 89 deputies and obtaining a proportion of 32.7 percent of the votes.
Second place was occupied by the PS, with 58 elected deputies, a proportion of 23.4 percent of the votes, on equality with the arrival, which elected the same number of deputies, but with a lower vote proportion (22.6 percent).
In fourth place was the liberal initiative, with nine elected deputies (5.5 percent of the votes), followed by Livre, with six deputies (4.2 percent of the votes) and the CDU, which got three terms (3.0 percent). In addition to these parliamentary groups, a deputy also elected the lists of the Left Bloc (2.0 percent), people-nimals in nature (1.4 percent) and together for the people (0.3 percent).
Emigrants will decide
The determination of national results causes the votes of emigration to be decisive to determine the second largest political force in the Assembly of the Republic.
In last year's legislatures, AD won the votes of emigration outside Europe, where the votes of Macao are accounted for when choosing a deputy. Second place in this circle was occupied by CH, who elected the other deputy. In the circle within Europe, CH was the most voted party, and the PS elected the other deputy. If these results were repeated, CH surpass the PS as the second most represented force in Parliament. However, these results should only be known within approximately 10 days, as it is necessary to count the votes by correspondence.

The legislators demanded changes in the economic panorama, including Leong Sun Iok. "The Xia Director attributed great importance to the progress of the proper diversification of the economy of Macao. With economic changes and external influences, the game sector faces certain challenges and it is necessary to boost that economic diversification. But we come across, in practice, with many difficulties," he said, highlighting "limited resources" and insufficient structures taking into account "industry development."
In turn, Deputy Lei Chan U recalled that Xia Baolong "said it was necessary to unite efforts to accelerate the development of the proper diversification of the economy, promote the construction of the deepened cooperation zone and treat the development of Hengqin as its own subject in Macao." Law Chan U expects to “Macao's economic resilience increases, they can be provided to residents more employment opportunities with development prospects, promoting a high quality job for the population”.
Wu Chou Kit defended greater “coordinated development” between Macau and Hengqin above all at the level of “articulation of commercial exploitation regime rules” and also in the case of construction of works and infrastructure.</description><pubDate>2025-05-20 01:37:17</pubDate></item><item><title>Mental Health | Ron Lam asks for an end to the “ostrich policy”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/20/saude-mental-ron-lam-pede-fim-da-politica-de-avestruz/</link><description>Ron Lam accuses the government of following an “ostrich policy” and little or nothing to wage the growing trend of suicides in recent years. The deputy defended yesterday in the Legislative Assembly more transparency in the dissemination of data and prevention measures in the area of ​​mental health
 
In the interventions period before the order of yesterday's Plenary Session of the Legislative Assembly (AL), Ron Lam accused the government of following a “ostrich policy” in relation to mental health, referring to a kind of policy that hides true problems. "I ask the government to abandon the current ostrich policy and proactively create specific and objective mechanisms, to publicize the social communication the essential information about suicide cases," said the deputy.
In the same question, the deputy suggested that the executive "continue to provide gross data in publications and statistical studies, so that society and the sectors concerned to become aware and pay attention to mental health and suicide", arguing that it is necessary to "define clear objectives to reduce the number of suicides."
Regarding the government's response, the deputy pointed out that "the services responsible for its execution, through interdepportal collaboration and the reinforcement of the investment, must ensure that people have sufficient access to support, in order to actually lock suicide."
The deputy did not fail to make concrete criticism of the current performance, arguing that "the information currently disclosed by the government is limited." "For example, the numbers of suicide deaths released by health services (SS) are quarterly and through press notes, with data classified according to sex, Macao residence and ages. As this data is not complete, it is not possible to make an analysis and comparison, and society can no longer discuss this topic," he said.
The criticism also goes to the Directorate of Youth Education and Development Services (DSEDJ), because "it never responds to a student's suicide issues, that is, it simply does not disclose them." In addition, “according to some people in the area of ​​psychology, in previous SS reports on the 'health behavior in macao student health behavior', data on secondary school students' self -harm acts were included, but in the recent report these data were eliminated,” said the legislator.
It is the fault of the economy
During the debate dedicated to the vote, in the specialty, the change to the general staff of private school teachers, Ron Lam presented the latest statistical data that demonstrate the growing trend of suicide deaths in recent years, noting that "according to some voices, if economics and society remain in an adverse society, the problem of suicide is likely to be more serious."
In oral interpellation, data already advanced by Wong Sio Chak, secretary for security, is cited for 91 suicide deaths last year, "with the rate reaching 13.6 per 100,000 people, a significantly higher than 9 to 10 people." Also according to the deputy, "the suicide rate in Macau increased 44 percent in the space of 10 years, compared to the 9.4 cases recorded in 2015", and "the situation of young people also deserves attention".
In 2024, "4 cases of suicide were reported between 5 and 14 years, more than one case for the first time in the last 10 years, and 9 cases between 15 and 24 years, which is the largest number in the last 10 years." "This demonstrates that it is pressing attention and dealing with the suicide problem in Macau," he said.</description><pubDate>2025-05-20 01:36:15</pubDate></item><item><title>Princess Mononoke 520 (i)</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/20/princess-mononoke-520-i/</link><description>In the last scene of the movie “Princess Mononoke” (“幽灵公主”), performed by Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki, San chooses to stay in the forest and Ashitaka decides to return to the village. Although they are loved, the moral of history is the mutual respect and liberation of the other so that it can freely live their choices.
The end of this relationship reminds me of a television series broadcast on mainland China called “the story of my best friend” (“流金歲月”). The protagonist is a successful middle-aged businessman and the protagonist is a university student who has just graduated. A casual meeting provoked a love story. Due to the difference in ages, the hero ends up let the heroine go freely behind his dreams.
Later, the heroine married and had a son. When her husband's business was on the verge of bankruptcy, the hero took the initiative to abandon his own business and offered to work with executive director to his beloved's husband and save the company. He also promised to form his husband to become an excellent boss in three years. In the end, the heroine divorced, but the hero continued not to want to marry her. Once again, he let her go in freedom. The heroine eventually left for Beijing to invest in her career and the story ended here.
The Princess Mononoke and the story of my best friend coincidentally express two points of view about love. Firstly, loving truly means being happy with the happiness of the other. When he is sad, we also sadden, and we sincerely want the best to our beloved. Secondly, true love is free. Lovers do not kidnap themselves or restrict each other in the name of love, because this kind of love is not true, but a kind of control to satisfy self-love. This kind of love ends up imprisoning the other on a cage. Therefore, Princess Mononoke's famous makes it “I come to see you when you miss me.”
Love implies mutual companionship, care and attachment. Companionship means that the two are together and that they accompany themselves mutually. Beware means that we are available to each other whenever you need us. Attachment is loyalty to love. Companionship and care requires time and living in communion is a good foundation. We only take care and follow the people who are dear to us, do not do it for each other. This is attachment.
Mutual companionship, care and attachment are important elements that constitute love. Once these elements are established, they integrate the lives of lovers. When we get sick, the other takes care of us unconditionally. This is careful. If the disease is prolonged and your love continues to take care of you unconditionally, this is companionship. Don't leave you when you are sick. This is attachment. Lovers need time to obtain these three elements. Today you can walk and speak, you are not sick or suffering, so you cannot understand the importance of these three elements.
When do people get more susceptible to the disease? The answer, of course, is when they get older, with age we are contracting various health problems. In the days they run, how many couples are they together in this way? Only with true companionship, care and attachment, we cry and laugh together and wish each other's good. As we mentioned in last week's article, one of Sean Lau Ching Wan's iconic phrases about love is: “One day you will realize that you do not want to live a passionate love, but to have someone who never gives up or ever abandoning you.”
Next week we will continue to analyze the messages of Princess Mononoke and the story of my best friend.

I had asked for a bifana and an imperial. I thought about the people I was watching to pass. In the difference with which humans externalize their habits in the most diverse ways of presenting themselves. Girls and boys passed with the new fashion of listening to the ears, something that, according to several clinicians, you will leave the new generation completely deaf at 60 years of age, because they hear the music at most decibels; They passed renovated with their cane; They passed mothers with their strollers carrying the babies.
It is a pleasure to realize that birth does not stop, but it is sad to know that many young people cannot and do not want to have children for lack of financial conditions to raise them and because the situation of hospital urgencies for pregnant women is chaos; Men of folder and fact and tie passed, possibly lawyers or superior staff of the municipality; They passed children appearing 12 or 13 years old with their backpack in such a way that it benefits the future of their vertebral columns; They passed the elderly with dementia with an African arm -armful lady.
Oh, if it weren't for immigrants… I don't know who I worked on continuing care institutions, in the homes, thousands of Portuguese and high -class houses such as maids, restaurants and cafes, agriculture and construction works. And we still have politicians who want immigrants outside Portugal, when we have always been a country that forced the factuality that we have millions emigrated from the four corners of the world; They passed salespeople of this and that. I think I said about six times that I was not interested in watches, wallets, glasses, hats or lighters; Police passed in the conversation and no cap in their heads. I still remember when the police officers traveled to the gridy uniform streets and contained as a superior uniformed military man. Today they don't care anyone and it seems that we are the ones who are to blame for their low wages.
At the beyond moment, a citizen with poorly arranged gray hair came next to me, his beard to do, with old or unin-clean clothes and said anything I didn't realize. I replied that I had not changed because I paid the bill with the ATM card. The individual babered a few more words and I asked to repeat. He told me he wasn't asking for money. I wanted me to pay him a cake because I was hungry. I answered him affirmatively and continuous act I asked what I was doing. He answered me, surprisingly, that he was a writer. Writer? I told him to sit at the table and asked him if he wanted a bifana and an imperial. He answered me with a smile.
"So you are a writer and are hungry, certainly for lack of money, no?"
- That's it.
- But, there's no money why?
- Because I have a renovation of 700 euros, paid 450 for income, I have to buy some non -reimbursement medicines, paid for electricity, gas, water and I have very little money for food. I haven't bought clothes or shoes for five years.
- And does social security not give you support?
"I've tried three times and I haven't gotten anything yet."
- Listen, my dear, what do you write?
"Have I wrote two books about Captain Salgueiro Maia and one about what was the Armed Forces movement?"
- And where can I buy your books?
- exhausted.
- And the publisher didn't pay you the sales commissions?
- No, because we woke up that I would not pay anything for the production of the works but would not receive anything for sales.
He arrived in Bifana and the imperial for my interlocutor and from a goal drank the alcohol liquid and from almost a bifano bite. The hunger was great and the tears stood my eyes.
- O friend, eat another bifana ...
- If you can, thank you very much.
"Don't treat me for sir, call me André and give me your home so I send you anything that tells me you need and your bank account number to when I can send you a few Euros."
The writer, who asked me not to mention his name, after telling him that I wrote in the blogosphere and would approach that meeting. He thanked me sensitized and as he retired only told me that I had "fallen from heaven."
- Why do you say that?
- Because these days there are very few people who help others.
The writer went to his life and let me meditate on the hidden poverty that is ran through our Portugal. A poverty that intensifies from year to year and that politicians whistle to the side. Poverty in Portugal is a reality that affects almost two million people, representing 16.4 percent of the population at risk of poverty or social exclusion, according to recent data. Although the risk rate of poverty decreased by 2023, income inequality and poverty remain significant challenges for the country, with children, young people, and single -padded families being the most vulnerable groups. In Portugal, one in five people lives at risk of poverty or social exclusion.
The poor are poorer in Portugal. The evolution of the main indicators of inequality, poverty and social exclusion released by the National Institute of Statistics (INE), from the inquiry into living and income conditions, performed in 2024, shows some contradictory signs, which should be read with additional care. A part of these contradictory signs results from the different periods of observation of their main variables.
While the level of income, inequality and poverty levels reflect the reality of 2023, the indicators of material and social deprivation and social exclusion translate the reality existing on the date of the inquiry, that is, from March to June 2024.
However, the most important thing is that there is a lot of hidden pope in our country and there are hungry "writers" and that they have the dignity and courage to ask the streets that someone hungry them, and this is the saddest of a reality that the political class does not show concern, especially in keeping renovated with monthly peculi of 200, 300 or 400 euros.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>The Great America (III)</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/16/a-grande-america-iii-2/</link><description>(Continuation of the May 15th edition)
And then they said, too many times, that Europe is in the laws of history, but who knows these laws of history? And who has ever prevented men, especially the great men, from going against the laws of history? We were in 1966. Sumantra Maitra is right when asking them "what happened to you? To exhort them, with some emphasis, to the role of a" key western country. "
His thesis crosses the geopolitics of the maritime periphery of forty -end memory, updated for current crises, such as the tensions between Turks, Greeks and French, the attcluded allies of fact aligned with themselves. What happens if a conflict bursts? Italy could focus on creating local devices in some key areas, assuming the task of providing logistical and structural support.
Italians have a well -structured navy. This is a domain in which they could make a considerable contribution, dealing with training and safety in the southern and north back. Trump and the Pentagon are correct, as we the Europeans provide logistics, along with secret services, cybernetics and anything useful. But it is the Italians who put their boots on the ground.
An idea that they rejected when Trump 1.0 invited them to recover Libya. It was not a matter of imitating the failed landing conceived by the then Chairman of the Council of Ministers Giovanni Giolitti (1903-1914) in Tripoli, in 1911, the World War I Spark, the coup for the communities of North Africa and Italian Levantinas they need so much.
The question was whether they should admit a strong degree of Turkish control over Tripolitania, then Russian control over Cyrenaica, or taking care of its own backyard. Refused. An error that should serve as a lesson for the future. The stigma of our time is the awareness that man can end the world. A privilege so far reserved for God for Christians, who has the last word about how and when. A secret that opposes Christ, at least according to Matthew that “heaven and earth will pass, but my words do not.
As for that day and that hour, no one knows, neither the angels of heaven, nor the son, but only the Father ”(24,35-36).“ If the owner of the house knew what the time the thief comes, he would watch and not let his house be broken into. Therefore, you are also prepared, because the Son of man will come to the time when you least expect it ”(24: 43-44). If this gospel applies, we are sure that the thief is away from home, for never before man has thought in the end.
It remains for us to expect the mysterious “Katechon” of Paul's second letter to the Thessalonians, the supposed containment force that prevails over chaos, delayed the apocalypse and the coming of Jesus. If philosophers and theologians argue about “Katechon” it is because we live the apocalypse as a gift, not as a future. Immersed in chaos, disfigured by the wicked anomos that the Lord will crush “with the breath of his mouth” (2,8).
Is it a sign of the times that the Catholic Church, for centuries committed to inflicting ourselves "Mori", has softened this litany after Hiroshima? Perhaps you fear losing the latest mystery monopoly, secularized in coffee conversation. We don't get in the passionate diatribe of whose, what, how is the "katechon". Unattainable hermeneutics. What matters is to observe how the perception of living within the apocalypse, living death, exacerbates the despair of the chaos that paralyzes us. It deceives us to think that we can escape the constraints of politics, the way of reason, the art of the symposium. A temptation that generates terrible simplifiers of all kinds.
Anomie producers who want to perform with the breath of their mouth. Is Trump the power that slows or speeds up the American crisis? A very European question. For an American, the question does not arise. Those who are convinced that they belong, by grace of divine mandate, to the benevolent supreme entity, super sorted to the rest of humans, tend to imagine their trajectory as a sequence of cycles in constant ascending evolution. Drawing endless circles, just starting. In the lower stages, the American believer pushes to the top because the best is yet to come.</description><pubDate>2025-05-16 01:41:51</pubDate></item><item><title>The Great America (III)</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/15/a-grande-america-iii/</link><description>“We Are Going Through a Bad Stage in the Cold War-All Wars have ther Bad Stages. But in All Wars When One Is Going Through A Bad Stage One Should Concentrate First and Foomos on the Core of the Problem;
Weaknesses of Western Society
Pietro Quaroni
In recent years, we have been watching an unprecedented interest from Americans in Europe. Initially it was "what do you want from us?" A mixture of condescension and sympathetic contempt, which raises embarrassing answers or simply silence, since we are not used to establishing what we can want. Then the sudden turn to "what would they do in our place?" Until Trump's counterattack. With it there are no questions, only pre-placed or improvised agreements. All extremely informal on the basis that "we want this, they can help us like this, in return they receive that other. Good luck." Of course, firepower is totally disproportionate. Deadly is retaliation in case of insubordination. The example may be that if we make state -of -the -art trade with Chinese technologies, we must at least expect reprisals on customs rights and visa regime over the table, with steps accompanied underneath.
Which forces us to know beforehand what we can want from the leader and at what price. Nothing extraordinary. Tactical variants of a strategy. This should be based on our geostrategic income, which we not only neglect but even undermine. The southern continent is Mediterranean first, European in second. But this privilege is lived as a shame. They did not take advantage of the advantage of the mid-oceanic turning point they enjoyed since the opening of Suez, which today risks closing disastrously due to the Red Sea crisis. His sea gaze sees his inner waters as a limit and not as a source that pushes them to the world and the world to them.
Among the harmful inheritances of their Europeanism and the inferiority complex associated with continental nations, hydrophobia is the most harmful. The secret figure of their strategy escapes them because they are Western because they are medium-oceanic, not because they are European. Its continental neighbors, starting with the Germans, are by anti-medium-ocean vocation. Since time immemorial. As the “School of Annales” states, the concept of Europe was born against Rome, when the Islamic tide broke the Mare Nostrum in two, between the 18th and eighth centuries. A fracture that continues to resolve and to get worse. The Italians remain the passive center, at best reactive hypotheses of the middle ocean, after their decisive pivot.
Ridiculous disguise themselves with pivots. It is urgent to make sense of its western advanced geography in the middle of the ocean. And that this counts more on Germany and France, which are directly facing the world ocean, while they have to defend with nails and teeth the exit through Suez and Bab-El-Mandeb (the Bab-El-Mandeb Strait in Arabic, “gateway” is the epicenter of the vast maritime region that extends from the Red Sea to the Indian Ocean Officer, Also encompassing the Gulf of Aden and part of the Arabic Sea. This strangulation, which is only twenty-seven kilometers wide at its narrower point, near the island of Perim, separates the horn from Africa from the Middle East and serves as an antechamber to the Suez Canal, the artificial passage that, since the second half of the nineteenth century, connects the Indo-Pacific Limits to the Atlantic system through the Mediterranean).
Together with those who will be willing to treat them as partners in the middle of the ocean. First, and certainly not only, the United States. They feel here in debt to the great Italian diplomat Pietro Quaroni (their thoughts and actions are described in “Pietro Quaroni, Italian Diplomacy and the Libyan Issue (1945-1949)” by Luciano Monzali) who belonged to this race of state servants who understood this privilege as a contribution to foreign policy. Even contrary to intellectual fashion, resisting the temptation of bureaucracy and politicking. Its golden pamphlet on the “Atlantic Pact and Freedom Security”, published sixty years ago, is of a fulminating current. Pietro Quaroni suggested that they "fit into an peripheral American policy" within NATO, evolving from a "sea power" into a "maritime power." The Thalassocratic Theater distinguishes them from their continental partners and gives them greater freedom of movement than France and Germany.
Expressed in the “peripheral defense based on the outer waist of Europe, England, Iberian Peninsula, Italy and Greece”. Not being a naval power, it is capital to revive them bilateral understanding with America as the first Mediterranean power, as happened with England while still dominating the waves. While their foreign policy remained firm in the beginning that they could take all freedoms except to turn against England, any foolishness they had done had serious consequences; The day they forgot this principle, the consequences would be such that they would still remember them. Today, instead of England, are the United States, and it is the first need for Italian politics to understand with the United States as Giorgia Meloni intends. They should not be dragged on behalf of a alleged Europe for a European policy that is in fact-the-American.

The public can also see productions such as “Girl with Amen”, by Teng Kun Hou; or “Flight wedding”, a tagal production by Johson Chan Chon Sin
 
Macau cinema is good and recommended. This could be the motto of another edition of the initiative “Panorama of Macao Cinema”, which has been awarding the best in local cinema for several years, highlighting new filmmakers that debut in the world of stories and their shooting.
This year's edition, which ends this week, also brings the possibility of the audience to enjoy the latest exhibitions, which take place this Thursday and Friday at Cinematheca Paixão. These days there are 11 films that competed for the “Macao Competition” section of the “Macao Cinema Panorama”, which aims to support financially and highlight the best productions with the “Great Jury Award”, “Best Argument”, “Best Interpretation” and “Best Realization”.
So, this Thursday, from 7:30 pm, we showed “Girl with Amen”, by Teng Kun Hou, a last year's movie that tells the story of Kimmy, the “girl who just wanted to sleep with her mom, and so remembered a story her mother had told her”. According to the synopsis of the film, this story refers to the presence of the Catholic religion in Macao, but also to Chinese beliefs, because if the girl visited “all the churches and temples of Macao”, her desires could come true.
After the session, the director will be present for a conversation about the movie. Teng Kun Hma had a master's degree in the film department of the Taipe National Arts Department of Cinema, having been selected for the Golden Horse Film Academy in 2021. His work, “One to Ten”, was distinguished with the Golden Harvest Awards Student Category.
On the same day, the short film “Nutchies in Flight” is presented, a tagal movie by Johnson Chan Chon Sin that reveals the story of a “mesmerizing dance man who one day saw his eyes consumed by erratic flashes of light that clung mercilessly to his vision”. "They continued to haunt their gaze, even as their body moved at a graceful pace. In his search for a medical remedy, he diligently consumed pineapple as prescribed, hoping to expel these unwanted visitors from his vision. However, over time, he remained stuck in a foggy and aimlessly, his now heavy movements for a sense of uselessness."
Also noteworthy for the exhibition on Thursday of "Wave of Return", a short film by Ieong Chi Wai, about the young Jinshan who works in his parents' fishmonger and who, one day, "spotted a strange figure with fish heads", from which "was forced to face the hidden fears of his heart and awaken the Sleeping Memories of Childhood."

The Centaline real estate agency director foresees the continuation of the fall, estimating a depreciation of 10 percent, and calls for new measures to support the sector
 
The real estate market continues to suffer, with sales to levels that do not compare with the period before pandemic and prices falling. And, according to the director of the Centaline Real Estate Agency, Roy Ho, the sector has not yet hit the bottom.
According to official data released by the Directorate of Statistics and Census Services, in the first quarter of 2025 the price of autonomous fractions for housing descended 5.5 percent compared to the last three months of last year. The fall was more pronounced in annual terms, with the homes devalued 15.5 percent.
Roy Ho expects the market to continue to fall into the near future, estimating a descent of about 10 percent. Speaking to the Exmooo newspaper, the businessman revealed concerns about the negative tendency of the evolution of the real estate market. "There are currently factors that support the recovery of the sector, or the climb of prices. The transactions that are made at this time result, basically, the cheapest prices," he lamented.
Following this slope, Roy Ho foresees that next quarter, between May and July, will reach the market for discount offers for new housing, a factor that can be decisive for the price of fractions to be “lighter” during this period.
It should be noted that in the first two periods of this year, the housing purchase market was dominated by the sale of fractions in new buildings. The agency's director stressed that price variation can range a lot, depending on the sales variation of new or second -hand apartments, which are naturally cheaper.
Market response
The official also argues that if the price of housing to debut is cut, statistical data will reflect a decrease in sales of used fraction. Given this scenario, and although it does not predict price breaks in the order of 30 to 50 percent, if new dwellings have more competitive prices, Roy Ho considers that the highest devaluations should be verified in properties located in more degraded buildings.
The entrepreneur also points to the possibility of buyers, who can offer a higher entry value, are in favorable conditions to negotiate more competitive prices with owners who need funds urgently.
Regarding policies to boost the sector, Roy Ho understands that the Macao government should go beyond tax exemptions and launch a house exchange allowance, similar to what was done by several Chinese city provinces and Hong Kong.</description><pubDate>2025-05-20 01:51:28</pubDate></item><item><title>Show Zone | Open Restoration Contest</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/20/zona-de-espectaculos-aberto-concurso-para-restauracao/</link><description>The Cultural Institute (IC) opened the candidacies yesterday to assign restoration places in the Macao outdoor shows area to DJ Alan Walker's concert, which will take place on June 15.

From March 28, the payment of parking for half -hour periods will be extended to the public parks of the Qingmao Border Post, the Macau Union Hospital, the Public Health Specialty Building and the residence for the elderly of Avenida do Nordeste. The announcement was made yesterday through a statement from the Directorate of Service for Traffic Affairs (DSAT).
This is a payment model that has been defended for years by several deputies and that began to be applied experimentally on 1 April in the public parking lot of the Mong Son building. According to this model, users only need to pay half an hour of parking, where even this parking time need. It is a form of payment that contrasts with other parking lots, where it is necessary to pay for at least one hour, regardless of the parking time is much lower.
"After a comprehensive assessment of the current use of public parking parks in Macao and driver parking habits, from May 28, four public parking parks in Macau will adopt the collection system for half an hour," was justified in DSAT's statement. "This direction of services hopes that this measure will allow more efficient use of parking resources in public parking parks and accelerate the turnover of vacancies, continuing to monitor the operation of these parking parks and evaluate society's opinions on the charging model," he was added.
In Qingmao, half an hour during the day will cost 5 patacas, and go down to 4 patacas at night. In the remaining parking lots, half an hour costs 4 patacas during the period of day, dropping to 2 patacas during the night. DSAT also admits “at the right time” to extend this payment model to more public parking lots.
Price reduction
In addition to the half -hour parking period, parking prices for motorcycles and mopeds will be halved to "with the aim of encouraging motorcyclists to use public parking parks." The changes cover the public parks of the Macau Union Hospital, the public health specialty building and the residence for the elderly of Avenida do Nordeste.
With these changes, the prices, after the reduction, will ride to 1 level for every half hour, during the period of day, and go down to 50 graves, for every half hour, during the night.</description><pubDate>2025-05-20 01:48:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Hello Kitty | Bus passes through residential neighborhoods</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/19/hello-kitty-autocarro-passa-por-bairros-residenciais/</link><description>Began to operate this weekend the themed bus of Hello Kitty that transports free residents and tourists through the community neighborhoods of the North Zone of the Peninsula.

On Friday, the authorities met with associations and community institutions to decentralize support for vulnerable groups
 
After last year the registration of suicide deaths have recorded records, the statistics for the first three months of 2025 brought some relief. In the first quarter of this year, 18 people took their own lives, four less in homologous terms, representing a 18.2 percent descent. According to official data, suicide attempts also fell from 99 to 84 in the period under analysis, a decrease of 15.1 percent.
Among the people who committed suicide, 13 were men and five women, aged 29 to 72. Of the 18 deaths recorded in the first three months of the year, 16 were residents of Macao.
However, “suicide cases have been recorded in recent days,” said the president of the Institute of Social Action (IAS), Hon Wai, in a seminar to exchange impressions with associations and related institutions related to mental health promotion and suicide prevention. "The government thinks there is a need and urgency to associate with the forces of the community to face the problem," added Hon Wai, quoted by TDM's Macao channel.

Keep the alert
The president of IAS revealed that the executive is concerned with the situation and that the bet is to reinforce community prevention to identify and monitor more vulnerable groups.
The position was adopted at the seminar dedicated to promoting the concept of “guardian of life” and supporting “people's caregivers”. The purpose of the event was to “promote the message that we are all 'guardians of life' and encourage the population to be aware of their own mental health and their families and friends, as well as resort to government and private support services when necessary”.
According to the authorities, the main causes of suicide continue to be emotional, financial or game -related problems and mental illnesses. In terms of monitoring the situation, the president of IAS has ensured that "the government, in addition to continuing to intensify multi-departmental cooperation, will also try to decentralize resources for the community and promote the participation of more social service institutions."
Hon Wai alerted again to contain the sharing of information too detailed by particular cases of suicide, "because the spread of news may have an impact on some people, because it is known that they are acts that can be imitated."
Anyone who feels emotionally distressed or is in a situation of despair should call the open line “Caritas Life Hope” by calling 28525222 in order to obtain emotional counseling services.</description><pubDate>2025-05-19 02:51:38</pubDate></item><item><title>Zelensky vs Zelensky</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/31/zelensky-vs-zelensky/</link><description>10/27/22
A renovated Ukrainian, with the same name of the president, guilty Zelensky about the extension of the conflict that destroyed his village. Zelensky, the village, who has never left his land, now lives mortified because his favorite gravedigger died in the bomber.
This Zelensky, the village, represents half the world that reproves the other Zelensky, the villain, for not wanting to negotiate with Putin.
Negotiate what? The invader enters us through the house, pies us the wife and daughter (cf. recent UN report on Ukraine violations in this “special operation”), an act that forced us to watch, and then we say: Alto there, we are for peace, but we have to negotiate: You have not said the name you want to give to children!
A peace that is not worthy is but a cessation of rights. As severe as Russophobia that Putin inflicts his people.

In a lunch with several guests I hear a friend, who declares himself a spiritist, explaining about the particularities of his belief, in a serene and balanced way, would even say, without "irrationalism". He discussed long and serenely, devoid of any fanatical proselytizing. “Here is someone to whom belief brought weighting!” I thought, a rare alliance.
However, at one point a phrase that horrify me. He says, “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!” And I enter the voracious fauces of holism. Because holismo has a pathological aspect like all good things, a side of shadow.
Two examples: In Hinduism there is less sensitivity to existential dramas, if that child suffers in this life this is only an expression of the strict karmic symmetry, an effect of the acts she committed in her previous life. In Africa it is not accepted that death may have been accidental, and many women are accused by the dead family of having caused her husband's death, in an act of manifest dementia, and, in the blatant majority of cases, in a huge injustice to his wife - madness that spreads and infiltrates the social fabric.
Buddhism introduced compassion and Christianity to Caritas, trying to break with this logic, but in many other beliefs and religions the cage of causalities prevails about sensitivity to experience, the need to respond to the now.
It is a tremendous logic that transforms the world into a platonic stage, where we are just the shadows of something -an inextricable law -in a determinism that calcines all singularities, but strangely fascinates many.
The conquest of modernity has anchored in the conquest of chance and random, subtracting the incidences of a life to this fierce determinism that closed the world in a web. When the Renaissance freed the body from the influence of the stars, at this moment sexuality was relieved of guilt and individualism and their volition could emerge.
There is an unequivocal moral implication in the phrase “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!”, Which should work as a key to self-knowledge and self-judgment, but usually this phrase is managed to seek a reason for things abroad from us in the other. It is an alibi.
There is a holistic temptation in the world today, as in the Middle Ages there was a satanic temptation, without great reflection on its consequences. Because it is not enough we want to connect everything in a resonant chain of affection. Even the most unexpected: affection itself can kill.
I realize, thanks to this cultured, balanced, intelligent woman, that “the combat” moved at the beginning of this century. One of the great misconceptions of the twentieth century was the false dichotomy between "rationalism and irrationalism", a debate that extended to all fields, including art. First, rationality was confused (the positive side of reason) with rationalism (the pathological feature of reason), and articulated in this lack of discernment was confused irrationalism with freedom. Almost all the art of the twentieth century, with surrealism to the head, worked in this error. The fallacy still exists despite having consolidated the emergence of 'irrationalism' and the consequent relativist currents that followed it. Essentially much of what happened in the twentieth century, it turned around this shock between two paradigms: rationalism versus irrationalism.
Now, I see, the indetermination, chance, the random of the terrible temptation of the causal cage. Holism, in its pathological feature, can be the reductionism that is the way it puts the way as a new 'eschatological narrative'.
Is it "by chance" that the holism emerges at the moment when neo-liberalism and its cynical contempt for the human person besides all freedoms, all acquired rights?
Holistic consciousness has brought positively a greater ecological awareness but followed by scholastic rigor drifting reality under the blanket of a determinism that is much more than inconvenience: all great authoritarian ideologies are holistic.
My friend will know how to combine her holistic and transpersonal belief with the freedom and responsibility that every moment asks us - but how many will make the destruction, under a law that explains and encompasses everything?
How many will not be abandoned to what it is?
The awareness of the indeterminate brings tragic conscience, as the Greeks knew, but also brings the will and the courage of the decision. And of this we cannot abdicate.
In addition, as Drummond shows in Carlos Drummond de Andrade's poem “Quadrilha”:
"John loved Teresa who loved Raimundo/ who loved Maria who loved Joaquim who loved Lili/ who did not love anyone./ John went to the United States, Teresa to the convent,/ Raimundo died of disaster, Maria stayed to aunt,/ Joaquim suicide himself and Lili married J. Pinto Fernandes/ who had not entered the story."
Real always runs outside the track, in full exteriority to our concepts. This is what is worth a J. Pinto Fernandes at the exact moment we thought we had everything under control.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Nobel and others</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/17/do-nobel-e-outros/</link><description>9/10/22
Reading many people's reactions when the Nobel Prize in this year's literature was announced, I couldn't help but remind me of this repair of Jean-Pierre Siméon, in relation to another Nobel Prize: “An editor of a large national newspaper wrote five lines of indignation because the Nobel Prize for Literature, a complete stranger. But unknown to whom? How did not occur to this patented and paid literary columnist to do his work, that his apparent ignorance was a matter of incorrect professional conduct? Tranströmer was translated into many languages, it was available in French. »
There is always the choir of those who wait for the announcement of the prize to complain about not being invited to the jury of the prize, there is a subgroup of Irados that professes “never read and I will not bother to read”; It is an uncommon fauna, which inhabits social networks.
I don't always know all the winners-I was unaware of the existence of Louise Glück, who I find a great poet, or the Olga Tokarczuk, for example-but it only brings me the comfort of knowing that the world is not a soap opera where everyone knows each other and the joy of recognizing that the gauge of the world is not measured with my short measure and that on the contrary it gives me a new opportunity to face the unknown.
And perhaps the most cretin of reactions was the smart one who wrote, but there are still those who read French? Confirming only that today there is a new kind of ignorance that fires with a displeasure: the one who only read English.
I would also prefer that, in French, Pascal Quignard, Linda reads, or even Sollers, or, among the new ones, Mathias is awarded, but that does not take dignity to the work of Annie Ernaux (and it would be enough to have written the “Les Années”). There are books of her that I like less, like the vulgar "a simple passion," but this happens with almost every authors, they have a channel books and others that are like intervals in their itinerary. I advise reading a beautiful book of interviews with her, "L'Ecriture Comme un couteau".

Yesterday came an article in Maputo's morning “News”, realizing that the Pen Club narrative prize was assigned to my wife, Teresa Noronha, for her soap opera “Tornado”, which had already had the Maria Velho da Costa award.
The summary they made of the book does not even deserve comments, by pathetic, but what matters to highlight is the note of disqualification about their "Mozambicanity" by calling it Luso-Mozambican. It is not inaccurate, but for those who know the context, it is a dirty touch.
Because finally, following the same logic, Adelino Timothy should be called Tsonga-Mozambican, to Álvaro Taruma Ronga-Mozambican, and Macua-Mozambican to writers who are from the north, etc., etc. Which is not reported to happen.
At the beyond moment, in the soap opera, she writes:
«Our color has never been dominant. In colonial time we were not white, we were ripped from monories, gone mugs, the pejorative term to speak of a son of Goes and Portuguese. In the postcolonial period, I was not black and if, in Lisbon, they took me by Brazilian or Cape Verdean, already in France were lost in cogitations of where they would be and amazed when they found out it was African. There I had to explain my DNA's wanderings before relying on moorms. It took me a long time to accept that it was so because yes, and that it was no curse that were so; On the contrary, I could even discover intense patterns of fantasy and freedom in this shrewd cloak that is our genealogy… »
In the current Mozambique it is white… and this is overlapping it soon to what it does or what it is.
It is sad, but as Naipaul warned, through these stops the race is everything and is soaked in it as deeply as, elsewhere, in religion.

Bruno Latour, an anthropologist who studied the sciences and their procedures and legitimations, law, technique and religions died and entertained themselves to turn the guts to the dogmas of the “modern”. For him the place, the expert's function, was more defined by the perplexity he embodied than for the supposed truth he would support him.
He proposed, as an alternative to the kinds of multiculturalism and his mistaken password "all different all the same", the return to "diplomacy", given precisely, not from the presupposition that "we are unified because participants of the same nature" but simply reveal that we "do not yet share an ordinary world"; It is necessary to deal frontally with the "abyss of disagreement" that separates us, rather than wanting to delude it.
And about politics said, disassessedly:
«If transparency is required from the politician, we kill him; If one requires fidelity to what the other was or he says, kills him; If a mimetic relationship is required between what the crowd wants and what its representative says, the representation is killed.

Increasingly close to our precarious existences, howling the war monster, which threatens to merge humanity with the earth, incessantly traveled by the squalid spectrum of hunger and the invisible evil of ten thousand pests.
O human human, who cries superior to his own nature, but then reveals to you, once and again, unable to simply order your existence and do not understand that you are possessed by the fickle wrath and are slave to your own ambition! Do not be content with the white jade or the light gold, there is no treasure that gives you your inextinguishable thirst for other men, animals and things; for in you an eternal anguish in you; in you crawl the expelled snakes; For you grows, powerful and impossible, the very fertile ivy of evil!
This is perhaps why on the mound they call the white deer, where one of the eight immortals in sacred mount was evolved through the skies to Penglai, inhabits the fuxa, a bird whose form resembles that of the rooster, although topped by a human head. What strange copulas, what monstrous amplexes, what terrible procedures will have occurred to make the existence of this animal sinister possible? We do not know, but it is enough for our exhausted mind to dare to raise an answer, so we soon feel the skin traveled by horrendous goose bumps and the heart trigger in paraded, which wild horse beaten by the night whip of fear, oblivious to reins and containment.
May men refrain from going through the Mount of the deer, because although there are riches capable of calming the most misunderstanding ambitions, if they have the disgraced fortunate to glimpse a fuxa, it will be immediately triggered the cultivated fields, because it will be beheaded the soft animals, for it will be sacrificed the best young man and destroyed superb from countries.
Fuxi emits a sound that resembles its name. If you hear it, dark night or clear day, goose way, for the path where you find you is the most right of the ways for misfortune!</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Procrastinators Club</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/29/clube-dos-procrastinadores/</link><description>Walking in rereading of Easter, because of an article I prepare, I give this excerpt, extracted from “the universal man”:
«Every man morally is one and absolute; But you have to live with your personality to mitigate. (…) Coexistence is only possible among people reduced to a negative or hollow presence, which is constantly giving in. Hence, the emptiness of society, a huge ghost composed of numerous deceased. An upper man is antisocial or criminal. Its destination is jail and desert.
He is in thinking about whether she reflects here about the political-social conditioning that gagging, and worse, in a sad country as Portugal was in the middle of the Estado Novo (and the book is from 1931) where any possibilities of spontaneity and frankness in human relations were coarcet, or only lends the behavior of men (oppressed) a metaphysical frame, a “essence”, from a presumption of each one in the presumption of each one be in isolation “one and absolute”. Sometimes, to an excess of spirituality (or longing), it adds to Pascoaes to lack the world. He is a great poet, but he is a poet who takes gray-Jewish ampoules and is therefore written amiiude on a programmatic furor, ceasing to have pores; There is often a glass between him and the real, the same one who made him wring the Ballet, 1921: “Everything is ghost. There are only clouds, clouds of voices, clouds of souls, afflictions and tragedies! Clouds and more clouds, appearances and more appearances! It is a divine lightning that pierces them, the instant appearance that arises and throws us to the ground, dazzled! »
Sometimes I would like to remind him, as Antonio Sérgio did in the article “Regeneration and Tradition, Moral and Economy”, which dedicated to Easter: “Easter, Easter my dear friend: You are a pure, excellent and noble poet, but also a victim of this social environment, like us all: this horrible isolation that you praise and I”.
"As a child, he stole two melos," says Jacinto do Prado Coelho, stole him from a nest, and throb his lifetime remorse for it. The person, few more mischief is known to him. Only in Álvaro de Campos sprouts a twinge of evil and obscenity: “Oh, and ordinary and dirty people who always seem the same,/ who employs profanity as usual words,/ whose children steal at the grocery door/ and whose daughters at eight years-and I think this is beautiful and I love him! -/ masturbate decent -looking men on the stairs. » (Ode triumphal).
Both poets beaten by a certain idea of ​​holiness, they were identical to the inability of breaking the siege of the skin with the overflow of the dike, the same curse of sublimating Eros's concrete ferocity with the mansuity of the verses.
Of course, they are the two "Bigger Than Life", but sometimes unnerves to watch, from my hostor's post at the Procrastinators Club, to the tantrums between them, just to see who occupies, in the internal organization, the place of president and treasurer.
Although a person has guessed more, for example, this he wrote in the least known martial ode and that is declining in the situation we live today, differently, with the heart in his hands:
«Ode martial

"The Russian War in Ukraine affects fundamental European interests. China has a responsibility for world peace," the Ministry of German Foreign Affairs wrote. The message was released after a call between German diplomacy heads, Johann Wadephul, and China, Wang Yi, according to France-Presse (AFP) news agency.
Although the first contact since the inauguration of the Friedrich Merz executive centered on the “German-chinese relations”, the Ukrainian issue was also discussed, government spokesman Christian Wagner said at a press conference. Wadephul's message conveyed Wang was "that the war that Russia is hanging in Ukraine affects the essential interests of Europeans and attentive against the European order of peace," he said.
The new chancellor, Friedrich Merz, said in Parliament on Wednesday he was concerned about the "growing proximity between Beijing and Moscow." "We will insist on China to contribute to the resolution of the war in Ukraine," he said at the time.
China is a crucial commercial partner for Germany, but it has long been spared by the Germans. During the mandate of the previous chancellor, Olaf Scholz, Berlin hardened the tone in the face of increased geopolitical tensions and the growing economic rivalry between Beijing and the European Union.
The war began in February 2022, when Russia invaded Ukraine to “demilitate and disinal” the neighboring country, as well as preventing him from becoming a member of Nato.</description><pubDate>2025-05-20 02:03:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Gaza | Beijing expresses support for Arab League positions on ceasefire</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/20/gaza-pequim-manifesta-apoio-as-posicoes-da-liga-arabe-sobre-cessar-fogo/</link><description>The Popular Republic of China yesterday expressed support to the main Arab League conclusions including the request for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and the rejection of any forced travel from the Palestinian population. The Arab League summit took place last Friday in the capital of Iraq.
In the Bagity Declaration the Arab countries appealed to an “urgent denunciation,” condemned the attacks on civilians and expressed opposition to the forced expulsion of the Palestinians of the territories where they are.
The spokeswoman of the Foreign Ministry of the Popular Republic of China, Mao Ning, reiterated yesterday's support of Beijing to a solution that integrates the existence of two states and the law of Palestinians to autonomy.
During a press conference in Beijing, Mao Ning stressed that Gaza is an inseparable part of Palestinian territory and that the Popular Republic of China supports the “legitimate rights” of the Palestinian people.
Mao Ning also added that any political solution should be based on respect for the principle of Palestinian autonomy in the Gaza Strip after the conflict. Thus, the Popular Republic of China demonstrates a willingness to work with the international community to relieve the humanitarian crisis and build a lasting and fair peace.
The spokesman also recalled that Chinese President Xi Jinping sent a congratulations at the beginning of the summit, in which he highlighted the Arab League achievements and expressed Beijing's desire to deepen cooperation with Arab countries.

The device was transported on Sunday to the Launch Preparation Area at the Xichang Space Center in Sichuan province, where functional checks will be performed before taking off, the China Daily state newspaper said.
The Chinese space agency said the launch will take place before late May, without further details. Tianwen 2, consisting of an orbit and reentry module, was transported to the installation of Xichang in late February, and the coaching staff completed the supply and several inspections ever since.
The mission will target the 2016 Ho3, also known as 469219 Kamo'oalewa, which, although orbiting around the sun and not the earth, is the smallest and closest asteroid on the planet that has been identified so far.
The plan foresees that the probe orbits around the asteroid, where it will remain for several months, after which will approach enough to use a mechanical arm to collect surface samples.
Mysteries of Evolution
After this phase, the probe will return to the orbit of the earth and free the reentry module, which will take the samples to the planet's surface. The 2016 Ho3 Asteroid was first detected in 2016 by an asteroid observation telescope at the Haleakala High Altitude Observatory in Hawaii, United States.
Researchers believe they may contain important information about the early stages of the solar system, including aspects of its original composition and evolution. China strongly invested in the space program and successfully landed the Chang'e 4 probe on the hidden side of the moon-the first time it was achieved-and became the third country-after the former Soviet and the United States-to reach Mars.
In addition, China operates its own space station, Tiangong, which will operate for about 10 years and could become the only orbital platform in operation. The International Space Station - an initiative led by the United States to which China is forbidden to access due to military ties with its space program - is expected to be abandoned by 2030.</description><pubDate>2025-05-20 01:54:10</pubDate></item><item><title>Favorite to South Korean presidential</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/19/favorito-as-presidenciais-sul-coreanas-defende-segundo-mandato/</link><description>South Korea's leading presidential candidate Lee Jae-Myung proposed a change to the Constitution to shorten the presidential mandate to four years, but adding a second term, considering it a measure to balance power.
The proposal, released yesterday by Lee on the social network Facebook, comes when the South Koreans are two weeks to choose at the polls their president for a single five-year term, in a vote triggered by the dismissal of former President Yoon Suk Yeol.
The latest polls show that Lee, the opposition's Democratic Party candidate, leads the race to the elections scheduled for June 3 with a 51 percent support rate.
"We will make the president more responsible and decentralize power," Lee said in a Facebook post. "A presidency of four years and two terms would allow interchangeary assessments of the administration, which would increase its responsibility."
Subsequently, in response to journalists at an event in Gwangju, Lee stressed that the South Korean Constitution does not allow a presidential mandate revision to be applied to the leader in office, Yonhap News reported.
Other changes
Lee also proposed a series of measures designed to give more powers to Parliament, such as the limitation of the President's right of veto and the requirement of parliamentary approval for the declaration of martial law.
"If discussions progress sufficiently, we can ask what people want in local 2026 elections or the 2028 general elections, even if backwards," Lee wrote on Facebook.
The election of the next president of South Korea is a crucial step in replacing export power on the way to political stability, after Yoon's martial decree in December, triggered the country's worst constitutional crisis in decades.
On Saturday, Yoon abandoned the Popular Power Party, paving the way for conservatives to attract more indecisive voters, when the failure of martial law still proceeds a dense shadow on their candidate Kim Moon-soo. Kim, Yoon's former Labor Minister, was praised by conservatives for opposing Yoon's dismissal and refused to apologize for the decree of martial law.</description><pubDate>2025-05-19 03:06:07</pubDate></item><item><title>Shanghai | NVIDIA intends to open I&amp;D center despite the fall of sales</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/19/xangai-nvidia-pretende-abrir-centro-de-id-apesar-da-queda-de-vendas/</link><description>The American Nvidia aims to open a research and development center (I&amp;D) in Shanghai as part of the renewed commitment to the Chinese market, despite the drop in sales resulting from the export restrictions imposed by Wahsington.
The information is advanced by the British Diary Financial Times (FT), which says that the new center aims to develop solutions adapted to the technical needs of Chinese clients, while ensuring compliance with US laws.
Nvidia clarified, according to the FT, that it will not send projects of Graphic Processing Units (GPU) to China, nor will it allow local modifications to avoid sanctions for improper transfer of intellectual property. The plan was discussed in April between Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and the mayor of Shanghai, Gong Zheng.
The new center will also be involved in global projects, such as chip design verification, existing product optimization and applied areas such as autonomous conduction. The local government will have expressed preliminary support to the initiative, which still needs 'green light' from the US.
Regulatory pressure has been severe as the H20 - Graphic Processing Unit (GPU) that Nvidia began to sell in China in 2024 and was designed specifically to meet Biden's era regulations - is also subject to Washington controls, although it was created in response to previous restrictions on more advanced chips.
Washington warns that the use of AI chips produced by Huawei can lead to legal consequences for US or foreign companies. In response, Nvidia offered its Chinese clients the lowest power L20 chip, which has no high -speed memory.</description><pubDate>2025-05-19 03:02:23</pubDate></item><item><title>Hong Kong | Portuguese convicted of subversion resorts to the last instance</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/19/hong-kong-portugues-condenado-por-subversao-recorre-para-ultima-instancia/</link><description>Portuguese Joseph John appealed to Hong Kong's last court after an intermediate court rejected a request to reduce the penalty of five years in prison for the crime of incitement to the subversion.
According to the portal on the internet of the last court of the Chinese region, the request was received but the date for the court hearing, which has its judges with Lusodescendent Roberto Ribeiro, has not yet been set.
The appeal was filed on Thursday by the defense of Joseph John, also known as Wong Kin Chung, according to Hong Kong Free Press.
In April 2024, the Hong Kong court sentenced Joseph John to five years in prison for the crime of incitement to subversion in the first national security case involving a double nationality defendant.
Later, the Portuguese lawyer, Randy Shek Shu Ming, asked the court of appeal to reduce the penalty to four years and four months, stressing that Joseph John had declared himself guilty. But last April, the Court of Appeal refused the Portuguese defense request, concluding that any crime linked to national security that is classified as "serious" implies a minimum penalty of five years.

Agreed, was the exchange of prisoners between both parties
 
China said Friday expects a fair and lasting peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine, when Moscow and Kiev were preparing to hold their first direct negotiations since 2022 in Istanbul, Turkey.
Ukrainians and Russians sat down the first at the negotiation table since the spring of 2022, but the absence of Russian President Vladimir Putin, in the meeting mitigated hopes for any progress in the signature of a peace agreement. From the meeting, only an agreement for the exchange of prisoners between the two nations, a thousand from each side.
"We hope that all parties involved will continue the conversations and negotiations to reach a fair, lasting and binding peace agreement, acceptable to all parties, in order to achieve a political solution to the Ukrainian crisis," said China's Ministry of Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jean at a press conference.
Beijing, he added, expects a “political solution” to the “crisis in Ukraine” to be reached soon.
Active paper
China has repeatedly affirmed that it wants to play a constructive role to achieve peace and stressed that Europe must have a word to say in peace negotiations.
Since the beginning of the war, Beijing has kept an ambiguous position on conflict, appealing to respect for the “territorial integrity of all countries,” including Ukraine, and attention to the “legitimate concerns of all” states, referring to Russia.
Thus, he opposed unilateral sanctions against Moscow, although the West has accused China of supporting the Russian military campaign, something he has always denied, and providing Vladimir Putin essential components to produce weapons. European countries have repeatedly appealed to Chinese leader Xi Jinping to use their influence on his Russian homologist Vladimir Putin to wage the conflict.
However, spokesman Lin announced Friday that vice-master-minister Zhang Guoqing will visit Russia today until May 22 for a meeting of the presidents of the Intergovernmental Committee of Cooperation between Northeast China and the Far East in Russia.
Commenting on the visit, Lin recalled that Xi and Putin agreed during the last visit of the Chinese leader to Moscow to "continue his cooperation" and explore ways to promote it "with greater vitality and vigor."</description><pubDate>2025-05-19 02:59:37</pubDate></item><item><title>Rui Leão, architect and co-author of “Layering the City” | A four -hand city</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/16/rui-leao-arquitecto-e-co-autor-de-layering-the-city-uma-cidade-a-quatro-maos/</link><description>Architects Rui Leão and Carlotta Bruni have accumulated many drawings over the years, which have now been materialized in “Layering the City”, a work that was released last week at the Venice Architecture Biennial. The book results from two lives dedicated to architecture and two doctoral theses defended at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology
 
How does the initiative come to publish “Layering the City”, which makes the retrospective of your work a little?
This project is born from a dialogue between my dissertation thesis and Carlotta [Carlotta Bruni's] dissertation thesis, who both take different aspects of our contribution as architects to Macau, to the city. And therefore, the project of this book is the encounter of these two theses.
The title of the book refers to the idea of ​​a town in layers.
No, what happens is that in the case of our views, my and Carlotta, there is work brought by each one to the project, and which gives a response to the programmed request, what the client asks, to what lives in the alignment plant [of the project], or a series of questions at civic, public space or the right to quality of life. There are a number of social dimensions [to take into account] to make spaces for people, even when they are impossible [in terms] of politics and in the city. It is these layers that go into the projects and that, deep down, are creating opportunities to qualify the life of the city, the person, the street. And this has nothing to do with those who pay, it has to do with the management that the architect makes in the city through the project. It is these layers, the layers, in which the architect is enriching what is the project's offer to the city and creates several micro-projects within this larger project, which qualify the ride, social spaces and public space in a way that was not requested.
Therefore, in a project of architecture always persists the idea of ​​the people and the spaces they inhabit.
In the case of Macau there is this extreme situation where the public space is always the minimum, with a narrow walk, and where everything is resolved. Because there is a lack of more public space profile in the city, this management done by the architect through the project turns out to be a way to compensate for the city, to reconcile people with it, or the opposite.
The cover of the book refers to Fai Chi Kei's public housing project. I assume that they consider the project one of the great milestones of your studio.
Undoubtedly. This was the first large housing building in collective terms, where we had the opportunity to apply ideas that we had developed to the public space, in Praça do Lago, or even in the park next door. All of these projects have a lot of involvement with the public space and this was our first initiative with a housing program. We did a number of super important experiences that allowed us to demonstrate that it was possible to qualify public housing. We produce a series of gardens, packets, air gardens in various floors [from the building]. We were collecting the floors two to two and four to four to create communities inside the building, almost like a Chinese pharmacy that has drawers, social interaction sites since the bottom floor, and so on. All of this has been worked with small public terraces present throughout the project, and in this respect, it is very innovative. It is, in fact, a demonstration that, whether it is a housing building or a museum, it can indeed contribute to the qualification of people's lives. Any [architecture program, in order to order or contract] it serves for the architect to act on the project.
What other projects are in this book?
We have the Barra station and the intermodal zone [related to the light meter]. There are two projects, for us, very important, because they also come to reconfirm the ability to overlap many and many layers. In the case of Barra Station, there is also a public park on top, and the two marginals, the historic and the new. It is an all -glass, transparent project that allows me to be on the side of the slaughterhouse and see the river and boats through the glass. The building turns out to be a kind of octopus that makes ground level connections, with the gardens around the season that connect with the roof. There is a certain complexity, in which almost a new city system is created and there is at the same time a trial overlap of the train, buses and the passing people. The book also has projects that are not yet built.
What was it like to combine the content of your doctoral thesis with that of Carlotta Bruni?
The book consists of texts by some critics about our work. There is a text by Jorge Figueira, for example, and a great interview conducted by Ana Vaz Milheiro [Academic] and then has our texts.
Is there a presence by architect Manuel Vicente in this work?
Manuel Vicente is very present, because some of these projects were made in partnership with him. Therefore, there is a continuity of these first projects for those who came next, already without Manuel Vicente, and who is very polished for us. Deep down, it has to do with what we not only inherited, but what we brought with us from Manuel.
Presenting this work at the Venice Architecture Biennial, and considering that the MSAR is also represented with an exhibition, is it important for your work and visibility of the studio?
Yes. The idea of ​​publication, with Barcelona's Actar Books, has to do with putting the work, and more than that, its message, which is very specific to Macau and our way of working in the international and architects community, and this goes a lot through the Biennial. It was also in Europe that a consensus was built on the level of descriptions [in architecture] for a few centuries, and where there is a discussion, national and international, around the issues of the profession. We want our work to be present, either through the book and through acting Books, in this international community, to be part of the world.
Leaves and layers
“Layering the City” intends to establish with the international community of architects and passionate about the profession a dialogue showing the last years of work and the vision of the LBA - Rui Leão and Carlotta Bruni's architecture and planning. The work is born of the intersection between two doctoral theses of the two architects: “Designing by Increments: Opportunistic Planning As Urban Strategy for Macau” (by Rui Leão) and “Shaping Macau’s Unpurposed Space: Design in Context” (by Carlotta Bruni).
According to a book presentation, "LBA's intellectual contributions are evidenced through the space narratives that integrate complex urban contexts with culturally sensitive design strategies."
The two architects and their team "emphasize the importance of creating spaces that harmonize with their surroundings, while responding to the functional needs of modern urban life." It is therefore a “particularly relevant approach in Macao, where the juxtaposition of the old and the new is a defining characteristic of the city”, it reads.</description><pubDate>2025-05-16 01:04:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Álvaro Barbosa, vice-rector of the University of São José: “Student visa is very limiting”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/07/alvaro-barbosa-vice-reitor-da-universidade-de-sao-jose-visto-de-estudante-e-muito-limitativo/</link><description>The University of São José continues the negotiation saga with the Chinese authorities to recruit students from the interior of China. Vice-rector Álvaro Barbosa expects, soon, the increase in master's students from 30 to 200. Regarding the internationalization of higher education, the official advocates changes in student visas to facilitate recruitment
 
Does the recruitment of students from the interior of China remain a matter pending to the University of Saint Joseph?
It is a process that is underway. We have had huge support from the Macao government in negotiations to obtain the quota for our university, and they have been tireless in the effort to try to resolve the issues raised by the central government. Many of the questions are legitimate and concern concerns that arise. We were granted a temporary quota of 30 students for masters ago over a probative period, which served to evaluate how we, as Western University, would host students from China. From China, there is this concern with the host of students in Macau. I think we have made a huge effort and the students who are there, included in this contingent, are quite satisfied.
Is this quota for masters just?
Yes. For a degree we do not have authorization yet. In this way, we are currently at the time we try to overcome this probative period in order to obtain a quota of about 200 students for masters. We are in the final phase of the evaluation process and everything has been doing well. We will have the possibility that, next academic year, expand this quota. That would be great, because for our university, to have a greater impact of our mission in Macao, it is essential to have access to students from mainland China. We cannot be a university in an integrated region in a country like China, and not contact with students from China.
Is it more difficult for USJ to compete with other universities, such as those of Hong Kong, by foreign students, outside China?
The issue of recruitment of international students has become a priority for Macao universities. In the last two or three years, it has become evident that this internationalization is very important. What difficulty is there? There is the issue related to student visas, as these visas currently do not allow students to do any kind of work, denying them that minimum local subsistence mechanism to be able to meet expenses. Nor is it contemplated the possibility of, when the student concludes his formation, to be in the territory and find work. What all countries and regions that are competitive in higher education do, such as Singapore, Hong Kong or Australia, is to have incentive policies. Allow students to work part -time, for example. In Hong Kong when a degree ends, the student can stay in the territory up to a maximum of two years to find a job. This kind of measures do not yet exist in Macau, but I think the government is pondering this possibility. From the moment the decision was made that the internationalization of higher education was important, this must be accompanied with the corresponding measures. The current student visa is extremely limiting and does not encourage the coming to Macao to study, only allows coming. This issue was not as present as it is now, but now there is a strategic policy of internationalization.
It is also a matter of survival for local universities.
Yes. Perhaps there is no greater example of a catalyst for the diversification of Macau's economy than higher education. We have ten institutions, 60,000 students in about 700,000 inhabitants. This is the potential of internationalization, to foster diversification.

And also the research that comes out of higher education.
The investigation, the dynamics of the work that is done. There are a number of vectors that higher education brings to a region or country, this happened to Portugal, for example, with the policy of doctoral scholarships for students from abroad, which completely changed the dynamics of higher education. Cape Verde developed thanks to the impact of higher education.
Then we need to make the system more flexible in Macau.
I don't know if it's a matter of having a holistic view of strategy. There may be an idea, but then it does not intervene in all the necessary dimensions to achieve a certain goal. But I am very optimistic. I believe this new student policy is a key step to be taken in Macau. The internationalization strategy followed by all these countries and regions I spoke, and were successful in capturing international students, was always the same. No need to invent much. First, one should increase the capacity and notoriety of universities, and then a policy of scholarships, which will enhance a student flow, creating a reference for the territory, so that studying there becomes a habit. After this flow of students for a few years, an image is already created and some scholarships can be removed, which students will continue to choose a particular territory to study in it. Australia has a huge higher education industry, for example, and I think that in Macau we just have to follow the same strategies. We do, at USJ, that a little.
How, in concrete terms?
We offer many scholarships, and in this sense the Diocese of Macao has helped us build this flow of international students that allow us to create this dynamic that we hope will be sustainable by itself in the future. I think the government is also doing this. There have always been scholarships in Macau, attributed mainly by the Macau Foundation, but this measure will be strengthened. Solving the student's visa issue, creating a scholarship incentive system for five to ten years, Macau will have a bright future as an international higher education destination. But we need to invest, continue, and it takes a few years.
USJ created the “Macau Hub” platform, in partnership with the Macau Scientific and Cultural Center (CCCM) in 2023. At what stage is this project?
This project has to do with our interest in developing a relationship dynamic of Lusophone countries centered in Lisbon in the area of ​​entrepreneurship, first. This cabinet we have at CCCM is not intended to offer training in Portugal, but we want to do something else. As we are positioned in the Great Bay and with Hengqin, where it is intended to activate a business ecosystem, we want to take advantage of the fact that we have relations with the Lusophone world to activate the access of the startups of Portugal, Brazil and Angola, above all, to the great bay and hengqin. We are trying to create a kind of incubator of transnational companies, in which we support the development of Lusophone businesses that want to settle in the large bay and also the reverse system. Strategically, for a university, it is absolutely fundamental to have a dynamic in the area of ​​entrepreneurship. Currently, more than half of our students do not want to go to the corporate world, but create their own businesses. Just as universities have to have employability solutions, they also have to have them for entrepreneurs, who are increasingly. So a university has to have a business incubator. My vision of the future for higher education goes around: a university, besides having a library and canteen, will also have its own business incubator. I would say that most students of management or economy courses dream of having their own business, especially in China. China is perhaps one of the most entrepreneurial countries in the world. The CCCM welcomes this initiative in Portugal, but we also work with the Portuguese Catholic University.
And concrete results, already have it?
We have a number of small initial projects that are starting now, and we also work with many business organizations. We have now negotiated a series of projects, and I think everything will develop very quickly, based on the manifestations of interest we have. We were in Angola in December and we have already aligned a series of initiatives, we also have projects with Brazil and Portugal.</description><pubDate>2025-04-07 22:56:36</pubDate></item><item><title>Adelina Moura, teacher and trainer: “The mobile phone is like a Swiss knife”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/07/adelina-moura-docente-e-formadora-o-telemovel-e-como-um-canivete-suico/</link><description>Graduated in the area of ​​educational technologies, Adelina Moura will lead lectures to parents, students and teachers about the use of digital technologies in classrooms, within the “Letters &amp; Company” festival of the Portuguese Institute of the East. The teacher understands that prohibiting mobile phone in schools is not a solution
 
What are the challenges felt by teachers with the introduction of technologies in the classroom? Can the mobile phone actually be a complement to learning?
Yes. I've been saying this since 2005. The mobile phone can be an excellent learning tool, a means to motivate students and to enrich their learning. We have a kind of Swiss knife here, a very powerful equipment in the hands of the students and there is a school failure, because they do not work and help students enhance this equipment they have. What happens is that students learn in the worst way, in a destructed way, by attempt-rrove. There is a gap, as students are not alerted to the positive potential for mobile phone use. They face their mobile phones as a free time use, spending time on social networks and scrolling, and time consumes. It is essential that teachers are users, in their practices, mobile phones, and for the preparation of classes and other projects, to know how to prepare students. I consider that the school has lost several stages of students' preparation and awareness to use these equipment that lead to classes and with which schools have not spent any money. With the prohibition of bringing the mobile phone to the classroom we did not advance anything in this regard.
During the pandemic period, for example, the use of technologies, with distance learning, was quite enhanced.
But during the pandemic we also burned some steps regarding the use of digital by teachers, because before the pandemic many teachers did not believe or used. They thought it was a fashion and they saw no use in the use of mobile phones and other technologies. With the pandemic the use of these equipment proved that without them the situation of education would have been much worse. In these pandemic years, teachers have become more aware of the technologies that already exist and are available to anyone. With internet access on mobile phone, something that has existed since 2007 with the launch of the first iPhone, the e-learning system is enhanced and then we move to “Mobile Learning”, where you can learn anywhere and anytime with mobile devices. It is this reality that we see a little away from school.
And after the pandemic, how has it been?
I think we will take a few more steps towards digital literacy. With Artificial Intelligence (IA), it seems that we are as in the phase I created my first website in 1999 or email in 1995. We are at the beginning. But it is 30 years of technology where there have been many changes, and technology in fact goes on and if we immediately do not realize what we have available, we and students, we help create a moat that has happened in the past compared to digital. In the face of AI, if we do not look back and do not realize what was not done and should have been at school level, we are wasting time. Only a few years from now will people be alert to AI, and the gap is increasing. Hence it is very important to bet now, in this early stage, in the training of teachers, students and families.
Is there much ignorance of parents, removal from this reality?
We have parents who are from this century. That is, they were born with the existence of computers, internet, saw the appearance of the smartphone. But when they studied, the school did not talk about the potential of digital. So these former students came to society and did not bring this sensitivity to digital, to educate their children. We teachers, when we do digital training, are doing good to society because we are also preparing these young people for the future, because they will be parents and should be aware of educating their children. At school we do not only prepare for the job market, but for personal and family life. Hence teacher education is essential. The invitation I received from IPOR seems to me an excellent holistic view of everything, because the school includes several actors, connecting with society.
How should AI be introduced into the classroom?
We currently watch changes in search engines, in fact. We have search engines created from root to Age Age, for example. The best way to introduce AI into the classroom is to ask students and how they use it, and already resort to this tool. At the beginning of the academic year I always ask students to answer a questionnaire about their digital routines, and then I know more or less their practices. In 2023, when the chatgPT came out, I introduced AI in my classes, and realized that students were using this tool to deceive the teachers. Students have to realize that when using AI, they are falling into a certain trap because they are not learning. It is the law of the lowest effort, equal to the phase in which the internet emerged, when students selected, copied and sent to the teacher. We now have the problem that the answers are in Brazilian Portuguese, for example, and I see soon that AI was used. We have, therefore, to dismantle this action in the heads and face them. I tell them that they are being intellectually dishonest and that they have not read the AI ​​response, for example. Since 2023, I feel that students, in the answers to this questionnaire I do, say they are afraid to use chatgpt because they are afraid of being caught by teachers. That is, it seems to have gained some conscience.
It will give these lectures in a different educational context in Asia, where the use of mobile phone can be earlier. How will you deal with these differences, or do you understand that the problems of using technology in the classroom are transversal?
It is a transverse question. Do we have to wonder if the use of a particular equipment and tool will make us wiser? It seems to me not, because we may have the equipment, but the use we make it varies a lot. I tell my students that they should be ashamed, because they have much easier access to content than in my time, when we truly had to do research and read in physical format. I tell them that with this technology they should all have a grade 20, and that they are wasting resources, being dishonest intellectually, because they sign works that are not theirs and do not read, even, they deliver. One of the works we have with students is to teach them how to make bibliographic references, refer to the sources. But I am an optimistic by nature, and I hope that in a decade, secondary education students who are fathers and mothers will be able to deal with these problems of social networks and increase fraud with their children. It is this “parents school” that the school can help create. We are in a moment with no return of digital, and forbidding is the most comfortable situation, but it is not the best to face reality. We have to use the right words to alert. We have in this time of alerts and consciences, encouraging the critical spirit of our students, which is little today.

Speaking to HM, the academic enhances the interconnection between tourism, economy and geography, and lists its possibilities, limitations and effects, including Macao
 
 
In this book it speaks of the concept of “spatial economy”, in connection with tourism and geography. How is this connection?
Economic geography combines the geographical context with economic processes, being studied the spatial distribution of economic activities. The economy of tourism is particularly sensitive to these geographical constraints, as they are the characteristics of each place that enhances the development of certain products or services. These characteristics widely exceed the physical aspects of the territory and also include culture, history, ways of life or even institutions and legal frameworks. The case of casino, something particularly important in Macao, is a good example of the importance of legal aspects to develop certain types of tourism. Economic geography has a wider scope than the spatial economy, more focused on strictly economic aspects. Being evident in tourism this relationship between economics and geography, this book establishes a double approach that systematizes the interdependence of these three aspects it refers. First explores how the concepts and theories of economic geography can apply to tourism. In the second half it makes the opposite route, discussing how the analysis of relevant problems of contemporary tourism justifies the use of economic geography. Examples are the degradation of local resources, environmental impacts, contribution to climate change, acceleration of gentrification processes or disturbance of community modes of life.
Can having an excessively -dependent economy of tourism constitute a problem or salvation?
The two things, and are both cases that economic geography can help to understand. The industrialization of economies is linked to the agglomeration processes of activities that reinforce each other when they reach a certain scale. This allows the massification of production and consumption, with reasonable costs. Contemporary industries, more associated with the integration of digital technologies and creative processes, are less clustered in specialized industrial development zones, but tend to focus on large cities and metropolitan areas. It also follows that rural areas, islands, or sites that have not followed industrialization processes, have more difficulty mobilizing investments, technologies or qualified people to innovate and develop new industries. In such cases, tourism often appears as the possible solution as it can be developed with incorporation of technology and relatively low knowledge. On the other hand, tourism consumption, not being essential to human life, is very sensitive to income fluctuations.
Can you give examples?
This was visible, for example, with the 2007/2009 international crisis. Tourism is also very vulnerable to safety problems or international epidemics, such as COVID-19 has demonstrated to the extreme. Economies too specialized in tourism are very vulnerable to external shocks and less resilient to crises. It is also visible that, being the tourist development often supported by intensive and weak labor services, the specialization in tourism can cause, in the long run, embarrassment in terms of population qualifications, the ability to innovate and integrate technology or to add value to the regional economy.
The book also speaks of “intelligent tourism” and “co-creation of experiences”, using the megados and IA. Is tourism definitely becoming more digital?
Social networks are fundamental instruments for new generations. However, they began to generalize the tools for planning or promotion of travel supported by artificial intelligence. The so-called “intelligent tourism” more generally designates the use of digital technologies to intensify information flows, consolidate the formation of networks and promote more informed and shared decision making, eventually contributing to the so-called “co-creation of experiences”. Tourism digitization has its origins in service distribution systems originally developed by airlines since the 1960s, but it would be the internet to accelerate and globalize digitization.
And social networks.
The emergence of social networks promoted the creation of a more interactive universe, potentially in real time and involving wide numbers of users and various types of supports. The generalization of the use of mobile phones permanently connected to the Internet, even on foreign travel, has further increased this potential for intensive and interactive use of data and information. This "co-creation", however, hides obvious imbalances of power.
Such as?
With regard to tourists, or consumer in general, it is usually the role of providing information, for example through social networks. This information is obtained, accumulated and marketed, sometimes without consent or even without knowledge, to eventually translate into the creation, adaptation or promotion of products and services. This process is particularly important in the case of tourism, because there is usually a long period between the decision to travel and the trip itself. This period of travel exploration and planning is used by tourist marketing companies to try to influence choices. This type of interaction also introduces a difference in the “spatiality” of the provision of tourist services, which are usually produced and consumed at the same time and in the same place, in a direct relationship between producer and consumer. The digitization of tourism anticipates most of these interactions and information flows and transfers them to large technological companies or marketing and distribution.
In a world where more and more travel, the routes are shorter and access to information is immense, how can countries and regions be competitive in the tourist offer?
Contemporary tourism lives in a highly competitive international environment. But just as there is a wide variety of destinations and offerings, there is also a wide range of preferences and consumption, what is called “hyper-personalization”, the result of such abundance of information and opportunity for interaction. The challenge that is placed on destinations is to identify the resources, products and services that can be adjusted to a particular group of consumers, to communicate effectively. This competitiveness greatly goes beyond the strict scope of tourist services because it also requires mobility and transportation services, varied infrastructure, safety, medical support, or easy communication. Anywhere you want to develop your tourist industry have to intervene about all these factors.
The book also addresses how “social processes” shape the development of tourism. In the case of China, for example, do you believe we are watching a change, which will have consequences for Macau?
It seems to me that Macau is in a highly privileged position to develop other forms of tourism. China is the largest issuing market in the world, the widespread rise of income in recent decades allows many million people to explore the opportunity to travel. Macao is a very close and distinct destination, with its historical and cultural particularities. For the Chinese population it was not easy to visit Macau and there is certainly a great interest.
How does the Great Bay project come in this?
The strategy that is being followed by integrating the Great Bay allows you to develop a cosmopolitan and diverse offer that can certainly attract Chinese tourists and other parts of the world. Moreover, these three areas have excellent hotel and tourism schools, which guarantee qualified personnel for tourism management and planning. The element of differentiation that Portuguese culture introduces in this context can certainly contribute to the success of the transition from a casinos focused on other forms that value culture and heritage more.
Is it possible to have sustainable tourism?
The problems and difficulties of tourism sustainability are more visible than in other sectors. This “spatiality” of tourism (where the consumer is obliged to move to the place of consumption) implies that the consequences of this consumption become more evident. These effects are less obvious when it comes to the unsustainability of industrial units or intensive forms of agriculture in relatively isolated areas. As mass reduction and investment reduction strategies also apply to tourism, the consequences of the environment or the quality of life of residents in destinations can be devastating. Sustainability implies a long -term perspective based on the idea that today's decisions do not imply future negative consequences. Sustainable practices depend on the control of the impacts that accumulate over time by individual and independent economic agents.
How can this control be done?
When a hotel or airline defines what ability to install on their services they may eventually estimate the impact that consumers will have on the local environment or economy. They will have more difficulties in anticipating that impacts will be generated in the next 10, 15 or 20 years to investment. And surely it will be impossible to measure how this impact accumulates the impacts caused by other service providers, now or in the future. In other words, although the idea of ​​sustainability is widespread accepted, economic agents do not have mechanisms or instruments in practice. Regulating the use of resources and territories by public entities with a more comprehensive and future perspective can contribute to the sustainability more effectively than the regulation associated with market dynamics, which in many cases has been revealed highly predatory. The Chinese economy is one of these examples and may eventually benefit from it.
And in the concrete case of Macau?
Macao has historically known problems: ultra-urbanized and polluted areas, with large energy consumption and waste production; Great concentration of tourists in a relatively small area of ​​great historical and cultural interest; Great dependence on the game, with the resulting imbalances in the appropriation of tourism benefits. The ongoing transition to new forms of tourism should better solve these problems and state regulation will certainly have better results than based on market dynamics.</description><pubDate>2025-04-02 23:28:16</pubDate></item><item><title>Piménio Ferreira: “Anti-igan rhetoric has always worked in Portugal”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2021/04/26/pimenio-ferreira-a-retorica-anti-cigana-sempre-funcionou-em-portugal/</link><description>Piménio Ferreira, better known as Gitelles Ferreira, anti-racist militant, 34, physical engineer, national Romani. He is a man with a provocative speech, a corrosive, kind mood and a smile that leaves no one indifferent
Gitelles, we live in an intercultural land and the Gypsies - in particular - have lived about five centuries in Portugal. What is going on for Gypsy communities to remain “on the fringes” of the so -called society? 
The model of society remains to be changed. This is extremely stratified by placing people in subordinate places to privilege a violent minority. The white social structure is patriarchal and racist. What is called the "margin" of society is actually an intrinsic place to it, which belongs to it. In other words, Gypsy people have been included in this model of society since they discovered Europe and its kingdoms. The problem is the model of society that is maintained and the place to which they were relegated and how they were relegated: with violence, in inferior status against whites, without the right to human dignity, to constitute a family, to choose one's own language and religion, expropriated from any and all cultural and material law. A place built and maintained to this day by violence and genocidal and ethnicidal persecution. In 1463, a Gitano Vasco was drowned to an estate. In 1521, Gitans, or Gypsies, were already used as a reference for all that is considered bad in the model of society. The "counter-exemple" in the face of the white that would stand out for the positive. The 'angel' and the 'devil'; the 'other', the enemy; That against whom any attack and persecution is legitimate. Including the prohibition of defending, having weapons, any kind of goods, and the right of permanence.
And is this right to permanence that we still have nomadic gypsy communities within the country is denied?
Yes, no doubt. There are many ways to force nomadism: directly, prohibiting permanence and expelling with police or military force; indirectly, refusing public or private housing to Gypsy people, as they are Gypsy; and even through the gentrification process.
I read the result of an inquiry from the European Union Fundamental Rights Agency, which is said to be approximately 80% of the Gypsies responded to the risk threshold of poverty in their country; One in three Gypsies lives in a housing without channeled water; One in three Gypsies belongs to a family where someone hungry at least once the previous month; and 50% of Gypsies aged 6 to 24 do not attend school. Why does this happen like this? 
It is the historical persecution, which continues. There is no impoverishment that has no external cause. In this case, a political system of total expropriation and imposed on the basis of violence. Already in 1648, D John IV, the restorer, prohibited ‘Giving or Rent houses to Gypsies’. The same D John IV who got the kingdom of Portugal thanks to D. Jerónimo da Costa and his 250 knights. The same D. Jerónimo da Costa who had died to defend Portugal's independence from Castile. Gypsy, like his wife and children. Between prohibitions of permanence, “that do not enter Gypsies in the Kingdom and leave those who are” (D John III, 1526), ​​with expulsions, degred to the galleys, expropriation of goods and properties, imposed with stripping, mutilation and death, systematically performed to this day (still in 2011 Faro City Council wanted to ban Gypsies in the municipality).
The prohibition of working on others (no one employs Gypsy workers, and those who accept they do it in total precariousness, for poorly paid positions and without decent rights and conditions). They cannot be dependent on their own work, they cannot get investment means due to extreme expropriation. Are dependent on precariousness. If you want to know what it is like to live in pure neoliberalism, know the lives of Gypsies. Their reality is paradigmatic of the aggression and depletion to which the "gentlemen" are willing to go to their benefit.
Are you talking about economic and political power?
The group of political, social, cultural and economic power. The owner, the colonizer. This group that has been in power since it established the system of current domination. And that only makes sense within the hierarchically stratified sociopolitical model in which we live. Hence the need to end 'gentlemen' and institute a new model of society, healthy, free, without hierarchies or strata, whether of race, class or gender.
The model we live in leads to the Gypsy (and not only) community to economic exclusion, removing it from access to product consumption or excluding them from its production process; political exclusion associated with lack of access to information; To education and consequently the social exclusion that is seen in inequality of access to quality community areas such as restaurants, libraries, theater, cinema, concerts, health care, etc. How do you feel a gypsy child when you realize that it is not part of a whole? Children who are never represented, neither in movies, nor in books, nor in cartoons, not even in an announcement to eat cereals, for example? Is this a disaster for self-esteem, is a priori condemnation?
The question is that. Gypsy people are not “excluded from society”, by contrast, they are included in it. The problem is the existence of what is cynically called 'social exclusion', which term Orwellian, and there be under coercion, people. Which field of concentration and extermination. Incidentally, Nazi concentration camps are a more visual realization than called 'social exclusion' and, as here, were not a 'excluded' part of Nazi society, but rather its fundamental and characterizing structure. It is a place of violence, where people are maintained by violence, dedicated to their extermination, and designed so that few people can leave. And yet they resist. As in Nazi concentration camps.
And what you have listed as an example of 'consequence' of this 'exclusion', is actually the means by which this exclusion also happens and remains. Gypsy people are out of theaters, both as consumers and producers (but go to the cinema). They are out of school, education and the gym. Either as 'users' or as producers (but go to school and are on the basis of knowledge construction and academic and scientific debates).
Even in attacking Gypsy children's self -confidence, we talk about a maintenance mechanism of this situation. But Gypsy people respond very well: with Gypsy pride. Another resistance, another aggression. Gypsy people are thus included in society. In a place that belongs to this model of modern society. And they resist and contradict the power of domination and make a point of being in the city, in the cinema, in the theater, in the gym, in all spaces. With a lot of struggle and always resisting, but they are there. Social exclusion, more than a “place outside of society”, is part of its social structure.
Do you want to say that there is a collective resistance?
At work, already in a context of absolute precariousness, during the pandemic, Gypsy people rolled up sleeves and showed once again proactivity and creativity in adversity. They learned seeing and doing. And here, it is again the women who jump to the front line, face, learn to use digital tools with their daughters or children, and throw themselves into the network. And so they explore online sales as well as application by application (transportation or rehabs). In housing, in a context of pandemic in which the evictions were not locked - as they owed and dictated the law itself - residents did not fail to organize and fight unjust evictions and claim dignity in housing; associations of allied residents in their action with other housing and anti-racist struggle organizations.
It should also be noted how they reinvented and intensified to raise and distribute dietary goods and kits of masks/alcohol gel to the most expropriated people. Gypsies and non -Gypsies. In the anti-racist struggle, new movements emerged and their actions intensified by social networks. People who had never been organized or militated before began their first steps in activism, thickening this way of the organization and popular gypsy and anti-racist action. People forget, or do not want to value, but Gypsy action has helped determine results in the political dispute. Gypsy citizens mobilized in large and determined electoral results in the municipalities of 2017, both in Alentejo and in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area, even causing electoral earthquakes.
And even in the presidential, second place was resolved by a value equivalent to the estimated number of Gypsy voters. Apart from the non -Gypsy votes that were mobilized by the action of Gypsy voters. Gypsy people are even co-considering power in the spaces of opinion, local media, social networks and party and institutional political dispute. And most importantly, in the popular Ação and alliances with other social movements. We have never stopped fighting for all means and continuing to resist.
In contrast there are more and more hate speeches, from the far right in particular. What do you have to say about it?
To start these speeches are historical and European. Not even current and even less “of the far right”. These speeches have been adopted and rendered for a long time, even in 'democracy and freedom', by several representatives of the center right, conservatives, left center, liberal, liberal left, even representatives of the PCP. Anti-egana rhetoric has always worked in Portugal as it is the whiter rhetoric [white genesis]. That is, it allows you to create and give the "white" as the superior of all. And so please the white electorate who, when feeling well, pays off with his vote. Even if the policies implemented by their elected harm him even more.
Finally, did you like them to talk a little about your personal experience and how did you get to the activist?
I studied, fought for studies, made alliances, graduated, went in the labor market of the “formal precariousness”. I started my militant action and here I am today. We can transform this society a better. This certainty combined with the fact that the current one has so much suffering makes anyone want to have a transformist attitude. I wanted to be 'inventor' (physical engineer) and anti -racist militant. And through study (not necessarily schooling) and organization with others, in turn, with other studies, formations and visions, I learned how the world works and how it can be changed. But before transforming, we need to survive.
Hence two types of actions arise: transformative and survival. The struggle against hate discourse arises as survival, but his defeat will be a transformative victory. There is a lot that - like people who want a better world - we have to do, namely working to criminalize hatred speech; condemn and prohibit organizations with racist discourses and practices; denounce the racist institutional structure and logics that organize power and generate community resources. And in this sense, there have been various types of actions, of petitions, to manifestations. And we need more.
I, besides being a military man in the SOS Racism movement, participate in the “We came to stay” podcast, with Mamadou BA and Joseph da Silva. And if all goes well, we will soon start a new project. With friendly people, we also have the project “Gypsy Initiative”, dedicated to reflecting and promoting transformative movements. Essentially focused on educating against anti-agigarism, denouncing historical and continued genocide and working for a new society project. Also with new projects on the gutter. And finally, there are always voluntary actions without an organization, where I try to share what I found out about anti-egism and Roman history in schools and with interested people. In addition, there is still the struggle for housing, because the evictions did not stop during the pandemic. Due to housing and work precariousness, the subjects racialized especially the Roma nationals are the most vulnerable to COVID-19. There is essential to have actions in this area; Of all the struggles, this is the most structural, as it goes against one of the main enemies of a healthy society: the real estate speculation of this capitalist system, which places profit and goods above people and their humanization.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>ESPORTS | First Fia Girls on Track Esports Cup Decided in Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/06/esports-primeira-taca-fia-girls-on-track-esports-decidida-em-macau/</link><description>Next June, for the first time in its history, Macau will host the Extraordinary General Meetings and the Conference of the International Automobile Federation (FIA). This event, which will take place at Galaxy International Convention Center, from 10 to 13 June, will be complemented with extra activity: the first edition of the “Fia Girls on Track Esports Cup”
 
The worldwide body that governs motorized sport has announced this new competition of Sim Racing, which is being organized in partnership with the Advanced Simracing Simeling Simulation Cockpit manufacturer and the popular SIM Racing Iracing game, will be directed to 16 or older female elements, regardless of pre -esports experience. To apply, participants must register on the FIA ​​official website. In addition, it is necessary to have an active account in Iracing to compete.
Online qualifications for the competition, whose finals will be held at MSAR, have already started officially. The first phase consists of participants trying to record the fastest return on Iracing's Attack team. This online qualification phase ends on May 6th. After this first stage, the top 10 classifieds will be invited to participate in the Grande Final, which will take place at the Week of Extraordinary General Meetings and the 2025 FIA Conference, scheduled from June 10 to 13. In Macao, participants will compete in a several day -to -day face -to -face final, where the first champion of the “Fia Girls on Track Esports Cup” will be crowned.
"We know that eSports are the future, but for this discipline to grow and truly develop, we need to encourage more girls and women to get involved," said Ciscal Niroshan Pereira, the current chairman of the FIA ​​eSports committee. “We hope this competition will serve as a catalyst, encouraging aspiring pilot to experience our discipline and consider a career in motorized sport.”
According to FIA, the 10 finalists will also have access to a training program on how to deal with social communication and networking opportunities, gaining a valuable view of the motor sport industry.
Grow on all fronts
This is the first time the fia girls on track initiative has been involved in a eSports competition. His best known project was probably the Fia Girls On Track-Rising Stars program, an initiative aimed at promoting car sports with the female audience aged 13 and 18, and supported young women's pilots between 2020 and 2023. It is recalled that only 1.5 percent of the total sports licenses are women.
Burcu çetinkaya, the president of the FIA ​​Women in Motorsport Commission, said that “FIA is committed to duplicating participation in motorized sport and creating more opportunities for women and girls. Electronic sports allow us to reach more vast and younger audiences-especially those talent to discover or with limited access to traditional motorcycle sports. The winner - at the event in Macau. ”
The FIA ​​decision to launch a eSports competition exclusively for women also reinforces the body's bet on the digital landscape. Electronic sports are an increasingly important part of the FIA ​​base development program.
Last year, the Federation added an Appendix of ESPORTS (Appendix E) to the International Sports Code, allowing national sports authorities to regulate and manage national and international competitions. The FIA ​​also supported numerous regional eSports events, received a record number of 117 eSports participants in the Motorsport Games and further encouraged adhesion by offering 12 -month subscriptions from IRACING to member clubs.</description><pubDate>2025-05-06 00:31:27</pubDate></item><item><title>GPM | Carlos Lemos presents volume II of his book in October</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/02/gpm-carlos-lemos-apresenta-volume-ii-do-seu-livro-em-outubro/</link><description>After the success of Volume I, Macaense Carlos Lemos, residing in Toronto since 1974, is prepared to launch, in October, the Macao Grand Prix-Victor H.'s personal collection, 1954-1978, volume II (1967-1978), the second part of a book that intends to honor his father, Victor Hugo Lemos-an enthusiast of the great prize of Macao that Life, collected a vast number of photographs and everything that was related to the car races in Macau since 1954, the date of the first edition of the event.
About the second part of the work, Carlos Lemos explained to HM that it will be “very similar to volume I, but contains more newspaper clippings in English and Chinese of each year, as well as some financial reports of the Grand Prix. It also includes a poster of the Jubilee Year, which I made three limited copies and initialed in Canvas, offering one to the Macau (Apomac) retirees and pensioners association (Apomac) Lusitano, as a sign of thanks for the support provided. ”
Docued with photographs of the time and newspaper articles, there are some of the most emblematic periods of the mashed event, such as the evolution of the guide circuit, the first victim (Arsenio Laurel, 1967), the birth of the Grand Motor Motor Prize and the Guide Race, the arrival of the first factory teams and the first sponsors, the first television broadcast in direct, and the attempted Hong Kong to create his own great prize itself. Also in addition to a new chapter, with "ten pages of another collection of my father, called Motor Racing World, with some copies of 1900, autographed photographs of pilots, leaders and personalities of world motorsport."
After releasing volume I in 2023, the presentation of Volume II is scheduled for October 15 in Macao and on October 17 in the neighboring Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong.
More and bigger
The truth is that sales of the first volume exceeded expectations. "It was really a success," the author acknowledges, because "there are only two dozen copies left, which I kept for myself, for offers and reservations, if someone outside Macau is interested." However, for Carlos Lemos, “the biggest success was to be able to raise more than 41,000 patacas for charity”, intended for the Macau IC2 [I Can Too] institution, which supports people with autism or disability.
For this second volume, with more recent content, the number of copies produced will increase slightly. "The impression of volume I was 500 copies, and I found it a little" tight "to get a satisfactory number to offer friends and certain personalities and entities linked to the Grand Prix. So I had 550 copies this time."
Carlos Lemos also underlines that "Apomac and the Lusitano Club of Hong Kong promised to support the launch of Volume II, which is very important." The book will have more pages - about one hundred more - and the author confirms: “I've received several reservations!”
Mission (almost) fulfilled
With the publication of the second volume, Carlos Lemos's first major goal will be fulfilled, because "my mission to honor my father is complete with regard to the Macao Grand Prix collection, though not entirely, because my father's biggest dream was to have his name in Guinness World Records."
This is also a curious story, as Victor H. Lemos has applied three times to Guinness World Records, to no avail. "God willing and all goes well, I will try once again, on his behalf, to present a new candidacy for the Guinness Book of Records and perhaps also to Fiva Hall of Fame." Fiva (International Federation of Old Vehicles) is a non -profit world organization dedicated to the protection, preservation and promotion of historical automobile heritage.
“This time, for Guinness World Records, I will submit the application with support documents, such as videos and photographs of the collection and books,” explains the former president of the Macao House in Toronto. "My father wrote only one letter without attaching any document, because in those days there was no ease we have today."
In addition to motoring, Carlos Lemos also reveals that he would like to “publish a book on the collection of matches of matches made in Macao. My father collected labels of matchboxes from around the world - has Portugal, Spain, several countries in Europe, etc. This project depends on the time available and the interest of people”. And we stay here for collections? Maybe not: "I have hundreds too, maybe thousands of old coins - so many that is complicated ... So I won't move (laughs)."</description><pubDate>2025-05-02 06:30:08</pubDate></item><item><title>Macao's historicals get a GP clearance</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/20/historicos-de-macau-conseguem-apuramento-para-gp/</link><description>The Guangdong International Circuit welcomed, last weekend, the second and decisive double journey of Macao - Macau Road Sport Challenge cars, proof of finding for the most important motor racing of the season: the Macao Grand Prix. In a journey with few celebration reasons for the colors of the sinters, the veterans Jerónimo Badaraco and Rui Valente managed to ensure the qualification.
With a list of 68 subscribers, the grill was divided into two groups, A and B, with all the pilots competing with Toyota Gr86 (ZN8) or Subaru BRZ (ZD8) models. This year, with only one race scheduled for the Grand Prix Program - due to the inclusion of the FIA ​​Formula 4 World Cup - the number of riders was reduced to 36, which placed a supplementary pressure for both missing races. To complicate, the rain came, changing the turns to teams and riders.
In Group A, where Rui Valente faced a complicated weekend on the track around Zhaoqing, Célio Alves Dias and Maximiano Mannão failed to qualify, in a series dominated by Hong Kong pilots. In Saturday's race, the podium consisted of Wong Chuck Pan, Lo Pak Yu and Chan Ka Ping. On Sunday, these three repeated the feat, but with a new order: Lo Pak Yu, Chan Ka Ping and Wong Chuck Pan.
In difficult atmospheric conditions on Saturday, Rui Valente ended only 25th, due to an error in tuning, improving to 15th on Sunday, with the track dry. A penalty after the second race fired him to the 27th place. Still, the 7th place obtained on the first round was enough to secure a place in the Macao Grand Prix.
On the contrary, Maximiano Mannão, behind the wheel of a Toyota with the colors of the historic Macau Racing Team, ended on 26th and 14th, a result below the finding, but it turns out to be positive given that it was Jove Pilot's debut in these wanderings. Célio Alves Dias, with difficulties in his car since the first race, was 24th and 28th, far from the usual level of this experienced Macaense pilot.
Badaraco with final sprint '
On a weekend, where the lively races were broadcast on live streaming in Group B, Hong Kong riders stood out again. On Sunday, Adrian Chung won, with Leung Tsz Wa and Tsang Pak Yin completing the podium. In the second confrontation, Cheang Kin Sang reached a deserved victory, followed again by Leung Tsz Wa and Tsang Pak Yin.
Jerónimo Badaraco came to this challenging weekend without the assured clearance. A modest qualification and 11th Saturday place maintained the open outcome. However, a solid race on Sunday and an excellent 4th place assured veteran Macanese the much desired place on the grid of the Macao Grand Prix, along with countrymen Cheng Kin San, Leong Keng Hei, Lou Check In and Carson Tang.
Also outside the Grand Prix was Dionísio Albino Pereira, who finished 23rd in Saturday's race, but closed the time more forcefully, cutting the line of goal in 13th place in the second race.
At the end of the races, competitors provisionally calculated had an extra technical verification, being forced to open engines and gearbox, to verify the legality of these two decisive organs of their vehicles.</description><pubDate>2025-05-20 01:57:43</pubDate></item><item><title>Fit F4 World Cup will be in Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/09/primeira-taca-do-mundo-de-f4-sera-em-macau/</link><description>The International Automobile Federation (FIA), announced on Wednesday afternoon that the 2025 Macao Grand Prix will feature its program with the first edition of the Formula 4 World Cup.
The World Council of Motorsport approved by electronic vote the creation of this Formula 4 World Cup in Macao, along with the return to the Territory of the Regional Formula World Cup, which in 2023 came to occupy the place of Formula 3, and the FIA ​​GT World Cup.
The concept of Formula 4 has been introduced by the FIA ​​for over a decade and has been one of the biggest success stories of motorized training sport, currently there are 13 different national championships within the technical and sports framework of the FIA. This will be the fourth time the discipline runs in Macao, having been a regular presence from 2020 to 2023, and was even “head of poster” in the three years the world was immersed in the pandemic.
The FIA ​​did not say how the pilots will be chosen, just referring in a statement that there will be "a rigorous selection process of pilots, with only the most talented young people to be authorized to compete." The International Federation also stressed that the Chinese company “Mintimes, organizer of the F4 Chinese Championship, will be the Single Operator, along with FFSA (Fédération Française du Sport Automobile), responsible for providing technical support to the F4 F4 World Cup”. This means that all competitors will have to use Mygale M21-F4 singleolugar, recently renamed Ligier JS F422.
Paris support
The chairman of the FIA ​​monoligae commission, the Italian Emanuele Pirro, said that “Macau is an essential part of the formation of a young pilot, and we have a duty to protect his legacy and future. There is as few challenges as the Macao Grand Prix that we feel that it was the right time to introduce the F4 Fia World Cup. From F4, which is a little more permissive than a regional formula car, so that when they return to a year or two to the FR world cup, they are prepared to truly show what they are capable. ”
Emanuele Pirro, a former guide race vender and a MSAR test enthusiast, also said that "we are also working hard to ensure that we take this opportunity to inspire and educate young Karting riders in the region. The growth and development potential in China and the Asia Pacific region is huge as we boost participating in motorized sport."
Thinking about Macau
FIA's long statement also states that this initiative “also aims to bring students from Karting de Macao, China and the region in general to watch the event in an observational manner, offering them the opportunity to experience a motor racing test and to obtain valuable knowledge for the next steps in their careers”.
Without going into detail, the international federation, which did not allow it to decline on the participation of Chinese teams in the regional formula cup last year, says that “this big step will undoubtedly benefit local Macao pilots, which will have access to a complete range of international events - Karting, Formula 4 and Regional Formula - on national soil”.
In a statement of Chong Coc Veng, president of the Macao-China General Automobile Association, he said: “We are happy to see FIA ​​hold a F4 World Cup at the Guide Circuit in Macao, which represents an opportunity for young people in the region to find their way of development from international Karting events to F4 and FR singleoligles, and become world champions in the future.”
The participation of MSAR pilots in this race has not yet been officially disclosed, but may be limited in number.</description><pubDate>2025-05-09 00:41:31</pubDate></item><item><title>GP | Tourism finding races took place in Zhaoqing</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/21/gp-corridas-de-apuramento-de-turismo-decorreram-em-zhaoqing/</link><description>The 2025 edition of the Macao-Macau Road Sport Challenge-Macao Touring Championship-began at the Guangdong International Circuit, with 67 cars divided into two groups, A and B, disputing a total of four races over the weekend. Hong Kong riders again showed their superiority, but there were positive results among Macau pilots
 
In addition to the titles at stake, the competition organized by the Macau-China General Automobile Association (AAMC), which is divided into two events, also serves to assign the thirty-six vacancies available to the most important race of the season: the Macao Grand Prix. As such, this first journey on the circuit of the surroundings of Zhaoqing was particularly tense, with very disputed races between the Toyota Gr86 (ZN8) and the Subaru BRZ (ZD8), all equipped this year with the new DMC compound pirelli tires.
In the group it aligned three well -known pilots of the Lusophone community: Rui Valente, Célio Alves Dias and Maximiano Mannão. However, a less achieved qualification left the three in the final part of the starting grid, forcing them to redoubled work in the first race, played on Saturday afternoon. This same race was eventually interrupted with a red flag a few turns from the end, due to an oil stroke on the track. Damon Chan, winner of the competition in 2024, triumphed, followed by Lo Pak Yu and Chan Ka Ping, in a podium entirely composed of Hong Kong pilots. The experienced Rui Valente starred in an excellent recovery race, rising from 29th to 14th position. Maximiano Mannão won three places and finished 22nd, while Célio Alves Dias climbed eight positions, ending at 25th.
In the second race, Rui Valente again printed a strong progress, spinning 5th, but the degradation of the tires prevented him from maintaining the position, ending in 7th. With a scoring system that privileges the top ten classifieds, this result may be decisive for their qualification for the Great Award. In his weekend debuts to the commands of a Maximian Maão Tourism car, whose Toyota boasts the colors and the logo of the historic Macau Racing Team, ended in 15th. Célio Alves Dias, on a complicated weekend, was only 23rd and knows that there is a lot to do if you want to qualify next month. The victory was up to Lo Pak Yu, pressured closely by Wong Chuk Pan and Leong Keng Hei. The best representative in the territory was Lou Check In with a 4th place.
MSar and Top-10 Victory for Badaraco
Group B races were also marked by uncertainty and great animation inside the track. Chung Kwok Hei, winner in 2023, led the race until a hole forced him to leave. Cheng Kin Sang, representative of MSAR, took the opportunity and took the lead. Bayern Yip Wai Hei has released several attacks, all effectively defended by Cheng. However, an apparent accident on the main line, near the end, caused a new red flag interruption. Cheng Kin Sang won, ending ahead of Bayern Yip and Lam Tou.
In the second race, Bayern Yip exceeded Cheng Kin Sang on the second round and took command. Despite Safety Car's entrance twice, Bayern Yip kept his calm and secured the victory, winning a first and second place in the weekend. Rao Long, who left the eighth position, showed excellent pace and climbed to the 2nd place in the last two laps. Cheng Kin Sang concluded in 3rd place, adding two podiums on the opening day.
Jerónimo Badaraco, the last winner of the ACP Cup, in 1999, had a discreet beginning, ending in 19th Saturday's race. On Sunday, “Noni” showed that he still has a lot to give local motorsport, reaching a precious 10th place. Already Dionísio Albino Pereira completed the first race in 29th position and did not aligned in the second.
The next, final and decisive journey is scheduled for May 16-18, again at the Guangdong International Circuit.</description><pubDate>2025-04-21 23:40:23</pubDate></item><item><title>Table Tennis | Jieni Shao eliminated in the group phase of the World Cup</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/17/tenis-de-mesa-jieni-shao-eliminada-na-fase-de-grupos-da-taca-do-mundo/</link><description>The Portuguese Jieni Shao was eliminated yesterday from the Table Tennis World Cup in Macao, losing with Chinese Wang Yidi, the third of the world ranking, in the last game of the group stage.
