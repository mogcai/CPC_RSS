However, the number of terminals for making electronic payments has grown from about 70,000 to almost 110,000
 
From the end of 2020, to the end, banks have made available 429 automatic (or ATM boxes) to the population. The most recent number, referring to the end of June this year, was advanced to HM by the Macao Monetary Authority (AMCM), and contrasts with the greatest use of other forms of electronic payments.
According to data advanced by AMCM, in late June there were a total of 1,358 automatic boxes in operation. This number shows that compared to the end of 2024 there was even an increase in the number of boxes to work, with 29 more units. However, compared to the end of 2020, the year when there were more automatic boxes to work, the fall has happened practically constantly.
At the end of 2020 were in operation 1,787 automatic boxes, the largest number recorded at least since 2016. Compared to June 2025, there was a reduction of 429 automatic boxes, the equivalent of 24 percent decrease. This reduction means that for every five boxes operating at the end of 2020 one is no longer available.
The reduction has been progressively, but has accelerated in recent years, except for the first six months of this year. Between 2020 and 2021 only nine boxes are no longer available. However, between 2021 and 2022, the decrease was 221 units, or 12.4 percent.
Between 2022 and 2023 the breaking of the number of automatic boxes was slower, with a reduction 56 units to 1.501, when it was once 1,557. Between 2023 and last year the reduction was accelerating to the rate of 11.5 percent, with 172 machines in operation, which meant that 2024 ended with 1,358 machines to operate.
Other alternatives
The closing of banks' automatic boxes contrasts with the reality of payments through mobile phone applications that have continually expanded in the last five years.
In late 2020, according to the statistics published in January 2021 by AMCM, there were about 70,000 machines that accepted mobile payments. However, in the first quarter of 2020, the number of machines was about 43,000, which means that within 12 months the number almost doubled it. Throughout this year the value of transactions with mobile payments was approximately 6.31 billion patacas.
However, the first trimester numbers of 2025 show a higher implementation of this type of payments, a trend to which the Ho IAT SENG government also used the electronic payment means to assign consumption support during the pandemic.
According to the latest data at the end of March 2025, AMCM accounted for 108,749 terminals for mobile payments. And only in the first quarter the value of transactions reached 7.9 billion patacas. AMCM data also show that throughout 2024 there was a total of 30.3 billion transacted patacas through electronic payments.

A travel agency representative stated that 10 macao excursionists were in Hokkaido, where some zones had evacuation notice. Residents are safe and there were no requests for help

According to information provided by Paul Wong, president of the Macao Tourist Industry Association, ten residents of Macao who are making a tour in the Japanese region of Hokkaido are safe. In the statements made to the Chinese channel of Radio Macau, Paul Wong added that this group of ten people should return to Macau soon.

Paul Wong also said that in August there will be dozens of macao tour in Hokkaido and that, for now, there were no cancellations of the trips.
About two million people in Japan yesterday received orders to abandon their homes or coastal areas due to the risk of tsunami. The earthquake, which took place on the Kamchatka Russian Peninsula, had a magnitude of 8.8, and in Hokkaido, the largest island in the Japanese archipelago and the closest to Kamchatka, the local authorities issued a maximum level withdrawal order (5 in 5) to 10,463 citizens of the Urakawa Courage City.
In addition, more than 1.9 million people in 21 municipalities along the Japan Pacific coast have received level 4 withdrawal warnings, which appeal to the “removal of dangerous areas” - such as those near the sea and the mouth of the rivers - “as soon as possible before the situation gets worse”.
SMG issued order
However, weather and geophysical services yesterday issued a note to say that Macau will not impact this earthquake. It was only a forecast that “a small wave of tsunami” could reach the coast of Macao between 18h and 19h, “could cause a fluctuation of the water level of 0.1 meters or less”, without “significant risk” to the territory.
Japanese authorities' evacuation orders are based on the warnings issued by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), which have been in force from early yesterday morning to virtually the entire Pacific coast of the archipelago, and which estimate the occurrence of tsunamis up to three meters high.
Until yesterday afternoon (Macao Hour) had been recorded tsunamis up to 1.3 meters high in the locality of Kuji, Iwate City Hall, and 80 centimeters on the Nemuro Peninsula in Hokkaido, both in the north. A 30 centimeter tsunami was also observed in the port of Yokohama, south of Tokyo.</description><pubDate>2025-07-31 00:25:34</pubDate></item><item><title>Chikungunya | Announced Sixth Resident Infection</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/31/chikungunya-anunciada-sexta-infeccao-de-residente/</link><description>With the number of chikungunya fever cases rising in recent days, the secretary for social affairs and culture, LAM has visited shipyards and public parks, where it was filmed by government propaganda teams

By the time the statement was issued, the authorities also justified the reinforcement of mosquito extermination actions with the fact that five imported cases were recorded in Macao (the most recent case had not yet been disclosed), as well as a local dengue fever case.</description><pubDate>2025-07-31 00:19:02</pubDate></item><item><title>Beijing issued 63,000 visas for qualified paintings for Macau and Hong Kong</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/31/pequim-emitiu-63-mil-vistos-para-quadros-qualificados-para-macau-e-hong-kong/</link><description>The National Administration for Immigration issued about 63,000 visas for qualified squares of Beijing, Shanghai and the cities of the Great Bay to settle in Macau or Hong Kong.

The third largest Japanese car manufacturer also had an operational loss of 462 million euros, while sales volume dropped 9.7 percent in homologous terms to 15.824 billion euros, according to the financial report published yesterday.
The registered net loss is lower than expected by analysts consulted by Bloomberg, but reflects a situation still difficult for the Japanese manufacturer, involved in a large restructuring process.
Although the evolution of its offer and fixed cost reductions “has allowed to alleviate losses, the group continues to face contrary winds, namely a decrease in sales volumes, unfavorable fluctuations of exchange rates and the impact of US customs rights,” Nissan says.
The company maintains its predictions for the entire year 2025-2026, by 73 billion euros, but is excused to provide forecasts of profits or losses in a still very volatile commercial environment.
Japan's car exports to the United States have been subject to a 25 percent surcharge since April by the Trump administration. Total customs rights to the sector should be reduced to 15 percent, according to a recently completed agreement between Tokyo and Washington.

The idea was defended by Tiago Vasconcelos, advisor to Rocha Vieira, at a symposium promoted by the City of Macau. The Major General also agrees with the extent of the forum to Spanish-speaking countries
 
On Tuesday at the City of Macau (UCM), a symposium centered on cooperation in areas of scientific research and higher education between Macau, China and Portuguese-speaking countries, which served to present various academic projects that are being developed at MSAR.
The event was attended by Major-General Tiago Vasconcelos, who was an advisor to General Rocha Vieira in the last years of the Portuguese administration of the territory, and who defended a broader look at the role that the Macao Forum can take.
In its presentation, which HM had access, it is read that "the importance of the creation of the Macau Forum cannot be underestimated, both from a symbolic and practical point of view," but "it is necessary to be realistic as to what one can expected from such an organization."
Thus, for Tiago Vasconcelos, “the Macao Forum must find its place among other forms of diplomacy”, such as “bilateral relations, in some cases 'strategic partnerships' bilateral, such as Brazil and Portugal”, or “belonging to other forums” or “multilateral organizations such as G20 or BRICS, of which both China and Brazil are members, or the ASEAN Regional Forum, of which Timor-Leste as China are participants. ”
It is for the person responsible for a "variable geometry", where "the belongings of countries to various forums simultaneously can offer opportunities for the" Macao Platform "to broaden its scope."
And here the former advisor of the last Portuguese governor of Macau highlights the importance of the extent of the MSA platform to Spanish -speaking countries, something that has also been defended by the local executive.
Thus, the MSAR can, with the multiplicity of roles and partnerships of the Macao Forum, “reach other Latin-speaking countries, especially Spanish-speaking, given the similarities between Portuguese and Spanish languages, and existing dialogue platforms, such as the Ibero-American conference, which connects Portugal, Spain and most Latin American countries”.
In general terms, the official understands that one should “understand the proper role played by the Macau Forum among the various personalized bilateral and multilateral cooperation formats, as well as the lessons learned from the more than 20 years of history of the Forum”. This “is of paramount importance to ensure the proper level of ambition and the effectiveness of any new forms of cooperation in which Macau can act as a useful platform,” he said.
A promising land
In conclusion, Tiago Vasconcelos said that since the arrival of the early Portuguese to the territory, in the mid -16th century, that "Macao has played a traditional role as a platform between mainland China and the outside world", playing "part of the" Portuguese world "for almost 450 years, naturally integrating its network."
Thus, ties with Portuguese -speaking countries are "a legacy of their history," which "helps Macao to preserve some of their distinctive characteristics, but also play a useful role in supporting Chinese diplomacy, further facilitating China's relations with Portuguese -speaking countries."
For Tiago Vasconcelos, “Macau's prospects are quite promising to continue to play its traditional and very distinctive role as a connecting platform between China and the Portuguese-speaking countries”, taking into account that it begins half of the 50-year transition period present in the Sino-Portuguese joint statement of 1987.
Still in the area of higher education, the Major General pointed out that "despite its dimension, Macau is becoming, if it is no longer, a center of excellence for higher education in China." "Even worldwide, the same can be said about some specific sectors, making Macau a highly attractive destination for very talented students," he added. The official highlighted the role of the four key laboratories of the existing state, namely VLSI (large-scale integrated circuits) analog and mixed signal at the University of Macao (one); The Quality Research Laboratory in Chinese Medicine, between one and the University of Science and Technology of Macao; The Internet of Things Laboratory to Smart Cities, at UM; and also the laboratory for the Lunar and Planetary sciences, of Must.
The seminar where Tiago Vasconcelos participated, entitled “Scientific and Technological Cooperation between China and Portuguese -speaking countries”, also attended representatives of the central government's connection office on the Macau forum, among other academic and business personalities.
According to a press release on the event sent to HM, José Paulo Esperança, vice-rector of the UCM Faculty of Economics, spoke of the importance of financing academic investigations by the Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) in Portugal, highlighting “FCT's efforts to promote international cooperation and resolution of common challenges”.
IP KUAI PENG, Vice Rector of UCM and Director of the Institute of Studies of Portuguese-Speaking Countries at the same educational institution, argued that Macau “should be based on cooperation with Portuguese-speaking countries”, as well as “actively expanding exchange in various areas with Spanish-speaking countries, building a deep, and sustainable cooperation ecosystem, continuing to expand the circle of international friends and international friends and draw a new plan for modernization ”in the format followed by China.
In addition, the official believes that the “remains an important high-level outside opening window for the country” should continue to create “an international cooperation model in areas such as high technology, digital economy and standardization of traditional Chinese medicine, contributing to the construction of a technological power of the country and, at the same time, achieving diverse and moderate economic development”.
Think-Tank to Spanish
The UCM Vice Rector believes it can be created in Macau “an interregional Think Tank with the best universities in Portuguese and Spanish countries, focusing on areas such as green energy, biomedicine and digital technology, promoting transionic circulation with technological means and helping developing countries to overcome digital gap”.
Among the participating researchers in the seminar, highlighting Marta Filipa Simões, from the Macao University of Science and Technology, which presented the Sino-Portuguese Cooperation Project in Fungi and Astrobiology Research. The academic suggested “the conduct of various research projects through cooperation between Macau and scientific research institutions in Angola, Brazil, Cape Verde, Mozambique and Portugal, in order to promote interregional scientific innovation”.
Already André Antunes, from the University of São José, stressed that, currently, "Macao plays an important role as a point of contact in the network of Portuguese-speaking countries", with a very centered cooperation "in the economic area", although, he defended, "the scientific area will become in a new strong point."</description><pubDate>2025-07-24 05:04:52</pubDate></item><item><title>Dengue Fever | Authorities warn of the risk of imported cases</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/22/febre-da-dengue-autoridades-alertam-para-risco-de-casos-importados/</link><description>Macau is facing a “high risk” period of imported cases of dengue fever and chikungunya. The warning was reiterated yesterday at a joint conference on health services and the institute for municipal affairs. Last year's dengue fever cases have been the highest of the last two decades
 
Health Services (SS) and the Institute for Municipal Affairs (AMI) joined yesterday to alert the population to the growing risk of imported cases of dengue fever and chikungunya fever, given that the summer period is synonymous with more travel and travel.
At a press conference, Leong Iek Hou, doctor and head of the SS disease prevention and control center, said that "there was an increase in cases of dengue fever and chikungunya fever in neighboring regions, which is a high risk to Macao." In addition, he added, "we know that we are in the summer time, there is an increase in the number of Macao residents who travel abroad, or tourists traveling to Macao, factors that may increase the risk of disease." Thus, “the risk of cases [fever] in Macau is high,” said the official.
Leong Iek Ham has advanced some numbers, having said that until Sunday, 2,285 confirmed cases of fever were reported, 2,100 occurred only in Shunde district.
In the case of Macao, between 2013 and 2019 there were “two to three imported cases of chikungunya fever, all from Southeast Asia”, but in recent years it has increased, although there are no serious cases.
Leong Iek Hou also highlighted the fact that, last Friday, Macau registered the first imported case of this year's Chikungunya fever. According to a statement issued by the SS that same day, the patient is a 61 -year -old man, resident and resident in the Cheng I building, on Avenida do Conselheiro Borja.
Between July 8 and 17, the patient moved to Shunde district in Foshan, with the aim of visiting family members. However, they describe the SS, on the morning of the 17th “began to present symptoms such as fever, headaches, muscle and joint aches, among others”, having returned Macao and sought medical treatment at the Conde de São Januário hospital center.
On the 18th, the public health laboratory confirmed the presence of the Chikungunya virus, with a positive result. To date, the patient has kept stable.
Since the beginning of the year and until July 19, the city of Foshan recorded a total of 1,873 confirmed cases of chikungunya fever, of which 1,790 are from Shunde district, focusing mainly on the villages of Lecong, Beijiao, Chenncun. 49 cases occurred in the district of Chancheng, focusing mainly on the sub-district of Shiwanzhen, Zumiao and Zhangcha; While 34 cases were detected in the Nanhai district, focusing mainly on the Guicheng sub-district.
A dengue of the worst
As for dengue fever cases, Leong Iek Hama pointed out that by 2024 the occurrence of this disease "it was relatively more severe when compared to the last 20 years, as 38 cases of dengue were recorded, nine locations."
"This year were registered eight cases imported of dengue fever, being a place," said the SS official. It has been said that it is possible to lock and combat these infections through, for example, the cleaning of stagnant water, which attracts the proliferation of mosquitoes.
“This year we have done more work to eliminate mosquitoes with Jardim Camões,” said Fong Vai Seng, head of the AMI Environmental Hygiene and Licensing Department.
"We can say that we can eliminate mosquitoes that can be carriers of the virus [causer of fevers], avoiding its transmission. In any of the forms we are at the peak of cases, and residents and tourists may be carried to the virus, so we have to be alert. We have done a series of cleaning work to avoid the source of mosquitoes proliferation, and until June [since the year] we have supervised about 7,400 spaces." It was mentioned.
Inspection actions took place in 140 places that are considered “black points” with regard to the proliferation of mosquitoes, and between January and June this year, 1,220 chemical elimination actions of these insects were made.
Both entities promise to work side by side in cleaning land. “AMI and SS have a mechanism for monitoring and treatment of hygiene problems in private spaces or unoccupied land. Whenever the ss find that there is danger to public health, or in case of an emergency situation, and whenever it is not possible to contact the landowners, AMI will collaborate on removing containers or zones with stagnant water that may serve as proliferation of Mosquitoes, ”was said at the press conference.
Leong Iek Hou also explained that there are not yet many places in Macao where tests can be done that disapprove of the infection. "There are not many medical institutions that have this type of test available. When clinics or private hospitals want to take the test for dismissing transmissible diseases, these institutions send us blood samples and we do the tests in our public health laboratory for free for various types of fever, given that symptoms are similar."
Hong Kong on Alert
The risk alert of more imported cases of these two types of fever has also arrived in Hong Kong. According to the South China Morning Post newspaper on Thursday, several experts warn of the high risk of infections taking into account the outbreak registered in the city of Foshan, belonging to Guangdong province.
Wong Hoi-Kei, a senior doctor and head of the Guangdong Center for Health Protection, said that "although outbreaks do not occur in popular cities among Hong Kong inhabitants, frequent trips between Guangdong and Hong Kong mean the risk of imported cases is higher."
Also quoted by the same newspaper, doctor Joseph Tsang Kay-Yan, an infectious illness expert, said it is possible that Hong Kong will have imported cases that may lead to sporadic infections, and explained that the two types of fevers have similar symptoms, but with a big difference: with chikungunya fever, patients feel joint pain.
Wong Hoi-Kei said that several cleaning actions are being developed to avoid proliferation of mosquitoes and to inform the population for symptoms. "We have the ability to reduce the risk of an outbreak triggered by imported cases as much as possible," Wong said.
This year alone, and according to data released by SCMP, more than 220,000 cases of chikungunya fever were registered worldwide in 14 locations, including the Taiwan and Singapore regions. The latest cases of this type of fever in Hong Kong had occurred in 2019, with only 11 patients.
According to the SS, the means of transmission and measures to prevent and control chikungunya fever and dengue fever are identical, both transmitted by bite of mosquitoes of the "Aedes albopictus" species, which usually reproduce in small amounts of stagnant, clean and stopped water. Given the recent passage through Macao do Typhoon Wipha, the authorities yesterday remembered the importance of cleaning these spaces.
Chikungunya fever is a viral disease and has a period of incubation of three to eight days, which can vary between two and 12 days, with fever symptoms and then joint pain in body areas such as wrists, knees, ankles and fingertips. Two to three days later rashes appear. "The whole course of the disease usually lasts five to seven days, being the state of health of most patients considered light," explains the SS.</description><pubDate>2025-07-22 23:51:12</pubDate></item><item><title>War | Historians defend a monument about Vitória against Japanese invasion</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/22/guerra-historiadores-defendem-monumento-sobre-vitoria-contra-invasao-japonesa/</link><description>In a year of celebration of the 80th anniversary of China's victory in the war against Japanese aggression, Macao schools were encouraged by the government to convey these historical episodes to students. In the fervor of the ephemeris, an academic defended the construction of a monument to mark the date. HM has heard historians who enhance the ideas that should be transmitted by the monument
 
2025 is the year in which the 80th anniversary of China's victory is celebrated in the so -called Chinese people's resistance war against Japanese aggression and anti -fascist World War, that is, when China and Hong Kong managed to escape the Japanese occupation. Macao, having Portuguese administration, and for having kept neutral during World War II, was not occupied by the Japanese, although the neutrality status was quite volatile, as historian Helena Lopes showed in the work “Neutrality and Collaboration in South China: Macau During the Second World War”.
In this context, authorities have encouraged schools in the territory to recall the historical episode through various activities with a patriotic nature, while Lin Guangzhi, director of the Institute for Social and Cultural Research of the University of Science and Technology of Macao (Must in the English), argued that a monument of war in Japan with Japan should be created in Macau.
HM invited two historians, experts in this historical period, to comment on what has indeed happened in these years and what main messages should be transmitted if the construction of the monument actually advances.
Alfredo Gomes Dias, professor of the Lisbon Polytechnic Institute and author of the Doctoral Thesis on Macaense Diaspora in World War II and the Foundation of the Popular Republic of China, entitled “The Macaense Diaspora. Macau, Hong Kong, Shanghai (1850-1952)”, argues that the celebration of this historical period is common to several countries. "In the case of China, the end of the Japanese invasion, taking into account the violence of which it has covered, can and should be celebrated generically throughout the Chinese territory," he said.
But considering that Hong Kong had an effective occupation, while Macau dealt with refugee seizures and power games between Portuguese, Chinese, English and Japanese, will make sense to have a monument on the mashes? Alfredo Gomes Dias understands that yes.
“In the case of Macao, the monument gains relief if he perpetuates the memory that Chinese, Portuguese and Macanese have fought the invasion, especially on the island of Hong Kong, many of them died on the battlefield. In addition, Macau maintained the tradition of being a territory of refuge that housed Chinese and Macanese from Hong Kong.”
Essentially, the researcher understands that "in any of the cities he can be erected," but in the particular case of Macao, it is important that the monument "intends to take into account the specificity of the history of Macao and the diversity of origin of its residents." Moreover, which argues that it should "preserve the memory of all who have joined side by side to oppose Japanese imperialism at this time."
“Ambiguous neutrality”
For Helena Lopes, a particular interest historian in Macao's landscape in World War II, and author of the work on Macao's neutrality during this period, said she did not see "no problem in building a commemorative monument of World War II in Macao."
In the 1930s and 40s of the twentieth century, he recalls, "most of the population was, like today, Chinese," although "a significant number of the population was a refugee, having sought in Macao (such as in other places not occupied in China) shelter of the violence of conflict."
Thus, Helena Lopes, professor of history at contemporary Asia at the University of Cardiff, in Wales, says it is "normal for China to celebrate victory in World War II, as other allied countries do."
Regarding Macao's neutrality, the historian says it was "ambiguous", given that "many opposite sides crossed the territory during the war."
In these years, "the territory has been deeply linked to networks of resistance and humanitarian aid during the war: it was not isolated from conflict, but it was deeply linked to several of its dynamics identically to other territories in China under foreign rule (such as foreign concessions of Shanghai or Hong Kong until these territories were completely occupied)."
In this context, he adds Helena Lopes, "it seems natural to celebrate resistance against Japan during the war, where they participated - openly or underground - several people in Macao (Chinese and other nationalities)," he said.
THE ROLE OF HISTORICAL EDUCATION
Territory schools have been "encouraged" by the Directorate of Youth Education and Development Services (DSEDJ) to organize sessions for students and teachers to watch the ceremonies of the "80th anniversary of the Chinese people's victory in the war against Japan and world victory against fascism." According to a press conference organized to announce these initiatives, the celebrations of the 80th anniversary of victory against the Japanese start on September 3 in Beijing, and DSEDJ intends to organize various events in Macao.
Asked about the inclusion of historical celebrations, with a patriotic nature, in local schools, Helena Lopes says “she has no elements to comment on the educational situation in Macao currently”, recalling that in the years of World War II, “schools in Macau were themselves spaces of refuge and resistance to Japanese occupation of China”.
In turn, Alfredo Gomes Dias stresses that “historical education is always an extension of the narrative of national history”, “a reality common to all countries” and not exclusive to Macao.
The DSEDJ press conference for the presentation of commemorative events was attended by the secretary for social and culture affairs, Lam, which has the Pelouro da Education. The ruler said last June that the government's goal is to "promote the great spirit of the War of Resistance" and "inspire patriotic fervor." All activities will be subordinate to the theme: "Remember the story, stroking the memory of the martyrs, caressing peace and creating the future."
One of the highlights of the celebrations will be the memory of the victims of the Nanjing massacre, a celebration scheduled for December 13. Nanjing's massacre took place in 1937, having stepped for a few weeks after the conquest by the Japanese troops of the one who was the capital of the Republic of China. After the conquest, the Japanese troops massacred the population, including children, women and not combatants.
The invasion of China through Japan began in 1931 with the occupation of Manchuria at first. In 1937, Japan expanded the scope of war, seeking the total occupation of China. O que começou como um conflito localizado na Ásia acabaria por integrar-se na Segunda Guerra Mundial, a partir de Dezembro de 1941, com os ataques de Pearl Harbour. Over the course of several years, estimates point out that on the Chinese side between 3.8 million and 10.6 million people died. Peace was reached on December 2, after the United States attacked Japan with the second atomic bomb in Nagasaki.
HM sent questions to Lin Guangzhi, author of the idea of building a monument, but until the closing of this edition was not obtained.</description><pubDate>2025-07-22 05:02:35</pubDate></item><item><title>Tariffs: Seven agreements since Trump arrived at the White House</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/29/tarifas-sete-acordos-desde-que-trump-chegou-a-casa-branca/</link><description>The United States have reached seven bilateral trade agreements since Donald Trump returned to the White House in January and the latest, signed on Sunday with the European Union (EU), is the largest in terms of business volume.
In addition to the EU agreement, the US government has agreed new commercial terms with the United Kingdom, China, Vietnam, Japan, Philippines and Indonesia, while negotiations continue with dozens from other countries, US authorities.
Here is the data from the list of the seven bilateral trade agreements that Trump was able to obtain since January, when he returned to the White House for a second presidential term.
+++ United Kingdom +++
Signed on May 8, it was the first bilateral agreement signed by Trump since the US government announced a new tariff plan.
This agreement establishes the reduction of tariffs on British cars from 25% to 10% - up to 100,000 vehicles per year - and the elimination of steel and aluminum tariffs; Reciprocal permissions for export of beef and agricultural products, as well as reduction of non -tariff barriers and simplification of customs procedures.
+++ China +++
On June 26, after reciprocal threats of tariffs up to 115%, the United States and China have reached an agreement of principle that is still being developed.
Although it keeps high rates-55% for exporting certain Chinese products to the United States-facilitates the export of rare land in China, eliminates mutual retaliation measures and softens controls on Chinese products to the US market.
+++ Vietnam +++
The US and Vietnam agreed on July 2 to increase the vietnamese exports to the US to 20% (with a 40% rate on the products suspected of being Chinese origin). Trump's previous threat was to establish tariffs in the 46%.

++ Japan ++
Japan agrees with a 15% rate on all its exports to the United States compared to the 25% rate with which Trump had threatened. The country was committed to investing $ 550 billion (about 470 billion euros) in the US and opening its markets to sectors such as car, rice and agricultural products.
++ Philippines ++
The US now imposing a 19% rate on Philippine products, less a percentage point than the 20% that had threatened, in exchange for the exemption of tariffs on US products that enter the Philippines. The announcement was made on July 22, after the visit of Filipino President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., to the White House.
++ Indonesia ++
On the same date, July 22, and with almost identical content, Trump's agreement with Indonesia establishes 19% rates on exports to the United States and, in parallel, includes aircraft purchase commitments, US agricultural and energy products.
++ European Union ++
On Sunday, July 27, the trade agreement between the United States and the EU was announced, which states that most European exports will be subject to 15% fees - Trump had threatened with 30% - but included tariff exemptions for certain products.

Typhoon Wipha passed yesterday by Macau without leaving havoc of larger, although he has obliged the authorities of the Meteorological and Geophysical Services (SMG) to keep the 10th of storm, the maximum in this type of occurrences, for many hours, between 12:30 and 17h, when it was passed to signal 8. At the time of the closing of this edition, the probability of the tropical signal 3 Between 21h and 23h, synonymous with permission to resume the activities of daily life. Sign 3 was really lifted at 10:30 pm on Sunday.
At 20h was still the blue sign of “Storm Surge”, with expectations of flooding in the low areas of the city between 4am and 8am this Monday.
According to official data, until 7 pm on Sunday the Civil Protection Operations Center recorded 163 occurrences on both the Macao Peninsula and the islands, especially the registration of five typical injuries, which received hospital treatment in both public health facilities and the Kiang Wu Hospital. Only one person will have been retained in the elevator during the passage of the tropical storm.
It is also mentioned the registration of 54 cases in which authorities had to remove broken lamps, falling trees or overthrowing, or construction infrastructure with potential risk. There were also 98 cases of plaster removal, advertising panels, windows or awnings, as well as seven cases where scaffolding or other facilities was required at work-attest, or even overthrown. There was also the registration of a fire.
It is highlighted, from the data of civil protection, the reception of 24 people in the emergency host center of the Institute of Social Action, around 7 pm, and from the opening of these centers 139 people who were not safe were welcomed.
Posts opened at 17h
With regard to transport infrastructures, the SAI VAN PONTE LOWER TABLE was closed at 11am, being open to the circulation of light cars and vehicles from 17h, but by special permission. The upper passage of the same bridge was closed for a long period.
Also from 17h, it was “obtained consensus between the authorities of Macao and Zhuhai” for the reopening of the migration posts of the doors of the siege, Qingmao and the Transfronho Industrial Park Zhuhai-Macau.
Another transport infrastructure ended due to the passage of the Wipha Typhoon, was the HK-Zhuhai-Macau bridge, having been banned at 3:30 am on Sunday.
Macao bridge closed
Another point to be highlighted from the passage of the Wipha Typhoon through the territory, the closing of the new Macau Bridge, the fourth crossing between the Macao peninsula and the mud. It was the first time that this crossing closed doors regarding the passage of a typhoon, but what is certain is that the authorities never clarify whether this bridge would, or not, ended when the occurrence of tropical storms.
In 2023, when the bridge was still being built, Deputy Lei Chan U raised questions to the Executive on this matter. "In the fourth Macau-Taipa bridge, which is currently under construction, will be installed barriers to wind protection in the main line area, to the wind velocity on the bridge board is not higher than the wind velocity on the ground and it is less than the wind speed provided for signal No. 8, enabling uniforming driving with the conditions in the terrestrial areas," he asked.
However, the deputy stressed the existence of “doubts about the possibility of the fourth bridge may be open to vehicle circulation when signal 8 of typhoon is lifted”.
"In response to my written interpellation, the government stated that, before the bridge's entry into operation, the respective regulation should be observed, which will be defined by the Administration. However, according to recent news, the fourth bridge may also be closed to traffic on Typhoon days, for safety reasons, and to be true, in the future, the pressure of traffic between the Macao peninsula and the mud is even more severe," remembered law chan u.
The deputy asked directly whether the bridge would be “open to circulation when signal 8 or higher of typhoon”, and, if negative, “the administration would consider advancing, as soon as possible, with the construction of the fifth connection, in order to satisfy the needs resulting from the constant increase in traffic between Macao and the mud on typhoon days”.
The response of Lam Hin San, director of services for traffic affairs, granted on August 8, 2023, was comprehensive against the deputy's questions: “When the sign of Tropical Storm No. 8 or of higher degree is a sign, the government will adopt, under the law, restrictive precautionary measures, and the residents and tourists remain at home or in safe places”.

CPSP | Intercepted tourists on the bridge
Two tourists were intercepted by agents of the Public Security Police Corps (CPSP) while walking on the noble bridge of Carvalho in full sign 10 of Typhoon. The agents suggested to tourists a trip to a safer place. According to a statement from the Social Communication Office, the CPSP received the complaint at 11:30, having sent the agents to follow the occurrence with the tourists. Tourists were punished with a fine of 50 to 250 patacas for violation of trafficked traffic, a sanction provided for in the road traffic regulation.
Tin Hau | Temple survived the fall of trees
Yesterday afternoon, during the passage of Typhoon Wipha, the trees dropped and the collapse of a platform near the Tin Hau temple, on Fisherman Street, and is also near Macao Water's headquarters. According to a note from the Cultural Institute (IC), the fall of trees did not damage the main structure of the temple, and contacts were made with the temple administrator, confirming that there were no victims. The IC has stated that "it will send, as soon as the safety conditions allow it, employees to inspect and carefully evaluate the state of the Tin Hau temple and will maintain communication with the administrator, with a view to coordinating repair work."
Health | All services return today to normal
Health Services (SS) issued a note yesterday clarifying that all consultation and exam services return to normal today, taking into account the descent of Signal 8 of Storm for signal 3 after Sunday dinner time.
Today, external specialty consultations will be resumed at the Conde de São Januário Hospital Center, namely in radiology and imaging specialties, clinical pathology, hemato-oncology day hospital, differentiated external consultations, endoscopy center and diagnostic room and daytime treatment, among others.

The future advances to the rhythm of diplomatic relations with other Portuguese speaking countries. For academic Cátia Miriam Costa, the African country and China are strategic partners, despite the description of the relationship between both
 
Researcher Cátia Miriam Costa considers that the relationship between Sao Tome and Principe and China remains discreet, despite being almost celebrating a decade, with a growing strategic interest of Beijing in the position of the archipelago in the South Atlantic.
"Since neither country nor another talks much about the subject, we end up not realizing the depth of the relationship well. But I believe it is not yet a very deep relationship," the researcher at the Center for International Studies of ISCTE - University Institute of Lisbon, noted to the Lusa.
The geostrategic position of the archipelago, located in the Gulf of Guinea,, however, feeds Beijing's interest, namely in the context of the Chinese bet on the expansion of logistics and sea corridors in the South Atlantic.
"Sao Tome, if it is not a very important port in logistical terms, is a relevant port for control, for example, of piracy, threats. Therefore, this position also certainly reflected by Beijing," he explained.
The restoration of formal ties in 2016, after two decades of Taiwan's recognition by Sao Tome, was a “pragmatic” decision of the African country, and a trump card for Beijing Diplomacy, which always maintained “open channels”, even during the period of removal, Cátia Miriam Costa explained.
"The relationship with China is more fruitful because it brings other counterparts," explained the researcher. "It was also for these counterparts that [in 1997] Sao Tome exchanged the Popular Republic of China for Taiwan, because at that time the Popular Republic of China was a developing country. So it didn't have to offer what Taiwan had, which was perfectly integrated into the international market," he said.
A VOLTE-FACE
In December 2016, Sao Tome officially announced the establishment of relations with the Popular Republic of China, ending the recognition of Taiwan.
The decision caused the immediate cancellation of the scholarships offered by Taiwan to St.-Tome students, many of whom were eventually integrated into the other Chinese universities. China has quickly become one of the main cooperation partners in São Tomé, with promises of investment and support in areas such as education, technical training, agriculture and infrastructure.
The researcher recalled that even before formal relations, Beijing never completely broke with Sao Tome, keeping the country involved in the activities of the Macao Forum, albeit only as an observer, a strategy he considers "typical of Chinese diplomacy." "China does not fully close the doors. It can suspend relationships, but if it is something of national interest, it is usually renegotiated again," he said.
“Limited Results”
Nevertheless, Cátia Miriam Costa acknowledged that the concrete results of cooperation are still limited. “There are more projects in the role than properly ongoing works,” he said, attributing part of the responsibility to the weak institutional capacity of São Tomé, which only recently began to create structures to attract and negotiate foreign investment.
Among the sectors with potential for the deepening of cooperation, the researcher highlighted the fishing, marine resources and eventually cocoa. Oil exploration raises “high risks”, both for technical complexity and environmental limitations.
"China is interested in the region, but it is not because Sao Tome is an attractive market -because it is not -, yes, for its location, stability and integration capacity in a broader regional project," he said.
The researcher also stressed Chinese investment in Chinese language teaching in Sao Tome, which also aims to "create a network of people with language dominance, familiar with culture and potentially useful for the future of bilateral relations." "China maintains a strategic interest in the relationship, even if it does not express it with great visibility. And for a country like Sao Tome, any small help can have a significant impact," he concluded.
Reports of four Sao Tomers who followed courses in China
Denise, Lucineidy, Reginaldo, and Aithysa grew up under the sign of an alliance with Taiwan, until life and academic path were redefined by the rupture of diplomatic ties between Sao Tome and Taipei in 2016.
Denise Aragão Fortes still remembers her hand to Tsai Ing-Wen. It was November 2016, the day of Africa in Taiwan was celebrated, and the official was attended at the time.
It is very likely that behind the scenes would already outline the end of diplomacy between Taiwan and Sao Tome and Principe, but for this student of International Relations at the University of Ming Chuan, Taoyuan, North Taiwanese, the news, who arrived a month after these celebrations, on December 21, was a surprise.
“There was no rumors, nothing,” recalls Lusa Denise, now 29, working in marketing and living in Almada, Portugal.
When the secondary finished, also the bonds between the island and the African nation, agreed in 1997, had just reached the age of adult. There was “very closeness” between the parts, with Taiwanese friendships in the family.
Normality shaken this December 2016. Studying with a scholarship granted by Taipei, Denise and other St.-Tome students in Taiwan was given the option of continuing studies, without financial assistance, or being transferred to China as scholarships. Being at the end of the academic course, Denise remained in Taoyuan. Most, however, changed geography, university and life.
Country “full of opportunities”
Lucineidy Almeida, now 28, saw the arrival in Tianjin, northern China, as "a new restart" in a "country full of opportunities." Attending the second year of biotechnology in Taichung, this native of Santo António had some difficulty in following the degree in Mandarin. A limitation that would eventually surpass, evaluates today, but in China, had the possibility of studying in English pharmaceutical sciences.
He says he learned of the diplomatic break through social networks and, like all students who spoke to Lusa, left criticism of conducting the process, with “many uncertainties”, information given “on time”, “a feeling of disrespect”, and, in the middle, the suspension of the bags.
Two months after the announcement, he landed in Hong Kong, where he treated his visa, although he still unaware of what his final destination. Only upon arrival in Beijing was he told that he went to Tianjin, recalls Lucineidy, living today in Portugal, in Cacém, and working as an English and Portuguese interpreter in the medical field.
Regarding the diplomatic interruption, it notes that "from what was perceived at the time", it was "a monetary question": "in the sense that China offered more [to Sao Tomé] than Taiwan at the time could provide."
The São Tome Prime Minister of the time, Patrice Trovoada, considered the unilateral break of relations as “the right”, taking into account the authorities' view of the country's development. "We decided the principle of joining one China and when adhering implies the cut of relations with Taiwan. The international scenario 20 years ago, not the same as today," he added.
But the new political order did not take students to advance in the academic career. Aithysa Ramos, 32, is still in Beijing, where, after leaving Taiwan, she concluded the master's degree in business management.
If this morning of 2016, the story had not taken this course, would probably have been in Taiwan, where he had lived seven years ago. At the time, it now remembers the English education teacher, it was “devastated and angry”: “It was like my second home, I passed [part of] my adolescence, growth phases”.
Reginaldo was in the second year of Business Management at the University of Yuan Ze, Taoyuan, when he stayed to the news. He realized that he “had no power” to change the course of history.
The initial shock, assumes today, was really the cold. Despite admitting "it was" always a process of doubts, "China, where he moved two months after the cut of relationships," it was a surprise for the better. " “Because I was still here, not coming back, I can say yes, it was the best thing that happened,” he says.</description><pubDate>2025-07-14 01:35:35</pubDate></item><item><title>Coloane | Government canceled project of the Museum of Paladers 9 years ago</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/11/coloane-governo-cancelou-projecto-do-museu-das-palafitas-ha-9-anos/</link><description>Long before the authorities were part of the 85 square kilometers of maritime areas, there was the idea of lifting a stilts museum to consecrate this type of existing housing in Coloane. However, years later, the direction of tourism services says that the project will not even move forward, having been suspended in 2016
 
Between 2016 and 2017, the government planned to raise a museum about Coloane's stalps to tell the story of these peculiar houses of Macao. However, after news was published in the press to convey the inauguration of the project in 2017, the Directorate of Tourism Services (STD) confirmed to HM that no museum will be born. More: not only will it not be built, but the plan was aborted nine years ago.
“Due to the inclusion of the area where stilts are located in the government's urban planning plan for the coloane riverside, Lai Chi Vun shipyards and Navegantes Street, STD ended the 'Museum of the Museum of the Museum of the House' in 2016, and, subsequently, completed the 'Museum of House Project' procedure. Canceled ”, was referred to in the answer.
The cancellation in 2016 is still surprising, given that on June 14 of the same year the Jornal Tribuna de Macao (JTM) reported that the inauguration of the museum would take place in 2017. In this article, statements were cited by the director of STD, Helena de Senna Fernandes, made to the newspaper or Mun, explaining that the “project was in the [conception] phase of design”. They would have been held, including “several consultations to collect opinions from the residents of that area, expecting to improve the proposal of construction”.
According to JTM, the project should “be completed by the end of the year” in 2016, so that the work will be “started early 2017”, and STD expected “that the construction was completed in the same year”.
After the promise, in 2018 there was still “legal fundamentals” to build the Museum in Coloane, as also reported the JTM. The justification given by the STD was that Macau has not yet had the 85 square kilometers of maritime areas under his jurisdiction, something that has been legislated, precisely, since 2018.
A matter of priorities
HM sought to know the state of the designer of the Museum of Palafites following the recent launch of a book on the stalps of Colaane, by Filipe Afonso, coordinator of the degree in Architecture of the University of São José. Now confronted with the official cancellation of the museum project, the official lamented the decision of the authorities.
"The cancellation of the Museum of Slacinas project is not just news about a project that has not advanced, but a starting point to equate Macao's development priorities, the way the heritage is managed and what means for collective memory, in this case of Coloane," he said. In the opinion of the author of “The Colaane Grammar”, “The Plan for the Marginal of Rua dos Navegantes should include proposals for new buildings that use and reinterpret Madeira as the main and essential element of construction”, and the connection of this street with the Lai Chi Vun shipyards, “especially with regard to the sea front, is a unique opportunity to create a coastal corridor that celebrates Colona's seafront history”.
Thus, and “given the richness of context and cancellation of the stilts museum, the focus should be on integrating the memory of these structures into the new plane”, so the existing structures of the shipyards, stilts should be restored, maintaining their original and material characteristics, but adapting them to new uses ”.
Still on the patrimonial value, Filipe Afonso described, in the interview with HM, the proposal to “classify stilts as heritage to give them legal protection”.
"By cataloging existing stilts, the book contributes to preserving the memory of this type of architecture and a broader discussion about its possible protection," he argued, adding that dwellings, many of them left to abandonment, "could be reused for experience tourism, or cultural interpretation centers, valuing local history."
They could also “be transformed into creative and artistic spaces or in fact propose new wood buildings along the waterline, with various uses and that can generate value to the Coloane community, contributing to Macao's cultural and economic diversification”.
Hopes
Filipe Afonso highlights the process of revitalization and recovery of the Lai Chi Vun shipyard zone as a “initiative with immense historical and cultural value, which refers to the rich tradition of the region's shipbuilding”. In fact, the Lai Chi Vun shipyard zone is one of the “six zones” to recover by the government and operators, which also include places such as the pier in the interior port or Avenida Almeida Ribeiro, among others.
In the area of Lai Chi Vun there is already a leisure zone where cultural initiatives have been carried out, with a museum area that tells the history of the Junos construction industry in the territory.
In this sense, Filipe Afonso asks that “the Macao government does not limit the design of these projects to a restricted range of‘ short-listed companions ””, ie a restricted group of companies.
Also, in his opinion, "Macau has a new generation of talented architects and creative ready to make his contribution." "I believe that through more open ideas contests, these professionals could offer innovative perspectives for the city's urban and cultural challenges. Deleting them from such crucial processes for Macao's urban and cultural development is a waste," he added.
The HM contacted other architects to get reactions to the cancellation of the museum project, but did not get answers.
What the law says
Between the suspension of the project and today a lot has changed. In 2018, Macao arranged from the maritime management bases law, which includes 85 square kilometers of area, and whose principles provides for the environmental preservation of spaces such as those that stilts are inserted.
The legislation introduced concepts such as “functional maritime zoning”, in the sense of delimiting zones “with fundamental and specific maritime functions according to location, natural resources, environmental conditions and exploration and use needs”.
In the list of principles to be complied with, the legislation speaks of something like “protection of the environment of maritime areas”, in order to “protect natural resources and the environment of the sea, realizing the planning of protection and promotion of the marine ecosystem, and the marine protection should be taken into account”.
It should also be “conserving the sustainability of use and development” of these areas, and their use should be done “scientifically”, according to functional maritime zoning ”.
In addition to the concrete legislation that tied the paddle museum in 2016, there was also a direct planning plan to MSAR, something that was implemented in 2022 and also brings new directives for the exploration of maritime zones.
Coloane now has its own UOPG-Operative Planning and Management Unit, where a “rational organization of public infrastructures and collective use equipment” should be applied, as well as “proper use of soils” in order to create a “coordinated space structure”.
Coloane's UOPG is part of the “ecological conservation zone”, which aims to “protect areas with ecological value” and “contribute to the greater protection of natural resources with ecological value”. Here it will not be allowed “to allocate soils for housing, commercial, industrial, tourist and amusement uses”, reads in the director of the masket.
Coloane's UOPG is also integrated into the “green or open public spaces”, and here should be “maintaining the current use for green spaces and outdoor activities, integrating it [Coloane's UOPG] into the green zone or open public spaces”.
Specifically, Coloane's UOPG should “promote the development of ecotourism and cultural tourism, with the creation of a tours of nature and the 'green and resilient waist', based on the combination of natural resources, namely hills, sea and coastal lines”. It should also “conserve and optimize existing industrial zones, build the 'waist of knowledge - industry - science' and the 'waist of cooperation of a river, two margins' and, simultaneously, rationally plan the housing zones in adequate location, according to the principle of balance between professional and residential functions”, and these points interconnect with the paradise zone, Navigantes Street and Savings Lai chi vun.
The Director Plan also explains that "the predominant use of soils at UOPG Coloane is an ecological conservation zone."</description><pubDate>2025-07-11 00:11:09</pubDate></item><item><title>TDM | Inês Chan is the best paid administrator</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/31/tdm-ines-chan-e-a-administradora-mais-bem-paga/</link><description>Transferred directly from the Social Communication Office to the position of Administrator at TDM-Macao-Telelding, Inês Chan will have the highest salary among managers, just behind the company's vice president, Lo Song Man.

Chinese citizens' migration management director Xiong Shuren praised the measure and considered that it benefits the exchange between the interior, Hong Kong and Macau. The official recalled that 59 cities in the interior of China emit individual visas to travel to Hong Kong and Macau. "As for the travel visas of Hengqin and Macau, more than 56,000 residents enjoyed this convenience," he said.

Alternative solutions
Xiong Shuren recalled that during the pandemic, several RAE residents could not request the renewal. As such, he indicated that the authorities “promptly launched a policy to extend the shelf life. Extending the shelf life of the safe conduct covered 4.4 million residents of Hong Kong and Macau.
Xiong Shuren also revealed that since July 2024 the Salvo-Conduct emission policy has been launched for RAE residents with foreign nationality to realize what they said were “great advances” in the management of roads and exits from the interior, according to the “one country, two system” principle of the New Age.

The chosen ones have to speak "perfectly" Chinese and at least a foreign language. In addition, they must be registered with arbitration institutions of two of the three jurisdictions of the Great Bay
 
Residents of Macao wishing to be referees in legal disputes in the Great Bay have, as a general rule, of mastering Mandarin or Cantonese. The requirements for the performance of these functions were revealed yesterday through the publication of the “Work Guidelines on the List of Referees of the Great Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Bay”.
As a first requirement, referees are required to defend the country's constitution and the basic laws of Macau and Hong Kong, and it is also expected to “have good deontological behavior, without registration of sanctions for bad reputation or for violation of professional deontology”.
Future referees have also been on the list of referees from arbitration institutions of two of the three regions of the Great Bay, that is, they have to be recognized as referees in Macao and inland, Macau and Hong Kong, or inland and Hong Kong.
The requirements also include the need to have more than five years of professional experience in the performance of referee and to have “cumulatively performed referee functions in at least five cases of arbitration and elaborated arbitral decisions”.

Finally, the document with the guidelines indicates that the referees have to dominate "perfectly Mandarin (or Cantonese) and at least a different language from the Chinese."
Despite the general requirements, the guidelines admit that the authorities can exempt the referees to comply with some conditions, including the need to dominate the Chinese, "agreement with the situation." However, the guidelines do not reveal in what situations the exemption is guaranteed. Respect for the constitution and basic laws, as well as the need to have a clean deontological record can never be exempt.

The institution is linked to the Federation of Macao Workers' Associations, whose four deputies voted in favor of the law that forces the closure of the satellite casinos
 
The Game Industry Workers House is concerned with the lack of concessionaires to absorb workers from the satellite casinos. Concerns about the closing wave of 11 casinos was expressed by Pak Kin Kong, director of the institution, in statements to the Macao channel.
"At this time, we face the fact that we have more than 4,000 casinos-satellite workers that will be affected [by closing]. However, we think the concessionaire involved is not enough to get the same kind of work for these workers," said the official.
Pak Kin Kong recalled the scenario during the pandemic, in which some workers also saw their jobs extinct, having been transferred to other functions. However, the director of the Game Industry Workers House admits that the transition is not always free of problems. "Some satellite casinos workers were not transferred to the same position, or to game-related positions. Some were Croupie and were transferred to positions as rooms or security guards," he recalled.
The leader also explained that this change of positions is viewed as a concern for workers. "We are concerned because game operators may not find the same type of position for these satellite casinos workers," he said. "This causes concern among workers, because they are afraid that they cannot adapt to the new position. In recent years we have received some requests for support," he said.
Thousands of posts
Pak King Kong's statements were collected hours after being made public that the GrandView Casino-Satellite will close the doors today at 11:59 pm.
The Game Industry Workers House is linked to the Macao Workers' Federation (Faom), whose deputies, Chan U, Lam Lon Wai, Ella Law and Leong Sun Iok, voted in favor of the law that requires the closure of these casinos.
Satellite casinos result from agreements between some independent dealers and companies, which exploit various game spaces. According to the latest changes proposed by the government, and approved by the Legislative Assembly, satellite casinos have to be closed by the end of the year. The alternative is now explored by the dealers, a situation that will only be verified with the L'ARC and Ponte 16 casinos, therefore 11 closures.
The GrandView Casino is explored under an agreement with the SJM concessionaire, which will absorb 159 casino-satellite workers with whom it has a labor bond. However, there are seven workers whose future is uncertain. Also the future of non-resident workers is unknown.
Previously, the government acknowledged that the satellite casinos employ 5,600 workers, of which 4,800 were hired directly by the concessionaires and about 800 by the casinos. The latter may be unemployed.</description><pubDate>2025-07-30 00:41:24</pubDate></item><item><title>Public Housing | Defended assignment to qualified pictures</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/30/habitacao-publica-defendida-atribuicao-a-quadros-qualificados/</link><description>Choi Hong Law, the executive director of the Sun City real estate group, argued that the left-wing public housing apartments should be attributed to qualified pictures.
According to the citizen newspaper, the official recalled that the demand for public housing is no longer as high as in the past, taking as reference the most recent social housing competitions or economic housing in zone A of new urban landfills.
Law Choi Hong highlighted the ongoing project of the new Macau neighborhood in Hengqin that seeks to attract residents among residents of Macau, so there are a lot of housing supply in the market at this time.
At the same newspaper, NG Ka Teng, a member of the Council for Public Housing Affairs, argued that the demand for public houses has changed and that the government should update policies in this area. The official recalled that the latest numbers of economic housing orders fell significantly, and in the 2019 candidacy, 487 households eventually gave up in the house choice phase. This means more than ten percent of candidate families.
Ng Ka Teng, therefore, calls for the relaunch of some housing measures, namely the plan of the first acquisition of real estate for young people aged 21 to 44 years. Another policy that can be launched again, in the view of the person responsible, is the credit interest bonus regime granted for its own housing acquisition.</description><pubDate>2025-07-30 00:32:23</pubDate></item><item><title>China's Bank | President of the Macao branch detained on arrival in Beijing</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/30/banco-da-china-presidente-da-filial-de-macau-detido-a-chegada-a-pequim/</link><description>The Caixin Global newspaper reported the disappearance of the president of the Banco da China Macao branch, indicating that he was taken by the national authorities when he arrived in Beijing from Macao. Jia Tianbing is the second leader of Macao banks disappearing in less than a month
 
The president of the Bank of China's Macao branch, Jia Tianbing, was taken by authorities in the interior of China, reported yesterday the newspaper Caixin Global, one of China's leading financial information publications. This is the second leader of representations of Chinese state banks in Macao disappearing inside China in less than a month.
According to the global cash, Jia Tianbing was intercepted while returning to Beijing, coming from Macau, and was accompanied by several family and friends. The banker's companions will also have been taken by the authorities.
The detention came after Jia Tianbing was following, on the 11th of this month, the delegation of the members of Macao of the National Committee of the Chinese Political Advisory Conference (CCPPC) on a visit to the in -depth cooperation zone between Guangdong and Macau in Hengqin. The delegation was led by CCPPC vice president, and former chief of the Macau Executive, Edmund Ho.
However, the signs that something extraordinary was happening were visible at a recent meeting of the China Bank that served to issue new instructions for the branches. In this meeting the absence of Jia Tianbing was noted.
At least since Sunday that the Global Caxin tried to contact Jia Tianbing, but the number of mobile phone has always been turned off. No response was received until yesterday.
Repeated scenario
Earlier this month, the same newspaper revealed that Jiang Yusheng, former president of the China Industrial and Commercial Bank (ICBC), had been taken by interior authorities.
After information about the disappearance of the banker who began to circulate was made public that Jiang was being investigated by the Central Commission for Disciplinary Inspection on suspicion of severe violation of the discipline and the law. This is a term often used within China to designate corruption cases.
According to Caixin Global, the investigation aimed at Jiang Yisheng deals with real estate loans approved by the Macao ICBC, mainly in the scope of the Windsor Arch luxury project, built ahead of the Jockey Club and in which several local entrepreneurs participated.
This project was developed by NG Lag Seng, then president of the Sun Kian IP group, which was also part of the investigation within the judicial case that resulted in the judgment of former public works directors, Jaime Carion and Li Canfeng. Also Ng Kei Nin, son of NG Lap Seng, one of the company's directors, was implied in the case. Both were convicted in Macao to comply with prison sentences.
The publication indicated that the investigation emerged at a time when the ICBC Macau was increasing the rally credit, that is, from the loans approved to debtors who later had no capacity to pay debts.</description><pubDate>2025-07-30 00:30:13</pubDate></item><item><title>Employment Agencies: Consented illegality?</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/31/agencias-de-emprego-ilegalidade-consentida/</link><description>By Luís Almeida Pinto
No one controls greed, nor does it supervise the illegal collection of fees by employment agencies in Macao?
According to the stipulated in Article 28 (3)) and No. 4 of Law No. 16/2020, of 14 September, the total amount of fees to be charged for employment agencies to workers cannot exceed 50% of the base compensation of the first month, established in the employment contract, and employment agencies can only charge workers for the provision of services for one time, and 60 days after the date of the employment date, except the case. Special working relationship duration is less than 60 days, and may then charge workers, only once, on the day of termination of the employment relationship.
Now, this is not what is going on today in the generality of employment agency situations in Macau.
The difficulties felt by foreign workers looking for Macao to have a job and a better salary, since the amounts charged here by employment agencies to workers reach MOP $ 20,000, or even more, for jobs whose monthly salaries do not exceed ten thousand patacas, and often the fees required in advance, and not charged when the worker receives the expiration.
And all of this has been impuning with many years, without any control on the part of Macao authorities, nor can you realize the existence of oversight of employment agencies, all for the benefit of the greed of the owners of employment agencies, and in serious loss of foreign workers who seek a job in Macao, for having great economic needs, and trying to find better conditions of living, for themselves and for their family.
See, as a good example, what happens in the neighboring Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong:
In accordance with the relevant provisions of the Employment Ordinance (chap. 57) and the Regulation of Employment Agencies (Chapter 57a), the maximum amount that an agency can legally charge a domestic worker, which constitutes a large part of the foreign workforce in Hong Kong, is 10% of the first month of salary.
Any agency that covers more than this amount prescribed is breaking the law, and in Hong Kong, employment agencies are actually inspected and fined, with sanctions that include the suspension and revocation of business licenses.
It is time to be required to the authorities to end the illegal practices of employment agencies in Macau!</description><pubDate>2025-07-31 02:57:52</pubDate></item><item><title>Sexual health is complex - and still well</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/30/a-saude-sexual-e-complexa-e-ainda-bem/</link><description>At a time when more and more mental health is spoken, public discussion about sexual health remains shy - often limited to topics such as sexually transmitted infections (IST) or unwanted pregnancy. The article recently published in the International Journal of Sexual Health, by Manão, Brazão and Pascoal, entitled “How to Halth Sexual? The qualitative analysis of people's perceptions”, gives us some of the complexity of the concept from the perspective of people.
The study, which analyzes the answers of 151 participants in Portugal to the open question “What does sexual health mean?”, Offers a multifaceted portrait.
The first relevant conclusion is that for these people, sexual health is not limited to the absence of illness. For many respondents, it is a reality that encompasses the body, but also emotions, relationships, personal autonomy and the social and political context. This view meets the broader definition proposed by the World Health Organization, a proposal that takes into account the many factors that influence health and well-being in different ways.
Emerging themes - about the physicality of sex, autonomy, relational and intimate issues, and sexual justice - reveal a progressive evolution in the face of the traditional vision (biomedical and genital) in the sense of a more inclusive and contextual concept. It is revealing, for example, that many participants associate sexual health with the ability to feel pleasure, to communicate desires with their partner or to feel respected in their choices.
At a time when issues of sexuality from the discipline of citizenship in Portuguese schools are withdrawn in response to unfounded “ideological” fears, studies such as this show the importance of continuing to openly discuss sexuality - and, in particular, sexual health. This must be understood as a complex multifactorial system that requires spaces of equality, respect and freedom to be who is, without fear of discrimination.
It is essential that sexual health is fully integrated into health models, so that its epistemic strength gains new vigor. The absence of prejudice, the existence of inclusive public policies and the equitable access to sexual health services were identified by some participants as structuring elements, so that each person can effectively take care of their sexual health. Sexuality, after all, is not only a private subject, but also a political field.
Another relevant aspect concerns individual liability, reflected in the theme of autonomy. Many participants recognize that it is up to each person to take care of their sexuality, seek information, communicate with their partner and, when necessary, resort to specialized services.
This autonomy is undoubtedly essential. However, the exclusive emphasis on personal responsibility can easily slip into a logic of healthism - an ideology that transfers the weight of health entirely to the individual, ignoring social, economic and cultural determinants. It is precisely here that the critical perspective of the article - and this field of study - becomes fundamental: it is not enough to promote sexual health as an individual choice; It is necessary to create structural conditions so that this choice is really possible.
Sexual health is more than an office or classroom theme; It is part of the mechanisms of meaning that support social life. It is a direct reflection of the society we build. The type of sexual health we promote reveals a lot about our collective values - how we value the body, freedom, respect and justice.
It should be borne in mind that, despite the conceptual sophistication evidenced in this study, it is a sample of 151 people, mostly with higher education, collected through a snowball sampling technique - that is, the participants were referred to each other. We cannot ignore that these data represent a situated view, not necessarily widespread to the general population. Which means that there are more forms of understanding that may not be accepted, many of them that may still be problematic or undesirable.
Any attempt to deconstruct health biomedical models in favor of a broader social-political approach is, in fact, of utmost importance. Sexual health is not only defined by the absence of viruses or bacteria, but by a more complete understanding of well-being, in which socio-political factors need to be analyzed, understood and, in some situations, transformed. If for a while this was a relevant job, now it is urgent work.</description><pubDate>2025-07-30 01:07:27</pubDate></item><item><title>Financial management</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/29/gestao-financeira/</link><description>An online communication agency of Macau reported that a cybernaut was circulating (whom we will call John) where he said he had a monthly income of 30,000 patacas, but that he was with financial embarrassment because he was single, had bought a house and paid the installments to the bank, had monthly expenses, had no savings and asked how to do to improve his situation.
Many cybernauts answered this publication, asking the reason for the high expenses, if they were due to careless spending, if they had bad habits, etc. Many of them highlighted that a way to manage money is to “increase income”. John could look for part-time work or change jobs to make more money. Others suggested that if he lives alone and has a free room could rent him. If I rent the room, John may also consider cooking socks with the tenant to reduce food expenses.
Another important principle of financial management is the creation of “savings”, which implies “reducing expenses to the very least”. Therefore, the cybernauts asked John how much he paid to the bank for the provision of the house and if there would be the possibility of renegotiating it. Others suggested that they shop in mainland China to reduce expenses.
Keeping expenses but increasing revenues, John may have a financial surplus, which can apply to daily spending and savings. On the other hand, with the same income and reduced expenses, it can obtain the same result and achieve your desire to save money.
Which of the two options is better? If you reduce expenses but keep the same income, you will only be able to save a little. If you increase income, you will have several sources of revenue and future financial growth will be higher, and you can still create savings to ensure “times of need”. How much do you need to spare to collect “times of need”? Two million? Three million? We will discuss this issue next week.
To achieve prudent financial management, beyond the above advice, John has to consider two questions. First, what is the objective of financial management? Second, what is the financial management model?
The purpose of the financial management of most people is to make them richer. If you are richer means you have more money to spend in the future, then you will have to have expenditure on expenses. To achieve this goal, John must set different temporal goals. For example, increase the performance between 5% and 25% within a year, changing jobs or getting more part-time work, then having your own business within five years, etc.
After getting his goal, John can give himself a gift, such as a two -month trip to Europe, buy a good car, etc. Of course, both traveling and shopping are ways of getting satisfaction through consumption. John can only be truly happy when he reaches his goals. If it only spends money impensely, it will have a brief happiness and will be on its way to the financial disaster and may pay a very high price, so it must be very careful.
Another purpose of financial management is to increase savings to have more resources in the future, increasing their quality of life. For example, having more money to pay the house at full earlier and get a state of “financial semi-freedom”; This method is better than spending in a thoughtless way.
After setting these objectives, the next step is to consider the model to use to measure your financial performance. The average monthly yield in Macao is about 20,000 patacas. John currently earns 30,000, exceeding the average salary. John owns a house. With a monthly yield of 30,000 patacas, your financial level is very good.
After establishing the model and the financial objectives, there are two points to note.  First, the publication did not mention whether or not John was in love. If you want to get married, your home will be subject to the Macao Family Law and the property can be changed. John must think carefully in the way of dealing with this issue. Secondly, the value of the house is high, but if liquidity is low, the performance may vary depending on market fluctuations. The real estate market is currently slow. If most capital is invested in the house and suddenly it is necessary to have available a high amount, there will be a financial problem and John has to be more careful.
Increasing income and reducing expenses, living within our possibilities, and increasing savings are the basic principles of personal financial management; But we must also have objectives and clarify our financial growth. We can only guarantee that our financial situation is consistent with our socio-economic framework, and that we are not demanding more or less of ourselves when we adopt the correct financial standards.
We must also make the appropriate adjustments to our financial goals based on our own circumstances, ensure that we have enough money to cover daily expenses and have plans to precipate future changes, so that we can enjoy the happiness that money gives us.

Much worse, when the government itself owes millions of euros to firefighters. Firefighters are stick for the whole work: they delete fireworks, help road accidents where they often have to disembodate victims, help people inside elevators, help in flooding, carry the most varied sick, help pregnant women who have the delivery inside the ambulances. They call them the soldiers of peace.
But in the ambulances is the Busis. The government has a millionaire debt to fire brigade corporations of about 20 million euros and only in unique social rate - mandatory for social security - corporations must pay 35 million a year. Most of the ambulances used in the help are from INEM and it is this institute that will have to pay the default.
Firefighters have warned in advance that if the money is not paid that they will no longer use the ambulances of INEM and only use the ambulances of their associations, although an outpatient way out of INEM costs 21 euros to the state while the same service with firefighters ambulance costs 45 euros - more than double. However, the Portuguese Firefighters League has guaranteed that the population will not be left unanswered in emergency because the crews are the same. One of the problems that make the transport of patients more expensive is the chaotic situation that occurs in the country regarding the end of several hospital emergencies all over the country.
Firefighters often have to walk from city to city due to the end of emergencies and the fact that the mileage increase obviously makes transportation more expensive. In fact, because of the emergency crisis, firefighters have worked more in prehospital aid, but the government has not paid what it should. To this, it is defined to be a default. If the government does not pay the 20 million euros concerned, INEM's ambulances may stand still.
The various crises recorded at the Ministry of Health versus INEM have been a chaos, with several personalities to dismiss the minister and INEM workers to claim the dismissal of the president of the institute. With the strike at INEM citizens died for lack of help. Several citizens and babies have died for long help. The helicopters who should already be in the service of INEM or see them. However, the ridicule happened. Inim paid last week 3.5 million euros debt from the prehospital emergency service, the Firefighters League confirmed. This amount is ridiculous. INEM What it says is that, for your part, the whole bureaucratic process is ready, the only thing it needs is that the Ministry of Health transfer to INEM the values so that they can pay. The “only thing”…
Fire League responsible, António Nunes, stressed that this is a “very complicated period of the year” for firefighters, who have to pay for vacation subsidies, in addition to the unique social fee, a monthly charge that has to be paid to social security. All of this seems like a joke with something very serious. Sometimes there is no idea that the 464 fire department associations pay 35 million euros per year and that if the associations do not make the payment on the 20th of each month, they will fail and fail to take certificates of non -debt, which prevents the state's amounts. The seriousness of the situation is very serious if we meet that the fire brigade bodies transport 1.2 million users per year, by mobilization of INEM.
The Portuguese firefighters are in a dead end, simply by the inoperation of the Ministry of Health and its INEM. We are facing an incompetent management of public money that is necessarily intended for those who do everything by saving our lives. By day and night firefighters always respond and risk their lives in the most dangerous and drastic situations. Where is the consideration of the Minister of Health by the Soldiers of Peace? When 20 million euros are left to pay those who are fundamental in the daily life of the country, there is no classification for this way of rule.
The Portuguese firefighters did not deserve to be treated as beggars, a deplorable and shocking fact that we found to happen within those who have the power to manage our money directed to those who should never have any government late payment.

Macao ”
 
The MSAR hosts an exhibition that tells the life story of Sun Yat-Sen, the most revolutionary full-body than a doctor, who went through Guangdong, Macao and Hong Kong and who was one of the main responsible for the 1911 Republican Revolution that led to the fall of the imperial regime. Sun Yat-Sen eventually became known as “the father of China” to have contributed to the construction of a new nation.
According to a statement from the Cultural Institute (IC), the show “From Patient Healing to Salvation of a Nation-Dr. Sun Yat-Sen in Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau” will be inaugurated on August 8 at the Macao Museum and aims to commemorate the centenary of the death of Sun Yat-sen. This is a jointly organized initiative by the IC, the Hong Kong government's cultural and leisure department and the Zhongshan Department of Culture, Radio and Tourism, without forgetting the Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Museum in Hong Kong, which hosted the show in June.
The exhibition, which can be visited until October 12, pays “a profound tribute to the lasting contributions of Dr. Sun Yat-sen to the revitalization of the nation and the happiness of the people”, describes the IC, which is a traveling exhibition that is born “from a project of cooperation between the cultural entities of Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau”.
The show includes a hundred pieces or collections of historical images, documents and “valuable historical relics” of the Sun Yat-Sen passage through Guangdong, Macao and Hong Kong.
The story by phases
The whole exhibition space is divided into four parts, entitled “The Cradle of Thought on the Salvation of the Nation”, “The Cradle of Revolution”, “The Natal Regions of the Family”, “Memorials for the Great Spirit”. In all these spaces the public can “remember Dr. Sun's course and revolutionary career in Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau,” says the IC, presenting “the profound calls of Dr. Sun with Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau, expressing the deep respect of these three regions” by this revolutionary.
In addition to the exhibition, a film related to political personality will be projected, and is also released an online exhibition, using virtual reality, after the inauguration, in order to facilitate the viewing of the contents by the public.
According to information provided by the Digital Library of the Jorge Álvares Foundation, Sun Yat-Sen was born within a natural modest family in the village of Cuiheng, province of Guangdong.
Sun's father had been in Macao working as a shoemaker, and then returned to China where he formed a family. Sun Yat-Sen was born on November 11, 1866 and set out to Hawaii, 13-year-old Hawaii to meet his older brother.
Studied medicine in Honolulu and Hong Kong. It was during this time that it aroused its revolutionary vein. He left for Macao at the conclusion of the degree in 1892, having exercised Western medicine at the Kiang Wu Hospital and, later, in a clinic founded by herself on Rua das Estlagês.
"In 1894, already deeply involved in politics, he founded society for China's regeneration that aimed to overthrow the imperial regime and install a democratic government. The following year, he even participated in an attempted coup in Guangzhou, but the coup failed, and was forced to flee, exiling in Japan. During the years of exile, he traveled to the United States, Canada and Europe." Digital Library.
Still in Japan, he founded the United Alliance Society that came from the Kuomitang Party. Despite his ideological role in the revolutionary struggle, Sun Yat-Sen was abroad when the imperial system fell in China on 10 October 1911, and was for a short period president of the New Republic of China.</description><pubDate>2025-07-31 00:32:36</pubDate></item><item><title>Art Macao | Artists project The Haas Brothers to see in Cod</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/30/art-macao-projecto-dos-artistas-the-haas-brothers-para-ver-no-cod/</link><description>There is another exhibition integrated in the poster of “Art Macao: Macau International Art Biennial 2025”. This time the public will have the opportunity to see the project “The Haas Brothers: Clair de Lun”, evident at City of Dreams
 
Following the presentation at The A4 Art Museum in Chengdu last year, he is “Clair de Lune”, the work of artists The Haas Brothers arrives in Macau, integrated on the “Art Macao: International Art Biennial of Macau 2025”, in the special exhibition section.
Available for visits at City of Dreams (COD), Cotai, until September 12, “Clair de Lune” presents a series of pieces and facilities of the two brothers born in Austin, Texas, in a “trip where memory and emotion converge in an immersive art world”, describes the Cod in a note.
In “Clair de Lune”, light becomes a “metaphor, building an emotionally rich narrative that is accompanied by an anthropomorphic character”, which is a COD bet on “exploration of art and commitment to multidisciplinary culture”.
Also according to the same note, this exhibition “reflects the consistent creative philosophy of artists”, who seek to “break barriers between disciplines, activate the senses and evoke an emotional resonance”, and the name of the show refers to the composition of French Claude Debussy, “Clair de Lune”.
The Haas Brothers also sought inspiration from the childhood memories of the so -called "Moon Towers" [Moon Towers], structures used to illuminate Austin at night. For the two brothers, these towers "have become a last symbol of their childhood memories, surpassing the line between the true moon and the artificial moon."
Here, the moon becomes a metaphor "for emotional migration, in which the flow of light represents the two paths of a journey between 'coming and leaving'. Thus, the public is invited to enjoy and interpret these games of light and shadows, building a journey of "perception, reflection and emotional exploitation."
Six pieces with meaning
"Clair de Lune" in Cod, includes six facilities that "build a poetic and imaginative world" in connection with the moon, presenting five sculptures with lamps inspired by the moon towers, with names such as "The Street Named Desire", "Let There Be Street Light", "A Light in the Streets and Freak In The Sheets ”,“ Lamp of Approval ”and“ Light to Remain Silent ”.
The works, with “evocative titles and expressive forms”, constitute “a reflection of themes such as desire, recognition or silence”. The sixth piece presented, "Reach-Able Moment" presents a character similar to a monkey that "symbolizes the search, not only for love, patience and devotion, but also for deeper meaning," such as "peaceful and philosophical reflection of the meaning of existence."
The Haas Brothers are Simon and Nikolai Haas, currently living in Los Angeles. In recent years “developed a multidisciplinary and distinct artistic language, working with fashion, cinema, music and creative design”. Its artistic practice “continues to expand the possibilities of artistic expression by challenging conventional environments”, presenting “an anthropomorphic approach” in “experimentation of shapes and materials”. In this process, both "question and respond to the social functions of art and contexts of the culture where they inhabit."
More concretely about "Clair de Lune" and the power of moonlight, the two artists mentioned, cited by the same note, that it is something "fleeting, but powerful", that "changes everything in which it touches, which transforms the common into something fantastic." "This transformation is what we are later. If we can take the observer to a quiet, humorous and reflection world, then we did our work as artists," they said.</description><pubDate>2025-07-30 00:50:17</pubDate></item><item><title>Portugal of the little ones addresses Lusophone countries attenuating the idea of the empire</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/29/portugal-dos-pequenitos-aborda-paises-lusofonos-atenuando-ideia-do-imperio/</link><description>The Portugal of the Little Coimbra, which exalted the colonial empire when it was created in 1940, currently offers a playful passport to visitors who want to travel among the new Portuguese -speaking countries represented in the park.
Associated with the saga of discoveries, the fifteenth century by the Portuguese, the Armillary Sphere and the Cross of Christ remain 85 years later among the adornments of the tourist space installed on the left bank of the Mondego River by Bissaya Barreto (1886-1974), a Mason who was carbonary in Youth and later Salazar's friend.
"We believe it is possible to learn to play," the theme Park director Nuno Gonçalves told Lusa, citing the founder.

“We find here a perfect solution between the possibility of fun and learning, where the Portuguese language is a living way so that new generations can learn to play,” he said.
Both the Armillary Sphere, an ancient navigation instrument that the 1910 Republicans included in the new national flag, such as the cross -linked cross of Vasco da Gama and other navigators, were adopted by the Estado Novo to propagate a “Portugal from Minho to Timor”, imperial, pluricontinental, allegedly and indivisible.
The Cross of Christ, yet, continues to appear on the flag of the Autonomous Region of Madeira, as well as identifying the fleets of the Portuguese Air Force and the Portuguese Navy.
More pedagogy
In recent decades, following the consolidation of the democratic regime born with April 25, 1974, as well as the rise to the independence of the former colonies, the primitive ideological matrix of Portugal of the little ones has giving way to a more multicultural view that privileges the playful and pedagogical components.
“Deep expression of our language, as it is common” to most Member States of the community of Portuguese-speaking countries (CPLP), except Equatorial Guinea, the park is also assumed by the owner, the Bissaya Barreto Foundation, as “expression of intercultural” and tolerance between peoples linked by historical ties, said Nuno Gonçalves, while explaining the functioning of the playful passport that can be carried. Each country, region or territory.
The trip includes, in particular, Brazil, Angola, Guinea-Bissau, Cape Verde, Sao Tome and Principe, Mozambique, Timor-Leste and Azores, Madeira, India and Macau, whose Portuguese administration passed to China in 1999. “This visit includes the trip, the experience, the dynamics and the narrative,” emphasized Nuno Gonçalves.

Conceived by architect Cassiano Branco, the park was born at the initiative of Bissaya Barreto, professor at the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Coimbra, in which he studied at the targets of the twentieth century, making friends with António Salazar, then still a young student from the Faculty of Law.
He opened to the public in 1940, a scarce months after the Portuguese exhibition was inaugurated in Lisbon, which pointed out two centuries -old centuries: eight centuries from the foundation of nationality, by Afonso Henriques, and 300 years of the restoration of Portugal's independence by the 1640 conjured, ending 60 years of Philipian dynasty and Spanish rule.
Fifty years after the political emancipation of the old Africa colonies in 1975, when Goa, Damão and Diu, the so -called Portuguese India, had already been attached by the then Indian Union, in 1961, Portugal dos small, among other valences, magnifies with “Galleries inspired by Portuguese -expression countries”, proposing “a visitation experience that is also learning”.
"It is possible to visit Portugal and other countries in a short time and for a very small value, because we do not have to catch the plane," said the director.</description><pubDate>2025-07-29 02:05:31</pubDate></item><item><title>Banking | Less 429 automatic boxes within five years</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/31/banca-menos-429-caixas-automaticas-no-espaco-de-cinco-anos/</link><description>For every five starting boxes in operation in 2020, only four remain today. However, the number of terminals for making electronic payments has grown from about 70,000 to almost 110,000
 
From the end of 2020, to the end, banks have made available 429 automatic (or ATM boxes) to the population. The most recent number, referring to the end of June this year, was advanced to HM by the Macao Monetary Authority (AMCM), and contrasts with the greatest use of other forms of electronic payments.
According to data advanced by AMCM, in late June there were a total of 1,358 automatic boxes in operation. This number shows that compared to the end of 2024 there was even an increase in the number of boxes to work, with 29 more units. However, compared to the end of 2020, the year when there were more automatic boxes to work, the fall has happened practically constantly.
At the end of 2020 were in operation 1,787 automatic boxes, the largest number recorded at least since 2016. Compared to June 2025, there was a reduction of 429 automatic boxes, the equivalent of 24 percent decrease. This reduction means that for every five boxes operating at the end of 2020 one is no longer available.
The reduction has been progressively, but has accelerated in recent years, except for the first six months of this year. Between 2020 and 2021 only nine boxes are no longer available. However, between 2021 and 2022, the decrease was 221 units, or 12.4 percent.
Between 2022 and 2023 the breaking of the number of automatic boxes was slower, with a reduction 56 units to 1.501, when it was once 1,557. Between 2023 and last year the reduction was accelerating to the rate of 11.5 percent, with 172 machines in operation, which meant that 2024 ended with 1,358 machines to operate.
Other alternatives
The closing of banks' automatic boxes contrasts with the reality of payments through mobile phone applications that have continually expanded in the last five years.
In late 2020, according to the statistics published in January 2021 by AMCM, there were about 70,000 machines that accepted mobile payments. However, in the first quarter of 2020, the number of machines was about 43,000, which means that within 12 months the number almost doubled it. Throughout this year the value of transactions with mobile payments was approximately 6.31 billion patacas.
However, the first trimester numbers of 2025 show a higher implementation of this type of payments, a trend to which the Ho IAT SENG government also used the electronic payment means to assign consumption support during the pandemic.
According to the latest data at the end of March 2025, AMCM accounted for 108,749 terminals for mobile payments. And only in the first quarter the value of transactions reached 7.9 billion patacas. AMCM data also show that throughout 2024 there was a total of 30.3 billion transacted patacas through electronic payments.

A representative of travel agencies stated that 10 macao excursionists were in Hokkaido, where some zones had evacuation notice. Residents are safe and there were no requests for help
 
The occurrence of an earthquake yesterday in the Kamchatka zone in Russia caused a wave of tsunami alerts and evacuation measures in various regions with the Pacific Ocean, and Japan is no exception.
According to information provided by Paul Wong, president of the Macao Tourist Industry Association, ten residents of Macao who are making a tour in the Japanese region of Hokkaido are safe. In the statements made to the Chinese channel of Radio Macau, Paul Wong added that this group of ten people should return to Macau soon.
In addition, the official confirmed that the travel agencies of the territory have made contacts to realize how many residents of Macau are traveling in Japan individual, and none of them made requests for help or support. Paul Wong also said that in August there will be dozens of macao tour in Hokkaido and that, for now, there were no cancellations of the trips.
About two million people in Japan yesterday received orders to abandon their homes or coastal areas due to the risk of tsunami. The earthquake, which occurred on the Kamchatka Russian Peninsula, was magnitude of 8.8, and in Hokkaido, the largest island in the Japanese archipelago and the closest to Kamchatka, the local authorities issued a maximum level withdrawal order (5 in 5) to 10,463 citizens of the Urakawa Courage City.
In addition, more than 1.9 million people in 21 municipalities along the Japan Pacific coast have received level 4 withdrawal warnings, which appeal to the “removal of dangerous areas” - such as those near the sea and the mouth of the rivers - “as soon as possible before the situation gets worse”.
SMG issued order
However, weather and geophysical services yesterday issued a note to say that Macau will not impact this earthquake. It was only a forecast that “a small wave of tsunami” could reach the coast of Macao between 18h and 19h, “could cause a fluctuation of the water level of 0.1 meters or less”, without “significant risk” to the territory.
Japanese authorities' evacuation orders are based on the warnings issued by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), which have been in force from early yesterday morning to virtually the entire Pacific coast of the archipelago, and which estimate the occurrence of tsunamis up to three meters high.
Until yesterday afternoon (Macao Hour) had been recorded tsunamis up to 1.3 meters high in the locality of Kuji, Iwate City Hall, and 80 centimeters on the Nemuro Peninsula in Hokkaido, both in the north. A 30 centimeter tsunami was also observed in the port of Yokohama, south of Tokyo.</description><pubDate>2025-07-31 00:25:34</pubDate></item><item><title>Traffic | Lo Choi in suffers road accident in the interior</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/31/transito-lo-choi-in-sofre-acidente-de-viacao-no-interior/</link><description>Deputy Lo Choi In suffered a road accident in the interior and had to be hospitalized.

A resident of Macao living in Zhuhai was identified by health services (SS) as the sixth imported case of chikungunya fever. The information was released on Tuesday night through a Chinese language statement.
According to official information, the man with chikungunya fever is 66 years old and was infected during a work trip to Sri Lanka, where she was July 7 and 18.
He returned to the territory alone, but on July 21 he began to present the first symptoms of infection, such as fatigue, leg and knee pain and diarrhea. The next day, July 22, he developed fever and skin eruptions in the legs. As the fever did not disappear until the 26th, the man eventually sought treatment at the Conde São Januário hospital center. Finally, on July 27, the public health laboratory confirmed the new chikungunya fever case.
The SS also explained that the case was categorized as imported due to the patient's “travel history”, “symptom development” and “laboratory tests”. Authorities also pointed out that the patient's condition has improvements.
According to health services chikungunya fever is a viral disease, transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, especially those of Aedes aegypti and aedes albopictus.
Lam went to the ground
With the number of cases increasing, the Secretary for Social Affairs and Culture, LAM, moved on Tuesday to some territory locations, where mosquito extermination actions are being carried out, such as workshoars, parks and gardens. The images of the visits were shared by the means of propagated from the government.
The travel to the shipyards of the new landfills was justified with the fact that at least three of the cases of chikungunya fever identified in the neighboring province of Canton involving construction workers who work in zone A. "The possibility of transmitting fever through shipyards cannot be excluded," was considered by SS.
By the time the statement was issued, the authorities also justified the reinforcement of mosquito extermination actions with the fact that five imported cases were recorded in Macao (the most recent case had not yet been disclosed), as well as a local dengue fever case.</description><pubDate>2025-07-31 00:19:02</pubDate></item><item><title>Chikungunya | Diagnosed fifth imported case</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/30/chikungunya-diagnosticado-quinto-caso-importado/</link><description>Health services announced on Monday night the fifth imported case of chikungunya fever.

After returning, on July 25 he began to present the first symptoms, such as sideline joint pain. At first, the woman took fast relief medicines. However, as on Sunday he developed allergy and rash in his knee and on one arm moved to the Conde São Januário Hospital Center, where he was eventually diagnosed.
The woman is free of danger and in a stable condition. After the case was detected, mosquito extermination actions were carried out near the woman's housing, which is near Lam Mau Avenue in the north of the city.</description><pubDate>2025-07-30 00:47:14</pubDate></item><item><title>Hengqin | One paid 173.3 million for architecture and design project</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/30/hengqin-um-pagou-1733-milhoes-por-projecto-de-arquitectura-e-design/</link><description>The Institute of Investment in Architectural Design of the University of Southern China Technology was chosen for the University of Macao Campus Architecture and Design project in Hengqin. Official information does not allow to know the other entities invited to submit proposals, nor the prices
 
The University of Macao paid 153.8 million Renminbis (173.3 million patacas) by the architectural design project of the future campus of the educational institution in the deepened cooperation zone. The amount was released through the Directorate of Supervision and Management of Public Assets (DSSGAP), as the payment was made through the company Guangdong Hengqin a Higher Education Development.
The official information indicates that the company chosen to provide the service was the Institute of Investment in Architectural Design of the University of Technology of Southern China. The company's selection resulted from a direct consultation by the University of Macao investment arm in Hengqin. However, official information does not allow to know that other companies were invited to submit proposals for architectural design, nor the amount to pay for the service contained in these proposals.
Since the beginning of the year this is the second award to companies located in the interior of China by Guangdong Hengqin a Higher Education Development regarding the work of the new campus. The other award, worth 35.9 million Renminbis (40.5 million patacas), was made to the Beijing office of consultant Rider Levett Bucknall, which has the main headquarters in Hong Kong, and also resulted from a price consultation.
The services provided by Rider Levett Bucknall aimed at the “Cost Control Service” in the face of campus works in the plots of land identified as A1 to A6 of the Deepened Cooperation Zone.
New campus
Guangdong Hengqin A Higher Education Development was created by the University of Macao in the interior of China to build the new campus. Currently, the company's capital is 4 billion Renminbis.
As a result of this investment, one agreed to pay 1.4 billion patacas to the in -depth cooperation zone between Guangdong and Macau, on Mountain Island, for the land of 375,600 square meters that will receive the new campus. This investment meant the payment of 2,758 patacas per square meter.
According to the plans previously announced by UM, the land is divided into 9 lots, of which 6 will be used to build laboratories, colleges, and other university facilities, while three other lots arrest with the obligation of one to build the roads of the in -depth cooperation zone. At least 10,000 students are expected on the campus that is expected to be completed by 2028, the year they will start operations with 8,000 students, including 4,000 undergraduate degrees. It is also expected that the campus needs about 500 employees to operate.</description><pubDate>2025-07-30 00:44:08</pubDate></item><item><title>Zelensky vs Zelensky</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/31/zelensky-vs-zelensky/</link><description>10/27/22
A renovated Ukrainian, with the same name of the president, guilty Zelensky about the extension of the conflict that destroyed his village. Zelensky, the village, who has never left his land, now lives mortified because his favorite gravedigger died in the bomber.
This Zelensky, the village, represents half the world that reproves the other Zelensky, the villain, for not wanting to negotiate with Putin.
Negotiate what? The invader enters us through the house, pies us the wife and daughter (cf. recent UN report on Ukraine violations in this “special operation”), an act that forced us to watch, and then we say: Alto there, we are for peace, but we have to negotiate: You have not said the name you want to give to children!
A peace that is not worthy is but a cessation of rights. As severe as Russophobia that Putin inflicts his people.

In a lunch with several guests I hear a friend, who declares himself a spiritist, explaining about the particularities of his belief, in a serene and balanced way, would even say, without "irrationalism". He discussed long and serenely, devoid of any fanatical proselytizing. “Here is someone to whom belief brought weighting!” I thought, a rare alliance.
However, at one point a phrase that horrify me. He says, “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!” And I enter the voracious fauces of holism. Because holismo has a pathological aspect like all good things, a side of shadow.
Two examples: In Hinduism there is less sensitivity to existential dramas, if that child suffers in this life this is only an expression of the strict karmic symmetry, an effect of the acts she committed in her previous life. In Africa it is not accepted that death may have been accidental, and many women are accused by the dead family of having caused her husband's death, in an act of manifest dementia, and, in the blatant majority of cases, in a huge injustice to his wife - madness that spreads and infiltrates the social fabric.
Buddhism has introduced compassion and Christianity to Caritas, trying to break with this logic, but in many other beliefs and religions the cage of causalities prevails over sensitivity to experience, the need to respond to the now.
It is a tremendous logic that transforms the world into a platonic stage, where we are just the shadows of something -an inextricable law -in a determinism that calcines all singularities, but strangely fascinates many.
The conquest of modernity has anchored in the conquest of chance and random, subtracting the incidences of a life to this fierce determinism that closed the world in a web. When the Renaissance freed the body from the influence of the stars, at this moment sexuality was relieved of guilt and individualism and their volition could emerge.
There is an unequivocal moral implication in the phrase “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!”, Which should work as a key to self-knowledge and self-judgment, but usually this phrase is managed to seek a reason for things abroad from us in the other. It is an alibi.
There is a holistic temptation in the world today, as in the Middle Ages there was a satanic temptation, without great reflection on its consequences. Because it is not enough we want to connect everything in a resonant chain of affection. Even the most unexpected: affection itself can kill.
I realize, thanks to this cultured, balanced, intelligent woman, that “the combat” moved at the beginning of this century. One of the great misconceptions of the twentieth century was the false dichotomy between "rationalism and irrationalism", a debate that extended to all fields, including art. First, rationality was confused (the positive side of reason) with rationalism (the pathological feature of reason), and articulated in this lack of discernment was confused irrationalism with freedom. Almost all the art of the twentieth century, with surrealism to the head, worked in this error. The fallacy still exists despite having consolidated the emergence of 'irrationalism' and the consequent relativist currents that followed it. Essentially much of what happened in the twentieth century, it turned around this shock between two paradigms: rationalism versus irrationalism.
Now, I see, the indetermination, chance, the random of the terrible temptation of the causal cage. Holism, in its pathological feature, can be the reductionism that is the way it puts the way as a new 'eschatological narrative'.
Is it "by chance" that the holism emerges at the moment when neo-liberalism and its cynical contempt for the human person besides all freedoms, all acquired rights?
Holistic consciousness has brought positively a greater ecological awareness but followed by scholastic rigor drifting reality under the blanket of a determinism that is much more than inconvenience: all great authoritarian ideologies are holistic.
My friend will know how to combine her holistic and transpersonal belief with the freedom and responsibility that every moment asks us - but how many will make the destruction, under a law that explains and encompasses everything?
How many will not be abandoned to what it is?
The awareness of the indeterminate brings tragic conscience, as the Greeks knew, but also brings the will and the courage of the decision. And of this we cannot abdicate.
In addition, as Drummond shows in Carlos Drummond de Andrade's poem “Quadrilha”:
"John loved Teresa who loved Raimundo/ who loved Maria who loved Joaquim who loved Lili/ who did not love anyone./ John went to the United States, Teresa to the convent,/ Raimundo died of disaster, Maria stayed to aunt,/ Joaquim committed himself and Lili married J. Pinto Fernandes/ who had not entered the story."
Real always runs outside the track, in full exteriority to our concepts. This is what is worth a J. Pinto Fernandes at the exact moment we thought we had everything under control.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Nobel and others</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/17/do-nobel-e-outros/</link><description>9/10/22
Reading many people's reactions when the Nobel Prize in this year's literature was announced, I couldn't help but remind me of this repair of Jean-Pierre Siméon, in relation to another Nobel Prize: “An editor of a large national newspaper wrote five lines of indignation because the Nobel Prize for Literature, a complete stranger. But unknown to whom? How did not occur to this patented and paid literary columnist to do his work, that his apparent ignorance was a matter of incorrect professional conduct? Tranströmer was translated into many languages, it was available in French. »
There is always the choir of those waiting for the announcement of the prize to complain about not being invited to the jury of it, there is a subgroup of Irados that professes “I never read and I will not bother to read”; It is an uncommon fauna, which inhabits social networks.
I don't always know all the winners-I was unaware of the existence of Louise Glück, who I find a great poet, or the Olga Tokarczuk, for example-but it only brings me the comfort of knowing that the world is not a soap opera where everyone knows each other and the joy of recognizing that the gauge of the world is not measured with my short measure and that on the contrary it gives me a new opportunity to face the unknown.
And perhaps the most cretin of reactions was the smart one who wrote, but there are still those who read French? Confirming only that today there is a new kind of ignorance that fires with a displeasure: the one who only read English.
I would also prefer that, in French, Pascal Quignard, Linda reads, or even Sollers, or, among the new ones, Mathias is awarded, but that does not take dignity to the work of Annie Ernaux (and it would be enough to have written the “Les Années”). There are books of her that I like less, like the vulgar "a simple passion," but this happens with almost every authors, they have a channel books and others that are like intervals in their itinerary. I advise reading a beautiful book of interviews with her, "L'Ecriture Comme un couteau".

Yesterday came an article in Maputo's morning “News”, realizing that the Pen Club narrative prize was assigned to my wife, Teresa Noronha, for her soap opera “Tornado”, which had already had the Maria Velho da Costa award.
The summary they made of the book does not even deserve comments, by pathetic, but what matters to highlight is the note of disqualification about their "Mozambicanity" by calling it Luso-Mozambican. It is not inaccurate, but for those who know the context, it is a dirty touch.
Because finally, following the same logic, Adelino Timóteo should be called Tsonga-Mozambican, to Álvaro Taruma-Mozambican, and Macua-Mozambican to the writers who are from the north, etc., etc. Which is not reported to happen.
At the beyond moment, in the soap opera, she writes:
«Our color has never been dominant. In colonial time we were not white, we were ripped from monories, gone mugs, the pejorative term to speak of a son of Goes and Portuguese. In the postcolonial period, I was not black and if, in Lisbon, they took me by Brazilian or Cape Verdean, already in France were lost in cogitations of where they would be and amazed when they found out it was African. There I had to explain my DNA's wanderings before relying on moorms. It took me a long time to accept that it was so because yes, and that it was no curse that were so; On the contrary, I could even discover intense patterns of fantasy and freedom in this shrewd cloak that is our genealogy… »
In the current Mozambique it is white… and this is overlapping it soon to what it does or what it is.
It is sad, but as Naipaul warned, through these stops the race is everything and is soaked in it as deeply as, elsewhere, in religion.

Bruno Latour, an anthropologist who studied the sciences and their procedures and legitimations, law, technique and religions died and entertained themselves to turn the guts to the dogmas of the “modern”. For him the place, the expert's function, was more defined by the perplexity he embodied than for the supposed truth he would support him.
He proposed, as an alternative to the kinds of multiculturalism and his mistaken password "all different all the same", the return to "diplomacy", given precisely, not from the presupposition that "we are unified because participants of the same nature" but simply reveal that we "do not yet share an ordinary world"; It is necessary to deal frontally with the "abyss of disagreement" that separates us, rather than wanting to delude it.
And about politics said, disassessedly:
«If transparency is required from the politician, we kill him; If one requires fidelity to what the other was or he says, kills him; If a mimetic relationship is required between what the crowd wants and what its representative says, the representation is killed. These must, therefore, by definition, betray, deceive, modify, distort the word. Without this ability to double the word and betray, political language would not exist. I put the perfectly plausible hypothesis that political vocabulary will become as inaccessible as the religious language of the last twenty, three or fifty years. (in “UN Monde Pluriel plus Commun”). I believe it will be missed to decipher this frantically complex world that fit us.</description><pubDate>2022-10-17 02:18:03</pubDate></item><item><title>The yo -yo</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/30/o-fuxi/</link><description>O my friends, companions of these funerals trips to countries as old as the stars and the moon, and as strange as the profound interior of our disgraceful souls, - that startle still awaits us, what secret spells we will have to overcome, what horrors will rise to our dilated pupils of amazement and terror?

O human human, who cries superior to his own nature, but then reveals to you, once and again, unable to simply order your existence and do not understand that you are possessed by the fickle wrath and are slave to your own ambition! Do not be content with the white jade or the light gold, there is no treasure that gives you your inextinguishable thirst for other men, animals and things; for in you an eternal anguish in you; in you crawl the expelled snakes; For you grows, powerful and impossible, the very fertile ivy of evil!
This is perhaps why on the mound they call the white deer, where one of the eight immortals in sacred mount was evolved through the skies to Penglai, inhabits the fuxa, a bird whose form resembles that of the rooster, although topped by a human head. What strange copulas, what monstrous amplexes, what terrible procedures will have occurred to make the existence of this animal sinister possible? We do not know, but it is enough for our exhausted mind to dare to raise an answer, so we soon feel the skin traveled by horrendous goose bumps and the heart trigger in paraded, which wild horse beaten by the night whip of fear, oblivious to reins and containment.

«Every man morally is one and absolute; But you have to live with your personality to mitigate. (…) Coexistence is only possible among people reduced to a negative or hollow presence, which is constantly giving in. Hence, the emptiness of society, a huge ghost composed of numerous deceased. An upper man is antisocial or criminal. Its destination is jail and desert.
He is in thinking about whether she reflects here about the political-social conditioning that gagging, and worse, in a sad country as Portugal was in the middle of the Estado Novo (and the book is from 1931) where any possibilities of spontaneity and frankness in human relations were coarcet, or only lends the behavior of men (oppressed) a metaphysical frame, a “essence”, from a presumption of each one in the presumption of each one be in isolation “one and absolute”. Sometimes, to an excess of spirituality (or longing), it adds to Pascoaes to lack the world. He is a great poet, but he is a poet who takes gray-Jewish ampoules and is therefore written amiiude on a programmatic furor, ceasing to have pores; There is often a glass between him and the real, the same one who made him wring the Ballet, 1921: “Everything is ghost. There are only clouds, clouds of voices, clouds of souls, afflictions and tragedies! Clouds and more clouds, appearances and more appearances! It is a divine lightning that pierces them, the instant appearance that arises and throws us to the ground, dazzled! »
Sometimes I would like to remind him, as Antonio Sérgio did in the article “Regeneration and Tradition, Moral and Economy”, which dedicated to Easter: “Easter, Easter my dear friend: You are a pure, excellent and noble poet, but also a victim of this social environment, like us all: this horrible isolation that you praise and I”.
"As a child, he stole two melos," says Jacinto do Prado Coelho, stole him from a nest, and throb his lifetime remorse for it. The person, few more mischief is known to him. Only in Álvaro de Campos sprouts a twinge of evil and obscenity: “Oh, and ordinary and dirty people who always seem the same,/ who employs profanity as usual words,/ whose children steal at the grocery door/ and whose daughters at eight years-and I think this is beautiful and I love him! -/ masturbate decent -looking men on the stairs. » (Ode triumphal).
Both poets beaten by a certain idea of holiness, they were identical to the inability of breaking the siege of the skin with the overflow of the dike, the same curse of sublimating Eros's concrete ferocity with the mansuity of the verses.
Of course, they are the two "Bigger Than Life", but sometimes unnerves to watch, from my hostor's post at the Procrastinators Club, to the tantrums between them, just to see who occupies, in the internal organization, the place of president and treasurer.
Although a person has guessed more, for example, this he wrote in the least known martial ode and that is declining in the situation we live today, differently, with the heart in his hands:

It would be a way to close a circle, ”said Donald Trump, aboard the Air Force One, to a press question about a future meeting between both leaders, who had already announced last June.
The president indicated that the commercial delegations of Beijing and Washington had "a very good exchange today [yesterday]" in the Swedish capital, allowing him to be more optimistic about the possibility of talking face to face to Xi.
"If they had asked me yesterday, it didn't look very well ... Scott has just told me that the meeting with China did very well," Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who leads the US conversation along with commercial representative Jamieson Greer, among others.
The two -day meeting in Stockholm took place after the meetings in Geneva and London in May and June, respectively, and the telephone conversation between Trump and Xi, on June 5, in which the Chinese president invited his American counterpart to Beijing.
Bessent and Greer have announced that they will meet Trump in the White House on Wednesday to inform him of the progress of negotiations and obtain their approval for the extension for another 90 days of the tariff truce agreed by both countries, which is expected to end on August 12.</description><pubDate>2025-07-31 03:00:05</pubDate></item><item><title>Nissan | Losses of 677 million euros between April and June</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/31/nissan-perdas-de-677-milhoes-de-euros-entre-abril-e-junho/</link><description>Japanese automotive company Nissan registered a net loss of 677 million euros between April and June, the first quarter of its fiscal year, due to the drop in sales and the impact of tariffs.
The third largest Japanese car manufacturer also had an operational loss of 462 million euros, while sales volume dropped 9.7 percent in homologous terms to 15.824 billion euros, according to the financial report published yesterday.
The registered net loss is lower than expected by analysts consulted by Bloomberg, but reflects a situation still difficult for the Japanese manufacturer, involved in a large restructuring process.
Although the evolution of its offer and fixed cost reductions “has allowed to alleviate losses, the group continues to face contrary winds, namely a decrease in sales volumes, unfavorable fluctuations of exchange rates and the impact of US customs rights,” Nissan says.
The company maintains its predictions for the entire year 2025-2026, by 73 billion euros, but is excused to provide forecasts of profits or losses in a still very volatile commercial environment.
Japan's car exports to the United States have been subject to a 25 percent surcharge since April by the Trump administration. Total customs rights to the sector should be reduced to 15 percent, according to a recently completed agreement between Tokyo and Washington.
In this context, Nissan saw its sales in the United States, in number of units, retreat 6.5 percent from April to June.</description><pubDate>2025-07-31 00:54:09</pubDate></item><item><title>Cambodia and Thailand reiterate in China commitment to ceasefire</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/31/camboja-e-tailandia-reiteram-na-china-compromisso-com-cessar-fogo/</link><description>Representatives of Cambodia and Thailand yesterday assured China's Deputy Foreign Minister Sun Weidong that their countries are “committed to the consensus achieved for ceasefire” after a border conflict.
Sun yesterday received representatives of Cambodia and Thailand yesterday who, according to the Chinese Foreign Ministry, reiterated Beijing “their commitment to the consensus on ceasefire” and expressed “their thanks for the positive role of China” to alleviate the situation.
The statement indicates that the meeting took place in a “frank, friendly and harmonious” environment and that the meeting demonstrates “China's last diplomatic effort”, which continues to play “a constructive role in supporting Cambodia and Thailand to peacefully resolve its border dispute”.
Thailand once again accused Cambodia of “violating” the ceasefire due to conflict on the border, while PNHom Penh denies and ensures that he is “committed” to the hostility cessation agreement.
Thailand and Cambodia agreed on Monday with a ceasefire after five days of clashes that left more than 40 dead from both countries, after a historical territorial dispute ended in a military confrontation at various points in its common border. Bangkok has already denounced on Tuesday the violation of the covenant by the neighboring country.

In the city of Severo-Kourilsk, in the north of the Russian Curilla Islands, several tsunamis flooded the streets and part of the two thousand inhabitants were removed, according to the Ministry of Emergency Situations. The state of emergency was declared in that area.
"The fourth wave of Tsunami is coming. The wave is very large, everything is flooded, the whole coast is flooded," yesterday testified a inhabitant in a video published by the Russian newspaper Izvestia. According to the mayor of the city, quoted by the Russian state agency Tass, one of the tsunamis dragged to the sea the ships that were anchored.
According to the United States Geological Institute (USGS), the 8.8 magnitude earthquake on the Richter scale occurred around 7:25 am in Macao, 20.7 kilometers deep, 126 kilometers from the Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky coast in the Far East Russian. This magnitude has been the strongest registered in Kamchatka since November 5, 1952, when a magnitude 9 earthquake, which occurred practically in the same place, provoked devastating tsunamis throughout the Pacific Ocean. Kamchatka's seismological service warned that replicas of up to 7.5 were expected.
In Japan, images on television showed people to drive or walk to higher areas, especially on the island of Hokkaido, in the north of the country, where a first tsunami was observed 30 centimeters high.
Fukushima (North) nuclear central employees, destroyed by a strong earthquake and tsunami in March 2011, were removed, the infrastructure operator said.
“Do not venture into the sea and do not approach the coast until the warning is lifted,” said the Japanese Meteorological Agency (JMA), which provides for waves of three meters. "The inhabitants of the regions where alerts were issued should be immediately withdrawn to safe places, high areas or evacuation buildings," Japanese government spokesman Yoshimasa Hayashi insisted.
The Japanese alert covers the entire north and east coast of the archipelago, to south of Osaka, as well as the small peripheral islands. Also, in Tokyo and Osaka bays, tsunami can reach a meter.
The other Pacific
China has issued tsunami alert to various areas of the coast. The Philippines also urged the inhabitants of the east coast to move inside and advised the fishermen who are already in the sea to remain deeply.
The same message was broadcast on Hawaii, in the United States, threatened by waves of three meters or more. "People should not, and repeat once again, should not, as we have seen in the past, stay close to the coast or risk life just to see what a tsunami is like," said state governor Josh Green.
Also Peru and Mexico said Tsunami's warning to the coast, as well as Ecuador, who evacuated the beaches and ports of the Galapagos archipelago. Tsunamis one to three meters are also possible in Chile, Costa Rica, French Polynesia and other archipelagos. The United States issued a series of alerts of different levels along the west coast from Alaska to the entire California coast.</description><pubDate>2025-07-31 00:44:58</pubDate></item><item><title>Shanghai | More than 280,000 people withdrawn due to the co-may typhoon</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/31/xangai-mais-de-280-000-pessoas-retiradas-devido-ao-tufao-co-may/</link><description>Shanghai's Chinese metropolis removed over 280,000 people until 10am yesterday, due to the passage of Typhoon Co-May, the eighth of this season, which hit the east coast of China.

Liu Jun, former president of the Chinese Superleague Management company (CSL), was sentenced to a combined prison sentence and a fine of 1.1 million Yuan for accepting bribes, both as an employee and non-state agent. The court also ordered the confiscation of the profits obtained illegally by Liu, one of the main investigated in one of the largest cases of soccer corruption in China.
Wang Xiaoping, former director of the Disciplinary Committee of the Chinese Football Association (CFA), received a 10-and-a-half year sentence and a fine of 700,000 Yuan for similar crimes. The incomes obtained improperly also confiscated.
With these two new sentences, the number of convicts in the anti-corruption campaign that, since November 2022, has been shaken by Chinese professional football, affecting former leaders, coaches, referees and high positions of CFA.
Among the convicts are prominent figures such as former CFA President Chen Xuyuan, sentenced to life imprisonment, and former national selection coach and local idol, Li Tie, who meets a 20-year sentence for accepting and offering bribes.

Shenzhen was fifth, while Beijing, Guangzhou and Shanghai did not enter the Top 10
The conclusions of the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) study, published on Tuesday, reflect a growing change in the country's economic scenario, as smaller cities affirm themselves as growth engines, thanks to the strength of advanced transforming industry, clean energies and other emerging sectors.
The EIU annual report classifies Chinese cities in terms of growth potential, with Hangzhou - headquarters of the Electronic Trade Giant Alibaba, Artificial Intelligence Company Deepseek and several other major technology - leading the list for the fifth consecutive year.
It follows Hefei, a city in eastern China known as the semiconductors and electric vehicles, and Chengdu, an important industrial center in the southwest of the country. Shenzhen, often nicknamed China's "Silicon Valley", was fifth, while Beijing, Guangzhou and Shanghai did not enter the Top 10.
The results “reflect the rise of the transforming industry and the decline of the sector of services” in China, wrote economists Xu Tianzeng and Su Yue, in a context where the prolonged real estate crisis has been fought consumption and the economy remains dependent on production.
According to the report, Hangzhou recovered robustly after the regulatory restrictions imposed by Beijing to the technological sector in 2021. "Since then, the city has reaffirmed its leadership in the Chinese race to artificial intelligence, driven by companies such as DeepSeek, while taking advantage of advanced transforming industry," said the authors, noting that Hangzhou has one position most solid inspectors in the country.
Hangzhou is also the headquarters of the "six little dragons" - a group of prominent technological startups, including DeepSeek, the UNITEE Robotics Humanoid Robot maker and Neuralk's rival Brainco.
The authorities of Zhejiang Province, where Hangzhou is located, have given priority to support to high -tech companies. Last week, they released an action plan project to boost local innovation, which establishes as a goal that more than 80 percent of new prices are from the technological sector by 2027.
The report also points out that Hefei and Chengdu made “strategic and bold investments” in fundamental technologies to boost their development.
Hefei has invested heavily in CXMT, one of China's leading chip producers, which prepares for an initial public offering, being widely seen as the country's best bet to compete with South Korea and the United States in the global semiconductor market.
With feet and head
Chengdu, in turn, invested in the Semiconductor manufacturer Hygon, a collaboration with the American AMD. “These enterprises not only generated substantial returns for both cities, but also launched the foundations for broader industrial ecosystems in neighboring cities,” the authors report.
The metropolitan area that includes Chengdu, Deyang, Meishan and Ziyang registered an average growth rate of more than 7 percent in the first trimester of 2025, becoming one of the fastest growth regions in the country.
Similarly, China's bet on clean energies is boosting strong growth in smaller cities with industrial bases linked to renewable energy technologies. Xinyu and Yichun, in the eastern province of Jiangxi, saw the growing demand for lithium -rich ores - essential for electric vehicles and energy storage - accelerate local growth.
Already Jinchang, in the northwestern province of Gansu, registered an average annual growth rate of 12.9 percent between 2022 and 2024, driven by the search for renewable energy infrastructures, which streamlined the local non-ferrous metal industry.
The report, however, warns that these smaller cities, driven by the energy transition, also face “vulnerabilities”, including exposure to raw material price cycles, foreign trade shocks and indirect industrial overcapacity adjustments.</description><pubDate>2025-07-31 00:39:23</pubDate></item><item><title>Gaza | More than 60,000 Palestinians have already died in the war</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/30/gaza-mais-de-60-mil-palestinianos-ja-morreram-na-guerra/</link><description>More than 60,000 Palestinians died in the war between Israel and Hamas, which began 21 months ago, said the Ministry of Health of the Gaza Strip, controlled by the Palestinian Islamite group. The Ministry of Health of Gaza stated that the number of dead rose to 60,034, adding that another 145,870 people have been injured since the beginning of the war on October 7, 2023.
Gaza's health authorities did not specify how many of these deadly victims were civil or combatants, but stressed that women and children represent about half of the dead. The United Nations and other independent experts consider the numbers presented by the Enclave health authorities as reliable counting of victims.
The Israeli offensive destroyed vast areas of Gaza, dislocated about 90 percent of the population and caused a catastrophic humanitarian crisis, with experts and organizations warning of the severity of hunger in the enclave.
The war suffered a drastic twist in early March, when Israel imposed a total blockade of two and a half months, preventing food, medicines, fuel and other goods.
Weeks later, Israel broke the ceasefire with bombing and began taking large areas of Gaza, measures that, according to Israel, aimed to press Hamas to release more hostages. At least 8,867 Palestinians have been killed since then, according to Gaza authorities.</description><pubDate>2025-07-30 01:12:21</pubDate></item><item><title>Panama Channel | China considers crucial neutrality</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/30/canal-do-panama-china-considera-neutralidade-crucial/</link><description>The China Embassy in Panama considered the neutrality of the Panama Canal, after a meeting with the interooceanic road administration in which areas of maritime cooperation were discussed.

Today, Beijing seeks “alternative mechanisms” of cooperation in the “global south” and tries to build an alternative model to the World Health Organization
 
 
Let's start with the concept of Global Health Governance (GGS). Is this a more contemporary concept or relating to the post-war period and the Foundation of the World Health Organization (WHO)? What have been the main actors of this governance until China's growth?
GGS is a concept whose prominence and relevance have grown significantly in the 21st century, largely driven by economic globalization and worldwide interconnection. Although global health has always transcended national borders, demanding multidisciplinary approaches and international cooperation, only from the 1990s it was made greater awareness of it. Historically, GGS has been predominantly influenced by western powers and neoliberal values. The main actors of this governance, until China's growth, were historically marked by interventions of entities such as WHO and non-governmental, predominantly American and European organizations.
One of the findings of its doctoral thesis is that China has been progressively positioning itself in this leadership. This position started specifically when and why?
Yes, China has been progressively positioned as a relief actor in the evolution of the GG system. Although it is not possible to point out an exact date of start, China has evolved from a relatively isolated country to a main actor in global political, economic and technological arenas. Its growing economic and political influence also represents a change in GGS's historical dynamics, and in the 1960s China tried to play a humanitarian health care role in neighboring countries and Africa. The thesis points out that China's experience can be seen as an example of what is achievable when a state chooses its own way rather than a pre-established model, aligning itself with the 21st century prediction as the "century of Asia."
Did the pandemic years influence this position? How?
Covid-19 pandemic highlighted the need for global health cooperation, as well as the potential consequences of the failure to prioritize global health. The thesis explores the evolution of the Health Silk Route before and after the pandemic, indicating that the pandemic years allowed greater awareness of the need for instruments such as the Health Silk Route as the most effective cooperation platforms among nations. Although not detailed in this specific section, it is implicit that the pandemic intensified China's performance in health diplomacy and health development assistance.
Looking at the internal reforms that China has carried out in the health area, which highlights as the most important?
I approach, in the thesis, the reforms of the China Health System and I point out that the Chinese governance model is a unique combination of state -oriented economic reforms and development by the state, incorporating elements of neoliberalism and authoritarianism into political issues in general, and the health sector is nothing different from the rest. One of China's mentioned contributions, recognized by WHO, is its primary health care model based on the recognized good practice of “barefoot doctors” (barefoot doctors). In addition, the thesis analyzes the main reform policies and their progress and challenges in the period 2009-2018, which comprise the reforms of primary health care, hospital and pharmaceutical reform. The “Healthy China 2030” program is also an important and ambitious reference of China's domestic reforms in health, also encompassing social determinants.
Is Beijing's intention to create an alternative entity to WHO, or simply create an alternative movement that can coexist with WHO, in the context of the relationship with the global south? How could this work?
The thesis suggests that China adopts a "dual approach": while integrating in existing global structures, forging simultaneously alternative paths, particularly through regional alliances such as BRICS and partnerships with Global South. This indicates an intention to create an alternative movement that can coexist and complement the role of WHO, rather than a direct alternative entity. China demonstrates a clear commitment to align the objectives of the “Belt and Road” initiative with the united nations sustainable development objectives, showing their willingness to present these initiatives as complements to the existing cooperation mechanisms in the international liberal order. President Xi Jinping's view of a “future community shared for humanity”, which includes the notion of a “global health community for all”, also points to a new perspective in international cooperation.
Traditional Chinese Masks, Vaccines and Medicine (MTC): What are China's products or instruments to position itself as an increasingly global actor in GGS?
The thesis points out that China is an indispensable provider of global public health, essential for the product supply chain, such as masks and vaccines. The MTC is also mentioned as one of China's great contributions to global health governance, with its chinese herbal treatments, some of which already recognized by WHO in 2017. In addition, Chinese medical assistance and medical teams sent to other regions of the globe are important instruments of Chinese health diplomacy.
In creating an alternative movement or reality to WHO, China may be taking advantage of the lack of full representativeness in the same WHO, or gaps in its operation?
The thesis does not address directly whether China is taking advantage of a lack of full representativeness in WHO or gaps in its operation. However, it emphasizes that the work aims to fill a gap in scientific knowledge in relation to the paradigm of health governance from a non-western and liberal perspective, emphasizing China as an actor of the global south. This suggests that China seeks to strengthen alternative models that can offer more personalized health challenges, different from those defended by Western countries, positioning itself as a moderate reformist actor.
How has the European Union (EU) foreign policy in relation to China affecting or influenced this position of the country in global health governance?
In the thesis, the fourth publication, entitled "Challenges on the European Union-China Cooperation in Higher Education from" People-To-People Dialogue ’Perspective: The Case of Health-Related Joint Projects," explores cooperation in higher education, in particular that includes health-related projects. Therefore, despite the strategic and economic dialogue, the deterioration of UE-china bilateral relations intensified, with the commission to assume a decline of enthusiasm due to “China's countermeasures to EU human rights sanctions, economic coercion and commercial measures against the single market, and the positioning of China in the war in Ukraine”. Although challenges and tensions are recognized, cooperation in higher education, including health projects, is seen as part of a broader picture of strategic partnership between EU and China. However, it is evident that there is no long tradition of health cooperation between EU and China in higher education, and that there are few joint projects compared to the general panorama. It is suggested that both EU and China should make more efforts to align medical study curricula and promote more joint research in areas related to health, infectious diseases, among others.
In the Trump 2.0 era, and without pandemic, what could be China's role in global health governance?
Although the thesis is published this year, it focuses on the preceding period and includes the pandemic, where it does not speculate directly on a future scenario of “Trump 2.0” without pandemic. However, the thesis argues that China is not just a participant, but a moderate reformist force in the formation of global health standards. Regardless of future political scenarios, their growing economic and political influence, strategic health diplomacy, internal reforms and initiatives such as the Health Silk Route will continue to shape their role in global health governance. The view of a “global health community for all” also remains a guiding principle for China's efforts.
Does this power of China in GGS verify more with bilateral or multilateral agreements?
The thesis suggests that China's power in global health governance manifests itself through both bilateral and multilateral agreements, but with a growing emphasis on certain forms of cooperation that strengthen their role in the global south and through alternative mechanisms. Although the thesis does not explicitly quantify the predominance between bilateral and multilateral, the focus on regional alliances (BRICS) and partnerships with the Global South (which often involve bilateral agreements and group cooperation initiatives) and the Health Silk Route indicate a hybrid approach.</description><pubDate>2025-06-30 23:46:26</pubDate></item><item><title>Macao Forum | Secretary-General says it has never discussed widening to Hispanic countries</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/30/forum-macau-secretario-geral-diz-que-nunca-se-discutiu-alargamento/</link><description>In an interview with Lusa agency, the secretary general of the Macau Forum, Ji Xianzheng, assured that “never discussed” the widening of action to Hispanic countries, but that the willingness already stated by the government of Sam Hou Fai will have to be the authorities to decide a new direction to the cooperation strategy.
 
The Secretary-General of the Macau Forum stated that the institution “never discussed” the creation of an entity to extend to Hispanic countries to promote economic cooperation similar to those that provide the connection between China and Portuguese-speaking countries.
“Within the Macao Forum, we have never discussed this topic,” said the Forum Secretary-General for Economic and Commercial Cooperation between China and Portuguese-speaking countries Ji Xianzheng.
The official acknowledged that, "in society, there were some conversations to discuss or address the possibility of promoting more contact and cooperation with Spanish -language countries, but at the Forum level we have never addressed this theme."
The Macao executive announced in mid -April the intention of creating a center to promote economic services between China and the Portuguese and Spanish languages in the neighboring Special Economic Zone of Hengqin.
The idea is to provide companies in Hispanic countries services in the “linguistic, legal, fiscal, verification of compliance with norms, formation, arbitration and mediation”, according to the Secretary for Administration and Justice, André Cheong.
Days earlier, the chief executive, Sam Hou Fai, had also announced the intention of “promoting exchange and cooperation” through Macao, between China and the universe of Spanish -speaking countries.
Although Macau wants to widen focus to Castilian -speaking countries, “the forum will remain the forum for China and Lusophony countries,” said Ji Xianzheng. The secretary general clarified that the institution that directs "can contribute contributions to the greater opening of Macao in international cooperation", as is the intention announced by the new government of MSAR.
Complementary forum
Personally, the secretary general has ensured that he had “pleasing to work with all parties,” but stressed that this is a “decision that is up to central governments to make” and that the forum was never contacted in this regard.
"Yes, I worked in Latin America, Spain, nine years in Madrid and Caracas. But this is not a decision of personal interest, it is up to politicians to make the decision," he said, explaining that the idea will be to promote the relationship between Macao and Brazil and then to other Latin American countries, as well as expanding the relationship with Portugal to Spain.
"There is no limit. The Macao Forum is complementary. It does not restrict any promotion of the cooperation of the other parts," he said.
According to the Macao Government Communication Office, Sam Hou Fai admitted on June 21 that he postponed a trip to Portugal, scheduled for July, and should also pass through Spain and the European Union headquarters in Brussels.
Bad interpretations
In the same interview with Lusa, the Secretary-General of the Macao Forum imputed to national governments the responsibility for conducting development and economic cooperation policies, stressing that the institution “has no investment projects”.
Ji Xianzheng attributes criticism to the Macao Forum to an wrong interpretation regarding the body's mission. "The forum is a mechanism of cooperation between central governments. Many people think it is to the secretariat that it is up to the execution of policies, but we have a limited number of people," added Ji.
"The secretariat has no investment projects, it is a mechanism for preparing the ministerial conference, connecting with governments, not a promotion agency. It has not been thought of, connects with the promotion agencies. We are four people sent by China and one delegate for each country," he said.
At the last ministerial conference, in April 2024, then Portuguese Economy Minister Pedro Reis argued that the Portuguese Language China-Parais Cooperation and Development Fund should bet more on small and medium enterprises (SMEs).
The Cooperation Fund was created in 2013 by the China Development Bank and the Macao Industrial and Commercial Development Fund, with a thousand million dollars, of which about 60 percent have already been invested, according to the secretary general.
Action plans
Ji Xianzheng has admitted that SMEs are "a difficult theme for any government" and that "international cooperation for the promotion of development and cooperation of small and medium enterprises is even more difficult. It is a topic that is being debated daily worldwide." But admitted, "here, little."
"But it is stipulated in the action plan [2024-2026]. It is up to central governments and commerce chambers, promotion agents, to work together to do this. The secretariat assumes responsibility as authorized by the central governments, specifically, in the activities program," he said.
Politicians from various countries, including Portugal, Angola and Mozambique, have appealed to a change in the rules of the fund's candidacy. Current rules require, for example, that candidate projects have a minimum investment of five million dollars, and the fund only covers 20 percent of total investment, referring the rest to governments or companies.
Ji Xianzheng said the new fund's new direction "is committed to promoting a broader investment, with better coverage for all forum countries, [relatively] to projects that have a strategic or significant impact on the socioeconomic development of participating countries."
According to the secretary general, "the terms of application [of the rules of access to the background] will be more flexible and the forms of application will also be more diverse." “Instead of being just direct investment, they are also studying ways to apply the fund, in cooperation with other funds or with other financial institutions,” he gave as an example.
"This fund has an operation according to market rules. It is not a humanitarian aid fund. Therefore, it has to guarantee the minimum return of benefit. But, on that, they are very open to study, in this case, the conditions of each project," added Ji Xianzheng, but to give examples of "flexibilization of the rules."
Regarding the approximation of the China universe and countries of the Iberian Peninsula, already cemented in official speeches, economist Maria Fernanda Ilhéu, president of the Seda's New Route Association, told HM, earlier this month, that this intention is “very objective and pragmatic and can be summarized to the Macao economy diversification project, for which companies and investors are not only in Macao, but also from Macao, but also from Macao, but also from countries, but countries Portuguese Language ”.
"But the fact is that companies and institutions from Portuguese-speaking countries are not being effective in responding to this need for Macao. Therefore, widening companies and Spanish-speaking institutions this invitation to cooperation seems logical to me," the economist said.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Isabel Rio Novo, author of the biography of Luís de Camões: “Time in Macau was of tranquility”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/26/isabel-rio-novo-autora-da-biografia-de-luis-de-camoes-tempo-em-macau-foi-de-tranquilidade/</link><description>It will be launched tomorrow, at the Consulate General of Portugal in Macau and Hong Kong, the biography of Luís de Camões, by Isabel Rio Novo.

Why did you decide to get in the writing of another biography of Camões?
It is true that Luis Vaz de Camões has been biographed many times over 500 years. However, 50 years ago there was no biography about him. From my point of view and the editor, Camões deserved a more current biography that revised all kinds of prejudices, seeking known sources, the uncovered information research and where the rereading of all previous works were rereading. This biography is not only a summary, but also the reinterpretation of what has been known, but which had rarely been related. The book also brings some new data with some documentation that was discovered.
How was your relationship with the writing of Camões born?
I fell in love and went to those young readers who was not tormented with Camões. On the contrary, I liked it soon and let myself be seduced by Camões Lyric. I am from the areas of comparative literature and history, and in this sense I always understood the dimension and importance of the work of Camões.
And what are they?
It is a work and an author of its time and its time, which was extraordinary, with the Renaissance, Humanism and the travels of navigation. But at the same time, it is a work that is the product of an outstanding literary genius, one that we can tell a handful in the history of universal literature.
What camões we find in this biography?
I tried to go to the bottom, remove layers of the meaning that these 500 years were adding to Camões, in the sense that each season read its Camões and produced its interpretation. I wanted to discover the substrate, the man of flesh and bone he lived and wrote 500 years ago.
He was a man suffered, with many financial difficulties.
He was a man with a complex and difficult relationship with reality, not only of his time, but also with reality [itself]. The theme of the time, the disconcerting of the world, how society seems to work instead of what should work, being a literary topic of the Renaissance, it was something Camões felt personal and genuinely.
How?
He lived a series of disagreements, of extreme experiences. Suffice it to say that you have been stuck several times and for various reasons. He made great trips at a time when these were absolutely risky, long, and complicated enterprises. Camões was involved in military expeditions, and almost all his life was soldered. But this set of experiences allowed him to be almost everything that someone could be at the time he lived.
He was one of the most traveled authors of the time, having been in Brazil, Goa…
Yes. Even the connection to Macau, which is contested by some scholars, but not by me… I am persuaded, given the existing documentation and indirect testimonies, which Camões passed through China with the position of Dead and Missing Provider. When this happened, albeit very incipiently, the Portuguese establishment in China, which was already Macao. It is not known whether Camões held this position assigned to him by Viceroy D. Francisco Coutinho, if he was exactly assigned to be a provider during the trip, or a provider at Macao's establishment. But what he knew from China was surely this little warehouse that Portugal had achieved, at a lot of cost, with great difficulty and after many attempts to obtain in China.
What did a deceased provider?
Whenever a Portuguese died in the East, a soldier or merchant, it was necessary to ensure the rights of the heirs, the families who were normally in Portugal. The provider had to identify the deceased, his naturalness, origin and make the heirs known. He also had to keep the deceased's assets before they were stolen, auction them, keep the coins that would result in, and then take it all to Lisbon. It was a process that, if it went well, took many months, because it was necessary to send this money to the authorities of Goa who later sent him in the career from India to Lisbon.
Can we talk about a period of stability in Camões's life in Macau?
Yes. Until this appointment as a deceased provider, everything Camões knew from the East had been as a soldier. As soon as Goa [1553] arrives weeks later in a first military expedition. We know why: Not because I had some war appeal, but because only participating in expeditions earned your welding. Although everyone said that the soldiers lived very poorly, the welding was what Camões had to survive. The time lived in Macao, when he was free from soldier obligations, was a time of tranquility regarding subsistence, which was assured. He had some time and calm to continue the work with "the Lusíadas." More than that, as much as the sources allow to deduce, Camões met in Macau a phase of balance in terms of personal and loving life, as, on the return trip, he brought with him, according to the testimony of Diogo do Couto, a Chinese girl.
Dinamene.
This was the term used by the chronicler. We don't know if it would be a Chinese or Asian girl. This girl with whom Camões lived maritally was someone who liked it very much, according to the testimony of Diogo do Couto. But Dinamene would certainly not be her name, as it was a mythological name that, by the way, Camões used in her lyric, even before she boarded the East. Chinese girls with whom soldiers and merchants in Macao lived amanced were baptized and received a Christian name. Therefore, Dinamene would even have a Christian and Portuguese name. But as we do not know her name, and if we are aware that we use a kind of metaphor, we can call it Dinamene.
She dies later on a trip and makes Camões very shaken.
On Macao's return trip to Goa, probably at the end of his mandate as a provider, Camões suffers the celebrated wreck, in which he loses the personal assets he had ease, including the assets of the deceased that he was guardian, and this will bring him complications. It also suffers the loss of dynamine. The wreck went with some in the seas of China, probably by the mouth of the Mekong River.
Considers unlikely to have lost part of "the Lusíadas."
The first biographers say Camões was saved from this wreck with a board. It is not unreasonable that he managed to save the manuscript of the Lusíadas on this board. But it is also no excluding that Camões knew his poem by heart. The memory of people in the sixteenth century was different. They were very used to keeping things from memory. And we know, because the proof is obtained in the work of Camões, that it had an extraordinary memory. I have a way to prove it, of course, that Camões is one of the rare authors who knew his poem by heart.
Do you think Camões had a lower life to his true talent?
Undoubtedly. According to a too extensive set of concordant testimonies, he dies poor, even in miserable conditions, and according to an eyewitness, without having a blanket with which he covered himself. On the other hand, Camões was known to follow the publication of the Lusíadas, who were commented and read [in the poet's life time]. We have the testimony of Faria de Sousa, one of the first biographers of Camões, which says that when he passed the streets, people stop and pointed. Camões also had a figure that stood out, with a leaked eye and using a pale. By then, I would be quite sick, using crutches. But there is a set of poets, which is very unreliable that they did not know Camões, who never refer to them. There are, on the other hand, other humanists, such as Pedro Magalhães Gândavo, who from the outset praises him as the prince of Portuguese poets.
But the king gives him a tendency for deeds provided and the publication of "The Lusíadas."
This famous tendency, which should not be a big deal, because all ancient biographers say it was derisive, is attributed to him as a kind of military reform, because of the 17 years of service in the East, and not as a reward for the publication of "The Lusíadas." D. Sebastião's mercy letter, which attributes him the title of nobleman knight, had no repercussion in practice, but gave him 15 thousand reais. [The publication of “the Lusíadas”] was an additional argument [for the letter] and not the main argument. This leads us to believe that D. Sebastião will not even have read or heard “the Lusíadas”, will have received indirect information, favorable about the poem.
How did the process of editing “Os Lusíadas” occurred?
It was an event, because both the press and the books that were published a year were a very small amount. In the year in which “the Lusíadas” are published were the only work of non -religious caress [to be edited]. To fund the edition, it is more than likely that Camões had the support of a patron, probably D. Manuel de Portugal, from the Condes do Vimioso family. Getting the work was a press was a mere and complicated process, as it had to go through the prior examination of the civil authorities, the royal authority and the censorship of the Inquisition. The resident of the Holy Office does not only let the book pass, but to make an amount of almost unprecedented compliments in the license that authorizes the publication of the work. If we go to the opinions emitted by the same rear, there is no other work on which he is as compliments as it was with the epic of Camões.
In Indonesia, he befriended a slave on the island of Java.
Camões was, at least once, on the island of Ternate, Indonesia, in the archipelago of molucas, at a time when there were conflicts motivated by an extremely cruel Portuguese captain towards the king or sultan of Ternate, which originated a kind of war between the Portuguese and the places. Camões has a song that describes the island of Ternate. We do not know if it was at this time, or in another passage to the Far East, that Camões turned on to a Jaú, or Javanese, but could not be exactly from the Far East, but a freed slave who had been linked by friendship to Camões. And this is because in one of the first biographies of Camões it reads that Jaú, with the Christian name António, asked for alms at night. This freedom of movements of a slave indicates that he would probably be a freed slave. He asked for alms to Camões, for himself and the mother of Camões, with whom Camões will have lived in recent years of life.</description><pubDate>2025-06-26 23:30:50</pubDate></item><item><title>Filipe de Saavedra, Teacher: “A Camões Interpretative Center in Macau is missing”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/21/filipe-de-saavedra-docente-falta-um-centro-interpretativo-de-camoes-em-macau/</link><description>Professor at the University of Science and Technology of Macao and a scholar of the presence of Camões in Asia, Philip de Saavedra understands that Macau is missing an interpretative center about the poet's life and work. The academic spoke yesterday at the National Library in Lisbon, about the correspondence written by Luís de Camões in Asia
 
He participated yesterday at the “from Lisbon to Goa: What the Letters of Camões” participated. What path does the East arise portrayed in these letters, and who were directed?
The letters Camões wrote from Asia are in the order of the dozens. There is in them scholarship, philosophy, and also a lot of humor, sarcasm, and satire of humanist nature. Some were written from Ternate, others from Malaca, Macau, probably others from Cambodia, to recipients in India and Portugal. With the exception of the letters of Goa, where the identification of the writing site is generally present, maping those that were written during the rest of it would be a complex task. They are only given as written in Asia.
Can you give examples of written letters in this context?
I mention here two of the first he sent to the kingdom. The epistle whose first line is “The Poet Simony speaking” was written in January 1554, when Camões has just arrived in Goa, destined for his pupil, D. António de Noronha. It is a very emotional letter, giving it the storm that had plagued the Armada in the Cape of Good Hope, "seeing the death of the before me." Camões survived this limit experience aboard the São Bento ship, the only one to arrive that year to Goa, and which was lost in the turn of the Christmas lands, dying in this second bid the Captain Fernão de Álvares Cabral, and many of those who traveled with him. In addition to the news of his salvation, the poet was equally eager to tell his friend the expedition of D. Afonso de Noronha to Malabar, in which he had taken part in the previous month. In Irenal pages, Camões vehemently condemns the massacre of the few native troops by the “thick armed” of the disproportionate vice-king army. In his radical compliment of peace, the poet calls "true remedy" to the early death that cure the war crazes of those who want to live "by knights", for "who will walk by following the fero Mars always brings their eyes to their danger." Cruelly prophetic words: by irony of fate, at the moment the poet wrote these lines and sent them, that recipient diletus, for whose life he feared, already lay, lying during a military foray in Ceuta on April 29, 1553, only 17 years old.
And the second letter?
A year later, in January 1555, he wrote to a friend a different epistle in tone and in purpose, whose first line is "I wished so much", where he evoked the shock he suffered from the death of D. António, gathering a sonnet that had composed to his memory. It is clear that Camões also had great intimacy with this correspondent, who knew D. António and the poetry of Camões, Petrarch and Boscán. Interestingly, the letter includes some male lines, which Camões says they are mandatory in private letters, containing what can be called a resort conversation, so being worship or scholar did not prevent it if it were "bon vivant".
The presence of Camões in Macau is still wrapped in a certain myth. What are the concrete tests of your presence in the territory?
It is necessary to separate the waters. The landing of Camões in Patane's busty, then called “cave”, is surrounded by a beautiful legendary aura. But the presence of Camões in Macao, this is not involved in "myth", is a factual and historical reality, founded on a wide variety of testimonies, all independent of each other. Insisting on a chronology that contained in the sources, but which was flagrantly erroneous, it was deliberately sought to confuse the doubts that could have about his permanence in the sinned, although unjustified, with false doubts about the poet's stay in Macau, which are laughable and devoid of the minimum foundation. The joke ran a swimming, and little by little it was embedded in the collective imagination, to the point that some less informed people take it for a supposed “discovery” recent. However, nonsense was released in 1907, and soon dismantled in 1911 by Jordan de Freitas. Judge Eduardo Ribeiro put more “points in the iis” in this regard. In your time I will publish the full documentation about the presence of Camões in Macao, putting a definitive end to the mythical “myth”.
What life did Camões in Macau?
We can say that these two years were those of the greatest professional, economic and affective in his life. Is it written poetry? Constantly, as the dimension of the work attests. A significant part of “the Lusíadas” was composed here, although the poem had neither began nor ended in Macao. Not least in his life was that it was in Macao who publicly assumed a relationship with a young Chinese, most exactly the Tanka ethnicity of poor fishermen. This asymmetrical connection is not surprising and with a modest young woman: only disadvantaged families would not prevent daughters from relate to foreigners. This explains the fact that she left with Camões in 1565 to Goa, with concubine status. But the private vessel in which they followed, belonging to Chinese merchants, suffered a wreck by Cambodia, and Camões lost there the “kind lamp I loved so much”. It was only after his death that he would come to chrisma as Denamene, a Greek nymph of the waters, so that she could live forever in the ocean. The Chinese of Macao have a special relationship with Camões, such as the Portuguese and the Macanese.
How is this relationship?
It existed in the eighteenth century in Macao the first monument in honor of Camões, something that in Portugal only began to think about the following century. He even received an inscription on Chinese, and even a Chinese pavilion was built on his sanctuary. The Viscount of Juromenha says that in 1845 the Viceroy of Canton and Imperial Commissioner Ki-A there was worshiped Camões as the “Portuguese Confucius”. And rightly, Camões shares many aspects of the sages of Chinese tradition: he established a dialogue with the masters through the recreation of larger works, cultivated a millennial tradition (he gloss two thousand years prior to his own time), practiced itinerary as a source of "sagesse", said the primacy of poetry, conceived the rivers as mythical entities, even personifying them, even personifying them, even He showed a marked tendency to moralize, and epitomously his thinking in masterful sentences.
What connection did Camões have with Goa?
Unlike Macao, Goa raised in Camões mostly negative feelings. The first impressions he had, like a lawless land in which only the little turns were worse, could not have been worse, as read in the initial letter to which he alluded: "long land, from all the poor honorable grave." In the second letter, he goes on, "I can say that it is the mother of bad villains, and stepmother of honorable men." These impressions would not improve over time, as corroborated the satire that led to the expulsion to Ternate in 1556. Goa, where he became the deputy protected, to fall later in the greatest disfavor under D. Antão de Noronha, was in his texts the inverted mirror of the Kingdom, the corrupt and corrupt Babylon, theil of God, and the betrayal of God, King and the law. In what is not original, as there are other sources that reinforce this Jeremiac and apocalyptic portrait of the capital of the Portuguese East Empire. Remember Bocage: "From the land to worst you are, O goa." This said, obviously that he will also have lived there sweethearts, especially under the viceroyalty of his protectors, and in living with some companions of the poetic lines that then lived there, and which he evokes in the so-called “feast of trovas”. To one of these cultured spirits, the poet Luís Franco, even a copy of his almost complete works, including the 'self of filodemo' that had composed there, that they could be saved if another adversity survived in the kingdom to the kingdom.

Do you think Portugal should pay more attention to your writings, streamlining your work more? How?
In Lisbon it is necessary to build a great literary museum dedicated to Camões and its creations. The ideal place will be the Convent of St. Bento de Xabregas, where his friend Dom António had a grave at the Pantheon of the Line Chapel. Also in Goa the statue of Camões left for exile in the cruelly called “Archaeological Museum”, which is not the appropriate place to end the poetry or image of a poet. Being the greatest intangible heritage of Macao, Camões has been poorly used in this region. multimedia.
What about Macau? Is Camões studied at higher education?
Two students from the Macao University of Sciences and Technology will now defend their master's theses. The first is an in -depth technical study of the translation of Zhang Weim of the Camões Odes. The second runs through the literary survival of the figure of Dinamene in contemporary Portuguese fiction, and are both excellent, bringing novelty.</description><pubDate>2025-05-21 22:42:45</pubDate></item><item><title>Piménio Ferreira: “Anti-igan rhetoric has always worked in Portugal”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2021/04/26/pimenio-ferreira-a-retorica-anti-cigana-sempre-funcionou-em-portugal/</link><description>Piménio Ferreira, better known as Gitelles Ferreira, anti-racist militant, 34, physical engineer, national Romani. He is a man with a provocative speech, a corrosive, kind mood and a smile that leaves no one indifferent
Gitelles, we live in an intercultural land and the Gypsies - in particular - have lived about five centuries in Portugal. What is going on for Gypsy communities to remain “on the fringes” of the so -called society? 
The model of society remains to be changed. This is extremely stratified by placing people in subordinate places to privilege a violent minority. The white social structure is patriarchal and racist. What is called the "margin" of society is actually an intrinsic place to it, which belongs to it. In other words, Gypsy people have been included in this model of society since they discovered Europe and its kingdoms. The problem is the model of society that is maintained and the place to which they were relegated and how they were relegated: with violence, in inferior status against whites, without the right to human dignity, to constitute a family, to choose one's own language and religion, expropriated from any and all cultural and material law. A place built and maintained to this day by violence and genocidal and ethnicidal persecution. In 1463, a Gitano Vasco was drowned to an estate. In 1521, Gitans, or Gypsies, were already used as a reference for all that is considered bad in the model of society. The "counter-exemple" in the face of the white that would stand out for the positive. The 'angel' and the 'devil'; the 'other', the enemy; That against whom any attack and persecution is legitimate. Including the prohibition of defending, having weapons, any kind of goods, and the right of permanence.
And is this right to permanence that we still have nomadic gypsy communities within the country is denied?
Yes, no doubt. There are many ways to force nomadism: directly, prohibiting permanence and expelling with police or military force; indirectly, refusing public or private housing to Gypsy people, as they are Gypsy; and even through the gentrification process.
I read the result of an inquiry from the European Union Fundamental Rights Agency, which is said to be approximately 80% of the Gypsies responded to the risk threshold of poverty in their country; One in three Gypsies lives in a housing without channeled water; One in three Gypsies belongs to a family where someone hungry at least once the previous month; and 50% of Gypsies aged 6 to 24 do not attend school. Why does this happen like this? 
It is the historical persecution, which continues. There is no impoverishment that has no external cause. In this case, a political system of total expropriation and imposed on the basis of violence. Already in 1648, D John IV, the restorer, prohibited ‘Giving or Rent houses to Gypsies’. The same D John IV who got the kingdom of Portugal thanks to D. Jerónimo da Costa and his 250 knights. The same D. Jerónimo da Costa who had died to defend Portugal's independence from Castile. Gypsy, like his wife and children. Between prohibitions of permanence, “that do not enter Gypsies in the kingdom and leave those who are” (D John III, 1526), with expulsions, degred to the galleys, expropriation of goods and properties, imposed with stripping, mutilation and death, systematically carried out to this day (still in 2011 Faro City Council wanted to ban Gypsies in the municipality).
The prohibition of working on others (no one employs Gypsy workers, and those who accept they do it in total precariousness, for poorly paid positions and without decent rights and conditions). They cannot be dependent on their own work, they cannot get investment means due to extreme expropriation. Are dependent on precariousness. If you want to know what it is like to live in pure neoliberalism, know the lives of Gypsies. Their reality is paradigmatic of the aggression and depletion to which the "gentlemen" are willing to go to their benefit.
What do you talk about is economic and political power?
The group of political, social, cultural and economic power. The owner, the colonizer. This group that has been in power since it established the system of current domination. And that only makes sense within the hierarchically stratified sociopolitical model in which we live. Hence the need to end 'gentlemen' and institute a new model of society, healthy, free, without hierarchies or strata, whether of race, class or gender.
The model we live in leads to the Gypsy (and not only) community to economic exclusion, removing it from access to product consumption or excluding them from its production process; political exclusion associated with lack of access to information; To education and consequently the social exclusion that is seen in inequality of access to quality community areas such as restaurants, libraries, theater, cinema, concerts, health care, etc. How do you feel a gypsy child when you realize that it is not part of a whole? Children who are never represented, neither in movies, nor in books, nor in cartoons, not even in an announcement to eat cereals, for example? Is this a disaster for self-esteem, is a priori condemnation?
The question is that. Gypsy people are not “excluded from society”, by contrast, they are included in it. The problem is the existence of what is cynically called 'social exclusion', which term Orwellian, and there be under coercion, people. Which field of concentration and extermination. Incidentally, Nazi concentration camps are a more visual realization than called 'social exclusion' and, as here, were not a 'excluded' part of Nazi society, but rather its fundamental and characterizing structure. It is a place of violence, where people are maintained by violence, dedicated to their extermination, and designed so that few people can leave. And yet they resist. As in Nazi concentration camps.
And what you have listed as an example of 'consequence' of this 'exclusion', is actually the means by which this exclusion also happens and remains. Gypsy people are out of theaters, both as consumers and producers (but go to the cinema). They are out of school, education and the gym. Either as 'users' or as producers (but go to school and are on the basis of knowledge construction and academic and scientific debates).
Even in attacking Gypsy children's self -confidence, we talk about a maintenance mechanism of this situation. But Gypsy people respond very well: with Gypsy pride. Another resistance, another aggression. Gypsy people are thus included in society. In a place that belongs to this model of modern society. And they resist and contradict the power of domination and make a point of being in the city, in the cinema, in the theater, in the gym, in all spaces. With a lot of struggle and always resisting, but they are there. Social exclusion, more than a “place outside of society”, is part of its social structure.
Do you want to say that there is a collective resistance?
At work, already in a context of absolute precariousness, during the pandemic, Gypsy people rolled up sleeves and showed once again proactivity and creativity in adversity. They learned seeing and doing. And here, it is again the women who jump to the front line, face, learn to use digital tools with their daughters or children, and throw themselves into the network. And so they explore online sales as well as application by application (transportation or rehabs). In housing, in a context of pandemic in which the evictions were not locked - as they owed and dictated the law itself - residents did not fail to organize and fight unjust evictions and claim dignity in housing; associations of allied residents in their action with other housing and anti-racist struggle organizations.
It should also be noted how they reinvented and intensified to raise and distribute dietary goods and kits of masks/alcohol gel to the most expropriated people. Gypsies and non -Gypsies. In the anti-racist struggle, new movements emerged and their actions intensified by social networks. People who had never been organized or militated before began their first steps in activism, thickening this way of the organization and popular gypsy and anti-racist action. People forget, or do not want to value, but Gypsy action has helped determine results in the political dispute. Gypsy citizens mobilized in large and determined electoral results in the municipalities of 2017, both in Alentejo and in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area, even causing electoral earthquakes.
And even in the presidential, second place was resolved by a value equivalent to the estimated number of Gypsy voters. Apart from the non -Gypsy votes that were mobilized by the action of Gypsy voters. Gypsy people are even co-considering power in the spaces of opinion, local media, social networks and party and institutional political dispute. And most importantly, in the popular Ação and alliances with other social movements. We have never stopped fighting for all means and continuing to resist.
In contrast there are more and more hate speeches, from the far right in particular. What do you have to say about it?
To start these speeches are historical and European. Not even current and even less “of the far right”. These speeches have been adopted and rendered for a long time, even in 'democracy and freedom', by several representatives of the center right, conservatives, left center, liberal, liberal left, even representatives of the PCP. Anti-egana rhetoric has always worked in Portugal as it is the whiter rhetoric [white genesis]. That is, it allows you to create and give the "white" as the superior of all. And so please the white electorate who, when feeling well, pays off with his vote. Even if the policies implemented by their elected harm him even more.
Finally, did you like them to talk a little about your personal experience and how did you get to the activist?
I studied, fought for studies, made alliances, graduated, went in the labor market of the “formal precariousness”. I started my militant action and here I am today. We can transform this society a better. This certainty combined with the fact that the current one has so much suffering makes anyone want to have a transformist attitude. I wanted to be 'inventor' (physical engineer) and anti -racist militant. And through study (not necessarily schooling) and organization with others, in turn, with other studies, formations and visions, I learned how the world works and how it can be changed. But before transforming, we need to survive.
Hence two types of actions arise: transformative and survival. The struggle against hate discourse arises as survival, but his defeat will be a transformative victory. There is a lot that - like people who want a better world - we have to do, namely working to criminalize hatred speech; condemn and prohibit organizations with racist discourses and practices; denounce the racist institutional structure and logics that organize power and generate community resources. And in this sense, there have been various types of actions, of petitions, to manifestations. And we need more.
I, besides being a military man in the SOS Racism movement, participate in the “We came to stay” podcast, with Mamadou BA and Joseph da Silva. And if all goes well, we will soon start a new project. With friendly people, we also have the project “Gypsy Initiative”, dedicated to reflecting and promoting transformative movements. Essentially focused on educating against anti-agigarism, denouncing historical and continued genocide and working for a new society project. Also with new projects on the gutter. And finally, there are always voluntary actions without an organization, where I try to share what I found out about anti-egism and Roman history in schools and with interested people. In addition, there is still the struggle for housing, because the evictions did not stop during the pandemic. Due to housing and work precariousness, the subjects racialized especially the Roma nationals are the most vulnerable to COVID-19. There is essential to have actions in this area; Of all the struggles, this is the most structural, as it goes against one of the main enemies of a healthy society: the real estate speculation of this capitalist system, which places profit and goods above people and their humanization.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Great Bay Race learned more pilots for the GP</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/11/corrida-da-grande-baia-apurou-mais-pilotos-para-o-gp/</link><description>The GT Cup Races - Great Bay Race, integrated at the 72nd edition of the Macao Grand Prix, ended with a double journey at the Pingtan Speed Festival last weekend of June. Of the twenty -eight vacancies assigned by the first two GT Cup races, only one Macao pilot got a direct entrance at the great sports event of November.
Following the success of the two races played under the China Formula 1 Grand Prix, both 30 -minute races of the GT4 Chinese Championship had a total of 21 participants at the event held at the International Circuit of Lago Ruyi in Pingtan. This picturesque track, located in Fujian province, replaced the Zhuhai International Circuit, initially included in the provisional calendar released in January, but did not confirm the holding of his event.
In Pingtan's semiurban layout, Chinese pilot Han Lichao won both races behind his Toyota GR Supra GT4 EVO2. In two very lively races, Kevin Leong Ian Veng (BMW M4 GT4) was the only Macau pilot scoring, having reached a sixth and eighth place, respectively.
Although only one Pilot of the Misrem has guaranteed the direct determination, it is possible that more riders in the territory will align on the GT - Great Bay Race, integrated in the Macao Grand Prix. This is because only 21 pilots scored in these four races, which means that even if all these pilots are signed up for the guide circuit race, seven vacancies will still be filled.
In addition to Kevin Leong, seven other pilots from Macau - Miguel Law, Wong Cheng Tou, Fok Wai Ming, Lao Kim Hou, IP Un Hous, Wong Wai Hong and Law Kit Meng - participated in at least one of the two qualification events and may be repaired for local test if the sports committee's sports committee of the Macau Grand Prix so.
Among the riders are some known names of the region's motorsport, such as Darryl O'Young, double winner of the Macau GT Cup; Chen Weian, 12 -hour separate winner; Liu Kaishun, Chinese F4 runner-up; Daniel Lu, former Champion of the Porsche Carrera Asia Cup; or Luo Kailuo, winner of the GT Cup - Great Bay Race at Macao's 70th Grand Prix.
It's not over yet
This debut season, Sro GT Cup still has two more pointed events, the last, naturally, played in the iconic Guide Circuit. The competition, which has the support of the Macao General Automobile Association - China (AAMC), has reached its intermediate point, and the struggle for the title is in the red. Prior to the mandatory visit to Macau, from 17 to 19 October, the GT4 category cars will compete at the first event held on the streets of Yizhuang, in Beijing.
Beijing's City Circuit is one of the most anticipated auto events in the Popular Republic of China and represents an excellent opportunity for Macao GT4 riders - and not only to prepare for the big challenge that are the curves and countercourse of the territory layout.</description><pubDate>2025-07-11 00:45:06</pubDate></item><item><title>TCR China | André Couto participated in the Zhejiang race</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/01/tcr-china-andre-couto-participou-na-prova-de-zhejiang/</link><description>Over the weekend, André Couto had an unexpected return to the TCR China Championship, in what was his first race of this season. The rider of the sgas showed that "who knows, never forgets", despite having had a troubled passage through the Zhejiang International Circuit
The Portuguese pilot residing in Macao, who has not competed since November last year-when he played the World Lamborghini Super Trofeo World Finals, having won the title in the Lamborghini Super Trofeo Asia Pro-AM category-received a last-minute invitation from MacPro Racing Team to conduct one of the Honda Civic Fl5 TCR Team in the third race of the Chinese Championship. TCR.
Without any prior training, André Couto came back to sit in a car he already knew, also with a technical structure that was familiar to him. By 2023, the territory pilot had already played some TCR China events with this set, then at the service of the official team Dongfeng Honda Racing Team, showing a progress right from the beginning.
"Free training did not go wrong, but in qualification a less attentive pilot hit me on my first departure lap to the track. He hit me from behind and did not realize why. Damaged me the rear, dislocated the convergence and the car was crooked. Hm. "Still, I qualified myself in fourth in Q1, five tenths of the first, which, with the car in the conditions it was, was not bad. The car had potential."
In Q2, due to the damage, the Japanese car “became much harder to guide” and Couto ended in tenth. However, this ended up having a positive effect: “With the reversal of the starting grid, the tenth place of Q2 allowed me to start first to the second race.”
The first race, played on Saturday on the shaoxing track, did not go as well as the pilot wanted, not being able to follow the official links, nor the best Honda and Hyundai. "I ended up eighth. The car was not as good as expected and we found that there was a damaged damper, still from the crash in the qualification, which was exchanged for the Sunday race."
Inglorius Sunday
In the 20 Sunday round race, André Couto had everything to shine as he departed from pole-position and Honda finally seemed in a position to fight for the first places. "On the way back, the car was good. I didn't feel strange anymore and I was optimistic."
The idea was to get well to distance themselves from the fastest competitors in the first laps and then manage the race with new tires. However, it all faded quickly when it was wrapped by Wu Yi Fan right in the brake for the first curve.
“That was my mission, but I couldn't,” acknowledged the winner of the 2000 Macao Grand Prix. “He hit me on the first curve and the car was damaged. Sports commissioners, but that does not change the fact that I have given up. ”
With Honda's damaged direction, André Couto had no choice but to leave. "I was a bit disappointed because I hope to get a good result for MacPro Racing Team that had given me a good car.</description><pubDate>2025-07-01 00:26:00</pubDate></item><item><title>GP | FIA has already defined what the F4 World Cup will be like</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/25/gp-fia-ja-definiu-como-sera-a-taca-do-mundo-de-f4/</link><description>The Macao Grand Prix hosts the first edition of the FIA Formula 4 World Cup, between November 13 and 16 this year. The International Automobile Federation has published the Sports Regulation, which reveals some details about what will be the latest cup in the world integrated into the Macau 72nd Grand Program Program
 
Registration for the Formula 4 Macao Race - Formula 4 World Cup of the International Automobile Federation (FIA) is open until July 30, and FIA is the selection of the pilots who will participate. FIA responsible will have been pre-selected by the best Formula 4 national championship riders, also encouraging all the pilots interested in directly contacting the FIA and providing details of their sports history to be considered.
The final list of twenty pilots will be confirmed through an official invitation letter, taking into account the current classification of the pilots in the respective championships. The final selection should only be made public in mid -October, as is tradition in the guide circuit test.
At a time when behind the scenes, it is spoken of the possibility of increasing the minimum age of formula 4 to 16 years, the sports regulation stipulates that all pilots must be at least 15 years old, and the birthday is binding. An inscribed pilot may not have participated in more than two races of a championship with any type of monolugar that has been conceived and/or built to achieve a power-to-weight ratio of less than 3.0 kg/hp, which prevents participation in this riders running regional formula seasons or Formula 3.
The sports regulation does not specify technical details, but in previous communications, the FIA had already confirmed that Mintimes - organizer of the F4 Chinese Championship - will be the “unique operator” of the race, together with FFSA (Fédération Française Du Sport Automobile (FFSA), responsible for the world's cup technical support. In practice, all competitors will use Mygale M21-F4 singlesules, recently re-baptized as Ligier JS F422.
These formulas, equipped with 1.3 -liter Turbo Renault engines, will be rented to teams from the interior of China and operated by a single technical team - the same that organizes the French F4 Championship. Pirelli will be the exclusive tire supplier, as is the case with the Macao Grand Prix of Regional Formula and the FIA GT World Cup.
Although the official time of the event has not yet been released, it is known that the World Cup will feature a qualification race played over 8 laps, or at most 60 minutes, most likely on Saturday. The main race will be held on Sunday, with 10 laps or, equally, a maximum of 60 minutes. Prior to that, a 40 -minute free training session will take place, followed by a qualification session with the same duration.
PATACA AND POINTS
About 350,000 patacas in monetary awards will be distributed to the competitors present in this first cup of the world, with the winner of the main race to raise eight thousand US dollars. As a curiosity, all participants will receive three hundred dollars of participation-the same value attributed to the pole-position of Saturday's qualification race and the rider who reaches the highest tip speed during the event.
More important than the monetary awards, the FIA Formula 4 World Cup winner on the streets of Macau will win two points for the super license - points that may be decisive to access the restricted Formula 1 world. The winner will also be forced to attend the FIA awards ceremony, which will take place on December 12 in Tashkentão, USBekistan.</description><pubDate>2025-07-25 05:01:08</pubDate></item><item><title>Lamborghini | Charles Leong returns to the Academy of Young Pilots</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/20/lamborghini-charles-leong-regressa-a-academia-de-jovens-pilotos/</link><description>The Lamborghini Squadra Corso, the Automobili Lamborghini competition division, will give Macau pilot a new opportunity for Macao Charles Leong Hon Chio, who was again selected to join the Italian -brand prestigious youth academy, the “Young Driver Program”
 
Charles Leong, who participates for the second year in a row in the Lamborghini Super Trofeo Asia, by SJM team Theodore Racing, currently leads the Pro category, with four wins in six races already played. This weekend, the territory pilot travels to South Korea to compete in the fourth race of the Sant'Agata Bolognese builder's Asian competition season, a small locality in the Emilia-Romanha region in northern Italy, between Modena and Bologna.
In a statement, the transalpina brand made known that, in all, selodes were pre-selected pilots of the various Super Trofeo championships and five of the various international GT3 championships, including Portuguese Rodrigo Testa, for the annual Lamborghini Squadra Corso program, which focuses on both track and outside performance. The twenty -one pilots will be accompanied and evaluated throughout the season, with specific analysis of their progression, consistency, experience, professionalism and ability to provide technical feedback. In addition, five additional pilots are part of Lamborghini's young professional pilots, receiving direct support from the factory in Sant'Agata Bolognese and Scola Federale ACI Sport, an entity managed by the Italian Federation.
The big news for the 2025 edition of the Young Driver Program is the selection process: it failed to settle only in age criteria, focusing on the most impressive pilots of the first two rounds of the year, based on a classification coefficient covering the three continental championships. The pilots were evaluated by Scoola Federale ACI-Sport chief instructor Niki Cadei, in collaboration with YDP consultants and official Lamborghini drivers Andrea Caldarelli (North America), who has already competed at the Macao Grand Prix, and Marco Mapelli (Europe and Asia), taking into account several performance indicators.
The results of qualification training and racing are thoroughly analyzed, such as track conduct, the pilot's post-end reports and the technical feedback provided to engineers and Squadra corse's technical team. The average score determines the final list of pilots selected for the decisive phase. A group of these young pilots will participate in a dedicated training camp at Lamborghini headquarters in Sant'Agata Bolognese, as well as at the final selection session in Misano. The best of the session will then receive support from Lamborghini Squadra Corso for the 2026 season.
Future is played in Italy
Among Super Trofeo Junior pilots, ten compete in the European series, while the rest come from the American and Asian championships. In addition to Macao's 24 -year -old pilot in Asian representation, Lamborghini also chose Singapore's Ethan Brown and Ireland's Alex Denning, which this year shares the steering wheel with Charles Leong to join this program.
Charles Leong will be evaluated throughout the season, and the final selection - whether or not to integrate Lamborghini's youth professional riders program - will be made in November at the Italian circuit of Misano, after the traditional closing of the Season of the various Super Trofeo, during the Lamborghini world endings. It is recalled that the winner of the Macao Formula 4 Grand Prix in 2020 and 2021 was part of this program last year, but was not selected. At the time, the final assessment took place at the Jerez circuit in Spain - an unknown layout, unlike his opponents.</description><pubDate>2025-07-20 15:23:35</pubDate></item><item><title>GP | FIA AFINA REGIONAL Formula Rules</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/23/gp-fia-afina-regras-da-formula-regional/</link><description>The International Automobile Federation (FIA) took advantage of the Macao Extraordinary Assemblies in Macao and its annual conference to publish the Macao Grand Prix Regulation - FIA Regional Formula Cup of 2025. There are not many changes compared to 2024, but the introduced changes aim to browse gaps from the first edition of this macau.
The twelve red flags during last year's qualification session called for the level of pilots at the Guide Circuit, which was the premiere of the FIA regional formula in Macau regional formula. This happened after the controversial decision of the FIA to consider that Formula 3 was no longer adequate to the Macao Citadino layout.
Unsurprisingly, the sports regulation is now clear that, to compete in the FIA regional formula world, “all pilots must have participated at least 3 competitions with a monolugar that has been projected and/or built to achieve a weight/power ratio of more than 3.0 kg/hp.”
Emanuele Pirro, a former F1 pilot, winner of the Guide Race and president of the FIA monoligai committee, said during the weekend of the 71st edition that, in the future, the FIA will be more demanding about track discipline. Thus, from now on, “any pilot who, in the opinion of sports commissioners, is solely responsible for the display of a red flag during the qualification training session, will not be able to continue to participate in this session and its best time back can be annulled.” The new regulation also states that “if a qualification training session is interrupted with less than four minutes remaining, it will not be restarted.”
On the other hand, the FIA maintains the limit in the participation of more experienced pilots, except only “pilots who participated in a maximum of 3 FI F2 Championship competitions of 2025.” This measure goes a little against the spirit and history of the Great Prize, which has always gathered pilots from higher categories in its main race. In fact, this was a fervent question between Macao and the International Federation on two previous occasions.
In 1985, Alfredo César Torres, then responsible for Portuguese motorsport, convinced Jean-Marie Balestre, against his will, to allow the participation of F1 pilots in the F3 Intercontinental Cup in the name of the economic viability of the race. In 2016, the controversy returned with the veto da FIA to the participation of Nelsinho Piquet, a decision badly received by the teams and then coordinator Barry Bland, which would eventually abandon the co-organization of the race a year later.
Bet on continuity
In sports terms, registrations for this second edition of the FIA regional formula Cup will remain open until July 30. The grill may include a maximum of 27 Tatuus regional formula monologues, all equipped with Alfa Romeo engines built by the Italian Autotechnic. Pirelli will once again be the official tire supplier.
The identities of the invited teams have not yet been revealed, but some news is expected in this field compared to 2024. To avoid any behind -the -scenes disputes, it has already been defined that “the position on the boxes for the teams that participate in the Macao Grand Prix will be based on the ranking of the previous year” and, in turn, “the position in the roadway for new teams will be attributed based on the order of application.”
Equal awards and more restricted advertising
The values of monetary awards remain unchanged this year, with a total of US $ 68,500 to distribute, the equivalent of just over 550,000 patacas at the current exchange rate. The race winner will receive $ 12,000, an amount that is still far from covering the costs of participation in this nature.
On the other hand, the sports regulation introduces two new prohibitions on advertising into the monoligales. In addition to the existing prohibition of advertising to fortune or bad luck, tobacco or pornography, also the promotion of electronic cigarettes and alcoholic beverages - a measure that follows the legislation in force in the territory.
The 72nd Macao Grand Prix, the largest international sports event of the MSA, will take place between November 13 and 16, 2025.</description><pubDate>2025-06-23 03:31:16</pubDate></item><item><title>FIA | Conference helped perceive future of motorsport</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/13/fia-conferencia-ajudou-a-perceber-futuro-do-automobilismo/</link><description>For the first time in its history, in 2025, Macau welcomed the Extraordinary General Assemblies and Conference of the International Automobile Federation (FIA). Organized in partnership with the Macau-China General Association (AAMC), the FIA-affiliated sports territory, and Galaxy Entertainment Group, this event brought together more than five dozen FIA senior delegates from 147 countries in the field.
 
In the Galaxy International Convention Center, to this day, the future of motoring and mobility worldwide is discussed. However, some details about the future of sport in the territory have already been revealed between the lines. Focused on obtaining information about the growth of motorsport and promoting safe, sustainable and accessible mobility to everyone in the Asia Pacific region, the FIA conference opening session highlighted the importance of communication and collaboration, as well as the region's ability to innovate and create solutions that respond to specific questions it faces.
Roberto Carlos Osório, president of the Macau-China General Automotive Association (AAMC), said the association has a strong tradition in motor racing and that following FIA's guidelines is being able to grow rapidly competition at the base level in the region.
“We organized the first GT Macau Cup in 2008,” said the AAMC leader. "Currently, we also have the GT Cup - Great Bay Race for GT4 cars. In addition, in 2008, we created Road Sport Challenge," he explained. “And today, in 2025, we are proud to announce that we have 68 tourism cars in the region to compete in the qualification race to enter the 72nd Macao Grand Prix.”
In a year when AAMC celebrates 30 years of existence - was born as Macao Automobile Club - we also learned that the association's bet for the future will be in the basic disciplines of motor sport. Roberto Carlos Osorio also revealed a curious fact: Macau has 135 pilots with sports license from the territory.
“This growth was achieved following FIA's guidelines to promote grassroots motorsport and create accessible races for riders in the region,” added the manager of the territory. “With the interest of pilots, teams and promoters in developing state-of-the-art activities in Macau, we will focus even more on base competitions and affordable races, not only to support tourism, but also to make Macau in a Karting international center of international events, where champions can be selected for F4 and, later, for regional formula.”
Confirmed GP program
The Macao Grand Prix Organizing Committee (COGPM) held a press conference on June 8 at the Macao Grand Prix Museum to confirm the 72nd Macao Grand Program races, which will take place from November 13 to 16 this year.
As last year, there will be seven races in total, respectively, the Macao Grand Prix - FR da Fia World Cup, the GT Macao Cup - FIA GT World Cup, the Macao Guide Race - Kumho Fia TCR World Tour Event of Macau, the Formula 4 Formula 4 World Cup, the 57th Macao Motor Motor Prize, GT Cup - Great Bay Race (GT4) and Macao Roadsport Challenge. For the first time, the guide circuit receives four different cups under the FIA seal on the same weekend.
Other news
Between meetings and communications, other information was revealed about the November edition of the Macao Grand Prix. The FIA World Council approved in Macao that the winner of the first Formula 4 World Cup of the FIA will receive two points for the super license. We have also noticed that Pirelli will equip all the monologes that participate in both the FIA Formula 4 World Cup and the FIA regional formula World Formula Cup. In turn, the supply of tires and fuel to the FIA GT World Cup remains in the contest phase.
Registration for the Formula 4 World Cup will be open until July 30. The final selection of 20 pilots will be confirmed by the FIA through an official invitation letter, taking into account the current classification of the pilots in the respective championships.
In the case of the FIA Regional Formula World Cup, registrations will also remain open until July 30, and the grill will be able to host a maximum of 27 Tatuus regional formula -equipped with alpha Romeo engines built by the autotechnic. As with Formula 4, participation will be by invitation, with priority assigned to pilots who have reached the best positions in the five regional formula championships of 2025.</description><pubDate>2025-06-13 18:43:57</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
