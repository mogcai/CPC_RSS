These restrictions “will remain in force, but only as long as the United States does not exceed the limits stipulated” in the treaty, Lavrov said in an intervention made yesterday in the Russian parliament.
Moscow “will act in a responsible and considered manner, based on an analysis of US military policy (…) and an analysis of the general strategic situation”, he added.
Russia and the United States have by far the largest nuclear arsenals in the world, but since the New START Treaty expired earlier this month, there is no nuclear disarmament agreement linking the two powers.
The treaty, signed in 2010 between Russia and the United States, limited the number of nuclear missile launchers to intercontinental distances. It expired on February 5th, as US President Donald Trump did not respond to Moscow's proposal to extend it.</description><pubDate>2026-02-12 03:23:48</pubDate></item><item><title>HZM Border | Concession yields 1.2 million per month</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/12/fronteira-hzm-concessao-rende-12-milhoes-por-mes/</link><description>Sociedade Express Grupo Limitada will pay 1.2 million patacas monthly to the Macao SAR to operate the commercial areas of the Macau Border Post Building on the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge (HZM).

After “Private Reasons”, released in 2021 and which ends a trilogy, Bruno Pernadas presents “a transition album”. “I'm still not being able to achieve what I wanted, but this is a necessary step for that to happen in the future”, he stated, in an interview with the Lusa agency, regarding “unlike, maybe”, to be published this Friday.
The process of creating the album served the musician to try to “detach from certain things that can be considered vices of resources and tools”, something that “is not such an immediate process”, as it is within himself.
The recordings were divided between Lisbon, where the musician lives, and Porto. In the ‘invicta city’, the musicians spent a few days in the same house “and this process was collaborative”. "More has already happened [on this album], but I want that to happen, in the future, that's all. There doesn't even need to be demos. Sometimes I don't have demos, I put everything on the agenda", he stated.
Other languages
The collaborative process allowed Bruno Pernadas to get closer to the language that for him “is closer to jazz, an idea that was left by the trends of Sun Ra, Don Cherry, Alice Coltrane, Art Ensemble of Chicago, The Last Poets – which is not quite jazz, but it is close”.
"I wanted to get closer to that language, with which I have a lot of relationship and which didn't happen on other albums. Even on my jazz album 'worst summer ever' [from 2016 and which opened the trilogy] this way of thinking like that wasn't realized. On this album ['unlike, maybe'] it already partially exists", he said.
The new album features the participation of musicians Margarida Campelo, António Quintino, João Correia, Diogo Alexandre, José Soares, Teresa Costa, Jéssica Pina and Eduardo Lála. Margarida Campelo also sings, and her voice is joined by those of guests Leonor Arnaut, Lívia Nestrovski and Maya Blandy.
Some are already part of the group that accompanied him in previous works, for others it was a debut. "It's like a cast. In cinema there are many directors who have a fixed cast, but sometimes another type of approach to the artistic object is needed and they form collaborations", he said.
In addition to playing, Bruno Pernadas is the composer, author and producer of “unlike, maybe”, sharing only one of the lyrics with Rita Westwood.
When he goes to the studio with the musicians, “things are more or less thought out”. "There are sections that I leave open for improvisations, thinking about the musicians who are going to record. I already know how people react and there are certain things that are done with that person in mind. There are other melodies and things that I do for the people that I invite to participate in certain songs", he shared.
In addition to studio recordings, Bruno Pernadas also incorporates recordings made at home, during the day and without acoustic isolation, into his albums.
"I always record things at home. At first I re-recorded, but then I stopped doing that, the sounds aren't bad, it's a clinical, surgical perspective of people listening to the music. It's not bad, that's how it turned out", he said.</description><pubDate>2026-02-12 03:19:38</pubDate></item><item><title>Light Rail | Correspondence with buses later this year</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/12/metro-ligeiro-correspondencia-com-autocarros-ainda-este-ano/</link><description>Anyone who takes a public bus after leaving the Light Metro will have a discount on the fare, similar to what happens with buses. The measure will be implemented later this year. Rail transport will also have turnstiles and electronic payments
This year, the Directorate of Services for Traffic Affairs (DSAT) will implement fare matching between the Light Metro and public buses, allowing you to pay a discounted ticket for the second transport between the Light Metro and the bus, or vice versa.
The measure should start this year, confirmed yesterday the deputy director of DSAT, Mok Soi Tou, to the microphones of Forum Macau, on the Chinese channel of Radio Macau.
The issue of correspondence was raised by a listener and the head of DSAT said that the correspondence will be carried out taking advantage of two moments. “We will take advantage of the opportunities to update access machines (turnstiles) to the Light Metro and the renewal of public bus concession contracts, to start correspondence this year”, said Mok Soi Tou.
The official added that bus routes will be adjusted as more Light Rail stations are opened, and that bus stops and pedestrian facilities will be improved and provided with information on transport correspondence.
Open doors
The head of DSAT highlighted that since the creation of the Light Metro, bus routes have always been adapted as new stations open. The opening of the metro station at Portas do Cerco will lead to many changes to the bus routes that serve the busiest point for people in the territory. The deputy director expects that the majority of tourists entering Macau will use the Light Metro to get to Cotai.
For his part, the director of the Macau Light Rail Society, Ng Keng Chung, said that the installation of turnstiles is scheduled for the third quarter of this year, allowing payment platforms to be used via QR code, similar to what happens on buses. MPay, Alipay and WeChat Pay applications will be accepted.
The replacement of turnstiles will not be done all at once, and Light Metro stations will now have automatic ticket machines that accept electronic payments.
DSOP director Lam Wai Hou did not rule out the possibility of the Light Metro network having more than six lines and maintained the forecast that the Eastern Line would be opened in 2029.</description><pubDate>2026-02-12 02:54:45</pubDate></item><item><title>BNU | Profits shrink by about a quarter by 2025</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/12/bnu-lucros-encolhem-cerca-de-um-quarto-em-2025/</link><description>The profits of the bank owned by Caixa Geral de Depósitos have been falling for two years, but remain positive. Last year, BNU managed to reduce losses related to non-performing loans
Banco Nacional Ultramarino (BNU) in Macau yesterday announced a 26.3 percent drop in net profits in 2025, the second consecutive year in which the financial institution's revenues shrank. According to a statement, the bank recorded unaudited net profits of 431.2 million patacas, 153.9 million patacas less than in 2024.
BNU had already recorded a 0.4 percent drop in revenue in 2024. The bank pointed out as the main reason for the drop in profits a reduction of 13.9 percent (138 million patacas) in the net financial margin, the difference between income from loans and interest paid on deposits.
BNU indicated that the net financial margin shrank, “driven mainly by the evolution of interest rates”. This is after the Macau Monetary Authority approved three cuts in the main reference interest rate in 2025, the last of which was a cut of 0.25 percentage points, introduced on December 11, following in all cases the North American Federal Reserve.
The reduction in net financial margin “was partially offset” by a 2.3 percent increase in commissions charged by the bank, “reflecting greater customer engagement”.
Malparado weighed
BNU also indicated that it suffered losses of 30 million patacas with non-performing loans and financial investments, 15.3 percent less than in 2024.
“This reduction reflects prudent risk management and the stable quality of the bank's assets, supported by conservative credit practices and a robust provisioning margin maintained throughout the year”, guaranteed the institution.
“BNU’s capital and liquidity position remains strong, supported by disciplined financial management and a robust risk control system”, indicated the bank.
BNU is headquartered in Macau and belongs to the Caixa Geral de Depósitos Group (CGD), being, together with the Bank of China, a currency issuer in Macau. According to official data, Macau banks achieved profits of 7.34 billion patacas in 2025, almost double that recorded in the previous year (92.7 percent more). Non-performing loans fell 11.6 percent over the past year to 49.7 billion patacas. It was the first annual drop in non-performing loans since 2013.
Overdue loans represented 4.9 percent of Macau banks' loans, 0.6 percentage points less than at the end of 2024. A percentage that rises to 5.6 percent in the case of credit to institutions or individuals outside the region.
The European Banking Authority, the EU regulatory agency, for example, considers that banks with at least 5 percent of non-performing loans have “high exposure” to risk and must establish a strategy to resolve the problem.
Even so, the percentage of overdue bank credit in Macau is far from the record of 25.3 percent reached in mid-2001, in the midst of the global economic crisis caused by the bursting of the speculative bubble of companies linked to the Internet.</description><pubDate>2026-02-12 02:48:57</pubDate></item><item><title>Casinos | Taxes charged increase 15% in January</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/12/casinos-impostos-cobrados-aumentam-15-em-janeiro/</link><description>The gaming sector represented 85.6 percent of taxes collected in January, with a total of MOP8.2 billion. Tax revenues from the territory's main industry increased by 14.6 percent compared to January 2025, when they did not reach 7.2 billion patacas
Last January, the Government recorded 9.62 billion patacas in current revenue, 14.5 percent more than in January 2025. Of total current revenue, the portion corresponding to taxes on gaming concessionaires was more than 8.2 billion patacas, which represents 85.6 percent of all current revenue, according to data published on the Finance Services Directorate's website.
In comparative terms, tax revenue generated by casinos in January increased by 14.6 percent, compared to the same month in 2025, when they reached almost 7.2 billion patacas, a difference of more than 1,000 million patacas.
It is recalled that according to the new gaming concessions, which came into force for a decade on January 1, 2023, the tax on casinos' gross revenues was set at 40 percent.
When counting capital revenues (sale of facilities and equipment, financial assets, sale of shares and other holdings), total revenues from public coffers in January recorded almost 9.64 billion patacas.
The other side
Representing almost all public revenue, revenue from the gaming sector is crucial to the Macao SAR Budget. For now, the Government estimates that 2026 will end with gross revenues from the territory's casinos of around 236 billion patacas, which will give around 19.7 billion patacas per month. To achieve this goal, January has already exceeded the estimated monthly average of around 2.93 billion patacas, when the sector's gross revenues registered more than 22.63 billion patacas, 24 percent more compared to January 2025.
If a positive performance during the Chinese New Year holidays is confirmed, casino gross revenues could record an annual increase of around 18 percent in the first quarter of the year.
In terms of expenses, January data from the DSF reveals that personnel expenses were around 1.19 billion patacas, 0.17 percent less compared to January 2025. In relation to public expenses to pay transfers, support and allowances, around 2.8 billion patacas came out of public coffers in January, 0.35 percent more in annual terms.
Overall, January ended with revenues almost doubling expenses, with the balance for last month's financial year in positive territory at almost 5 billion patacas.</description><pubDate>2026-02-12 02:43:58</pubDate></item><item><title>One Country, Two Systems | Sam wants Macanese to tell history “well”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/12/um-pais-dois-sistemas-sam-quer-que-macaenses-contem-bem-historia/</link><description>The Government leader indicates that the community has a role to play in the integration of Macau into Mainland China and highlighted the value of the community in connecting China and abroad
The Chief Executive wants the Macanese community to work with the Government to “guarantee the good safeguard and development” of Macau and “tell well” the story of “the successful implementation of ‘One Country, Two Systems’ in China and abroad”.

However, the tasks don't stop there. The leader of the Executive also wants Macanese to move “proactively in the Cooperation Zone in Hengqin and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area” and to “actively” participate in the construction of these projects.
Sam Hou Fai also highlighted that the Macanese have a place in the integration of Macau within Mainland China and that the community “fully plays out its unique advantages in language, culture, gastronomy, professionalism and interconnection with the world, helping the Macao SAR to create a relevant connection ‘door’ for the country in high-quality openness to the outside world and a privileged ‘window’ for exchange and mutual learning between Chinese and Western civilizations”.

Days after the conviction in Hong Kong of Jimmy Lai, a media entrepreneur who founded the now-defunct Apple Daily newspaper, China launches a new White Paper focused on the need to safeguard national security in neighboring territory. The “Practice of Safeguarding National Security in Hong Kong under ‘One Country, Two Systems'” was published by the Communication Department of China's State Council on Tuesday.
According to the Xinhua news agency, this White Paper consists of five parts, detailing “the persistent struggle to safeguard national security in Hong Kong and the fundamental responsibility of the Central Government in national security matters related to Hong Kong”.
Na mesma nota, é explicado que o Livro Branco “expõe as conquistas da RAEHK no cumprimento da responsabilidade constitucional de salvaguardar a segurança nacional” e ainda “a transição de Hong Kong do caos para a estabilidade e prosperidade”. 
“Efforts to create [a security landscape] of high standard are not forgotten in order to promote the high-quality development of the ‘One Country, Two Systems' policy”, in addition to being explained that “the Central Government applied a holistic approach to national security”.
In this context, “it effectively exercised general jurisdiction over the HKSAR, in accordance with the country's Constitution and the Basic Law of the HKSAR”, and the Law on Safeguarding National Security “has been applied in the region” and has ensured “that Hong Kong is administered by patriots”.
On the Macao SAR side, the government apparatus reacted positively to this White Paper, after the bill that presents a new format and composition of the Macao SAR State Security Defense Commission, created in 2018, was generally approved in the Legislative Assembly.
Chan Tsz King, Secretary for Security, was one of the political figures who reacted to the document, which considers “ensuring the stable and lasting implementation” of the “One Country, Two Systems” principle.
Quoted in an official note, the secretary understands that the White Paper comes to “clarify the intrinsic unity between political principles and institutional logic, causing Hong Kong society to return to normality and order to be restored”.
The document, in the secretary's view, “serves as an important reference for the Macao SAR to review and improve the construction of its legal system in the context of defending the security of the State and the respective execution mechanism”.
Chan Tsz King highlights that his leadership will give “great importance to ensuring security in non-traditional areas under the new situation, establishing the long-term stability of the Macao SAR as a strategic objective”.
Firme como uma rocha 
Also according to Xinhua, the White Paper describes how Beijing “supports the HKSAR in fulfilling its constitutional responsibility to safeguard national security by effectively preventing, interrupting and punishing any activities that put national security at risk”.
“The efforts” of the neighboring region to safeguard national security aim, according to the same document, to “sustain and develop” the principle created by Beijing to support Taiwan and the two special administrative regions, without forgetting the protection of “fundamental human rights, dignity and well-being of the 7.5 million residents of Hong Kong”.
The White Paper released by the State Council also states that “in today's world, and with unprecedented global transformations that have occurred in a century, they are accelerating, with the development environment facing China undergoing profound and complex changes”. In this way, “safeguarding national security is a long-term and permanent task”, it is said.
The White Paper states that Hong Kong “enjoys a high standard of security”, with the region “fated to overcome all risks and challenges in the future journey, remaining as stable as a rock in a turbulent world”.
Another political figure from the Macao SAR who reacted was Adriano Marques Ho, director-general of the Customs Service, saying that the White Paper “has an important guiding significance and a profound impact for the complete and accurate implementation of ‘One Country, Two Systems’ in the Hong Kong and Macau regions, for the realization of long-term prosperity and stability, and for their stable and sustainable progression”.
Adriano Marques Ho added that “both Hong Kong and Macau are inalienable and sacred parts of China”, and Beijing “has firmly and consistently maintained national sovereignty, security and development interests”.
In the view of the top Customs official, “the external hostile forces and anti-China elements disturbing Hong Kong incited and created the ‘legislative review riots’, which ended up evolving into a ‘color revolution’ version of Hong Kong, seriously damaging the constitutional order and the rule of law in Hong Kong, and putting national sovereignty, security and development interests at risk”.
End of the “chaotic situation”
Lam, Secretary for Social Affairs and Culture, said the White Paper “comprehensively analyzes and outlines Hong Kong's journey in defending national security, major achievements and experience gained”.
In the government's view, “Hong Kong went from a chaotic situation to stability and prosperity”. In the case of Macau, the principles contained in the White Paper apply, with the secretary promising to “continue to intensify education, giving priority to the formation of a social base that supports the values ​​of love for the country and for Macau”.
In this context, the aim is to “develop a comprehensive educational system to increase the patriotic feeling of young people and consolidate the ideological foundation of national security through multidimensional educational activities and exchanges”.
It is promised that the Social Affairs and Culture department “will continue to promote national security using culture as a driving force, reinforcing the exploration and dissemination of Macau’s historical and cultural resources and organizing different types of exhibitions and cultural shows with unique characteristics”.
The idea is to “spread the excellent Chinese cultural heritage in order to resist the erosion of harmful cultures, reinforce the cultural and national identity of the population and unite the forces of different sectors of society through culture”.
Wong Sio Chak, Secretary for Administration and Justice, who for years held the Security portfolio, considers that the White Paper has “extreme relevance for Macao SAR issues relating to the defense of national security”, particularly with regard to “defending sovereignty, security and the development interests of the State”.
The promises are that the area of ​​Administration and Justice “will boost legislative production in the priority areas related to the defense of State security, continuing to improve the respective legal regime”, with “training courses on the Constitution, the Basic Law and legislation relating to the defense of State security aimed at public service workers at different levels”.
In turn, Tai Kin Ip, Secretary for Economy and Finance, described that “economic and financial security constitute non-traditional key domains among the twenty priority areas of the global vision of national security, and are also crucial factors in ensuring the stable development and long-term security of Macau and the country”.
Tai Kin Ip aims to “pragmatically promote the development of adequate diversification of the economy, strengthening Macau’s global economic resilience and maintaining a high level of attention to various risks and challenges in the economic and financial domain”.
Raymond Tam, Secretary for Transport and Public Works, said Macau must “cultivate an awareness of vigilance in times of peace, in order to consolidate the foundations of lasting stability and security”.
In this sense, the government official understands that “Macau must always put the safeguarding of the sovereignty, security and development interests of the State first”, and in terms of Transport and Public Works he promises to “persist in the predominance of Executive power, firmly integrating the safeguarding of national security in all tasks”.
Ao Ieong Seong, Commissioner against Corruption, believes that “the security and stability of the political environment and the good functioning of the system, with the predominance of the Executive branch, [guarantees that] the level of governance in the Macao SAR is increasingly higher”.
The commissioner highlighted “last year’s successful holding of the elections for the 8th Legislative Assembly, reinforcing the implementation of the principle of ‘Macau governed by patriots’ and effectively ensuring the lasting stability of the Macao SAR”.</description><pubDate>2026-02-12 02:37:06</pubDate></item><item><title>Flights | Direct connections between Macau and PLP defended</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/11/voos-defendidas-ligacoes-directas-entre-macau-e-plp/</link><description>Representative Song Pek Kei yesterday defended the creation of direct air links between the territory and Portuguese-speaking countries, with the aim of “enriching the air network” of the territory.
“It is important to launch incentive measures to encourage operators in the [airline] sector to explore more direct international routes, with priority being given to expanding the direct flight network with Portuguese and Spanish-speaking countries,” said Song Pek Kei, in an intervention at the Legislative Assembly (AL).
The Macau Civil Aviation Activity Law came into force this year, opening the door to the liberalization of the sector. Song Pek Kei stated that, with the entry into force of this legislation, the Government “must accelerate” the adjustment of the service structure and “make good use” of resources to develop more routes with stopovers and connections.
“Taking the experiences of other regions as a reference, it is important to launch incentive measures to encourage operators in the sector to explore more direct international routes,” he added.
Other requests
Song Pek Kei is not the first deputy to propose to the Government the creation of new air routes that connect the Chinese region to Europe. In December, Ip Sio Kai also defended the establishment of a direct air link with Lisbon, to promote business between Portuguese-speaking countries and Europe.
Ip suggested that the Government grant subsidies for the opening of this long-haul flight and launch promotions for accommodation, transport and cultural activities to attract tourists to Macau.
In response to Ip Sio Kai in the hemicycle, the president of the Civil Aviation Authority, Pun Wa Kin, stated that the Government “attaches great importance” to the development of aviation, “in particular its role in promoting economic diversification”.
“However, in commercial operations, airlines often consider market demand, operational costs, long-term benefits and the competitiveness of the route, before deciding to launch new flights”, declared Pun Wa Kin, to whom the Government Head of Transport and Public Works, Tam Vai Man, had handed over the prerogative of responding to the deputy.
When Ip suggested that the Government could subsidize the route, Pun responded that this support “involves different sectoral policies” and that “the Macao SAR Government needs to analyze the issue comprehensively, from all aspects”.</description><pubDate>2026-02-11 03:09:30</pubDate></item><item><title>Nuclear | Moscow says it will continue to comply with the treaty if the US does so</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/12/nuclear-moscovo-diz-que-continuara-a-cumprir-tratado-se-eua-o-fizerem/</link><description>Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said yesterday that Moscow will continue to comply with the limits imposed on its nuclear arsenal, despite the recent end of the New START treaty, as long as the United States does the same.

Moscow “will act in a responsible and considered manner, based on an analysis of US military policy (…) and an analysis of the general strategic situation”, he added.
Russia and the United States have by far the largest nuclear arsenals in the world, but since the New START Treaty expired earlier this month, there is no nuclear disarmament agreement linking the two powers.
The treaty, signed in 2010 between Russia and the United States, limited the number of nuclear missile launchers to intercontinental distances. It expired on February 5th, as US President Donald Trump did not respond to Moscow's proposal to extend it.</description><pubDate>2026-02-12 03:23:48</pubDate></item><item><title>HZM Border | Concession yields 1.2 million per month</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/12/fronteira-hzm-concessao-rende-12-milhoes-por-mes/</link><description>Sociedade Express Grupo Limitada will pay 1.2 million patacas monthly to the Macao SAR to operate the commercial areas of the Macau Border Post Building on the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge (HZM).

The IC said that the restoration plan took into account “factors such as typhoon season, workplace safety, peak tourist periods and major events”.</description><pubDate>2026-02-12 02:53:30</pubDate></item><item><title>Bruno Pernadas releases album “unlike,maybe”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/12/bruno-pernadas-edita-album-unlikemaybe/</link><description>Guitarist and composer Bruno Pernadas, who has performed in Macau and the Greater Bay Area, releases “unlike, maybe” this week, an album with part of the songs created in collaboration with the musicians who accompany him, something he intends to do more of in the future.
After “Private Reasons”, released in 2021 and which ends a trilogy, Bruno Pernadas presents “a transition album”. “I'm still not being able to achieve what I wanted, but this is a necessary step for that to happen in the future”, he stated, in an interview with the Lusa agency, regarding “unlike, maybe”, to be published this Friday.
The process of creating the album served the musician to try to “detach from certain things that can be considered vices of resources and tools”, something that “is not such an immediate process”, as it is within himself.
The recordings were divided between Lisbon, where the musician lives, and Porto. In the ‘invicta city’, the musicians spent a few days in the same house “and this process was collaborative”. "More has already happened [on this album], but I want that to happen, in the future, that's all. There doesn't even need to be demos. Sometimes I don't have demos, I put everything on the agenda", he stated.
Other languages
The collaborative process allowed Bruno Pernadas to get closer to the language that for him “is closer to jazz, an idea that was left by the trends of Sun Ra, Don Cherry, Alice Coltrane, Art Ensemble of Chicago, The Last Poets – which is not quite jazz, but it is close”.
"I wanted to get closer to that language, with which I have a lot of relationship and which didn't happen on other albums. Even on my jazz album 'worst summer ever' [from 2016 and which opened the trilogy] this way of thinking like that wasn't realized. On this album ['unlike, maybe'] it already partially exists", he said.
The new album features the participation of musicians Margarida Campelo, António Quintino, João Correia, Diogo Alexandre, José Soares, Teresa Costa, Jéssica Pina and Eduardo Lála. Margarida Campelo also sings, and her voice is joined by those of guests Leonor Arnaut, Lívia Nestrovski and Maya Blandy.
Some are already part of the group that accompanied him in previous works, for others it was a debut. "It's like a cast. In cinema there are many directors who have a fixed cast, but sometimes another type of approach to the artistic object is needed and they form collaborations", he said.
In addition to playing, Bruno Pernadas is the composer, author and producer of “unlike, maybe”, sharing only one of the lyrics with Rita Westwood.
When he goes to the studio with the musicians, “things are more or less thought out”. "There are sections that I leave open for improvisations, thinking about the musicians who are going to record. I already know how people react and there are certain things that are done with that person in mind. There are other melodies and things that I do for the people that I invite to participate in certain songs", he shared.
In addition to studio recordings, Bruno Pernadas also incorporates recordings made at home, during the day and without acoustic isolation, into his albums.
"I always record things at home. At first I re-recorded, but then I stopped doing that, the sounds aren't bad, it's a clinical, surgical perspective of people listening to the music. It's not bad, that's how it turned out", he said.</description><pubDate>2026-02-12 03:19:38</pubDate></item><item><title>Valentine's Day | Macau Orchestra brings special concert</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/12/dia-dos-namorados-orquestra-de-macau-traz-concerto-especial/</link><description>This Saturday, the Macau Orchestra will take the stage at the Broadway Theater for a show that celebrates love and, more specifically, Valentine's Day.

ByteDance's new artificial intelligence model presents itself as a turning point in the film and television sectors
Chinese technology company ByteDance has attracted the attention of users and investors after launching an artificial intelligence model for video generation that analysts say “exceeds expectations in terms of realism”.
The new application, called Seedance 2.0, was launched this weekend, and its capabilities have already resulted in significant rises in the stock market for companies, not only in the technology sector, but also in the entertainment industry, with some of them reaching the daily earnings limit in recent sessions.
According to economic news portal Caixin, this model is capable of generating realistic images with fluid movements, also adding sounds that coincide with the images, which for the first time puts ByteDance in a position to compete with KlingAI, developed by the short video platform Kuaishou.
Feng Ji, producer of the popular video game Black Myth: Wukong, described Seedance 2.0 as “the most powerful video generation model yet,” and predicted a major impact on reducing production costs for film and television, as well as other types of content.
The official Seedance 2.0 portal states that the big difference compared to similar models is its ability to maintain the coherence of the characters in different scenes.
New chapter
According to analysts at Kaiyuan Securities, cited by the Bloomberg agency, this new model could mark a turning point in the use of AI in film and television: "The test results are impressive. It supports text, image, video and audio input, and has achieved significant progress in crucial capabilities."
Feng also warned of the risks of the proliferation of fake videos generated by these types of services, which could lead to a crisis of trust: “Realistic fake videos will be available to everyone, and intellectual property and supervision systems will face unprecedented challenges.”
"In the future, any video content that does not have an official and authorized backing – especially those with personal images and voices – may be fake. Please be sure to verify them through multiple channels to avoid being scammed," the producer wrote on social media.
Seedance 2.0 did not reach the market in isolation, as its great local rival, the aforementioned KlingAI, launched its 3.0 version on the 4th, with intelligent framing and the ability to add new images and people to the original video as major attractions.</description><pubDate>2026-02-12 03:15:46</pubDate></item><item><title>Zone A | Ten more cameras from the “Eyes in the Sky” system in operation</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/12/zona-a-mais-dez-camaras-do-sistema-olhos-no-ceu-em-funcionamento/</link><description>The first 10 cameras of the Macau video surveillance system, known as “Eyes in the Sky”, came into operation in Zone A of the New Landfills, in compliance with the order of the Secretary for Security, published yesterday in the Official Bulletin, which comes into force today.
According to a statement also released yesterday by the Unitary Police Services (SPU), “in conjunction with the development plan for Zone A of the New Landfills, security authorities plan to install, in phases, 120 cameras in this area”.
The first dozen cameras were installed in the peripheral areas of the Tong Seng, Tong Chong and Tong Kai Buildings, covering the main roads and pedestrian crossings, among other public spaces
The authorities indicate that, currently, the “Eyes in the Sky” system has 1,711 cameras, and that in the first nine months of 2025, the system supported the investigation of 7,131 crimes, “involving cases of homicide, drug trafficking, robbery, theft, arson, possession of a prohibited weapon, harm to physical integrity, fraud and illegitimate appropriation of found property”.
The SPU also added that the expansion of the video surveillance system aims to increase the capacity for security prevention and control, “with a view to preventing and combating criminal activities, providing scientific and technological support for Macau's security”.</description><pubDate>2026-02-12 02:52:39</pubDate></item><item><title>Ana Cristina Alves</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/autor/ana-cristina-alves/</link><description>Ana Cristina Alves – Assistant Researcher and Coordinator of the Educational Service of the Macau Scientific and Cultural Center
When listening to the Lecture on the Year of the Horse by Professor Wang Suoying at the Macau Scientific and Cultural Center regarding Chinese astrology and, specifically, the Fire Horse, which will inaugurate a new zodiacal period from February 17, 2026, I was able to recall some of the essential characteristics of the horse, transmitted by Chinese folk wisdom.
Thus the horse begins to mythologically combine with the dragon in Dragon-Horse (龙马Lóngmǎ). This is an ideal combination, both on a mental and aesthetic level. From a spiritual point of view, the pair allows access to the organization of the world guided by intuitive wisdom, since it was on the back of this animal that the first legendary Chinese emperor Fuxi (伏羲) discovered the eight trigrams, fundamental for understanding the world. Let us remember them: the Creative Heaven (乾 Qián), the Receptive Earth (坤 Kūn), the abyssal Water (坎Kǎn), the clinging Fire (离 Lí), the awakening Thunder or Lightning (震 Zhèn), the gentle and penetrating Wind (巽 Xùn), the Joyful Lake (兑Duì) and the tranquil Mountain (艮 Gě) . These eight trigrams, with the qualities already mentioned, gave rise to the 64 hexagrams that make up the Classic of Changes, as I have already had the opportunity to mention, for example, in the text A Mulher na China (2007) or in the poetic work Visitações (2022). Through the composition of the trigrams into hexagrams, a world is exposed that poetically unfolds, depending on the intuitive and imaginative capabilities of each person, with precepts open to past, but also present and future existential experiences. Each person will be able to find what they are looking for at the same time as they create and recreate themselves with the help of the real elements of Heaven, Earth, Fire, Water and all others that they consider useful for their existential path, also traced with the help of the mind and, above all, the imagination.
Still in its connection with the dragon in the proverbial expression “the Spirit of the Dragon-Horse” (龙马精神Lóngmǎ jīngshén) it represents the realization of an aesthetic ideal full of energy, beauty and power of transformation, just as these animals are for the Chinese.
It starts, however, from a concrete floor and then flies. The land of popular wisdom tells us that the horse is a noble and loyal animal, which knows the path (老马识途Lǎomǎ-shítú), since experience is the mother of wisdom in it, but it is not just any experience: it is energetic, a good friend and loyal.  This loyalty and energy could not be more noble, especially since since Chinese antiquity, equids have been the faithful companions of nobles. Therefore, the horse (马mǎ) also appears associated in language with nobility (侯hòu) and, through a game of homophonies, with the monkey (猴hóu), hence if in a painting the monkey appears on top of the horse, it means the possibility of receiving an honorific title, that is, of elevating the status.
 A horse can develop a lot of energy, with the most capable being those who travel a thousand miles (千里马Qiānlǐmǎ), whether equine or human, because there are also people overflowing with capacity and energy, like these animals, with those who had the blessing of being born under the good auspices of the Horse being in a more favorable position to cultivate enthusiasm and dynamism. This year of Fire.
 The suggestion is to return to the Classic of Changes (易经Yì jīng), to try to understand what the Fire hexagram has to offer, which is adherent and brilliant, composed of two trigrams of Fire (离下、离上 Lí Xià, Li Shàng), therefore the representation of the element in a pure state, thus enabling the understanding of the fundamental characteristics of the Fire Horse that enters in the middle of February. In Richard Wilhelm's interpretation, translated into English by Cary F. Baynes (1989, 118-121), we read that fire is dependent, it is always conditioned to something or someone else, for example to the combustion of Wood, only in this way can it be so alive and bright, and the more it burns, the more it rises from the earth towards the sky. In the judgment of the lines it is informed that if you adhere with perseverance like a cow, you will be guaranteed success (離，利貞，亨。畜牝牛，吉。2) (Zhang, 1995,131). Regarding his image, he appears to illuminate and doubly so, since when he shines he does so for himself and for others (《象》明兩作，離；大人以繼明，照於四方) (Zhang, 1995,135)., just as the sun shines and warms the earth throughout the day.  Being a conditioned element, like all others, in a world of interdependence, everything that does not burn positively and for good must be abandoned, just like the ancient Chinese leaders at the end of the dynasties who stopped being model and became capricious and destructive.
 The positive energy of the Fire Horse is like a beneficent sun that inspires everyone.
 If you ask the greatest of all Chinese poets, Li Bai (701-762), here in the translation by António Graça de Abreu, in One Hundred Poems of Li Bai 李白诗一百首 what virtues he associates with the horse, we read in response, for example, in “Your bay horse 君马黄” which is friendship and life experience, with its highs and low, but always worthy of being lived in the company of good friends:
君马黄，我马白。
马色虽不同，人心本无隔。
共作游治盘，双行洛阳陌。
长剑既照曜，高冠何赤3赫。
各有千金裘，俱为五侯客。
猛虎落陷阱，壮士时屈厄。
Article
Your horse is bay
my horse is white.
Different color of horses,
similar to the hearts of friends.
Through the streets of Luoyang
we know happy days,
sword at waist, tall hats,
valuable fur coats.
guests of five marquises.
Even tigers fall into the trap.
Today strong and brave,
Tomorrow subject to the misadventures of luck.
If such a day happens,
Help from a friend.
(Abreu, 2021, 174)
 In a leap forward to contemporary times, we will find in the poet Yao Feng (1958-), in Palavras Cansadas da Gramática (2014) the same traditional reading and an interesting identification with the horse, in “Cavalo Velho”, preserving the idea of friendship that extends throughout the Chinese centuries, but in an inverted presentation of the free condition of the animal, which appears, as happens mutatis mutandis to so many people, sad and imprisoned, unnaturally, in a cart, that is, a social condition, translated into the provision of services to others:
  Accustomed to the coachman, to passers-by, to cars
  Forgotten what it's like to gallop
  Dirty, sagging skin, gloomy as the end of the day
  Ironed hulls make the trail on the flat
  Even longer
  Sitting in a noisy village tavern
  I saw a horse bent under the weight of the cart
  Pull up and I would like
  To tell him in his language:
  Come in here, old friend, I'll buy you a drink!
  (Yao, 2014, 122)
It is certainly against the essential nature of equids to allow themselves to be imprisoned. They, who love to run freely across the prairies and steppes, through the mountains and valleys, can be domesticated by friendship, suffering and participating in the place of the social order that humans have destined for them. And like people, they also age, losing much of the vigor and energy they were born with, which is reflected in skin that loses its shine and sags. But while they are in the strength of life, and if they are lucky enough to remain free, there is no greater dynamism than theirs.
To conclude, my poetic tribute to the Year of the Horse that gallops towards us brimming with strength, enthusiasm and joy:
Fire Horse
Beautiful, fast, dreamy,
Run against the pain,
Growing in wind or breeze
in the wake of flowers,
They dancing in the passage,
of paws loaded with earth and heat.
Beautiful, fast, dreamy,
carry the monkey,
And on the back the dragon,
they call it the Spirit
of the Dragon Horse.
龙马精神
Horse-Dragon Spirit,
In a year that brings shine
and the light like heralds,
sounding strong and loud.

In religious practice, this “fire in the wind” is understood as the smoke that results from the burning of incense or papers that carry prayers, offerings or messages to the gods, ancestors or spirits up to the heavens. This fire, represented by the color red, is associated, among others, with immortality, positive energy forces or protection against evil.
Shades of the color red were notoriously adopted by the emperors of the Ming dynasty who had Zhu, “vermilion or cinnabar” as their family name. One of the most publicly manifest examples was painting the walls of the “Forbidden Imperial City”, Zijincheng, purple, as a form of protection for the occupants inside, or giving the clothing of literate officials the color of cinnabar.
When the dynasty fell and for many literati it became intolerable to obey the new emperors, some adopted the most diverse and subtle strategies of resistance. A scholar from the North who, in the plurality of his knowledge and vocations, came to use more than thirty names of brush, created for himself the name Zhuyi daoren, the «Daoist dressed in cinnabar» as if by using this protective color, he only recognized his own body as the only border or wall.
In ordinary life, his name was Fu Shan (1607-1684), born in Yangqu, Shanxi, and from his refusal to serve his new masters, which harmed his day-to-day life, countless talents emerged, still celebrated today in two gardens in the city of Taiyuan, the provincial capital. And although all the literati who knew him recognized his qualities as a calligrapher, painter or poet, those closest to him saw him as a practitioner of traditional medicine, in particular as an expert on women's illnesses.
Fu Shan preferred his handwriting to be “rough, not skillful; ugly, not seductive; deformed, not thin; spontaneous, not premeditated». And just like in paintings, he liked long vertical formats, as can be seen in a couplet in the Smithonian (ink on paper, 226 x 45.5 cm) where, reflecting his dual concern with the spirit and the body, he wrote:
«If the spirit is calm, the mind naturally reaches the distance;
The more relaxed your body is, the more of life you will be able to enjoy».
He is credited with creating an “eight treasure soup”, made with eight ingredients that restored the most weakened. And yet, when he was forced to go to court in Beijing for the ritual of obedience to the new dynasty, he threw himself to the ground, suffering an incapacitating illness.
Walking along the riverbank, enjoying the flowers, 6 (out of 7):
Access to Huangsi's in-laws' house
it is full of flowers everywhere,
There are a thousand, ten thousand flowers pressing
the branches, so full, bent.
Repeatedly invite the butterflies to stay
constantly dancing,
I listen to orioles: how they are tuned
in your delicate chirp.

Analysts interviewed by Lusa consider the proposed law for the Commission for the Defense of State Security, voted yesterday in the Legislative Assembly, to be unconstitutional, highlighting “disturbing aspects”, such as restrictions on the appointment of lawyers in national security cases.
The proposed law that will frame the State Security Defense Commission (CDSE) was discussed and voted on in general by deputies to the Legislative Assembly yesterday.
The document, according to Macau-based lawyer Luís Almeida Pinto, “contains disturbing aspects of the constitutional functioning of various powers, and also in some matters of rights, freedoms and guarantees enshrined in the Macau ‘Constitution’: the Basic Law”.
Anticipating changes to the Basic Law of the Judicial Organization, the proposal determines that the choice of a lawyer for national security cases is subject to the approval of a judge, who forwards the request to the CDSE, so that it can issue a binding and non-appealable opinion.
Special authorization, the Government proposes, can occur in criminal or other proceedings, when “there are well-founded reasons to believe that there is a need to protect the interests of State security”.
Almeida Pinto evokes the Basic Law, which guarantees “access to the Law, the courts, and assistance from a lawyer in the defense of their legitimate rights and interests”, to point out that it is up to the defendant “to freely choose the lawyer who best serves them”. “It seems like a rule that will be unconstitutional when approved, and when applied in practice”, he explains.
Collision with Lawyer's Statute
In addition to being “a violation of the Basic Law”, with constitutional force in Macau, Pedro Leal, who has practiced law in the territory for several decades, points out “clearly, a collision” between what is proposed and “the decree that regulates the Lawyers Association and the Statute” of the Lawyer, with regard to the free choice of a defender.
This is the “most debatable issue” of the proposal, assumes Leal, who says he agrees with the legislative initiative. "China pays special attention to security issues, it is a world power, as such it does not want interference in any way. I understand the position and I understand that it does not want changes to the 'status quo'. (…) Now, they want to do things, do them well", he adds.
Speaking to Lusa, Almeida Pinto also considers the regime envisaged to be “unacceptable” for “inquiries to be made to lawyers” who wish to legally represent a defendant in national security cases. Attached to the request made by the agents to the judge, there must be, among other elements, information regarding the members of the lawyer's household, nationality and connection with organizations or individuals abroad.
This is a “real investigation into personal life”, when “what is only at stake is the exercise of the profession for which he is duly registered and authorized by the Macau Lawyers Association”, he says.
The requirement, “in addition to being extremely vague, is perfectly impossible” to implement, assesses Leal, who suggests “it is implicit” that a non-Chinese lawyer will not be authorized representation in these cases – it should be noted that in cases of national security, only the intervention of Chinese judges is now permitted.
Question of times
Another doubt, raised to Lusa by jurist António Katchi, concerns the time it will take for the CDSE to issue the opinion. The proposal does not clarify this aspect, so the Code of Administrative Procedure “should” be applied, which sets the deadline for acts to be carried out by administrative bodies at 15 days.
But, says Katchi, “will the CDSE follow this same understanding or will it consider (without the possibility of this being denied by any court) that it can simply leave the issue to its next semi-annual ordinary meeting?”.
If the opinion is negative and it is necessary to repeat the process, with a new legal representative, “how many months or years will the defendant remain deprived of his liberty, without a lawyer”?
Alluding to the principle of judicial independence, which he recalls is guaranteed by the Basic Law, António Katchi deduces “with complete certainty, the inadmissibility of subjecting a judicial decision to a binding opinion from an administrative body, namely the CDSE”.
The professor also talks about the importance of a relationship of trust between constituent and lawyer and “how vital it is, for a person at risk of a prison sentence, to be defended by a lawyer who is sincerely motivated by the cause and well versed in the matter involved”.
In addition to the Basic Law and the Joint Declaration, signed by Lisbon and Beijing in 1987, and which defined rules for Macau after the transition of administration, Katchi highlights another legal provision that the proposal contradicts: the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), according to which, he quotes, “every person accused of a crime shall have the right, in full equality, (…) to present himself at trial and to defend himself in person or to be assisted by a defender of your choice.”
The ICCPR is one of the instruments that constitute the UN International Bill of Human Rights. In 1992, when Macau was still a territory administered by Portugal, Lisbon extended this convention to the region. Although China signed the treaty in 1998, it never ratified it, and is not bound by its rules.
The Basic Law, explains António Katchi, points out that restrictions on fundamental rights, including the right to be assisted by a lawyer, “cannot contradict the provisions of the ICCPR”.</description><pubDate>2026-02-11 02:16:02</pubDate></item><item><title>Cooperation | Relations between China and Timor-Leste guided by caution, study indicates</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/10/cooperacao-relacoes-entre-china-e-timor-leste-pautadas-por-cautela-indica-estudo/</link><description>It is certain that, by being part of the “One Belt, One Road” initiative, Timor-Leste can become a strategic point in commercial relations on this side of the globe, despite the “cautious pragmatism” in relations with China.

Timor-Leste, a young country, has been cementing its relations with China, namely through the “One Belt, One Road” initiative, but there is still some caution surrounding this relationship. This is one of the conclusions of the study “Timor-Leste's foreign policy options within the scope of China's Belt and Road 2.0 Initiative: a small state perspective”, authored by academics Tiago Botelho dos Santos, Diogo Borges and Paulo Afonso Duarte. The work was published in The Pacific Review, an academic journal edited by Taylor &amp; Francis.
The research work starts with Timor-Leste's adherence to the Chinese initiative, something that happened in 2017, to analyze how the relationship with China has been going, taking into account the fact that Timor-Leste has “the status of a small state”.
It is concluded, therefore, that “Timor-Leste's involvement with China's Belt and Road Initiative, particularly in the post-2023 period, can be understood as a strategic and calculated attempt to maximize its status as a small state in a complex regional and global environment”. It is described that, in this period, Timorese foreign policy has been characterized “by a multi-vector approach, strategically anchored in multilateralism”, seeking to “diversify international partnerships to reinforce national security, promote economic development and expand its voice in the international system”.
The study points out that relations between Timor-Leste and China, in the context of the Belt and Road initiative, are a “deliberate movement to leverage development opportunities” in the country, being a strategy aligned with the Timor-Leste Strategic Development Plan 2011-2030.
The plan aims to “promote economic diversification and the development of critical infrastructure, in a context in which the Belt and Road 2.0 Initiative emphasizes digital infrastructure, green energy and cooperation in the area of ​​health”.
Timorese potential
The three academics also highlight that Timor-Leste, as part of the Chinese geopolitical initiative, has the potential to stand out economically, and also in commercial terms, in the region. The country has “the potential to assert itself as a logistical center on a route that connects the South Indian Ocean to the South Pacific”, so the Chinese initiative “offers a relevant opportunity to significantly increase its regional prominence and decisively facilitate” integration into ASEAN [Association of Southeast Asian Nations], to which Timor-Leste recently joined.
Despite all these positive signs, the study concludes that “although Timor-Leste's relationship with China has deepened, culminating in a comprehensive strategic partnership in 2024, its engagement continues to be marked by cautious pragmatism”.
In this context, “the benefits of greater connectivity and investment are carefully weighed against concerns regarding debt sustainability, transparency and possible strategic dependencies”. This caution on the part of Timor-Leste demonstrates its “capacity for action by selectively engaging in projects aligned with its national interests”, navigating the “complexities of competition between great powers in the Indo-Pacific, while maintaining its commitment to a balanced and diversified foreign policy”.
Timorese pragmatism is also evident, according to the study, in the fact that the country “not only optimizes development opportunities, but also reinforces its regional position by meticulously analyzing economic benefits in the face of potential risks”. What is strengthened, “ultimately”, is the “capacity for action as a small State”, highlight the authors.
A “remarkable” ability
The study in question highlights how Timor-Leste has had “a remarkable capacity for action” in the context of the “One Belt, One Road” initiative, using other small States, such as Sri Lanka, as a point of comparison.
Citing other studies, the three academics highlight how “Timor-Leste has demonstrated a more cautious approach than countries like Sri Lanka, which have faced significant concerns about debt sustainability associated with BRI [Belt and Road Initiative] projects, or landlocked states like Laos and coastal nations like Cambodia.”
In the case of these Southeast Asian countries, “Chinese loans for emblematic projects, such as railways and highways, have drastically increased external debt and dependence on Beijing”.
What we sought to do in this investigation was “to examine the unique position of Timor-Leste, not as a financier, but also not as a victim of a ‘debt trap'”, highlighting “the distinct and valuable form of action capacity of a small State within the scope of the BRI”.
The authors highlight that, in the last decade, China “significantly expanded its presence in Southeast Asia” through the “One Belt, One Road” initiative, thereby “expanding its regional influence in the economic, security and political spheres”. In this relationship, Timor-Leste has been “far from being a passive observer”, seeking to “actively engage with China to ensure development benefits”.
Timor-Leste sought to “identify an opportunity to align with the long-term objectives” of its Strategic Development Plan 2011-2030, analysts indicate.
“Strategically, the country also intends to capitalize on its geographic position in emerging commercial maritime routes, particularly through the establishment of a logistics hub in the South Indian Ocean and the South Pacific, potentially reinforcing its regional role as a new integrated member state of ASEAN”, point out the authors.
Timor-Leste seeks to “balance economic gains and potential dependencies”, in a geopolitical context that “includes competition between great powers in the Indo-Pacific, where United States policies, under successive administrations, aim to contain China's regional influence”.
In methodological terms, the authors carried out this investigation based on reading official reports, documents that serve as the basis for signed bilateral agreements and government documentation. In addition, interviews were carried out with “experts based in both Europe and Asia”.
The authors state that they sought to interview academics and diplomats “due to the fact that ordinary citizens are generally unfamiliar with China's global multilateral initiatives, while diplomats tend to be excessively cautious in their statements, as they represent the official position of their state, and not necessarily their personal opinions”.
It is therefore understood that academics “tend to offer more balanced and rigorous analyses”. The questions focused on how Timor-Leste, as a small State, has benefited from the Chinese initiative, whether this initiative is compatible with the Timor-Leste Strategic Development Plan 2011-2030, or whether “there are visible dangers of creating dependency” between the two countries, among other issues.</description><pubDate>2026-02-10 01:54:12</pubDate></item><item><title>USJ | Book highlights panorama of philanthropy in Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/09/usj-livro-destaca-panorama-da-filantropia-em-macau/</link><description>The book “Media, Art &amp; Technology in the Nine Portuguese Speaking Cultures” has just been published by the University of São José. One of the chapters deals with philanthropy in Macau, the discreet profile of philanthropists and the work of entities such as Fundação Rui Cunha, Banco Nacional Ultramarino and Fundação Oriente
The University of São José (USJ) has just published the book “Media, Art &amp; Technology in the Nine Portuguese Speaking Cultures”, edited by professor José Manuel Simões. As the name indicates, the work aims to outline the panorama of arts, media and culture in the nine Portuguese-speaking countries and regions, which includes Macau.
Macao SAR is represented with a chapter dedicated to philanthropy, written by Carmen Zita Monereo, post-doctoral student at USJ, entitled “The Impact of Corporate Philanthropy on Media, Art, and Technology in Macao / What do we know about Philanthropy in Macao? What is the relationship between Confucianism, Philanthropy, Media, and strategic communication?”.
“Carmen has been developing a study on philanthropy in Macau, which is a slightly different work than the rest”, she began by telling HM José Manuel Simões. "This is a work that contributes to the analysis of the spectrum of philanthropists in Macau, then outlining a study on the Rui Cunha Foundation, Banco Nacional Ultramarino, Fundação Oriente. It looks at what corporate philanthropy is and the impacts it has on society through an analysis of the media, but also art and technology in Macau. In other words, it questions what we know about philanthropy in Macau and what is the relationship between Confucianism, philanthropy, the media and strategic communication.”
José Manuel Simões adds that one of the innovative points in this chapter is the discreet profile of philanthropists. “A curious aspect is that, unlike philanthropists from Europe and the United States, who really like to appear in rankings, in Macau there is greater discretion and a low profile of these people linked to philanthropy, and this has to do with the culture itself.”
The editor of the work adds that “in the field of communication sciences [in Macau] philanthropy has gained great importance as a communication instrument”, and that Carmen Zita Monereo’s work “identifies the values ​​of an organizational culture that is capable of generating communication flows conducive to innovation through this philanthropic activity”.
The book, which is available for free in digital version, “seeks to draw links between various vectors, and one of them is the nine Portuguese-speaking cultures”, without forgetting Macau “as a connection platform between China and Portuguese-speaking countries”.
According to José Manuel Simões, it is a book “whose research was developed seeking to adopt a multidisciplinary approach”, having “an academic nature, but, at the same time, it aims to have a simple and accessible language”.
Cape Verde’s good example
With a bilingual edition, the book presents “a very broad spectrum” of themes, containing an article by José Manuel Simões on São Tomé and Príncipe, entitled “Digital Media Contribution to Entrepreneurship and Development in São Tomé and Príncipe”. Below is an article on the educational panorama in Angola and the use of artificial intelligence (AI), written by Wilson Gomes Caldeira, entitled “Angola’s higher education system: An analysis of the opportunities and challenges presented by Artificial Intelligence”.
In the case of Cape Verde, Silvino Lopes Évora explores the ideas of social communication in conjunction with AI, in “Artificial Intelligence, newsroom culture, and journalism: From international spectrum to experiences in Cape Verde”.
“Cape Verde is a good example of media development in Africa and Silvino Évora's text works on the AI ​​component in the media and how it is being inserted. [The text also analyzes] what are the possibilities for using AI and how ethics can monitor and support AI and, at the same time, journalism”, adds José Manuel Simões.
The book published by USJ also explores, in the chapter “The media system as a leverage for democratic development in East Timor”, by Paulo Faustino and Rui Alexandre Novais, the links between journalism and historical memories of the independence process.
The book's editor explains the “more historical component regarding the role of remission that journalists still have today to almost preserve the memory of those who died in favor of the country's independence”.
"Journalism is of enormous importance in Timor, there were people and journalists who died. This is very little talked about and in this study there is an interesting conclusion, that these people, when they died in the name of freedom of expression, left a very important place in Timor-Leste that is still in force today, seeking to preserve their memory through surveillance over other powers."
In this way, “Timor-Leste is almost an example of how journalism should act as a watchdog of other powers, which does not happen in other sectors”.
José Manuel Simões highlights the case of Guinea-Bissau, “where journalists are called hired mouths”. "They don't know the difference between advertising, public relations, marketing and journalism, because they are conditioned by a very low salary. They write what they ask for in exchange for an envelope with some money inside, and this makes the profession [of journalism] very fragile in Guinea Bissau", he stressed.
A language of unity
According to José Manuel Simões, the book aims to unite “these quadrants of Portuguese cultures”, and the English edition aims to reach Anglo-Saxon communities, “so that they know about the existence of these cultures”.
"There are those who do not agree with me regarding the idea that the Portuguese language is a language of unity, not only among Portuguese-speaking peoples, but even within each country. We have the case of Timor-Leste, which on the island of Ataúro alone, which is very small, with 500 thousand inhabitants, has 40 dialects, one in each village. There, what does the Portuguese language do? It unites these people, because despite there being a difference between the who speak and those who learned Portuguese, in Timor-Leste, today, the elderly speak Portuguese and young people too, but there is the age group that goes from 25 to 50, who do not speak it. But, because it is a language of learning, because it is official, because it has books, a memory, Portuguese unites all these ethnicities and dialects, and has a common value, because the Portuguese language is everyone's mother tongue”, he explains.
José Manuel Simões does not forget the work that CPLP – Community of Portuguese Speaking Countries, has done in this regard. "The CPLP had a wonderful idea of ​​uniting us through language, but the CPLP has done vague, limited and barely visible work. In fact, very few people have done a worthy job of creating links between new Portuguese-speaking cultures. In this sense, this book fills a gap and brings new data about these new cultures, with this technological and innovative dynamic", this in relation to the QR codes for all chapters of the book. Each code gives access to a video that summarizes the author's work in each chapter.
In global terms, “Media, Art &amp; Technology in the Nine Portuguese Speaking Cultures” aims to be comprehensive in areas such as technology, art, culture and social communication. There is, however, “a common denominator, creating, curiously, a certain harmony, even with different focuses, and ends up covering, directly and indirectly, the spectrum of social communication”, he concludes.</description><pubDate>2026-02-09 02:56:18</pubDate></item><item><title>Security | Macao SAR rulers applaud White Paper on Hong Kong</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/12/seguranca-governantes-da-raem-aplaudem-livro-branco-sobre-hong-kong/</link><description>China has released a new White Paper on national security, on Hong Kong, which is entitled “Practice of Safeguarding National Security in Hong Kong under ‘One Country, Two Systems.’ In the Macao SAR, secretaries and political leaders reacted positively, saying that the document provides guarantees of stability and is a reference for Macau
Days after the conviction in Hong Kong of Jimmy Lai, a media entrepreneur who founded the now-defunct Apple Daily newspaper, China launches a new White Paper focused on the need to safeguard national security in neighboring territory. The “Practice of Safeguarding National Security in Hong Kong under ‘One Country, Two Systems'” was published by the Communication Department of China's State Council on Tuesday.
According to the Xinhua news agency, this White Paper consists of five parts, detailing “the persistent struggle to safeguard national security in Hong Kong and the fundamental responsibility of the Central Government in national security matters related to Hong Kong”.
In the same note, it is explained that the White Paper “exposes the achievements of the HKSAR in fulfilling its constitutional responsibility to safeguard national security” and also “Hong Kong’s transition from chaos to stability and prosperity”.
“Efforts to create [a security landscape] of high standard are not forgotten in order to promote the high-quality development of the ‘One Country, Two Systems' policy”, in addition to being explained that “the Central Government applied a holistic approach to national security”.
In this context, “it effectively exercised general jurisdiction over the HKSAR, in accordance with the country's Constitution and the Basic Law of the HKSAR”, and the Law on Safeguarding National Security “has been applied in the region” and has ensured “that Hong Kong is administered by patriots”.
On the Macao SAR side, the government apparatus reacted positively to this White Paper, after the bill that presents a new format and composition of the Macao SAR State Security Defense Commission, created in 2018, was generally approved in the Legislative Assembly.
Chan Tsz King, Secretary for Security, was one of the political figures who reacted to the document, which considers “ensuring the stable and lasting implementation” of the “One Country, Two Systems” principle.
Quoted in an official note, the secretary understands that the White Paper comes to “clarify the intrinsic unity between political principles and institutional logic, causing Hong Kong society to return to normality and order to be restored”.
The document, in the secretary's view, “serves as an important reference for the Macao SAR to review and improve the construction of its legal system in the context of defending the security of the State and the respective execution mechanism”.
Chan Tsz King highlights that his leadership will give “great importance to ensuring security in non-traditional areas under the new situation, establishing the long-term stability of the Macao SAR as a strategic objective”.
Firm as a rock
Also according to Xinhua, the White Paper describes how Beijing “supports the HKSAR in fulfilling its constitutional responsibility to safeguard national security by effectively preventing, interrupting and punishing any activities that put national security at risk”.
“The efforts” of the neighboring region to safeguard national security aim, according to the same document, to “sustain and develop” the principle created by Beijing to support Taiwan and the two special administrative regions, without forgetting the protection of “fundamental human rights, dignity and well-being of the 7.5 million residents of Hong Kong”.
The White Paper released by the State Council also states that “in today's world, and with unprecedented global transformations that have occurred in a century, they are accelerating, with the development environment facing China undergoing profound and complex changes”. In this way, “safeguarding national security is a long-term and permanent task”, it is said.
The White Paper states that Hong Kong “enjoys a high standard of security”, with the region “fated to overcome all risks and challenges in the future journey, remaining as stable as a rock in a turbulent world”.
Another political figure from the Macao SAR who reacted was Adriano Marques Ho, director-general of the Customs Service, saying that the White Paper “has an important guiding significance and a profound impact for the complete and accurate implementation of ‘One Country, Two Systems’ in the Hong Kong and Macau regions, for the realization of long-term prosperity and stability, and for their stable and sustainable progression”.
Adriano Marques Ho added that “both Hong Kong and Macau are inalienable and sacred parts of China”, and Beijing “has firmly and consistently maintained national sovereignty, security and development interests”.
In the view of the top Customs official, “the external hostile forces and anti-China elements disturbing Hong Kong incited and created the ‘legislative review riots’, which ended up evolving into a ‘color revolution’ version of Hong Kong, seriously damaging the constitutional order and the rule of law in Hong Kong, and putting national sovereignty, security and development interests at risk”.
End of the “chaotic situation”
Lam, Secretary for Social Affairs and Culture, said the White Paper “comprehensively analyzes and outlines Hong Kong's journey in defending national security, major achievements and experience gained”.
In the government's view, “Hong Kong went from a chaotic situation to stability and prosperity”. In the case of Macau, the principles contained in the White Paper apply, with the secretary promising to “continue to intensify education, giving priority to the formation of a social base that supports the values ​​of love for the country and for Macau”.
In this context, the aim is to “develop a comprehensive educational system to increase the patriotic feeling of young people and consolidate the ideological foundation of national security through multidimensional educational activities and exchanges”.
It is promised that the Social Affairs and Culture department “will continue to promote national security using culture as a driving force, reinforcing the exploration and dissemination of Macau’s historical and cultural resources and organizing different types of exhibitions and cultural shows with unique characteristics”.
The idea is to “spread the excellent Chinese cultural heritage in order to resist the erosion of harmful cultures, reinforce the cultural and national identity of the population and unite the forces of different sectors of society through culture”.
Wong Sio Chak, Secretary for Administration and Justice, who for years held the Security portfolio, considers that the White Paper has “extreme relevance for Macao SAR issues relating to the defense of national security”, particularly with regard to “defending sovereignty, security and the development interests of the State”.
The promises are that the area of ​​Administration and Justice “will boost legislative production in the priority areas related to the defense of State security, continuing to improve the respective legal regime”, with “training courses on the Constitution, the Basic Law and legislation relating to the defense of State security aimed at public service workers at different levels”.
In turn, Tai Kin Ip, Secretary for Economy and Finance, described that “economic and financial security constitute non-traditional key domains among the twenty priority areas of the global vision of national security, and are also crucial factors in ensuring the stable development and long-term security of Macau and the country”.
Tai Kin Ip aims to “pragmatically promote the development of adequate diversification of the economy, strengthening Macau’s global economic resilience and maintaining a high level of attention to various risks and challenges in the economic and financial domain”.
Raymond Tam, Secretary for Transport and Public Works, said Macau must “cultivate an awareness of vigilance in times of peace, in order to consolidate the foundations of lasting stability and security”.
In this sense, the government official understands that “Macau must always put the safeguarding of the sovereignty, security and development interests of the State first”, and in terms of Transport and Public Works he promises to “persist in the predominance of Executive power, firmly integrating the safeguarding of national security in all tasks”.
Ao Ieong Seong, Commissioner against Corruption, believes that “the security and stability of the political environment and the good functioning of the system, with the predominance of the Executive branch, [guarantees that] the level of governance in the Macao SAR is increasingly higher”.
The commissioner highlighted “last year’s successful holding of the elections for the 8th Legislative Assembly, reinforcing the implementation of the principle of ‘Macau governed by patriots’ and effectively ensuring the lasting stability of the Macao SAR”.</description><pubDate>2026-02-12 02:37:06</pubDate></item><item><title>Diocese of Macau/450 years | New Catholic Center will have a hotel</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/06/diocese-de-macau-450-anos-novo-centro-catolico-tera-um-hotel/</link><description>The new Catholic Center should open “in the middle of the second quarter” of this year and will have a hotel, prepared to receive “pilgrims and tourists”, says the Diocese of Macau. At a time when the institution celebrates 450 years, the inauguration of the Catholic Center is based on “the vision” of D. Paulo José Tavares, bishop of Macau in the 60s and 70s
After many years of emptiness and construction work on the corner of Avenida da Praia Grande and Rua do Campo, the new Catholic Center is preparing to open its doors later this year and is perhaps the most important event in the celebration of the 450th anniversary of the Diocese of Macau.
HM asked questions to the Diocese of Macau regarding the reopening of the building, which confirmed that the official inauguration is scheduled “for the second quarter” of this year. This building, with a total of 17 floors, will have features designed for religious purposes, but also a hotel prepared to receive all types of people.
"The Catholic Center will be a nerve center for disseminating and sharing the mission of the Catholic Church. The lower floors will feature a chapel, an auditorium, conference rooms, exhibition areas and spaces for activities." While “the upper floors will function as a hotel, offering welcoming and comfortable accommodation, imbued with a spirit of service”.
In the diocese's written response, it is added that the hotel facilities “were designed to receive both pilgrims and tourists, welcoming Catholics and non-Catholics with hospitality and inclusion”.
It is worth remembering that in December employees began to be recruited for the hotel unit, in partnership with the Directorate of Services for Labor Affairs (DSAL). In a job matching session aimed at residents, held on December 5th, with the “Companhia de Gestão do Centro Católico”, 23 job openings were made available for sales manager, assistant reception manager, chef, head of security, room service supervisor and acquisition supervisor, reads the DSAL note released in November.
The Diocese of Macau did not want to tell HM how much it would cost to rebuild the new Catholic Center, saying only that initial forecasts had slipped due to the pandemic. "The Catholic Center is currently undergoing development and submission and approval by the Government. Following the challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic, construction costs have increased significantly. We are grateful for the understanding and support of the builders and contractors, which allowed the reconstruction project to be completed successfully. At the same time, we warmly welcome donations from all sectors of society to help sustain and carry forward the Catholic Center's original mission of serving the Macau community."
A bishop still present
Asked about the main goals of the new Catholic Center, the Diocese of Macau describes that the building “aims to continue the spiritual mission of the Catholic Church and incorporate the spirit of Christ”, influenced by the work of Bishop D. Paulo José Tavares, who carried out his mission in Macau in the mid-20th century.
Of particular note is the fact that D. Paulo José Tavares, who died in 1973 and was appointed Bishop of Macau in 1961, was important in maintaining the presence of the Catholic Church in Macau at the time of the “1,2,3” movement. Between November 1966 and February 1967, the Cultural Revolution manifested itself in the territory, bringing together many local students, who intended to change the content of Catholic education. D. Paulo José Tavares fought with these groups of protesters, managing to keep teaching in Catholic schools and the spirit associated with them unchanged.
In this way, and based on “the vision” of this bishop, the diocese intends for the new Catholic Center to “continue to serve as a vital bridge for the Macau community, promoting dialogue, exchange and integration of faith and culture”. It is also the intention to “open the doors [of the Center] to visitors from all over the world, reinforcing not only its role as a spiritual refuge, but also infusing new vitality into the religious and cultural panorama of Macau”.
António Pedro Costa, author of the cleric's biography, entitled “D. Paulo José Tavares – The diplomat bishop”, described, in an interview with HM in 2023, that the bishop “was a breath of fresh air”, and a figure cherished by the Chinese community at the time.
"These attitudes of valuing the Chinese community led to a rapprochement and the establishment of a relationship of trust. Only in this way was he able to take his objectives forward, as he realized that he had to have the population on his side. But this caused him a lot of trouble with the European clergy, who did not agree with D. Paulo José Tavares' stance. It meant that the population saw him as an ally and not a person who comes from outside and imposes his ideas", said the author.
A year of celebrations
It was in 1576, in the fourth year of the Wanli reign, of the Ming Dynasty, that the Diocese was founded in Macau, with January 23rd being the official date of celebration. However, the next few months will also be festive.
In a previously released statement, the Diocese of Macau states that it has had, over the years, “the mission of establishing bridges between East and West, promoting education, charity and pastoral service”, leaving “a deep and lasting mark on the cultural, educational and religious development of Macau”.
The theme of the celebrations is “From Macau to the World: 450 years of Mission and Mercy”. The new Catholic Center will host two thematic exhibitions, entitled “Honoring the Past, Creating the Future” and “Witness to Heritage, Mission in the World”. These exhibitions aim to “reflect the development of the Diocese from historical, personal and cultural perspectives, as well as its future directions”, highlights the same note.
Tomorrow a sacred music concert will take place at the Sé Church with eight choral groups from Macau, Hong Kong and the Province of Guangzhou, with the sounds of the church's new pipe organ being heard.
From 7:30 pm onwards, the Diocesan Choir of Macau, the Cathedral Schola ensemble and other choral groups from Macau will perform, such as Coro Perosi, Dolce Voce and Cantate Chorus, without forgetting other ensembles from Hong Kong and Guangzhou.
The Diocese highlights that the “most symbolic and large-scale initiative of the commemorative year” will be the “great celebration” scheduled for October 31st this year, which consists of a reception and mass.
“Through this solemn celebration, the Diocese will give thanks to God for the graces and mission granted over four and a half centuries, and will pray that He continues to guide the way forward”, the same statement describes.
There will also be initiatives carried out by “various diocesan institutions” in the coming months, namely “cultural shows, school competitions, academic symposiums, social activities, youth meetings, online training resources, parish initiatives and liturgical celebrations”.
“Through transversal and intergenerational participation, the commemorative year seeks to deepen public knowledge about the historical development of the Diocese and its service to the community, promoting the spirit of the diocesan motto ‘Scientia et Virtus’ (Science and Virtue), which inspires a practice of service based on the balance between knowledge and ethical care.”
At a time when it celebrates 450 years of existence, the Diocese says it wants to chart the future, “walking with the residents of Macau in reflecting on the past and continuing its mission of faith, service and culture in this new stage”.</description><pubDate>2026-02-06 01:36:50</pubDate></item><item><title>History | Book reveals how Macau was created in the image of Évora</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/05/historia-livro-revela-como-macau-se-fez-a-imagem-de-evora/</link><description>The local association Heritage Society has just released a two-volume book on the history of Macau's founding. Authored by Caspar Chan and Nathan Rubene dos Santos, “Foral of the City of the Name of the God, Macau”, contains translations and annotations of documents that show how the founding of Macau had Évora as a model

A book, divided into two volumes, has just been published by the local association Heritage Society, which helps tell the story of the founding of Macau, from the mid-16th century onwards. The two volumes are entitled “Foral of the City of the Name of the God, Macau: Évora of the Far East” and “The Twenty-eight Alvarás”, and are authored by academics Caspar Chan and Nathan Rubene dos Santos.
The first volume, which establishes a curious connection between Macau and Évora in the founding of the territory to the East, is based on the archive “Foral, Regalias e Privilégios Concedidos à Cidade de Macau, na China, 1596-1756”, the original of which is kept at the National Archives of Rio de Janeiro, and there are microfilms at the Macau Archive.
In turn, the part dedicated to the 28 charters, a continuation of the first volume, analyzes the 28 legal texts initially decreed by the then governor of Macau and viceroy of India, D. Rodrigo da Costa, in 1689. These documents were later confirmed by King D. João V, in Portugal, in 1709.
As the authors told HM, in a joint email interview, the first volume “deals with the first part of the archive, or the first 17 sheets, which concern the oldest founding letters, letters and sentences received by the Senate of Macau during the last years of the 16th century”.
The second volume analyzes the contents of the file between pages 17 and 33, covering the 28 permits. “This is not yet the complete story, as we intend to continue working on the remaining archive in future years”, confessed the authors.
The authors highlight the importance of the charter, an ancient document that consisted of “a charter or contract that the governing power, be it a feudal lord, a bishop or a king, establishes with a local entity, be it a village or city, a senate or a council”.
"We consider that the word and the concept are important to reflect on this historical period and not only in Macau, but also the time when the European kingdom [Portugal] was at the height of its expansion across the seas and oceans. The concept of charter implies the way in which a Portuguese social structure was being transplanted and rethought in Macau."
In this way, the authors add, all documents analyzed for these two volumes are related to the idea of ​​charter.
In turn, the designation “City of the Name of God of Macau” appears, in this specific file, “not only in the charter of King Philip I of Portugal, during the Iberian Union, which stipulates the elevation of Macau from a town to a city, but also throughout the 28 subsequent charters”.
In concrete terms, readers can come across “a research work that addresses some of the most important documents in the history of Macau, documents that inform us about the founding of the city and the evolution of its legal and governing tradition”.
The connection with Évora
The first volume of the work includes the subtitle “Évora of the Far East”, relating “the story in which the town's Senate presented a petition to the Viceroy of India for the recognition of the Senate, for the elevation of this port to the status of city and for the granting to the 'new city' of Macau of the privileges, rights and freedoms of the city of Évora”.
D. Duarte de Meneses, at the time governor of Macau and viceroy of India, ended up granting this request on behalf of King D. Filipe I, in 1586, a “decision that was later confirmed by the king himself in 1595”. “To confirm and corroborate that Macau had the same status as Évora, it became natural that all the founding documents of the city of Évora were transcribed to Macau, so that the Senate of Macau could preserve them as evidence and keep them in its archives as founding documents of the city”, explain the authors.
The documents found in the archive based in Rio de Janeiro point out that “the ‘proof’ of Macau’s status as a city comparable to Évora does not consist of a single document, but a compilation of several texts”.
In the first volume of the work there are examples such as “sentences on the jurisdiction of certain positions, such as the Prosecutor and the Almotacé, royal letters on specific issues, laws on which positions should be part of a Senate, rites of religious and funeral processions and even the configuration of the Senate room”.
In short, “everything that Évora possessed de jure during this period was inherited by Macau, as proven by the meticulous transcription and authentication of these documents”, explain the authors.
The survival permits
Regarding the second volume of the work, focused on the 28 permits, the authors understand that these documents “are particularly significant because they present themselves as a cohesive set, with great integrity in terms of language, format, administration and argumentation”.
For Caspar Chan and Nathan Rubene dos Santos, this results from the fact that, at the end of the 17th century, Macau was no longer in its golden period of trade, “due to the loss of commercial routes”.
"At the same time, Macau faced constant social unrest, both internally – for example, between the Senate, the Captain-General and the Ouvidor – and externally, in relations with the Chinese and Castilians. The privileges and rights of the Senate were not respected, and it was necessary to resolve ambiguities to guarantee the city's survival, as reflected in the various minutes of the Senate meetings."
Thus, a petition was presented by these bodies to governor D. Rodrigo da Costa “for the reaffirmation of the city's rights and to present solutions to various problems, such as the overflow of the jurisdiction of the Captain-General, the preservation of the Padroado in the face of foreign missionary groups and trade with the Chinese and in Solor and Timor”.
Thus, the 28 permits emerged, which “also deal with a very diverse group of people from different arts, professions, origins and ideologies”, and not just relations between Portuguese and Chinese, which made “this set of documents particularly interesting to study”.
The aim of publishing these two volumes was to facilitate access to the archive and its information. “We intend to place in the hands of Macau readers a fundamental document of the legal and political origin of the city, which remains little studied, even in Portuguese-speaking historiography, and which is almost completely absent from the daily historical imagination of Macau”, they add.
The archive based in Rio de Janeiro was translated by the authors “and was never published in full, especially the founding documents related to Évora, not even in Portuguese”.
This archive almost always appears “indirectly, as excerpts and paraphrases, such as those of canonical historians of Macau, in the case of Manuel Teixeira; or as references inserted in specialized works, and in some cases only through digitalized transcriptions that circulate in doctoral theses”.
In the case of permits, they are “better known among historians, but appear only in very limited publications”. "For this reason, the publication of the primary text itself becomes essential. By presenting it in English and Chinese, alongside Portuguese, we also seek to remove a barrier that has long structured Macau's historiography, dividing the city's documentary past into separate linguistic archives that rarely dialogue with each other", they conclude.
Caspar Chan and Nathan Rubene dos Santos also understand that “these volumes offer new answers in historiographical terms, because they show with renewed clarity that the legal existence of Macau emerged through the transplantation and local adaptation of the Portuguese municipality [Évora] as a governing idea on an Asian border”.
“At its core, the archive poses a fundamental question that often remains implicit: what counted as ‘Portuguese territory’ in its smallest civic unit, and how could this unit be reconstructed overseas through privileges, positions and jurisdiction, after Portugal had become global from the 15th century onwards?”
Local management
Regarding the relationship between Portugal and China at the time, the authors state that the work shows how “relations between China and Portugal in Macau were not carried out mainly through formal diplomacy between two distant courts, but through the daily management of coexistence by local institutions, in conditions of unequal jurisdiction”.
The first volume of the book shows how “the king elevated Macau from a town to a city and confirmed the elections of councillors, judges and officials because the Captain-Major appointed to China frequently left for the annual trip to Japan, remaining only a short time there and leaving the settlement without continuous leadership”.
The original document reveals that “this situation was especially dangerous in China, given Macau's distance from India and the fact that supplies could only be made during the annual trip”. In this way, “municipal government is presented as a necessity: a frontier city could not wait for an absent commander nor could it allow disorder.”
Thus, the authors add, “the privileges, jurisdiction and civic positions granted to Macau describe a political logic as much as a legal one, since the Portuguese presence depended on a permanent local body capable of maintaining peace and managing risks in a space where the superior authority was distant”.
Regarding the permits, they show what maintaining the stability of the territory entailed, as “the survival of Macau depended on remaining within the limits tolerated by the Chinese authority”.
"The Twenty-sixth Alvará, for example, is explicit in stating that the Chinese mandarinate did not accept Portuguese jurisdiction over Chinese subjects, especially when Christian creditors sought to arrest Chinese debtors. The Senate describes the expenses and dangers caused when a mandarin was sent to enforce such determinations and requests a direct solution: preventing Christians from contracting credits with the Chinese and denying them recourse to both the Ombudsman and the Chinese courts, so that the city could 'live in peace’. The Crown confirms this approach”, they conclude.</description><pubDate>2026-02-05 05:40:30</pubDate></item><item><title>Elections | Portugal prepares to choose the next President of the Republic</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/17/eleicoes-portugal-prepara-se-para-escolher-o-proximo-presidente-da-republica/</link><description>Portugal goes to the vote on Sunday to choose the next President of the Republic. Of the 11 candidates, only two have representatives from Macau: Bessa Almeida from the PSD, and Neto Valente from the PS. The former president of the Macau Lawyers Association highlights that António José Seguro “does not join in provocations against China”, while Bessa Almeida considers that Marques Mendes is the right man for the moment


 
Eleven candidates will vote on Sunday to choose the next President of the Portuguese Republic, for a five-year term. This is a record number, with only seven having the support of political parties. Running for the position is Luís Marques Mendes, supported by the Social Democratic Party (PSD), and who appointed António Bessa Almeida as his representative in the Macao SAR. Next comes António José Seguro, with the support of the Socialist Party (PS), which has Jorge Neto Valente, president of the Macau Portuguese School Foundation and lawyer, as his representative. They are the only candidates for the Presidency of the Republic who chose figures as representatives of the Macao SAR.
The remaining candidates are Henrique Gouveia e Melo, João Cotrim de Figueiredo, Catarina Martins, António Filipe, André Ventura Jorge Pinto, Manuel João Vieira, André Pestana and Humberto Correia.
To HM, António Bessa Almeida, PSD activist and explained the reasons for supporting Marques Mendes. “At the time Portugal is going through, the country needs a candidate like Marques Mendes, who has a deep understanding of the different policies”, he began by pointing out.
Asked about the type of actions developed in Macau to attract the electorate to vote for Marques Mendes, Bessa Almeida simply mentioned that “the campaign in Macau is totally different from that in Portugal”, and the actions developed involve “what the candidate does in close proximity to the people, passing on information”.
For Bessa Almeida, “the electorate in Macau, on the Chinese side, is also made up of Portuguese”, and that “they have been following these elections like any other Portuguese, with confident visions for the future of Portugal”.
On January 6th, the president released a note highlighting the importance of Marques Mendes' candidacy, who is currently far from the top spots in the polls. "We have always been concerned with everything related to Portugal and at this moment, at a global level, political changes are sudden and unexpected. That is why we need a visionary president, experienced and thoughtful in guiding the destinies of Portugal and Portuguese people born and living outside the country."
 
A safe return
In Portugal, polls relating to the presidential elections have taken place almost daily, and show a change in the choice of candidates. If initially António José Seguro was somewhat removed from the top positions, a survey carried out by the Universidade Católica Portuguesa for RTP, Antena 1 and the Público newspaper, between the 6th and 9th of January and released this week, shows how Seguro is in a technical tie with André Ventura, Chega's candidate, guaranteeing 23 percent of voting intentions, when Ventura collects 24 percent. João Cotrim de Figueiredo comes in third place, with 19 percent, with the possibility of going to the second round of elections, followed by Marques Mendes and Gouveia e Melo with 14 percent.
Another survey, this time for TVI, CNN, TSF and Jornal de Notícias, with data collected on the 10th, 11th and 12th of January, shows Seguro with 23.9 percent of voting intentions, followed by Cotrim de Figueiredo with 20.8 percent and Ventura with 20.5 percent. Marques Mendes falls to fifth place, with 13.2 percent.
Seguro chose, in the Macao SAR, Jorge Neto Valente as his agent, who did not answer HM's call. In a statement published in the newspapers this Wednesday, the former president of the Macau Lawyers Association declared that Seguro “proposes a vision of the future based on the modernization of the country, the valorization of education and a focus on innovation”. Referring specifically to Portugal-China relations, Neto Valente highlights that “unlike other candidates, Seguro does not support China's provocations regarding the status of Taiwan, and is also a candidate who “knows Portugal, Europe and the world”.
Neto Valente also stated that Seguro “is a decent man”. “He participated in all debates, showed politeness, defended his ideas firmly, was never excessive in his language and, unlike others, did not insult opponents or make malicious insinuations toward them.”
 
A “consistent course”
Paulo Pisco, leader of the Insurance campaign for emigration, reminded HM that the candidate “even expressed the opinion that, given that it was an in-person vote [for the presidential elections], the Government could have done much more, namely complying with what the electoral law for the Presidency of the Republic says, which is the possibility of opening more polling stations”.
Seguro also defended, according to Paulo Pisco, “that mobility voting could also have been applied, based on the experience previously carried out in the last elections for the European Parliament”.
Paulo Pisco states that António José Seguro has followed a “very consistent, solid and objective path”, which has allowed him to reach the top of the polls. Regarding the emigrated electorate, the deputy highlights that Seguro “has not deviated from the purposes, form and values ​​with which he intends to exercise the Presidency of the Republic”.
Furthermore, it is “a guarantor of the stability of the political system and also of democracy”. “This image that the candidate António José Seguro has shown throughout his career has earned him greater receptivity from voters”, highlighted Paulo Pisco.
The president does not forget that “Seguro is the candidate who has the most representatives per country in our diaspora”. "There are 18, ten in Europe and eight outside Europe. I believe that this substantiates a very firm commitment from the candidate to the exercise of his functions as President of the Republic, and to the relationship he intends to have with the diaspora", he stressed.
Looking at the candidates lower down in the polls, we have many faces from the left. The same survey with data collected on the 10th, 11th and 12th of January places Catarina Martins, from Bloco de Esquerda, with 2.5 percent; followed by António Filipe, from PCP, with 1.4 percent, head to head with Jorge Pinto, from Livre, who has 1.3 percent. Manuel João Vieira, visual artist and musician, obtains 1 percent of voting intentions.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>HZM Border | Concession yields 1.2 million per month</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/12/fronteira-hzm-concessao-rende-12-milhoes-por-mes/</link><description>Sociedade Express Grupo Limitada will pay 1.2 million patacas monthly to the Macao SAR to operate the commercial areas of the Macau Border Post Building on the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge (HZM). The information was published yesterday in the official bulletin, where the contract was announced.
The contract has a duration of five years, meaning the final amount paid to the Macao SAR should be around 72 million patacas. The deadline starts from the effective start of exploration, which can happen until May 31st.
As part of the contract, the concessionaire commits to ensuring that 30 percent of the commercial space comes into operation, excluding self-service services. Furthermore, the company can change the space to expand commercial areas, but is obliged to maintain good business and hygiene conditions. If the commercial area is increased, the contract also provides for an increase in the monthly rent price, calculated according to the effective increase in space.
Sociedade Express Grupo was founded in 1999 in Macau and its main activity is operating pharmacies, linked to the Wan Tung brand, with around 30 spaces in the territory.
However, its activities also extend to travel agency services, and the company's portal guarantees that it is the main representative in Macau of Cebu Airlines, although it also has links with other companies such as China Eastern, China Southern, Eva Air, among others.</description><pubDate>2026-02-12 02:47:34</pubDate></item><item><title>Casinos | Taxes charged increase 15% in January</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/12/casinos-impostos-cobrados-aumentam-15-em-janeiro/</link><description>The gaming sector represented 85.6 percent of taxes collected in January, with a total of MOP8.2 billion. Tax revenues from the territory's main industry increased by 14.6 percent compared to January 2025, when they did not reach 7.2 billion patacas
Last January, the Government recorded 9.62 billion patacas in current revenue, 14.5 percent more than in January 2025. Of total current revenue, the portion corresponding to taxes on gaming concessionaires was more than 8.2 billion patacas, which represents 85.6 percent of all current revenue, according to data published on the Finance Services Directorate's website.
In comparative terms, tax revenue generated by casinos in January increased by 14.6 percent, compared to the same month in 2025, when they reached almost 7.2 billion patacas, a difference of more than 1,000 million patacas.
It is recalled that according to the new gaming concessions, which came into force for a decade on January 1, 2023, the tax on casinos' gross revenues was set at 40 percent.
When counting capital revenues (sale of facilities and equipment, financial assets, sale of shares and other holdings), total revenues from public coffers in January recorded almost 9.64 billion patacas.
The other side
Representing almost all public revenue, revenue from the gaming sector is crucial to the Macao SAR Budget. For now, the Government estimates that 2026 will end with gross revenues from the territory's casinos of around 236 billion patacas, which will give around 19.7 billion patacas per month. To achieve this goal, January has already exceeded the estimated monthly average of around 2.93 billion patacas, when the sector's gross revenues registered more than 22.63 billion patacas, 24 percent more compared to January 2025.
If a positive performance during the Chinese New Year holidays is confirmed, casino gross revenues could record an annual increase of around 18 percent in the first quarter of the year.
In terms of expenses, January data from the DSF reveals that personnel expenses were around 1.19 billion patacas, 0.17 percent less compared to January 2025. In relation to public expenses to pay transfers, support and allowances, around 2.8 billion patacas came out of public coffers in January, 0.35 percent more in annual terms.
Overall, January ended with revenues almost doubling expenses, with the balance for last month's financial year in positive territory at almost 5 billion patacas.</description><pubDate>2026-02-12 02:43:58</pubDate></item><item><title>Urbanism | City beautification follows Xi's spirit</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/12/urbanismo-embelezamento-da-cidade-segue-espirito-de-xi/</link><description>The Secretary for Administration and Justice, Wong Sio Chak, led the first meeting of the year of the City Beautification and Cleaning Working Group and highlighted that the tasks to be performed serve to “implement the spirit of President Xi Jinping's important speeches” during his visit to Macau, in December and 2024.

“It is important to launch incentive measures to encourage operators in the [airline] sector to explore more direct international routes, with priority being given to expanding the direct flight network with Portuguese and Spanish-speaking countries,” said Song Pek Kei, in an intervention at the Legislative Assembly (AL).
The Macau Civil Aviation Activity Law came into force this year, opening the door to the liberalization of the sector. Song Pek Kei stated that, with the entry into force of this legislation, the Government “must accelerate” the adjustment of the service structure and “make good use” of resources to develop more routes with stopovers and connections.
“Taking the experiences of other regions as a reference, it is important to launch incentive measures to encourage operators in the sector to explore more direct international routes,” he added.
Other requests
Song Pek Kei is not the first deputy to propose to the Government the creation of new air routes that connect the Chinese region to Europe. In December, Ip Sio Kai also defended the establishment of a direct air link with Lisbon, to promote business between Portuguese-speaking countries and Europe.
Ip suggested that the Government grant subsidies for the opening of this long-haul flight and launch promotions for accommodation, transport and cultural activities to attract tourists to Macau.
In response to Ip Sio Kai in the hemicycle, the president of the Civil Aviation Authority, Pun Wa Kin, stated that the Government “attaches great importance” to the development of aviation, “in particular its role in promoting economic diversification”.
“However, in commercial operations, airlines often consider market demand, operational costs, long-term benefits and the competitiveness of the route, before deciding to launch new flights”, declared Pun Wa Kin, to whom the Government Head of Transport and Public Works, Tam Vai Man, had handed over the prerogative of responding to the deputy.
When Ip suggested that the Government could subsidize the route, Pun responded that this support “involves different sectoral policies” and that “the Macao SAR Government needs to analyze the issue comprehensively, from all aspects”.</description><pubDate>2026-02-11 03:09:30</pubDate></item><item><title>The Dispute over Greenland (II)</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/12/a-disputa-pela-gronelandia-ii/</link><description>“Nations do not compete for land; they compete for the power that land unlocks.”
Halford J. Mackinder
The position of the European Union (EU) in the face of the United States' growing attention to Greenland, intensified during Donald Trump's presidency, generated concern and strategic reflection. Although Greenland has not been part of the EU since 1985, the island remains part of the Kingdom of Denmark, a Member State of the Union, which gives the issue an unavoidable political and institutional dimension. The European position thus results from the need to protect the territorial integrity of one of its members, to safeguard strategic interests in the Arctic and to preserve the stability of transatlantic relations.
The EU views Greenland as part of the broader European political space, not because of its formal membership, but because of its constitutional connection to Denmark. Any external attempt to acquire or exercise control over territory is interpreted as a direct interference with the sovereignty of a Member State. The American proposal to purchase the island was received in Brussels as a disruptive diplomatic gesture, which went beyond the traditional limits of cooperation between allies. The defense of Danish sovereignty constitutes the first pillar of the European position. The EU has reiterated that the territorial integrity of its Member States is non-negotiable and that any change to the status of a European territory requires full and voluntary consent from national and local authorities. The idea of ​​a territorial transaction, reminiscent of 19th century practices, contradicts contemporary principles of international law and European governance.
The EU recognizes the Arctic as a region of growing importance, both for its environmental relevance and its geopolitical value. The accelerated melting of ice, the opening of new maritime routes and access to strategic mineral resources transformed the region into a space for competition between great powers. The EU, which defines itself as a “global actor”, seeks to ensure that the Arctic remains a zone of peaceful cooperation, governed by multilateral norms and shared management mechanisms. American interest in Greenland is interpreted in Brussels as part of a broader strategy of military and economic assertion in the Arctic. Although the United States is a fundamental ally within NATO, the EU maintains reservations about unilateral initiatives that could alter the regional balance. The excessive militarization of Greenland, particularly through the possible installation of nuclear weapons, would be seen as a factor of instability, with a direct impact on European security.
Greenland has vast reserves of critical minerals, including rare earths, essential for the energy transition and the European technology industry. The EU has sought to reduce dependence on external suppliers, especially China, and sees cooperation with Greenland as an opportunity to strengthen its strategic autonomy. The American interest in controlling these resources raises concerns in Brussels, which fears an excessive concentration of power over vital supply chains. The EU argues that mining exploration in Greenland must be carried out in a sustainable, transparent manner and in partnership with European actors, guaranteeing benefits for the local population and avoiding predatory exploration practices.
The EU deeply values ​​the transatlantic relationship, but considers that strong alliances require mutual respect and predictability. The American proposal to acquire Greenland was interpreted as a gesture that disregarded European political sensitivity and put trust between partners at risk. Brussels sought, however, to avoid a diplomatic escalation. The European response combined firmness in defending Danish sovereignty with discursive moderation, in order to preserve strategic cooperation with Washington in areas such as defense, trade and international security. The EU stressed that dialogue on the Arctic should take place in multilateral forums and within the framework of NATO, and not through unilateral initiatives.
Trump's statements at the 2026 Davos Forum further intensified these tensions. Before global leaders, Trump stated that the United States “will not use force” to acquire Greenland, although he stressed that the country would be “frankly unstoppable” if it decided to do so. He added that “no other nation can defend Greenland” and that Washington intended to begin “immediate negotiations” to take control of the territory. In one of the most controversial passages, he declared: "We want a piece of ice to protect the world, and they won't give it. You can say yes and we will be very grateful, or you can say no and we will remember."
Trump also reinforced the historical narrative according to which the United States “saved Greenland” during World War II and insinuated that returning the territory to Denmark would have been a mistake. He repeated criticism of NATO, accusing European allies of contributing little to common security, and threatened to impose tariffs of 10% on several European countries, increasing to 25% if the sale of Greenland did not go ahead.  European reactions were immediate and firm. Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen considered it “positive” that Trump had taken the military option off the table, but stressed that “the president’s ambition remains intact” and that American pressure continued to be unacceptable.
In Brussels, the statements were interpreted as a rhetorical escalation that undermined trust between allies and sought to transform Greenland into an instrument of economic and strategic blackmail. European diplomats called the speech “bellicose” and “out of line with the spirit of cooperation” expected at the Davos Forum, noting that the threat of tariffs on EU Member States constituted a form of coercion incompatible with stable transatlantic relations. Denmark, although responsible for Greenland's foreign and defense policy, faces specific challenges in managing the territory. The island's growing autonomy, combined with interest from external powers, places Copenhagen in a delicate position. The EU has sought to support Denmark, strengthening its negotiating capacity and offering instruments for economic and scientific cooperation with Greenland. Brussels understands that the region's stability depends on a balanced relationship between Denmark's interests, the aspirations of the Greenlandic population and the need to avoid external interference that could compromise European security.
Therefore, the EU's position regarding the American interest in Greenland is based on three fundamental principles; the uncompromising defense of the sovereignty of a Member State; the preservation of stability and cooperation in the Arctic; and the protection of European strategic interests in critical resources and regional security.
Trump's statements in Davos reinforced the European perception that the issue goes beyond a mere territorial dispute, revealing an assertive American strategy that combines economic pressure, historical narrative and geopolitical ambition. Although it recognizes the importance of the transatlantic partnership, the EU rejects unilateral approaches that could weaken the European political balance or transform the Arctic into a stage for confrontation between great powers.
Greenland, located between continents and between logics of power, has become a test of the EU's ability to assert its strategic autonomy and protect its members in an increasingly competitive international context.</description><pubDate>2026-02-12 03:21:55</pubDate></item><item><title>The Prince of Denmark</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/11/o-principe-da-dinamarca/</link><description>This is an unpredictable and strange time of ours, but it is still at the level of comedy with scarlet hints of narrative. Very discursive, unspeakable in its eagerness to justify itself. Let's say that we don't feel any confidence in the fictional interpretations that each and every person wishes to transmit, nothing that narrates the genre that they insist on interpreting in an abuse of power for a non-fictional reality. There is undoubtedly a fictional paranoia in Europe that makes it the agent of something that tends not only to go wrong, but also to dilute it, a rinse of nervousness in a secret reigning madness. But what do the most elusive do? They play narratively like a cat with a full belly plays with a mouse: tormenting, and finally letting it go in an inglorious fight.
Hamlet appears on our horizon precisely to stop narratives and delve into tragedy, different genres that we should not capitulate to in search of new reverberations, which Slavs and Scandinavians seem more harsh, but their legends sometimes have a great poetic majesty. Today we might say that poem is an inhibiting genre in the face of the complex linguistic scheme of swearing uselessness, but it is much more than that, and it also includes a king of Tule, a wizard Merlin, and a strange King Arthur, Saxon...Celtic. Therefore, let narrators and narratives cease, that the literary genre has changed. A possible, fatal rupture is now emerging from the top of Europe, where the bewildered people of these societies further south are narrating meaningless things, and if we are all in agreement that none of this makes sense, quickly the most feared enemy dissipates and the dearest friend comes to the fore.
From a certain perspective we are all making Polonians “goodbye miserable fool, intruder and reckless!” a system that feeds on intentions without any capacity to avenge the death of a father.” L'oncle d'amerique” constrains the reserves that we had as aligned, and in an artificial maintenance we do things that only families can imagine, killing each other, which within each one is barbarously useless. The winter play testifies to the existence of a ghost, murdered with poison in the ear, and his son, Prince Hamlet, who recognizes his father in him, and as all ghosts are white, perhaps it was even in Greenland, where the murderer was still the brother of the victim, Prince Claudius. A barbaric signature that persists in legends and also in the weak imagination that is Europe today on the political and strategic narrative path that begins to poison the reigning acoustics.
Now, Hamlet follows the guidelines of a ghost, but destiny reveals itself to be much more ghostly in its definitions, and if the penguins are far from these white areas, there are those who see them as being outside of their habitat – these beings as tender as doves and with unusual loyalty – and in an immense and unrecognizable bad narrative we now find the soul of Claudius, the uncle that no family wants to find. The theater of life in a harsh moment where the crazy dialogue is not even considered a farce, will now be a challenge for any speaking being. Ofelia also mourns the death of her father, is abandoned by her cousin lover, and her entire life is a drama woven by men, a strange impossible condescension that makes these beings drivers of disaster in a winter cold. It is not the mermaid of Copenhagen, but the Prince of Denmark may or may not be, our closest “narrative”. Do it with respect. There are those who say that there are mysteries still undeciphered in the icy caps.
HAMLET
A killer! An infamous one! A slave not worth the twentieth part
A tenth of your first husband! A king of comedy in a vicious role!

Violators can face fines of up to HK$55,000 and be sentenced to imprisonment for up to three months.
On January 30, just six days after the law came into force, the Hong Kong Government announced its suspension. The amendment will be rewritten before being submitted to the Legislative Council for review.
Why was the law suddenly suspended six days after it came into force? The suspension was due to the occurrence of three incidents that gave rise to some reflection on the matter.
The first involved a passenger who was unable to unfasten his seat belt and was trapped for around 16 minutes. Twenty firefighters from the Fire Department were sent to help. After carrying out an inspection, Citybus Co. Ltd. discovered that aluminum foil had been placed inside the belt buckle, a suspected act of vandalism, and reported the incident to the police. This case demonstrated the potential risk of mandatory seat belt use during emergency evacuations and raised questions about whether passengers could cut their seat belts to escape in dangerous situations.
When reviewing or analyzing a law, it is crucial that there is “clear discernment and careful consideration.” If a passenger needs to escape following an accident and is unable to unfasten their seat belt, do they have the right to cut it to escape? In other words, could the law give people the right to damage other people's property in order to escape? Under Hong Kong law, damaging other people's property is a criminal offence. To convict a suspect, the prosecution will have to prove that the defendant intended to damage someone else's property and demonstrate his actions. If the purpose is to escape during an emergency, even if the belt breaks, there is no malicious intent to damage other people's property, and the person cannot be convicted under criminal law.
However, the situation is different with regard to civil law. Civil law establishes lower requirements than criminal law for the concept of “intent,” and in certain circumstances, it may accept the act of damaging another’s property to escape danger as an act to “Avoid an emergency.”
Because the law does not explicitly indicate whether passengers can cut their seat belts in these cases, the question arises as to whether passengers have the right to do so to escape and whether they must subsequently compensate the transport company for losses. Furthermore, if the passenger does not compensate the carrier, is the insurance company responsible? Currently, the law does not regulate this issue; To avoid controversy, perhaps future revisions to the law could do so. Without a clear answer in the future, any legislation from the Hong Kong Government will likely be subject to scrutiny.
The second incident occurred on January 27th. A passenger in a wheelchair, surnamed Zheng, caught the bus at the Tin Ma Court stop in Wong Tai Sin, Kowloon. Due to mobility problems, he asked the driver for help to fasten his seat belt. During this process, Zheng expressed concern about the way the belt held him, and asked the driver for explanations, which caused a delay in departure. Another passenger named Li, who was in a hurry to get to work, argued with Zheng. When Zheng picked up his cell phone to film the altercation, Li suddenly snatched the device from his hands and repeatedly hit him in the head with the phone.
It is believed that this was the first case to involve a person with special needs in a discussion regarding the use of seat belts on a bus and served to draw important lessons. It demonstrates that it is necessary to take special care with people who have special needs when putting on a seat belt. To solve the problem, the driver must first provide help and other passengers will have to be patient. Keeping quiet on public transport can avoid unnecessary conflicts. Ultimately, assisting people with special needs with seat belts and ensuring their safety during travel is an act of care and compassion, similar to providing priority seats.
Perhaps the Hong Kong Government could consider including a clause in the legislation to prevent malicious interference from third parties when the driver is helping a passenger to buckle up. This regulation would ensure that people with special needs can access public services, which is certainly consensual. Only by ensuring that those in need receive quick assistance and when possible the bus continues its journey can the problem be resolved. This regulation would benefit everyone.
In addition to reviewing the law, transport companies could provide training to drivers related to the mandatory use of seat belts, to learn how to better deal with these situations. They could also place information inside the buses about the provisions made in relation to the transport of people with special needs, ensuring that all passengers were aware. This would also benefit the image of carriers by providing higher quality services, as well as Hong Kong residents and society as a whole.
Next week we celebrate Chinese New Year. I wish all my readers a Happy New Year, good health and continued success for Hoje Macau newspaper. We will meet again on February 24th and at that time we will continue our discussion about the use of seat belts on buses.

We went to Portalegre to help some friends who were desperate about the destruction of their homes, like thousands of Portuguese people from North to South. Kristin, Leonardo and last Saturday in Marta, storms that have already caused 15 deaths. Three storms with lots of rain and wind that left Portugal in a state of calamity. Looking closely, it was a rainstorm similar to the many that happen in England and that does not leave thousands of people in despair and without everything they have managed to accumulate throughout a lifetime of work. One difference is that in Portugal government authorities never knew what planning is.
Plan what to do in case of a catastrophe, in case of floods, in case of earthquake, in case of a plane crash in Lisbon, in case of purchasing and storing a batch of generators if there is an energy blackout. Planning is a word unknown to those who govern. They worry about day to day life and the announcement of an airport in Alcochete, which should be operational there by the year 2045 and with a TGV from Lisbon to Badajoz.
In this last case of the TGV, it would be better if the Government had decided on a TGV between Beja and Lisbon and Beja airport was already operating as Lisbon's international airport. But let's go back to Portalegre and where several Alentejo residents told us, as an act of revolt and despair, similar to Leiria, Marinha Grande, Alcácer do Sal, Ourém, Coimbra or Régua, that “I won't vote even if they arrest me”. In fact, the second round of the presidential elections took place yesterday in most of the national territory, although some municipalities decided to postpone them due to a lack of minimum conditions to open polling stations.
The calamity that struck Portugal, some say is unprecedented, has been something horrible. Isolated villages, agricultural fields that disappeared, houses that flew away, hundreds of roofs that disappeared, factories where everything was destroyed and workers were unemployed for many months, thousands of fallen trees, hundreds of cars destroyed, floods of water that invaded houses, hotels and restaurants – some up to the ceiling, displaced homes, exhausted firefighters, a lady cooking in a cubicle for 300 families in a housing unit, marine boats non-stop transporting people who already had a house flooded, animals that were left without stables or kennels, food that did not reach certain populations.
There are still thousands of Portuguese people without energy, water and telecommunications. A tragedy that struck a people who never imagined such a catastrophe was possible. However, one very important aspect must be highlighted: solidarity. We remember, for example, the attitude of the people of Trás-os-Montes, particularly in Mirandela, where the Parish Councils got together and acquired tons of tiles that were taken to Marinha Grande in a 16-wheel truck facilitated by the owner. The solidarity between one another has been endless and has been a great display of humanism in the faces of those in government who simply visit the misfortunes experienced by the populations and who tomorrow are already planning their summer holidays in the Algarve or Punta Cana.
The first storm Kristin was recorded almost two weeks ago, but state support for those left with nothing may only arrive this week. Insurance companies are starting to “skate” when it comes to putting things in black and white regarding the payment of the losses that each citizen suffered due to the bad weather. Insurance companies should be subject to large fines when they do not comply with stipulations in favor of those affected. They only think about the annual profit…
And now? Experts ask about the future, if new Leonardos or Martas continue to appear? The Government must give a quick answer about the future and what it plans to reform so that something changes with positive decisions. And starting with the ‘Civil Protection’ institution, which does not have the humility to admit that its system is full of insufficiencies.
It was two weeks of horror, panic, suffering and loss. There were women and men who went more than four days without sleeping an hour. Looking around and just seeing water rising and destroying the refrigerator, the washing machine, the stove, the carpets and all the material values ​​that decorate a house was something very sad. Televisions showed the tears of men and women who were left with absolutely nothing. The country cannot continue like this, because the country is not poor, what exists are too many thieves.</description><pubDate>2026-02-09 03:51:48</pubDate></item><item><title>Bruno Pernadas releases album “unlike,maybe”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/12/bruno-pernadas-edita-album-unlikemaybe/</link><description>Guitarist and composer Bruno Pernadas, who has performed in Macau and the Greater Bay Area, releases “unlike, maybe” this week, an album with part of the songs created in collaboration with the musicians who accompany him, something he intends to do more of in the future.
After “Private Reasons”, released in 2021 and which ends a trilogy, Bruno Pernadas presents “a transition album”. “I'm still not being able to achieve what I wanted, but this is a necessary step for that to happen in the future”, he stated, in an interview with the Lusa agency, regarding “unlike, maybe”, to be published this Friday.
The process of creating the album served the musician to try to “detach from certain things that can be considered vices of resources and tools”, something that “is not such an immediate process”, as it is within himself.
The recordings were divided between Lisbon, where the musician lives, and Porto. In the ‘invicta city’, the musicians spent a few days in the same house “and this process was collaborative”. "More has already happened [on this album], but I want that to happen, in the future, that's all. There doesn't even need to be demos. Sometimes I don't have demos, I put everything on the agenda", he stated.
Other languages
The collaborative process allowed Bruno Pernadas to get closer to the language that for him “is closer to jazz, an idea that was left by the trends of Sun Ra, Don Cherry, Alice Coltrane, Art Ensemble of Chicago, The Last Poets – which is not quite jazz, but it is close”.
"I wanted to get closer to that language, with which I have a lot of relationship and which didn't happen on other albums. Even on my jazz album 'worst summer ever' [from 2016 and which opened the trilogy] this way of thinking like that wasn't realized. On this album ['unlike, maybe'] it already partially exists", he said.
The new album features the participation of musicians Margarida Campelo, António Quintino, João Correia, Diogo Alexandre, José Soares, Teresa Costa, Jéssica Pina and Eduardo Lála. Margarida Campelo also sings, and her voice is joined by those of guests Leonor Arnaut, Lívia Nestrovski and Maya Blandy.
Some are already part of the group that accompanied him in previous works, for others it was a debut. "It's like a cast. In cinema there are many directors who have a fixed cast, but sometimes another type of approach to the artistic object is needed and they form collaborations", he said.
In addition to playing, Bruno Pernadas is the composer, author and producer of “unlike, maybe”, sharing only one of the lyrics with Rita Westwood.
When he goes to the studio with the musicians, “things are more or less thought out”. "There are sections that I leave open for improvisations, thinking about the musicians who are going to record. I already know how people react and there are certain things that are done with that person in mind. There are other melodies and things that I do for the people that I invite to participate in certain songs", he shared.
In addition to studio recordings, Bruno Pernadas also incorporates recordings made at home, during the day and without acoustic isolation, into his albums.
"I always record things at home. At first I re-recorded, but then I stopped doing that, the sounds aren't bad, it's a clinical, surgical perspective of people listening to the music. It's not bad, that's how it turned out", he said.</description><pubDate>2026-02-12 03:19:38</pubDate></item><item><title>Valentine's Day | Macau Orchestra brings special concert</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/12/dia-dos-namorados-orquestra-de-macau-traz-concerto-especial/</link><description>This Saturday, the Macau Orchestra will take the stage at the Broadway Theater for a show that celebrates love and, more specifically, Valentine's Day.

The concert is described as “one of OM’s most colorful performances this season”, featuring “a parade of wonders”.
Melodies in March
Meanwhile, another concert starring OM was also announced for March 3rd, but this time in the Ruins of São Paulo. It is “Unforgettable Melodies in the Ruins of São Paulo” which aims to “celebrate the Lantern Festival with the public”.

When maximum capacity is reached, no more people will be allowed to enter. Viewers can also follow the live broadcast of the concerts through various online platforms.</description><pubDate>2026-02-12 03:18:06</pubDate></item><item><title>FRC | Challenges facing Macanese gastronomy today under debate</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/11/frc-desafios-da-gastronomia-macaense-hoje-em-debate/</link><description>The Rui Cunha Foundation (FRC) presents today, starting at 6:30 pm, another session of the new cycle of conferences under the theme “Being Macanese in the 21st Century – Culture, Tradition, Identity, Challenges”, with the third round table entitled “Macanese Gastronomy and the Challenges of its Dissemination”.
The session will be led by José Luís de Sales Marques, President of the Council of Macanese Communities, bringing together as guest speakers chefs Antonieta Manhão (Neta), professor of Macanese cuisine at the Macau Tourism University; Florita Alves, from La Famiglia Restaurant; Marina Senna Fernandes, from Restaurante Macaísta; and Sónia Palmer, from Cozinha D. Aida, four distinguished local representatives of the traditional culinary arts.
Macanese gastronomy is described in a statement about the event as having “originality, transporting its flavors and aromas to the four corners of the world, where the Portuguese traveled”, being the result of “harvesting from the global world and, therefore, deservedly considered the first fusion cuisine in the world”.
"It is, for this reason, also a unique landmark of the Macanese identity, and intangible heritage of Macau and the People's Republic of China, making a significant contribution to the classification of Macau, by UNESCO in 2017, as a Creative City of Gastronomy. However, there is still a long distance between recognition and its dissemination, making it accessible to the general public", says the event organizers
The session aims to address “the way of life of the Macanese, the community or communities, in Macau and in the diaspora, and their daily challenges to maintain the being and feeling of the Macanese reality”. The purpose of the conference is to promote a “constructive discussion looking at the present and the future, without forgetting the tradition and different identity landmarks, especially Gastronomy and Theater in Patuá, both Intangible Heritage of the Macao SAR and the People's Republic of China”.</description><pubDate>2026-02-11 02:52:41</pubDate></item><item><title>Aren Noronha collected testimonies that refer to the colonial period in Goa</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/11/aren-noronha-recolheu-testemunhos-que-remetem-para-o-periodo-colonial-em-goa/</link><description>Aren Noronha is studying for a master's degree in Portuguese and Lusophone Studies at the University of Goa and remembered to collect testimonies from people who had some connection to the language; This Thursday he presents a book containing 45 films, entitled “Lusophone Goa”.
When, last year, the 22-year-old, then in the first year of his master's degree, visited the Central Library of Goa, he came across “extremely interesting books from Goa and Macau, all in Portuguese and dating from the colonial period”, which confronted him with “questions about the history of the Portuguese language in Goa today”, he told Lusa.
“Like others of my generation, I had only a superficial idea about the situation in Goa and the decline of the language”, acknowledged Aren, when he came across that bibliographic collection, which he could barely read.
His parents suggested that he delve deeper into “these questions” and it was they who gave him the idea of ​​collecting “first-person stories, which could become a book, if there were enough answers”, says the master's student, explaining that his father has a small independent publishing house in Panjim, capital of the state of Goa.
Good surprise
In February 2025, Aren sent “a conceptual note” to “many people who had some connection to the language, asking if they would like to share their testimonies” and received “a surprising number of positive responses”, 45 in total, which he then organized into an equal number of chapters throughout the 294 pages of “Lusophone Goa”, written in English.
The testimonies collected are as diverse as the sources are dispersed, both in geographical terms and due to the occupation of each of the voices or the age group of the reporters, uniting them only by the fact that they are Goans or descendants of Goans and have a story to tell about the “relationship with the language”, which in all cases goes far beyond the borders of linguistics.
Aren Noronha collected 45 life stories and each one made up a film. The cardiologist and writer based in the United States, Anthony Gomes, and the former curator of the Central Library of Goa, Pia Rodrigues, talk about school and university life in the former Portuguese colony before 1961, as well as the books and magazines that circulated then.
Life stories
The Goan doctor in Brazil, Carlos Peres da Costa, also remembers his student days, but emphasizes that the manuals he used to complete the course at the then Medical-Surgical School of Goa were written in French, Spanish and English.
Writer Ben Antão, based in Canada, faced difficulties learning Portuguese at school, before 1961, because the method was based on memory. Musician Dilip Chico, based in Australia, remembers that the family read the daily “O Heraldo” in Portuguese and wrote letters and postcards in Portuguese to family members in Bombay, corrected by their grandmother.
The pretext of each of the stories is language, but they all reveal intimacy, even those with a more scientific content, such as that of Sandra Ataíde Lobo, researcher at the Center for Humanities, at the Faculty of Social and Human Sciences of Universidade Nova de Lisboa, who, based on her grandmother's writings, analyzes the role that Portuguese-language newspapers and periodicals played in Goa as an intellectual space, and the way in which literacy in Portuguese contributed to the development of Konkani writing in characters Romans.
“A language is not just words and phrases”, writes Sharmila Pais, History teacher at St Xavier’s College, in Mapuçá, in the state of Goa. “Portuguese makes me me”, seems to respond Omar de Loiola Pereira, a musician from Goa.
Aren Noronha is not of Portuguese descent. He has been part of a family of “local converts from Goa” for “eight or ten generations”. "I come from a family that is mostly English-speaking, but multilingual. My parents don't speak Portuguese; my grandparents, however, spoke Brazilian Portuguese, as they lived in Cubatão [a municipality in the state of São Paulo] for a decade", he tells Lusa, or rather, he writes, because he can "think better and respond".
Aren also never visited any Portuguese-speaking country. He is thinking about “going to Daman” soon,” he says, but he is “in contact with the Open University and the University of Macau to explore possibilities of doing a PhD in Lusophone Studies” at one of the two institutions, he adds. “If I have the opportunity, I would really like to go to a Lusophone country,” he says.</description><pubDate>2026-02-11 02:50:36</pubDate></item><item><title>Light Rail | Correspondence with buses later this year</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/12/metro-ligeiro-correspondencia-com-autocarros-ainda-este-ano/</link><description>Anyone who takes a public bus after leaving the Light Metro will have a discount on the fare, similar to what happens with buses. The measure will be implemented later this year. Rail transport will also have turnstiles and electronic payments
This year, the Directorate of Services for Traffic Affairs (DSAT) will implement fare matching between the Light Metro and public buses, allowing you to pay a discounted ticket for the second transport between the Light Metro and the bus, or vice versa.
The measure should start this year, confirmed yesterday the deputy director of DSAT, Mok Soi Tou, to the microphones of Forum Macau, on the Chinese channel of Radio Macau.
The issue of correspondence was raised by a listener and the head of DSAT said that the correspondence will be carried out taking advantage of two moments. “We will take advantage of the opportunities to update access machines (turnstiles) to the Light Metro and the renewal of public bus concession contracts, to start correspondence this year”, said Mok Soi Tou.
The official added that bus routes will be adjusted as more Light Rail stations are opened, and that bus stops and pedestrian facilities will be improved and provided with information on transport correspondence.
Open doors
The head of DSAT highlighted that since the creation of the Light Metro, bus routes have always been adapted as new stations open. The opening of the metro station at Portas do Cerco will lead to many changes to the bus routes that serve the busiest point for people in the territory. The deputy director expects that the majority of tourists entering Macau will use the Light Metro to get to Cotai.
For his part, the director of the Macau Light Rail Society, Ng Keng Chung, said that the installation of turnstiles is scheduled for the third quarter of this year, allowing payment platforms to be used via QR code, similar to what happens on buses. MPay, Alipay and WeChat Pay applications will be accepted.
The replacement of turnstiles will not be done all at once, and Light Metro stations will now have automatic ticket machines that accept electronic payments.
DSOP director Lam Wai Hou did not rule out the possibility of the Light Metro network having more than six lines and maintained the forecast that the Eastern Line would be opened in 2029.</description><pubDate>2026-02-12 02:54:45</pubDate></item><item><title>Ruins of S.

Last year, BNU managed to reduce losses related to non-performing loans
Banco Nacional Ultramarino (BNU) in Macau yesterday announced a 26.3 percent drop in net profits in 2025, the second consecutive year in which the financial institution's revenues shrank. According to a statement, the bank recorded unaudited net profits of 431.2 million patacas, 153.9 million patacas less than in 2024.
BNU had already recorded a 0.4 percent drop in revenue in 2024. The bank pointed out as the main reason for the drop in profits a reduction of 13.9 percent (138 million patacas) in the net financial margin, the difference between income from loans and interest paid on deposits.
BNU indicated that the net financial margin shrank, “driven mainly by the evolution of interest rates”. This is after the Macau Monetary Authority approved three cuts in the main reference interest rate in 2025, the last of which was a cut of 0.25 percentage points, introduced on December 11, following in all cases the North American Federal Reserve.
The reduction in net financial margin “was partially offset” by a 2.3 percent increase in commissions charged by the bank, “reflecting greater customer engagement”.
Malparado weighed
BNU also indicated that it suffered losses of 30 million patacas with non-performing loans and financial investments, 15.3 percent less than in 2024.
“This reduction reflects prudent risk management and the stable quality of the bank's assets, supported by conservative credit practices and a robust provisioning margin maintained throughout the year”, guaranteed the institution.
“BNU’s capital and liquidity position remains strong, supported by disciplined financial management and a robust risk control system”, indicated the bank.
BNU is headquartered in Macau and belongs to the Caixa Geral de Depósitos Group (CGD), being, together with the Bank of China, a currency issuer in Macau. According to official data, Macau banks achieved profits of 7.34 billion patacas in 2025, almost double that recorded in the previous year (92.7 percent more). Non-performing loans fell 11.6 percent over the past year to 49.7 billion patacas. It was the first annual drop in non-performing loans since 2013.
Overdue loans represented 4.9 percent of Macau banks' loans, 0.6 percentage points less than at the end of 2024. A percentage that rises to 5.6 percent in the case of credit to institutions or individuals outside the region.
The European Banking Authority, the EU regulatory agency, for example, considers that banks with at least 5 percent of non-performing loans have “high exposure” to risk and must establish a strategy to resolve the problem.
Even so, the percentage of overdue bank credit in Macau is far from the record of 25.3 percent reached in mid-2001, in the midst of the global economic crisis caused by the bursting of the speculative bubble of companies linked to the Internet.</description><pubDate>2026-02-12 02:48:57</pubDate></item><item><title>Pearl Metropolis | Age kept potential buyers away</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/12/pearl-metropolis-idade-afastou-potenciais-compradores/</link><description>After it was revealed that only 338 of the 1,932 Pearl Horizon victims went ahead to purchase a replacement home in the Pearl Metropolis building, Franky Fong Wai Hong, president of the Macau Real Estate Agents Association, explained that the low rate of buyers was due to several factors and not just the price of new homes.
To the newspaper Exmoo, Fong indicated that more than 10 years have passed since the families committed to buying houses in Pearl Horizon and the construction of Pearl Metropolis. Over time, the availability of families to ask for bank loans has changed considerably, because they will have fewer years to pay the requested amount.
Furthermore, it was also indicated that the criteria for accessing loans for the purchase of housing have become more stringent.
Franky Fong Wai Hong also indicated that people who needed to buy a home 10 years ago were not willing to wait so long for new apartments, which also contributed to the decrease in interest.
Even so, if the public capital company Macau Renovação Urbana intends to sell the remaining houses on the market, Franky Fong Wai Hong admitted that current prices are high and that it may be necessary to reduce them to attract buyers.</description><pubDate>2026-02-12 02:45:55</pubDate></item><item><title>Real Estate | Agency expects exemption effects after 1st quarter</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/11/imobiliario-agencia-espera-efeitos-de-isencao-apos-1-o-trimestre/</link><description>The director of the Sun City real estate group says that so far the market has not yet reflected the tax exemptions launched by the Government, but believes that the effect will begin to be felt after the first quarter of 2026. The person in charge pointed to the sacrifice of profits and reduction of inventory as factors that led to the slight increase in sales
The sacrifice of profits and the need to reduce property inventories for new homes may explain part of the tenuous recovery in apartment sales in Macau, explains the director of the Sun City real estate group, Lei Choi Hong. The person responsible points out that these tactics are used to attract buyers and get them to exchange their home for a larger one.
Speaking to the newspaper Cheng Pou, the director of the real estate group explained the sector's “survival tactics”, at a time when she says the effects of stamp duty exemptions, among other incentives launched by the Government, have not yet been felt in the market.
Despite public measures, Lei Choi Hong does not expect improvements in sales before the end of March. However, since the second half of last year, the person in charge considers that the market has improved slightly, with more customers visiting properties and sales registering a slight increase. The drop in property prices also slowed down, especially after the Government announced measures for the real estate market.
The increase in activity in the sector, from the real estate director's perspective, may indicate a tendency for consumer confidence to recover, although there are still many reticences due to fears of instability in the work environment and the ability to pay mortgages.
Inversion of the paradigm
Regarding the type of apartment, Lei Choi Hong reports the greater interest among buyers in small and medium-sized houses, taking into account the size of households and the financial capacity to pay bank loans.
Another factor listed by the person in charge is the tendency, which began to be felt during the pandemic, of Macau residents beginning to prefer renting a house instead of buying it, a reversal that reflects the loss of confidence in the market.
Lei Choi Hong hopes that optimizing the visa policy for large investors will attract capital to the region, in order to revitalize the luxury segment of the real estate market, as well as qualified professionals from technology sectors. In this chapter, he suggested that the Government increase the capital criteria for investment projects, for example, requiring candidates to purchase properties with a minimum value of 10 million patacas.</description><pubDate>2026-02-11 02:41:52</pubDate></item><item><title>ZELENSKY VS ZELENSKY</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/31/zelensky-vs-zelensky/</link><description>10/27/22
A Ukrainian pensioner, with the same name as the president, blames Zelensky for the prolongation of the conflict that destroyed his village. Zelensky, the villager, who never left his land, is now mortified because his favorite gravedigger died in the bomber.
This Zelensky, a villager, represents half the world that recriminates the other Zelensky, the villain, for not wanting to negotiate with Putin.
Negotiate what? The invader enters our house, covers his wife and daughter (cf. recent UN report on the rapes in Ukraine, in this “special operation”), an act that forced us to watch, and then we say to him: hi there, we are for peace, but we have to negotiate: you still haven't said what name you want to give the children!
A peace that is not dignified is nothing more than a cessation of rights. As serious as the Russophobia that Putin inflicts on his people.

At a lunch with several guests, I heard a friend, who declared herself a spiritualist, explaining the particularities of her belief, in a calm and balanced way, I would even say, without a hint of “irrationalism”. He spoke at length and serenely, devoid of any fanatical proselytism. “Here is someone whose belief has brought thoughtfulness!” I thought, a rare alliance.
However, at a certain moment a sentence comes out that horrifies me. He says, “there is no chance, nothing happens by chance!”, and I glimpse the voracious maws of holism. Because holism has a pathological aspect, like all good things, a shadow side.
Two examples: in Hinduism there is less sensitivity to existential dramas, if that child suffers in this life this is just an expression of rigorous karmic symmetry, an effect of the acts he committed in his previous life. In Africa, it is not accepted that death could have been accidental, and many women are accused by the family of the deceased of having caused the death of their husband, in an act of manifest dementia, and, in the blatant majority of cases, a huge injustice for the wife — madness that spreads and infiltrates the social fabric.
Buddhism introduced Compassion and Christianity introduced Caritas, trying to break with this logic, but in many other beliefs and religions the cage of causalities prevails over sensitivity to experience, the need to respond to the now.
It is a tremendous logic that transforms the world into a Platonic stage, where we are nothing more than the shadows of something — an inextricable law -, in a determinism that calcifies all singularities, but that strangely fascinates many.
The conquest of modernity was anchored in the conquest of chance and randomness, removing the incidences of a life from this fierce determinism that enclosed the world in a web. When the Renaissance freed the body from the influence of the stars, at that moment sexuality was relieved of guilt and individualism and its volition were able to emerge.
There is an unequivocal moral implication in the phrase “there is no such thing as chance, nothing happens by chance!”, which should function as a key to self-knowledge and self-judgment, however, this phrase is usually used to seek a reason for things outside of us, in others. It's an alibi.
Today there is a holistic temptation in the world, just as there was a satanic temptation in the Middle Ages, without much reflection on its consequences. Because it's not enough to want to connect everything in a resonant chain of affection. Even for the most unexpected: affection itself can kill.
I realize, thanks to that cultured, balanced, intelligent woman, that “the fight” took place at the beginning of this century. One of the great mistakes of the 20th century was the false dichotomy between “rationalism and irrationalism”, a debate that extended to all fields, including art. First, rationality (the positive side of reason) was confused with rationalism (the pathological aspect of reason), and articulated in this lack of discernment, irrationalism was confused with freedom. Almost all 20th century art, with Surrealism at its head, made this mistake. The fallacy still exists despite the emergence of “irrationalism” and the consequent relativist currents that followed it having been consolidated everywhere. Essentially, much of what happened in the 20th century revolved around this clash between two paradigms: Rationalism versus Irationalism.
Now, I see, we must save indeterminacy, chance, randomness from the terrible temptation of the cage of causalities. Holism, in its pathological form, may be reductionism that sets itself up as a new “eschatological narrative”.
Is it “by chance” that holism emerges at a time when neo-liberalism and its cynical contempt for the human person is besieging everything, all freedoms, all acquired rights?
Holistic awareness has brought a positive impact to greater ecological awareness, but followed with scholastic rigor, it stifles reality under the blanket of a determinism that is much more than uncomfortable: all great authoritarian ideologies are holistic.
My friend will know how to combine her holistic and transpersonal belief with the freedom and responsibility that each moment asks of us — but how many will make the distinction, under a Law that explains and encompasses everything?
How many will abandon themselves to what is?
The awareness of the indeterminate brings tragic awareness, as the Greeks knew, but it also brings agency and the courage of decision. And we cannot give up on this.
Furthermore, as Drummond shows in the poem “Quadrilha”, by Carlos Drummond de Andrade:
«João loved Teresa who loved Raimundo/ who loved Maria who loved Joaquim who loved Lili/ who didn't love anyone./ João went to the United States, Teresa to the convent,/ Raimundo died of a disaster, Maria stayed with her aunt,/ Joaquim committed suicide and Lili married J. Pinto Fernandes/ who had not entered the story.»
Real always runs outside the track, completely outside our concepts. That's what matters to us — a J. Pinto Fernandes emerges at the exact moment when we thought we had everything under control.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>From Nobel and others</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/17/do-nobel-e-outros/</link><description>9/10/22
When reading many people's reactions when this year's Nobel Prize for Literature was announced, I couldn't help but remember this comment from Jean-Pierre Siméon, in relation to another Nobel Prize: «An editor of a large national daily newspaper wrote five lines of indignation at the fact that the Nobel Prize for Literature had been awarded to Thomas Traströmer, a complete stranger. But unknown to whom? How did it not occur to this literary columnist, patented and paid to do his job, that his apparent ignorance was a matter of professional misconduct? Tranströmer had been translated into many languages, it was available in French.»
There is always the chorus of those who wait for the Prize to be announced to complain about not having been invited to be on the jury, there is a subgroup of angry people who profess “I have never read it and I won’t even bother to read it”; It is a less than humble fauna, the one that inhabits social networks.
I don't always know all the winners – I didn't know about the existence of Louise Glück, who I think is a great poet, or Olga Tokarczuk, for example – but this only brings me the comfort of knowing that the world is not a soap opera where everyone knows everyone else and the joy of recognizing that the measure of the world is not measured with my short measure and that, on the contrary, it gives me a new opportunity to face the unknown and learn from it.
And perhaps the most stupid reaction was that of the intelligent man who wrote, But are there still people who read French?; simply confirming that today there is a new type of ignorance that is being raised with abandon: that of those who only read English.
I would also prefer that, in French, Pascal Quignard, Linda Lê or even Sollers were awarded, or, among the new ones, Mathias Énard, but that does not detract from the dignity of Annie Ernaux's work (and it would have been enough to have written “Les Années”). There are books of hers that I like less, like the vulgar “Uma Paixão Simples”, but that happens with almost all authors, they have pivotal books and others that are like breaks in their itinerary. I recommend reading a beautiful book of interviews with her, “L’écriture comme un couteau”.

Yesterday an article appeared in the morning newspaper “Notícias”, in Maputo, reporting that the Pen Club Narrative Prize had been awarded to my wife, Teresa Noronha, for her soap opera “Tornado”, which had already won the Maria Velho da Costa Prize.
The summary they made of the book does not even deserve comments, as it is pathetic, but what is important to highlight is the note of disqualification regarding its “Mozambicanness” when they call it Luso-Mozambican. It's not that it's inaccurate, but, for those who know the context, it's a touch naughty.
Because finally, following the same logic, Adelino Timóteo should be called Tsonga-Mozambican, Álvaro Taruma Ronga-Mozambican, and writers from the north Macua-Mozambican, etc., etc. Which doesn't appear to happen.
At one point, in the novel, she writes:
«Our color was never the dominant one. In colonial times we were not white, we were dressed in monhés, mugs of washed asses, the pejorative term to speak of a son of Goan and Portuguese. In the post-colonial period, I was not black and if, in Lisbon, they took me for Brazilian or Cape Verdean, in France they were lost in thought about where I was from and were surprised when they discovered that I was African. There I had to explain the wanderings of my DNA before settling in Mozambique. It took me a long time to accept that it was like that because yes, and that it was no curse that that was the case; on the contrary, I could even discover intense patterns of fantasy and freedom in this harlequin cloak that is our genealogy…”
In modern-day Mozambique, it means being white… and that immediately takes precedence over what you do or what you are.
It's sad, but as Naipaul warned, in these parts race is everything and people live as deeply immersed in it as, in other places, in religion.

Bruno Latour, an anthropologist who studied the sciences and their procedures and legitimations, law, technique and religions and who entertained himself by turning his back on the dogmas of the “moderns”, has died. For him, the place, the role of the specialist, was defined more by the perplexity he embodied than by the supposed truth that would sustain him.
He proposed, as an alternative to the goodness of multiculturalism and its equivocal cliché “all different, all equal”, a return to “diplomacy”, given that this, precisely, does not start from the assumption that “we are unified because we share the same nature” but simply highlights that we “still do not share a common world”; It is necessary that we deal head-on with the “abyss of disagreement” that separates us, instead of trying to deceive it.
And about politics he said, boldly:
«If transparency is demanded from politicians, we kill them; if anyone demands fidelity to what the other was or what he says, kill him; If a mimetic relationship is required between what the crowd wants and what its representative says, representation is killed. These must therefore, by definition, betray, deceive, modify, distort the word. Without this ability to bend the word and betray, political language would not exist. I put forward the perfectly plausible hypothesis that political vocabulary will become as inaccessible as the religious language of the last twenty, three or fifty years.» (in “Un Monde Pluriel mais Commun”). I believe we will be needed to decipher this frantically complex world that has fallen to us.</description><pubDate>2022-10-17 02:18:03</pubDate></item><item><title>Fuxi</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/30/o-fuxi/</link><description>O my friends, companions of these disastrous journeys through countries as old as the stars and the Moon, and as strange as the deepest interior of our wretched souls, what surprises still await us, what secret magics will we still have to overcome, what horrors will arise before our pupils dilated with astonishment and terror?
Increasingly closer to our precarious existences, howls the monster of war, which threatens to merge humanity once and for all with the earth, incessantly traversed by the squalid specter of hunger and the invisible evil of ten thousand pestilences.
Oh damned human, who believes you are superior to Nature itself, but then you reveal yourself, time and time again, incapable of simply ordering your existence and do not understand that you are possessed by fickle anger and are a slave to your own ambition! You are not satisfied with white jade or resplendent gold, there is no treasure that quenches your inextinguishable thirst for command over other men, animals and things; for eternal anguish dwells in you; in you the expelled serpents crawl; for you grows, powerful and impressive, the most fertile ivy of Evil!
This is perhaps why on the Mount they call the White Deer, where one of the eight immortals on a sacred mount soared through the heavens towards Penglai, lives the fuxi, a bird whose shape resembles that of a rooster, although topped by a human head. What strange copulations, what monstrous embraces, what terrible procedures must have occurred to make the existence of this sinister animal possible? We don't know, but all it takes is for our exhausted mind to dare to come up with an answer, and then we feel our skin covered in horrendous goosebumps and our heart races in parade, like a wild horse whipped by the night whip of fear, unresponsive to reins and containment.
Let men refrain from visiting Monte do Veado, because although there are riches capable of calming the wildest ambitions, if they have the unfortunate luck of catching a glimpse of a fuxi, it is certain that a war will soon break out and the cultivated fields will perish, because of it the tame animals will be beheaded, because of it the best young men of two generations will be sacrificed and the pride of the countries will be destroyed.
The fuxi makes a sound reminiscent of its name. If you hear it, dark night or clear day, be on your way, because the path you are on is the surest path to misfortune!</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Procrastinators Club</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/29/clube-dos-procrastinadores/</link><description>While rereading Easter, because of an article I'm preparing, I come across this excerpt, taken from “The Universal Man”:
«Each man, morally, is one and absolute; but he has to live with attenuating his personality. (…) Coexistence is only possible between people reduced to a negative or hollow presence, which constantly gives way. Hence, the emptiness of society, an immense ghost made up of countless dead people. A superior man is antisocial or criminal. His destiny is prison and the desert”.
I hesitate to think whether Pascoaes reflects here on the political-social conditions that muzzle, and, worse, in a sad country like Portugal in the middle of the Estado Novo (and the book is from 1931) where any possibilities of spontaneity and frankness in human relationships were restricted, or if it merely lends to the behavior of (oppressed) men a metaphysical framework, an “essence”, declared in the presumption of each being, in isolation, “one and absolute”. Sometimes, in addition to an excess of Spirituality (or Saudade), Pascoaes lacks the world. He is a great poet, but he is a poet who takes Ampoules-of-Great-Ideas and who therefore writes often trapped by a programmatic furor, ceasing to have pores; It is not uncommon for a glass to be erected between him and reality, the same glass that made him write in O Bailado, from 1921: «Everything is a ghost. There are only clouds, clouds of voices, clouds of souls, of afflictions and tragedies! Clouds and more clouds, appearances and more appearances! And a divine lightning that pierces them, the instantaneous Apparition that appears and throws us to the ground, dazzled!»
Sometimes I felt like reminding him, as António Sérgio did, in the article “Regeneration and Tradition, Moral and Economy”, which he dedicated to Pascoaes: «Pascoais, Pascoais my dear friend: you are a pure, excellent and noble poet, but also a victim of this social environment, like us all: of this horrible isolation that you praise and I curse».
«As a child, he stole two blackbirds», says Jacinto do Prado Coelho, he stole them from a nest, and he felt remorse for that all his life. The Person, few more mischiefs are known to him. Only in Álvaro de Campos does a hint of wickedness and obscenity emerge: «Ah, and the ordinary and dirty people, who always look the same,/ Who use swear words as usual words,/ Whose sons steal from grocery store doors/ And whose daughters at the age of eight – and I think this is beautiful and I love it! –/ Decent-looking men masturbate in stairwells.” (Triumphal ode).
Both poets, driven by a certain idea of ​​sanctity, had the same inability to break the siege of their skin with the overflow of someone else's dam, the same curse of sublimating the concrete ferocity of eros with the gentleness of the verses.
Obviously, they are both “bigger than life”, but sometimes it makes me unnerved to watch, from my position as a hatter at the Procrastinators Club, the tantrums between them, just to see who occupies, in the internal organization, the place of President and Treasurer.
Although Pessoa guessed more things, for example, what he wrote in the lesser-known Ode Martial and which is reflected in the situation we live in today, deferred, with his heart in his hands:
«MARTIAL ODE
(…)
Helahoho! helahoho!
The poor widow's sewing machine who was bayoneted...
She sewed indefinitely in the afternoon…
The table where the old people played,
Everything mixed, everything mixed with bodies, with blood,
All one river, one wave, one dragging horror.
Helahoho! helahoho!
I unearthed the child's tin train pressed into the middle of the

And I cried like all the mothers in the world about the horror of life.
My pantheistic feet tripped over the sewing machine
[widow who was killed with a bayonet
And that poor instrument of peace stuck a spear in my heart.
Yes, I was the one to blame for everything, I was the soldier for them all
Who killed, raped, burned and broke,
It was me and my shame and my remorse like a shadow
[misshapen
They travel around the world like Ashavero,
But behind my steps there are footsteps the size of infinity
And a physical fear of being accountable to God makes me close my eyes.
[eyes suddenly.

I ordered, captain, to shoot the trembling peasants,
I let the daughters of all fathers tied to trees be raped,
Now I saw that it was inside my heart that all this happened,
And everything scalds and suffocates and I can't move without it
[everything be the same.
God have mercy on me, I didn't have it from anyone!

ByteDance's new artificial intelligence model presents itself as a turning point in the film and television sectors
Chinese technology company ByteDance has attracted the attention of users and investors after launching an artificial intelligence model for video generation that analysts say “exceeds expectations in terms of realism”.
The new application, called Seedance 2.0, was launched this weekend, and its capabilities have already resulted in significant rises in the stock market for companies, not only in the technology sector, but also in the entertainment industry, with some of them reaching the daily earnings limit in recent sessions.
According to economic news portal Caixin, this model is capable of generating realistic images with fluid movements, also adding sounds that coincide with the images, which for the first time puts ByteDance in a position to compete with KlingAI, developed by the short video platform Kuaishou.
Feng Ji, producer of the popular video game Black Myth: Wukong, described Seedance 2.0 as “the most powerful video generation model yet,” and predicted a major impact on reducing production costs for film and television, as well as other types of content.
The official Seedance 2.0 portal states that the big difference compared to similar models is its ability to maintain the coherence of the characters in different scenes.
New chapter
According to analysts at Kaiyuan Securities, cited by the Bloomberg agency, this new model could mark a turning point in the use of AI in film and television: "The test results are impressive. It supports text, image, video and audio input, and has achieved significant progress in crucial capabilities."
Feng also warned of the risks of the proliferation of fake videos generated by these types of services, which could lead to a crisis of trust: “Realistic fake videos will be available to everyone, and intellectual property and supervision systems will face unprecedented challenges.”
"In the future, any video content that does not have an official and authorized backing – especially those with personal images and voices – may be fake. Please be sure to verify them through multiple channels to avoid being scammed," the producer wrote on social media.
Seedance 2.0 did not reach the market in isolation, as its great local rival, the aforementioned KlingAI, launched its 3.0 version on the 4th, with intelligent framing and the ability to add new images and people to the original video as major attractions.</description><pubDate>2026-02-12 03:15:46</pubDate></item><item><title>CNOOC starts searching for hydrocarbons in Mozambique in March</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/12/cnooc-inicia-em-marco-procura-de-hidrocarbonetos-em-mocambique/</link><description>The Mozambican Energy Minister, Estêvão Pale, assured that the Chinese state oil company CNOOC will begin exploring for hydrocarbons in March with the drilling of up to six blocks of the concession awarded in the sixth tender, launched in 2021.
"They will start very soon. In March, they will start preparing to start exploration", said the Minister of Mineral Resources and Energy, Estêvão Pale, questioned by journalists at the Mining Indaba conference, which has been taking place since Monday in Cape Town, South Africa.
“Right now, we are in the initial phase, five to six more blocks”, he also replied, regarding the drilling holes to be carried out by the Chinese National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) in deep waters of the Rovuma Basin, north of the country.
The previous Mozambican Government approved on March 26, 2024 five terms of concession contracts for the production of hydrocarbons – essentially natural gas – in the country, the then spokesperson for the Council of Ministers announced at that time.
“As part of the implementation of the mineral resources policy (…), the Government of Mozambique continued with actions aimed at seeking more investments for the oil sector”, said the Government spokesperson at that time.
In December 2022, the National Petroleum Institute announced the award of these blocks to CNOOC, as a result of the sixth tender for gas and oil prospecting, launched on November 25, 2021.
On the ground
The current Minister of Energy, Estêvão Pale, questioned at the same event, assured that, for now, Mozambique has no plans for a new round of auctions for oil and gas blocks.
"Not now, because we think that there are still many areas for direct negotiations, which were part of the last round, that have not been developed. We now have the opportunity to continue discussions and see if we can find another potential partner", he said.
Mozambique has three development projects approved to explore natural gas reserves in the Rovuma basin, classified among the largest in the world, off the coast of Cabo Delgado.
Eni's Coral Sul project is the only one in operation since 2022, and investment in a second floating platform for extraction, called Coral Norte, was approved last October, in an investment of 7.2 billion dollars, which from 2028 will allow production to be doubled to 7 million tons per year (mtpa) of liquefied natural gas.
After four years of suspension due to the terrorist attacks in Cabo Delgado, the $20 billion Mozambique LNG project (Area 1), operated by TotalEnergies, officially resumed last January and is expected to produce up to 13 mtpa from 2029, followed by the $30 billion Rovuma LNG project (Area 4), operated by ExxonMobil, with 18 mtpa expected after 2030, and whose final investment decision is expected this year.</description><pubDate>2026-02-12 02:59:44</pubDate></item><item><title>Economy | Inflation eases as food prices fall</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/12/economia-inflacao-abranda-com-queda-nos-precos-dos-alimentos/</link><description>Inflation in China slowed down in January, after reaching the highest value in the last three years in December, mainly influenced by the fall in food prices, according to official data released yesterday.
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 0.2 percent year-on-year in January, a slowdown from the 0.8 percent recorded in December, according to China's National Bureau of Statistics.
Food prices fell 0.7 percent in January, reversing the 1.1 percent rise recorded in the previous month. The prices of non-food products rose 0.4 percent, less than the 0.8 percent in December.
The underlying CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 0.8 percent year on year, after rising 1.2 percent in December. In monthly terms, the IPC registered a positive variation of 0.2 percent in January, the same value as in December. The data contradicts the deflationary cycle that has hit China for around two years.
The Production Price Index (IPP) fell 1.4 percent in January compared to the same month last year, an improvement compared to the 1.9 percent drop in December, but remaining in deflationary territory for the 40th consecutive month.</description><pubDate>2026-02-12 02:58:43</pubDate></item><item><title>Space | New rocket and spacecraft tests completed in the plan to take astronauts to the Moon</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/12/espaco-finalizados-novos-testes-com-foguetao-e-nave-no-plano-de-levar-astronautas-a-lua/</link><description>China flight-tested the Mengzhou spacecraft's escape system and the first stage of the Long March-10 rocket, advancing preparations to send astronauts to the Moon before 2030.
The test took place yesterday at the Wenchang space center in the southern island province of Hainan, state television CCTV reported, citing China's Manned Space Program Office. The test included a low-altitude demonstration of the Long March-10 system and an escape test under conditions of maximum dynamic pressure for the Mengzhou spacecraft.
At 11:00, the rocket took off until it reached the point scheduled for activating the evacuation system. The ship then received the escape signal and successfully separated from the launcher. Both the rocket's first stage and the return capsule landed in a controlled manner in the designated maritime zone.
According to the authorities, this is the first flight activation of the Long March-10 in initial prototype status, the first Chinese escape test under conditions of maximum dynamic pressure and the first recovery at sea of ​​both the first stage of a launcher and a manned capsule within the scope of this program.
The test continues the tests carried out last year on the aforementioned Mengzhou spacecraft and the Lanyue landing module.

Seoul has denied any government or army involvement, suggesting that civilians could be responsible, but yesterday South Korean authorities announced that they are investigating three soldiers and an intelligence official suspected of involvement.
Search and seizure warrants were executed “at 18 locations in total, including the Defense Intelligence Command and the National Intelligence Service,” according to a statement.
Three civilians have been charged for their alleged role in the drone scandal. One of them publicly claimed responsibility, claiming to have piloted the device to measure levels of radiation and heavy metal contamination around a uranium processing plant in the North.
South Korean President Lee Jae-myung denounced this overflight, warning that it was an initiative that could trigger a war.
His deposed predecessor, Yoon Suk-yeol, is currently on trial for illegally ordering drone overflights over North Korea, hoping to provoke a reaction from Pyongyang and use it as a pretext for a failed attempt to impose martial law. Yoon Suk-yeol was removed last April for this attempt.</description><pubDate>2026-02-11 03:01:51</pubDate></item><item><title>Japan | Takaichi's Party Secures Two-Thirds of Parliament</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/11/japao-partido-de-takaichi-assegura-dois-tercos-do-parlamento/</link><description>Sanae Takaichi's ultraconservative party won a categorical victory in Sunday's elections, crushing Japanese centrist and leftist representations. Friend Donald has already sent congratulations
Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's Liberal Democratic Party (PLD) won 315 seats in Sunday's early legislative elections, alone obtaining a two-thirds majority in the Lower House of Parliament, according to official results published yesterday.
This result is the best in the history of the PLD and allows the ultra-conservative leader to consolidate her mandate to implement the expansive economic program in the archipelago of 123 million inhabitants over the next four years.
Becoming the first woman to lead the Japanese Government in October and enjoying a state of grace since then, Takaichi dissolved the Lower House of Parliament at the end of January, where her government coalition had the majority.
Bet largely won: the coalition formed by the PLD and Ishin (Party for Innovation, center-right) obtained a total of 351 seats out of the 465 that make up the Lower Chamber, according to data from the Ministry of the Interior.
In the previous legislature, the PLD had just 198 seats, while Ishin held 34. The elections also saw the anti-immigration party Sanseito increase its number of seats, from two to fifteen, according to the results.
The new Centrist Alliance for Reform, formed by the main opposition party, the Constitutional Democratic Party (center-left), and the PLD's former partner, the small Buddhist party Komeito, suffered a crushing defeat, with the number of seats falling from 167 to 49.
Takaichi was warmly congratulated by US President Donald Trump, with whom she is scheduled to meet in mid-March in Washington.
Regional disorder
The victory places her in the wake of her mentor, Shinzo Abe (prime minister in 2006-2007 and then in 2012-2020), who profoundly marked the country with nationalist positions and an economic program, which included, in particular, budgetary recovery measures.
From an external point of view, the Asia-Pacific region will be attentive to the development of Sino-Japanese tensions, which have taken on a new dimension since Sanae Takaichi suggested, in November, that Tokyo could intervene militarily in the event of a Chinese attack on Taiwan, whose sovereignty is claimed by Beijing.
Financial markets may also be concerned about the imbalance in Japanese public finances and, above all, the escalation of the already huge public debt, if Takaichi continues to reinforce fiscal stimulus measures to boost the world's fourth largest economy.
Strengthened by the prospect of greater budget spending and tax benefits, the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose more than 5 percent in Monday's session and opened again yesterday at gains and new record levels.</description><pubDate>2026-02-11 02:59:09</pubDate></item><item><title>Cars | China overtakes Argentina as the largest exporter of vehicles to Brazil</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/11/automoveis-china-ultrapassa-argentina-como-maior-exportador-de-veiculos-para-o-brasil/</link><description>Chinese manufacturers consolidate their presence in the largest automotive market in South America, leaving Argentina behind
China overtook Argentina in January to become the largest exporter of automobiles to Brazil, consolidating the dominance of Chinese brands in South America's largest automobile market, according to data released by industry sources.
According to the specialized platform Autoweb, China exported 16,800 vehicles to Brazil in January, compared to 13,400 units from Argentina. This is a historic reversal in the automobile balance between the two main Mercosur partners, which has been underway since the first quarter of 2024.
Unlike Argentine cars, which generally include a high percentage of parts produced in Brazil, Chinese cars arrive fully assembled, bypassing the local supply chain.
In value, car imports from China to Brazil reached 375 million dollars (around 315 million euros) in January – more than ten times the value recorded in the same month of the previous year – and represented around 65 percent of the sector's total imports.
This pattern follows the global strategy of Chinese brands, which begin their presence through exports and, subsequently, invest in local assembly and production units. In Brazil, manufacturers Great Wall Motors and BYD have led this process. BYD invested 5.5 billion reais (around 890 million euros) in the conversion of the former Ford factory in Camaçari, in the state of Bahia, where it intends to produce vehicles based on the “semi-knocked down” model – in which cars arrive almost ready from China and are finished locally, mostly with imported parts.
Criticism and praise
The practice has generated criticism from the national association of vehicle manufacturers (Anfavea), which warns of the lower generation of employment in local value chains compared to the traditional model of complete production. O presidente da Anfavea, Igor Calvet, elogiou recentemente a decisão do Governo brasileiro de não renovar a isenção fiscal para a importação de ‘kits’ desmontados, medida que expirou em Janeiro e visa incentivar uma produção nacional mais sofisticada.
According to data from Anfavea, Brazilian automobile production fell 12 percent in January compared to the same month in 2025, while sales recorded a slight decline. The market share of electrified vehicles reached an all-time high of 16.8 percent, although only around 35 percent of these were produced in Brazil. Exports fell 18 percent, mainly affected by lower Argentine demand.
Despite the strong expansion of Chinese brands in the Brazilian market, Brazil occupies only fifth place among the main destinations for Chinese automobile exports, behind Mexico, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United Arab Emirates. According to the Chinese Passenger Car Association, China exported 8.32 million vehicles in 2025, an increase of 30 percent compared to the previous year, confirming the sector's global growth trend.</description><pubDate>2026-02-11 02:57:13</pubDate></item><item><title>Former defense industry leader accused of corruption</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/11/ex-dirigente-da-industria-de-defesa-acusado-de-corrupcao/</link><description>Beijing yesterday announced corruption charges against Zhang Jianhua, a former defense industry leader, and an investigation into Yi Lianhong, a senior official at the legislative body, in the latest development of the anti-corruption campaign launched by Chinese President Xi Jinping.
According to state television CCTV, China's Public Prosecutor's Office filed charges against Zhang Jianhua, former deputy director at the State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense, for bribery, alleging that the former official had used the positions he held in the body responsible for the defense industry to benefit third parties in exchange for undue advantages.
According to the same source, Zhang abused his position in areas such as project evaluation, finance and auditing to receive “assets of especially high value”. After abandoning public functions, he continued to exploit the influence of the positions previously held to obtain benefits through other employees.
Eyes on Defense
This process comes at a time of greater scrutiny on the defense sector in China, the target of several investigations into senior military officials in recent months, although the authorities have not established any link between these investigations and Zhang's case.
In a separate announcement, the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) Central Disciplinary Commission and the National Supervision Commission – the country's main anti-corruption bodies – said that Yi Lianhong, vice chairman of the Economic and Finance Commission of the National People's Congress, is being investigated for “serious violations of discipline and law”.
The official note, released yesterday on the party committee's website, does not specify the nature of the infractions, which is usual in the initial stages of this type of investigation.
Both cases are part of the vast anti-corruption campaign, against “tigers” and “flies” launched by Xi Jinping since he took power in 2012, and which has already affected leaders at all levels – from local officials to provincial leaders, military leaders and those responsible for large public companies – tigers – to low-status employees, flies.</description><pubDate>2026-02-11 02:56:07</pubDate></item><item><title>Marcelo Loureiro, author and teacher: “The indigenato was a continuation of slavery”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/04/marcelo-loureiro-autor-e-docente-o-indigenato-foi-uma-continuacao-da-escravidao/</link><description>He was recently in Macau to present the book “Colonial Citizenship: law, race and rights through the Portuguese empire”.

How did this investigation begin and how did the themes of colonialism and citizenship emerge?
Tudo nasceu de uma experiência pessoal e familiar. Cresci no Rio de Janeiro, numa família marcada pela diáspora portuguesa por um lado, e pelo silêncio colonial do outro. A minha avó paterna, portuguesa, guardava no fundo de um armário os documentos que me permitiram, aos treze anos, reclamar a cidadania portuguesa. A minha outra avó, mestiça, cafuza, não tinha papéis, não tinha histórias para contar; de ela para mim, existia apenas um silêncio. Esta divisão, entre quem tem direito a documentos e a voz e quem é forçado ao apagamento, foi o ponto de partida para questionar a construção legal da cidadania e da nacionalidade. Quando cheguei a Portugal para estudar Direito em Coimbra, comecei a perceber que a lei que me reconhecia como português era a mesma que historicamente negou esse reconhecimento a milhões de pessoas com base na raça, na ‘civilização’ e na cor da pele. O livro é, em parte, uma tentativa de compreender essa estrutura jurídica de inclusão e exclusão, é uma denúncia da injustiça por detrás dos direitos. É uma denúncia da cidadania como método de exclusão. 
In the context of the Portuguese empire, when did the first notions of citizenship emerge and what criteria were used?
The first formal notions of national belonging in Portugal appear in the Philippine Ordinances of 1603, which establish who should be considered 'natural' of the kingdom. It is interesting to note that the inclusion of the notion of nationality was only included in Portuguese law during the Iberian Union, during the Philippine dynasty, when Spain controlled Portugal through the Habsburgs. It was in this context that Spanish law was transposed to Portugal to separate Portuguese from Spanish. However, the practical construction of Portuguese citizenship begins much earlier, in opposition: through slavery. Since the 15th century, with papal bulls (such as Dum Diversas of 1452 and Romanus Pontifex of 1454), Portugal obtained canonical legitimacy to enslave Africans and conquer their territories. Portuguese citizenship was thus constructed, in opposition to the figure of the ‘other’ – the Moor, the black, the pagan, the ‘savage’, and finally, the ‘indigenous’.
What were the differentiation criteria?
The criteria were essentially civilizational and racial: being Christian and, progressively, being white or recognized as ‘civilized’ according to European standards. Conversion to Christianity functioned, at times, as a kind of 'spiritual whitening', but even converts rarely achieved full legal equality, which continued to be imposed for centuries. The law called indigenous to all those who existed outside the standard of civilization expected of citizens, which were the non-white populations of Angola, Mozambique, Guinea and Timor.
Macau will always have occupied a “privileged position” in the context of this empire. Specifically, how?
In terms of citizenship, Macau has never been subject to the Indigenous Statute, which was in force in Angola, Mozambique, Guinea and Timor. This exclusion was not accidental. The Indigenous Statute applied to populations considered 'uncivilized' according to European racial and cultural criteria, being, in practical terms, essentially black populations from continental Africa and Timor. In Macau, the Chinese population, often called ‘Macau Chins’, although not European, were treated differently. There were laws that regulated the rights and customs of the Macanese population, with a complete law coming into force in 1909 and only abolished in 1949, for example. The Portuguese presence in Macau has always been accompanied by several other factors, such as British influence through contact with Hong Kong, the progressive political presence of Beijing, Portuguese political instability and the questioning of the existence of the Portuguese empire itself internationally. This meant that Portugal was unable to impose in Macau a sovereignty as powerful as that imposed in Africa and Timor.
Were there cases of discrimination against the Chinese and Macanese communities before the 20th century?
Discrimination existed, although of a different nature than that imposed in Africa. We can even see in literature, in the works of Senna Fernandes, for example, how the existence of walls, sides and parts of Macau, sometimes even ideological, for different populations, from Chinese villages to Christian cities. The same division occurred in the world of rights, only in an indirect way, and not through the direct imposition of indigeneity and the status of second-class national. Segregation and difference occurred socially, with difficulty accessing certain careers, the lack of invitations to birthdays because they were not ‘white’. This discrimination did not take the systematic legal form of indigeneity, as stated. The Macanese occupied an intermediate position, often functioning as intermediaries between the Portuguese and Chinese. Their ‘Portugueseness’ was recognized in an ambiguous way: they were Portuguese, but of a different type.
We can mention that skin color was decisive in not placing Macau under the Indigenous Statute.
Yes, skin color was absolutely decisive. The Indigenous Statute was applied in Angola, Mozambique, Guinea and Timor, territories with populations that are mostly black or ‘non-white’ in the colonial sense. Portuguese law even created the term 'oceanic race' to identify Timorese during the imposition of indigenato so that they could bring this population racially closer to African populations. Macau, Portuguese India, Cape Verde, and, to a certain extent, São Tomé and Príncipe, were excluded from this classification. The official criteria established 'uses and customs' and 'civilization' as the parameters to identify these people, but in reality these categories only functioned as a substitute for race: they were race, but by another name.  The populations of Portuguese India and Macau, although not European, have always been spared the application of openly racist laws, despite local practices and policies imposing, most often indirectly, restrictions on the full citizenship of these populations, as I have described.
Taking into account the Indigenous Statute, what evolution can you trace in terms of the concept of Portuguese citizenship?
The Indigenous Statute, consolidated in the early 1930s, represented the maximum legal codification of racial exclusion. Indigenato was a legal form of racial segregation that created two categories of being Portuguese, namely being a Portuguese citizen (white and assimilated) and being indigenous Portuguese (the majority black). The indigenous people were legally Portuguese, but they were not citizens; they did not live with access to rights, but to restrictions, they lived, as I call it in the book, in a status of ‘negatory nationality’. Indigenous people could not vote, could not move freely, did not have the right to lawyers, were subject to forced labor, paid special taxes based on race, and could not attend the same schools or hospitals as whites. The evolution of the concept of Portuguese citizenship in this context is paradoxical: formally, everyone was ‘Portuguese’, but materially, citizenship was reserved for those who demonstrated ‘civilization’ through skin color or by proving themselves to be sufficiently assimilated despite being black. Assimilation was the only legal path to leaving indigeneity, but it required proving mastery of the Portuguese language, abandonment of African ‘uses and customs’, stable employment, ‘good moral conduct’, and military service.  Very few could.
What are the most flagrant cases of denial of rights that you can point to?
One of the most flagrant is the system of forced labor, which functioned as a continuation of slavery under another name. Indigenous people were forced to work on plantations, mines and public works, often far from their families, in inhumane conditions. Another case is spatial and social segregation: separate hospitals for whites and indigenous people, segregated neighborhoods, different schools. In Guinea, indigenous people were forced to wear necklaces with metal plates. In Mozambique they were forced to pay radio taxes if they had a device. In Timor they were required to pay taxes if they moved from one local authority to another, or when they divorced according to local customs. The archives also show cases of indigenous people who, despite having moved to Lisbon, still continued to be treated as indigenous people. All thanks to a 1955 law that imposed indigenato status on any indigenous person in any part of the Portuguese empire – which was previously only applied in indigenato colonies. This was the case of the so-called ‘Lisbon Requests’, a group of assimilation applications that I found in the Lisbon Ultramarine Archive, where indigenous people who, having emigrated to the metropolis, tried to obtain recognition as citizens.
The Indigenous Statute would be abolished years later, but the effects seem to have remained.
I absolutely agree. And I say more: indigenato was a continuation of slavery itself, a reflection that is still felt today by so many communities touched by the Portuguese empire. The Statute was abolished in 1961, but decades of legal, educational and economic exclusion are not erased by decree. African populations have been systematically denied access to education, property, mobility and political participation for generations. This explains, to a certain extent, the difference between the different parts of the Portuguese empire, where Brazil, Angola, Macau and India occupy completely different spectrums in relation to levels of protection and access to rights. When the Statute was abolished, a context of restriction and necessity was already consolidated where the black majority survived without formal education and without access to basic rights. The post-colonial effects are equally profound: indigenato taught generations of Africans that their culture, language and way of life were inferior, and that to formally be someone, to be recognized as fully human before the law, they had to become white, they had to resemble, as much as possible, the colonizer. But even this formal assimilation rarely translated into real protection: legal recognition did not guarantee effective access to rights. Assimilation marks not only a historical period, but a way of seeing, feeling and surviving colonial history. This violence left marks that persist in Portuguese-speaking post-colonial societies and that can only be resolved when there is a process of acceptance, truth and reconstruction — something that the Portuguese State has not yet been able to do.</description><pubDate>2026-02-04 03:57:28</pubDate></item><item><title>Exhibition | Eric Fok mostra “Dreaming of the Occident” em Taiwan: “Em Portugal, vejo vestígios da minha cidade”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/15/exposicao-eric-fok-mostra-dreaming-of-the-occident-em-taiwan-em-portugal-vejo-vestigios-da-minha-cidade/</link><description>The year began with a new project by Eric Fok, who despite living in Portugal did not leave Macau and the East. “Dreaming of the Occident” is on display at the Helios gallery, in Taipei, and can be seen until January 24th. To HM, the local artist reveals that he wants to artistically explore the universe of Vendas Novas bifana, through its connection to Macau pork chop
How is the West represented in this exhibition?
I've always been fascinated by the intersection between Eastern and Western cultures, and I've explored how Macau was a territory shaped by Western missionaries and navigators who brought new sciences and ideas to the East. Regarding a previous exhibition, and during the research process, I realized how rare it was for the Chinese to travel to Europe at the time of the Discoveries. I read with enthusiasm the reports of the few who did so. There are diaries that vividly recreate the dangerous sea voyages and what life was like in ancient European cities. This allowed me to project myself into their stories, bridging the gap between past and present, between East and East. These cultural differences are not just history to me, but have become a rich source of imagination for my new work.
As an artist from Macau, how has the history of the territory, marked by exchange between East and West, shaped your way of thinking about this exhibition?
It all started with mapping Macau for the “Paraíso” series [2014 exhibition], a project that was born out of my curiosity about the city's past in a context of rapid expansion of the tourism and gaming industries. Through this dialogue with local history, I began to truly understand the city. I went from focusing on the small details of urban life to having a macro perspective of the world, highlighting Macau's significant role in global history. This includes its status as a gateway to China during the Discoveries, its contribution to the beginning of globalization, or even being a space for the spread of Catholicism to the East. [We cannot forget] the profound influence of maritime culture. All of these themes constitute an extension of my exploration of the historical and unique experience of Macau.
Can you describe in more detail the creative process for “Dreaming of the Occident”?
In addition to maps of Macau, this exhibition also presents maps of Eurasia and several Asian colonies, where I explore themes such as navigation, trade and empire. My research also extends to experimenting with materials. In addition to using paper and wood, I incorporated unconventional supports, such as ostrich eggs. These objects function as canvases to narrate stories about endemic species and the history of migration, establishing a bridge between a biological and historical side.
Does the exhibition intend to criticize the Western influence in Macau, reflect on it or simply observe it?
In my exploration of these themes I am mainly interested in the cultural dimensions of history. When Europeans first arrived in Asia, they viewed the world from a Eurocentric perspective. The term “Far East” was not just a geographical designation, but a symbol of power and a specific view of the world. But, on the other hand, the term “Far West” represents an initial global imagination, in the sense of being a space of mutual understanding, albeit incomplete. Today, as we live in an era of a lot of information, where connectivity is instantaneous, we have lost that sense of mystery, and my work seeks to recover a little of what is the fantasy of distance.
Do you expect different readings of the exhibition or a deeper knowledge of what Macau is, in cultural and historical terms?
In the creative process, I privilege personal expression as responses to society and the world in which we live. Although exhibiting in a commercial gallery inevitably brings a market dimension to my work, my focus is always on the integrity of the work. In recent years, my desire for the public to “correctly decode” my art has changed, in the sense that, although I feel deep satisfaction when someone connects with my inner world, I have come to accept this “emptiness” in the narrative of my work. These gaps are meant to be filled by the experiences and emotions of the viewer, or perhaps by time and history itself. In a time of rapid and ephemeral changes, I use the brush to document and preserve. My work consists of sharing the urban experience that invites the public to create an emotional connection with cities, promoting a deep reflection on identity and belonging.
He has lived between Macau and Portugal. How does this influence your work and your view of Macau’s history and culture?
At the moment I respond to this interview I find myself in Vendas Novas, a town in Portugal that is famous for bifana. I am currently exploring whether there is any direct connection between this local specialty and Macau pork chop bread. Centuries ago, the Portuguese sought to build a “home” in Macau, leaving behind Portuguese structures that defined the skyline of my city. Currently, being in Portugal, I see traces of my city everywhere. Being Asian, and being surrounded by different races and languages, I find a certain sense of belonging that can be both alienating and deeply familiar. The enormous geographical distance is shortened by culture and history, which are shared. This exchange of identities and the movement between places constitute deep inspirations for my work.
Searching for an unknown place
On the Helios gallery's internet portal, Eric Fok's new exhibition is described as a search for a Europe that, on the eastern side, was known to exist, but which was far from being known, especially from the middle of the 16th century, when the term “Taixi” appeared as a reference to the “Great West”. The Chinese expression was used by the Jesuit missionary Matteo Ricci and is one of the focuses of the Macau artist's work in “Dreaming of the Occident”.
According to Helios' presentation, “Taixi” was a term attributed to “an extremely distant land in the West that was, once, a blank space on maps, yet to be explored”. In this way, Eric Fok's imagined maps explore the ideas of an absent and unknown place, also analyzing “the identity of the self, the transport of memories, power and ideology”. Using historical research, the Macau artist “rediscovers ‘Taixi’ from the perspective of the Far East, through writing and cartographic representation”. Eric Fok also investigated “the views of the world that existed in the past, formed by the interconnection between power and belief”, it is described.</description><pubDate>2026-01-15 01:53:54</pubDate></item><item><title>Iranian Ambassador in Lisbon condemned “institutionalization of the improper use of force”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/14/embaixador-do-irao-em-lisboa-condenou-institucionalizacao-do-uso-indevido-da-forca/</link><description>Iran's ambassador in Lisbon, Majid Tafreshi, condemned the “institutionalization of a new policy”, implemented with the instrument of “improper use of force”, alluding to the United States and Israel. In an interview with the Lusa agency, Tafreshi warned that this process will “spread” if countries, especially Western ones, “do not take serious measures” against the United States and Israel, “which have incited public unrest”.
“There are no guarantees that such practices will not be repeated, especially when disturbing discussions are already being heard, such as those regarding the possession of Greenland”, highlighted Tafreshi, remembering the North American actions in Venezuela, and the insinuations against Colombia and Cuba.
The interview took place before the diplomat was called by the Portuguese Government due to the violent repression of demonstrations against the Iranian Government, an announcement made yesterday by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The Iranian diplomat recalled having already asked his “academic colleagues” and diplomats to create in Portugal a new forum entitled “Dialogue between Enemies”, in the search for “universal peace and a world free from war and tension”, as well as the creation of new mechanisms – such as an East Asian Union – “could constitute a meaningful initiative”.
“I believe that politics and politicians should follow more closely the will of their own people, who, in reality, do not seem to have major conflicts between themselves – as can be clearly seen in tourism, in football stadiums, in concerts and in hundreds of other human interactions”, argued the Iranian diplomat.
Regarding recent developments in Iran, in which, he said, peaceful demonstrations focused on economic challenges, over time, “some elements present in these concentrations escalated to violent incidents”, including armed actions that, according to reports, “involved individuals with prior training”.
“Lamentavelmente, estes acontecimentos resultaram em vítimas entre agentes das forças de segurança, forças de ordem pública e cidadãos comuns”, afirmou Tafreshi, depois de o alto-comissário da ONU para os Direitos Humanos, Volker Türk, ter condenado e exigido o fim da “repressão dos protestos no Irão, que resultaram em mais de 600 mortos desde 28 de Dezembro, segundo uma organização não governamental.
O embaixador do Irão em Lisboa referiu os “milhões de cidadãos iranianos” que participaram segunda-feira em manifestações públicas, “reflectindo uma mudança no quadro geral e expressando apoio ao seu país islâmico”, o que, tal como no passado, a notícia tem uma atenção limitada dos meios de comunicação social ocidentais.
Incentivos exteriores
Asked about what is strangling the Iranian economy, Tafreshi highlights the interventions of Israel, “to a lesser extent”, and the United States, “which have encouraged public unrest”, as well as Iran's economic challenges, which are significantly influenced by extensive sanctions imposed” by Washington.
“These measures, which Iran considers illegal, have also been supported by European countries that defend human rights, despite there being concerns that such policies have negatively affected fundamental rights of the Iranian population, including access to healthcare”, he denounced.
“Respect for the Charter of the United Nations, the bitter lessons of the First and Second World Wars and the devastating experiences and costs of events in Afghanistan, Syria, Palestine, Lebanon, Libya, Iraq, Ukraine and elsewhere should be enough to remind us of the urgent need to prioritize, more than ever, peaceful coexistence”, he added.
Regarding the high number of fatalities, Tafreshi denied that Iranian security is using a disproportionate use of force, exemplifying, alongside the high number of deaths among civilians, the significant number of deaths and injuries among police officers”.
People power
Asked about the words of Reza Pahlavi – son of the former shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, deposed after the 1979 Islamic Revolution – in which he stated that he intends to return to Iran soon, Tafreshi considered that, with the “support of some Western and Zionist media”, he appears to be trying to play the role of a “Robin of the Woods”.
"However, Robin Hood never called on ordinary people to resort to violence or violate international norms and principles, such as attacking embassies and diplomatic facilities. During his father's reign, despite Iran having the support of the United States and the West, the country lost its 14th province, Bahrain. Based on experience, the United States supports and exploits anyone capable of harming Iran's independence and security," he responded.
Tafreshi denied, on the other hand, that the regime – “the term “regime is an illegitimate and biased expression” – is at risk, highlighting again “the millions” of Iranians who demonstrated on Monday in favor of Iran's sovereignty.
“The Islamic Republic belongs to the people of Iran. Ayatollah [Ali] Khamenei is the leader of Iran and one of those citizens”, highlighted the diplomat, for whom China and Russia maintain “good relations” with Tehran, meaning it is not necessary to count on Beijing or Moscow to defend the country, which counts on its own people to protect its security and sovereignty.</description><pubDate>2026-01-14 02:52:14</pubDate></item><item><title>Sofia Ferreira da Silva, author of a study on opera in the Mao years: “Silk Road was the biggest influence”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/07/sofia-ferreira-da-silva-autora-de-um-estudo-sobre-opera-nos-anos-de-mao-rota-da-seda-foi-a-maior-influencia/</link><description>In “Singing the Revolution: The Role of Songs and Opera in the Spread of Communism in Mao Zedong's China”, Sofia Ferreira da Silva analyzes the way in which songs and opera spread political ideals, leaving marks on the country's cultural panorama. The analysis came from the doctoral thesis in Artistic Studies, defended by the author at Universidade Nova de Lisboa
What was the musical environment like in the country before Mao Zedong came to power?
China was, and continues to be, a territory with a huge variety of practices at regional, local and ethnic levels. We can speak of four main types: music of a more erudite nature, symbolized by court music (yayue) and guqin music, more centered on Confucian ideals and with ritual functions and self-cultivation of individual morality; folk music, with vocal and instrumental genres varying according to region and ethnicity; Taoist, Buddhist and other religious music; and traditional opera, such as Kunqu and Peking, Sichuan and Canton operas, combining singing, declamation, stylized movements and martial arts. The biggest influence on Chinese music was, perhaps, the Silk Road, as a good part of the musical instruments that are now considered “Chinese”, such as the erhu, the pipa, the suona and the sanxian, have their origins in foreign instruments brought to Chinese territory, and which were gradually adapted and incorporated into their music. On the other hand, some narrative and operatic genres evolved from the adaptation and combination of counterparts from the territories crossed by this route. If it weren't for the Silk Road, traditional Chinese music would be radically different.
What other influences are there?
The other big influence is Western music. This, despite having entered the country in the 16th and 17th centuries, was felt with greater intensity from the middle of the 19th century and throughout the 20th century. The growing foreign presence and influence led to the systematic introduction of Western notation, academic training along European lines and Western classical and popular music genres, which would be assimilated in varying ways by Chinese composers, such as Ma Sicong, Li Jinhui or Xian Xinghai, combining them or not with traditional music motifs.
In the thesis, he talks about two major changes in the Mao years, with the creation of the so-called “model shows (yangbanxi)” and the revolutionary Peking operas. How did these formats help to reshape the music scene at the time?
The model shows, which include Peking operas and revolutionary songs, played an important role in reforming the Maoist musical landscape, implying changes not only in musical styles, but also in the social function of music. Production became entirely subordinated to the political project of the Chinese Communist Party (PCC), resulting in the mandatory membership of artists and designated artistic associations, and the suppression, through criticism in the media, of musical elements or genres considered “feudal”, “bourgeois” or “superstitious”. In opposition, and following successive political movements and campaigns, other formats were promoted, more in line with the regime's ideals.
How, in concrete terms?
In the case of the “yangbanxi”, from the Cultural Revolution, the fact that they were called “model” implied that all new creations must strictly follow the aesthetic precepts established through them, especially the rules of the “basic task”, with the construction of revolutionary heroic figures as the ultimate aim of artistic creation. There were also the “Three Prominences”, with the attribution of greater or lesser prominence to a certain character depending on their degree of positivity or negativity, their function in the plot. These rules guided not only the narrative structure and the role of the characters, but also aspects such as the integration between music and gestures, the construction of costumes and sets, and the harmony between traditional and Western musical elements. This codification would aim, to this extent, to guarantee the ideological and aesthetic uniformity essential to the creation of a controlled, functional and politically effective musical culture within the framework of the objectives of the revolution.
What are the main political messages conveyed through these two types of shows?
The first big idea is the almost religious loyalty to Mao Zedong and the unconditional observance of his ideas. It is his thought that inspires and guides the actions of the heroes and heroic characters, the second most important category of characters in revolutionary operas, and leads them to the successful completion of the mission assigned to them or to heroic sacrifice in favor of the communist cause. The second is the class struggle as the driving force of history. We have, on the one hand, the oppressive, capitalist, imperialist and feudal class as the villain, and on the other the working people, exploited and oppressed by the former, suffering the greatest storms at their hands. The conflicts and difficult situations faced by the heroes or other positive characters, such as the death of family members, imprisonment or slavery, were always the direct expression of this struggle, and their resolution would only come from the revolutionary stance and the assumption of an active role in the construction of socialism.
And the third idea present in the shows?
This is collectivism, as a true revolutionary places the interests of the Party and the People above any individual dream or desire. No matter how prominent his role, the hero needs popular support to complete his mission: his aspirations are the aspirations of the people, and it is in solidarity between all that difficulties are overcome and the much-desired socialist harmony is achieved. Personal achievement only has value if it serves the collective cause, and individual sacrifice is glorified when it contributes to common progress. Operas promote, to this extent, a worldview where individual identity dissolves into the identity of the revolutionary collective, and where the active participation of the masses is not only desirable, but necessary.
These were years of so-called cultural Maoism, as mentioned in the thesis. How is it characterized?
Cultural Maoism presents points of contact regarding the subordination of art to politics, the valorization of the daily lives of the masses as the raw material for creation and the defense of its widespread popularization. However, it is distinguished by its emphasis on the proletarianization of the artist himself, who should abandon his position as a distant intellectual and become an active member of the working people, learning through practice and inserting himself in their daily struggles.
What are the main influences of this movement?
In addition to the Marxist-Leninist matrix, cultural Maoism would be marked by Confucian influences, giving art an ethical and formative function, as in Confucius, Mencius or Xunzi, art shaped character. However, in the Maoist context, this molding was channeled towards the construction of socialist consciousness and the eradication of traces of the bourgeois mentality. One of the central principles of this policy was the “mass line”, a kind of circular cultural dynamic in which popular ideas and expressions were collected and systematized by the Party, before being returned to the people in a clearer and more politically oriented way. Another aspect to consider is the appreciation of native and foreign cultural heritage, condensed in the maxim “use the past to serve the present, use the foreign to serve China”.
In what way?
To create new artistic works, Mao recommended the initial study of Western works, considered “scientific” and technically superior, before selectively incorporating elements of Chinese tradition. In both cases, the value of artistic forms lay in their social and political function, not in their preservation as heritage. In this context, the PCC leader proposed two criteria for artistic evaluation: the political, which required the promotion of national unity and the rejection of ideas contrary to the Party; and the artistic, which presupposed technical and aesthetic rigor following an abstract notion of “scientific criteria of art” at the service of the masses. This double requirement replaced, in Maoism, the Confucian distinction between moral quality and aesthetic quality.
In these years, what were the biggest influences on songwriting?
The composition of songs was greatly influenced by two great musical traditions: the native, with the use of regional melodies and motifs and those of the various ethnic minorities that make up the territory; and the Western, in which I include the Soviet musical tradition, most visible in marches and so-called “art songs”, which could be understood as a type of revolutionary ‘lieder’ or with highly politicized content. The influence of each of them was more or less visible depending on the political situation of the territory.
How did the years of “cultural Maoism” change the country’s musical landscape?
Some aspects of the production of Cultural Revolution operas, such as the introduction of the Western orchestra and the use of techniques from Western music, the incorporation of more realistic scenarios and the melodramatic nature of the stories influenced and continue to influence the production of new Beijing operas, especially those with contemporary or historical themes relating to the 20th century. XX. Over the last 30 years, operas with historical themes have also been produced with some of these elements, especially in terms of music and settings, such as “Cao Cao and Yang Xiu”. Some remnants of this period can also be seen in the interpretation of traditional operas, especially in the presentation of arias or excerpts on television programs. I see countless performances that combine, just like in the revolutionary repertoire, arrangements with a Western orchestra and realistic scenarios, with extensive use of new technologies. However, what I consider to be the greatest remnant of revolutionary operas will, perhaps, be a greater artistic audacity on the part of the creators of new operas. It is an issue that deserves further study by the academy, but, from my observations as a spectator, I notice a greater openness to the incorporation of elements from other arts, such as dance and theater, and a greater complexity in the characters, especially those considered negative, less antagonistic, with more nuances when it comes to motivations for acting in a certain way. It is obvious that the psychological suffering inflicted by these operas on an entire generation of Chinese people is undeniable and cannot, under any circumstances, be forgotten; however, model operas boosted the creative impetus of composers and librettists, in line with the evolutionary process, of fusion with other arts, of Peking Opera over the centuries.</description><pubDate>2026-01-07 01:10:41</pubDate></item><item><title>Piménio Ferreira: “Anti-gypsy rhetoric has always worked in Portugal”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2021/04/26/pimenio-ferreira-a-retorica-anti-cigana-sempre-funcionou-em-portugal/</link><description>Piménio Ferreira, better known as Gitelles Ferreira, anti-racist activist, 34 years old, physical engineer, Romani national. He is a man with a provocative speech, a corrosive, gentle humor and a smile that leaves no one indifferent.
Gitelles, we live in an intercultural land and gypsies – in particular – have lived in Portugal for around five centuries. What happens so that gypsy communities continue to be “on the margins” of so-called society? 
We need to change the model of society. This is extremely stratified, placing people in subordinate positions to privilege a violent minority. The white social structure is patriarchal and racist. What is called the ‘margin’ of society is in fact an intrinsic place within it, which belongs to it. In other words, gypsy people have been included in this model of society since they discovered Europe and its kingdoms. The problem is the model of society that is maintained and the place to which they were relegated and how they were relegated: with violence, in a status of inferiority compared to white people, without the right to human dignity, to found a family, to choose their own language and religion, expropriated of any and all cultural and material rights. A place built and maintained to this day by genocidal and ethnocidal violence and persecution. In 1463, Vasco Gitano was granted an estate. In 1521, the gitanos, or gypsies, were already used as a reference for everything that is considered bad in the model of society. The “counter-example” compared to white that would stand out in a positive way. The ‘angel’ and the ‘demon’; the ‘other’, the enemy; the one against whom any attack and persecution is legitimate. Including the prohibition of defending oneself, having weapons, any type of property, and the right to stay.
And is it because they are denied this right to stay that we still have nomadic gypsy communities within the country today?
Yes, without a doubt. There are many ways to force nomadism: directly, by prohibiting permanence and expelling with police or military force; indirectly, refusing public or private housing to Roma people, because they are Roma; and also through the gentrification process.
I read the results of a survey by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, where it is said that approximately 80% of Roma respondents live below the risk of poverty threshold in their country; one in three gypsies lives in a house without running water; one in three Roma belongs to a family in which someone went to bed hungry at least once in the previous month; and 50% of Roma aged between 6 and 24 do not attend school. Why does this happen like this? 
It is the historic persecution that continues. There is no impoverishment that does not have an external cause. In this case, a political system of total expropriation is imposed on the basis of violence. As early as 1648, D João IV, the Restorer, prohibited ‘giving or renting houses to gypsies’. The same D João IV who achieved the kingdom of Portugal thanks to D. Jerónimo da Costa and his 250 Knights. The same D. Jerónimo da Costa who died defending Portugal's independence from Castile. Gypsy, like his wife and children. Among prohibitions on staying, “that gypsies do not enter the kingdom and those who are in it leave” (D João III, 1526), ​​with expulsions, banishment to the galleys, expropriation of goods and properties, imposed with penalties of flogging, mutilation and death, systematically carried out to this day (even in 2011 the Faro City Council wanted to ban gypsies in the municipality).
The prohibition of working for others (no one employs gypsy workers, and those who do do so in complete precariousness, for poorly paid positions and without rights and dignified conditions). They are unable to remain dependent on self-employment, they are unable to invest, due to extreme expropriation. They become dependent on precariousness. If you want to know what it's like to live in pure neoliberalism, get to know the lives of gypsies. The reality of these is paradigmatic of the aggression and lack of protection that the “lords” are willing to go to, for their own benefit.
What are you talking about, is it economic and political power?
The group of political, social, cultural and economic power. The owner, the colonizer. This group has been in power since it instituted the current system of domination. And that only makes sense within the hierarchically stratified sociopolitical model in which we live. Hence the need to put an end to ‘lords’ and establish a new model of society, healthy, free, without hierarchies or strata, whether of race, class or gender.
The model in which we live leads the gypsy community (and beyond) to economic exclusion, removing them from access to the consumption of products or excluding them from their production process; political exclusion associated with lack of access to information; to education and consequently the social exclusion seen in the inequality of access to quality community areas such as restaurants, libraries, theater, cinema, concerts, healthcare, etc. How does a gypsy child feel when they realize they are not part of the whole? Children who never see themselves represented, not in films, not in books, not in cartoons, not even in an advertisement eating cereal, for example? Is this a disaster for self-esteem, is it a priori condemnation?
That's really the question. Gypsy people are not “excluded from society”, on the contrary, they are included in it. The problem is the existence of what is cynically called 'social exclusion', an Orwellian term, and people are under duress. Which concentration and extermination camp. In fact, the Nazi concentration camps are a more visual embodiment of what is called 'social exclusion' and, as here, they were not an 'excluded' part of Nazi society, but rather its fundamental and characterizing structure. It is a place of violence, where people are kept by violence, dedicated to their extermination, and designed so that few people can leave. And yet they resist. Just like in the Nazi concentration camps.
And what you listed as an example of the ‘consequence’ of this ‘exclusion’, is in fact the means by which this exclusion also happens and is maintained. Gypsy people are outside the cinemas, either as consumers or producers (but they go to the cinema). They are outside of school, education and the Academy. Either as ‘users’ or as producers (but they go to school and are at the basis of the construction of knowledge and academic and scientific debates).
Even in the attack on the gypsy child's self-confidence, we speak of a mechanism for maintaining this situation. But gypsy people respond very well: with gypsy pride. Another resistance, another aggression. Gypsy people are thus included in society. In a place that belongs to this modern model of society. And they resist and counter the power of domination and insist on being in the city, in the cinema, in the theater, in the Academy, in all spaces. With a lot of struggle and always resisting, but they are there. Social exclusion, more than a “place outside of society”, is part of its social structure.
Do you mean to say there is collective resistance?
At work, already in a context of absolute precariousness, during the pandemic, gypsy people rolled up their sleeves and once again showed proactivity and creativity in adversity. They learned by watching and doing. And here, it is again women who jump to the front line, show their face, learn how to use digital tools with their daughters or sons, and launch themselves into the network. And so they explore online sales as well as app-based work (transport or couriers). In housing, in a pandemic context in which evictions were not stopped – as the law itself should and dictates – residents did not stop organizing and fighting against unfair evictions and demanding dignity in housing; residents associations allied in their action with other housing and anti-racist organizations.
It is also worth noting how they reinvented themselves and intensified to collect and distribute food items and mask/alcohol gel kits to the most expropriated people. Gypsies and non-gypsies. In the anti-racist fight, new movements emerged and their actions intensified through social media. People who had never organized or become active before began their first steps in activism, joining this path of gypsy and anti-racist organization and popular action. People forget, or don't want to appreciate, but gypsy action has helped to determine results in the political dispute. Gypsy citizens mobilized in large numbers and determined electoral results in the 2017 local councils, both in Alentejo and in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area, even causing electoral earthquakes.
And even in the Presidential elections, second place was decided by an amount equivalent to the estimated number of gypsy voters. Apart from the non-gypsy votes that were mobilized by the action of gypsy voters. Gypsy people are even co-building power in opinion spaces, in local media, on social networks and in party and institutional political disputes. And most importantly, in popular action and in alliances with other social movements. We never stopped fighting by all means and we continued to resist.
On the other hand, there is more and more hate speech, from the far right in particular. What do you have to say about that?
To begin with, these speeches are historical and European. They are neither current nor “extreme right-wing”. These speeches have been adopted and delivered for a long time, even in 'democracy and freedom', by various representatives of the center-right, conservatives, center-left, liberals, liberal left, even representatives of the PCP. Anti-gypsy rhetoric has always worked in Portugal, as it is the most white-natured rhetoric. That is, it allows the creation and recognition of “white” as the superior of all. And thus please the white electorate who, when they feel good, compensate with their vote. Even if the policies implemented by your elected officials harm you even more.
Finally, I would like you to talk a little about your personal experience and how you became an activist?
I studied, fought for my studies, made alliances, graduated, and entered the “formal precarious” job market. I started my militant action and here I am today. We can transform this society into a better one. This certainty, combined with the fact that the current one has so much suffering, makes anyone want to have a transformative attitude. I wanted to be an ‘inventor’ (physical engineer) and an anti-racist activist. And through study (not necessarily schooling) and organization with other people, in turn, with other studies, training and visions, I learned how the world works and how it can be changed. But before transforming, we need to survive.
This gives rise to two types of actions: transformative and survival. The fight against hate speech appears as survival, but its defeat will be a transformative victory. There is a lot that – as people who want a better world – we have to do, namely work to criminalize hate speech; condemn and ban organizations with racist speeches and practices; denounce the racist institutional structure and logic that organizes Power and manages community resources. And in this sense, there have been various types of actions, from petitions to demonstrations. And we need more.
In addition to being a member of the SOS RACISMO movement, I participate in the Podcast “Viemos Para Ficar”, with Mamadou Ba and Joseph da Silva. And if everything goes well, we will soon start a new project. With friendly people, we also have the “Cigana Initiative” project, dedicated to reflecting and promoting transformative movements. Essentially focused on educating against anti-gypsyism, denouncing historical and ongoing genocide and working towards a new societal project. Also with new projects in the pipeline. And finally, there are always voluntary actions, without an organization, where I try to share what I discovered about Anti-Gypsyism and Romani history in schools and with interested people. In addition, there is still the struggle for housing, because evictions did not stop during the pandemic. Due to housing and employment precariousness, racialized individuals, especially Roma nationals, are the most vulnerable to Covid-19. It is essential to have actions in this area; Of all the struggles, this is the most structural, as it goes against one of the main enemies of a healthy society: the real estate speculation of this capitalist system, which puts profit and goods above people and their humanization.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Motorsport | New alternative will be created in Foshan</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/26/automobilismo-nova-alternativa-vai-ser-criada-em-foshan/</link><description>Motorsport in the urban core of the Pearl River Delta will have a new permanent infrastructure, after the first fixed circuit was announced in the city of Foshan, located around 120 kilometers from Macau
The official announcement was released in the first week of the year. The result of an investment led by Benchmark Global Group, the project aims to mark a relevant milestone for Guicheng, the urban center of Nanhai district, consolidating Foshan as an international hub for sports consumption and stimulating high-level development in the areas of culture, sport and tourism. Benchmark Global Group had already developed reference projects in Sanshan in partnership with Key Capital, RDM and other entities, including Guangfo Florentia Village, Zona Artística One Times, Hilton Hampton Hotel and Chimei Art School.
According to the statement, “the circuit aims to attract a younger audience and boost the surrounding area”. Inspired by the successful experience of the Tianjin V1 Auto World, whose layout is used in local competitions, the V1 Guangfo International Circuit aims to create an integrated car park, combining the race track, motor culture and themed entertainment. The complex will occupy approximately 141,666.7 m² and will have all the necessary support infrastructure.
According to the tender documents, the land is located on Sanlongwan Avenue, in the south, and Gangzhong Street, to the west, with a lease period of twenty years and planned use as an ecological and sports car park. The project also includes a kart track of at least 1.1 km, while the main circuit should reach FIA Grade 2, allowing it to host competitions promoted by the Macau-China General Automobile Association (AAMC).
The development aims to “strengthen Guicheng's emerging consumption and entertainment ecosystem”, complementing the surrounding commercial hubs and enhancing the urban functions of the Wenhan Lake International Scientific and Technological Innovation Cooperation Zone. Residents and visitors will benefit from more diverse and sophisticated leisure experiences.
Foshan is one of the national pilot cities dedicated to new formats and consumption models, promoting innovation and economic dynamism. The V1 Guangfo International Circuit will represent a concrete example of the application of these guidelines, focusing on diversified consumption scenarios and sustainable growth in the sector.
 
Other options
In the Greater Bay Area, motorsport has focused on the Zhuhai International Circuit (ZIC) and the Guangdong International Circuit (GIC) in Zhaoqing, but several recent projects indicate a growing effort to expand the infrastructure network, including the possible construction of the Zhuhai Chaoyue International Circuit in Doumen, with an initial investment of 250 million renminbi and FIA Grade 3 certification.
In 2024, before the return of the Formula 1 Chinese Grand Prix in Shanghai, Guangzhou announced plans to build a Grade 1 circuit, capable of hosting events in the premier discipline. So far, no new information has emerged about this project, which was intended to be the second Formula 1 circuit in China. The first, in Shanghai, was opened in 2004, as the Zhuhai International Circuit, the first permanent circuit in China and designed to host Formula 1, never received maximum approval from the FIA. Other projects designed in Hong Kong and Shenzhen have not taken shape until now.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>GP | Rui Valente questions staying in motorsport</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/17/gp-rui-valente-questiona-permanencia-no-automobilismo/</link><description>Rui Valente had a 72nd Macau Grand Prix to forget. To the point that the driver with the most years of activity in motorsport in the territory seriously admits the possibility of hanging up his helmet and putting away his gloves, or, at least, stopping competing in Macau's premier race, be it the Macau Roadsport Challenge or even the entire event.
 
 
“There are a number of factors that lead me to question whether it makes sense to continue,” Rui Valente told HM. The experienced Touring car driver points out several reasons for this reflection, namely “the fact that Grand Prix races are of much less interest today, as they are almost always contested behind the Safety Car, the current scoring system for Macau qualification and the attitude of some drivers on the track”.
The most recent edition of the Grand Prix did not leave good memories for those who made their debut at the Guia Circuit in 1988. The Macau Roadsport Challenge weekend started negatively for the Portuguese driver, who did not avoid touching the rails in the Paiol area during free practice on Thursday, an incident that affected his entire performance. After achieving the 25th best time in the qualifying session, misfortune manifested itself again in the race, when the recovery attempt at the controls of the #16 Subaru BRZ ended prematurely on the approach to the São Francisco Curve. On the restart after the first Safety-Car, Rui Valente was hit by Li Kwok Chuen, in a maneuver in which the Hong Kong driver attempted to overtake on the inside, in a place where there was no available space.
"Even today I can't understand what went through his head. I don't know how he saw a space that simply didn't exist. Maybe he thought I was going to lift my foot to let him pass", recalled the driver, who has thirty-six participations in the Macau Grand Prix and was one of the nine representatives of the Macao SAR in the 2025 edition of the Macau Roadsport Challenge.
 
Qualification lottery
Rui Valente has been one of the most critical voices of the current qualifying model for the Grand Prix, which mainly benefits those who finish one of the races in the top ten. The use of identical vehicles by all competitors, Toyota GR86 (ZN8) or Subaru BRZ (ZD8), accentuates the balance of movement on the track. Added to this factor is the fact that only four races count towards qualification and that the grids often have more than three dozen participants, transforming each race into an authentic “pitched battle”, in which the objective is to achieve a top result in a single race to guarantee the points necessary to be on the starting grid for the event in November.
“With so many cars on the track at the same time, there are many drivers under enormous pressure to score points, which ends up causing a high number of incidents”, admits the Portuguese driver. “In this way, the qualification is closer to a lottery than a process truly based on merit”, adds the Premium Racing Team representative.
On the other hand, Rui Valente recognizes that younger people are the main losers. With experience clearly superior to that of newcomers, who have fewer kilometers of track and less competitive experience, the driver emphasizes, even so, that the difficulty is not restricted to newcomers. "Even for those who have been racing for many years, like me, qualifying is extremely complicated. If this is the case for the more experienced, it becomes clear that young people end up being the most penalized by this model", he concluded.
 
Next step
As for the future, Rui Valente – who received the award for third place among Macau drivers in Group A of the MTCS Macau Roadsport Challenge, at the 2025 Awards Ceremony of the General Automobile Association of Macau-China – has not yet made a definitive decision. The alternatives on the table include remaining in competition along the same lines, considering a change of category, an option conditioned by budgetary limitations, or, ultimately, putting an end to their participation in the Grand Prix, or even their career.
The second driver with the most participations in the history of the Macau Grand Prix, just behind Albert Poon, confesses that he has not lost his love for motorsport, an activity that keeps him in excellent physical shape at 64 years old. However, he admits that "perhaps it's time to leave Macau. It's a shame, because I really like this. In fact, the problem is that I like this a lot."</description><pubDate>2026-01-17 01:56:26</pubDate></item><item><title>Lamborghini | Asian debut of the Temerario GT3 could be in Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/09/lamborghini-estreia-asiatica-do-temerario-gt3-podera-ser-em-macau/</link><description>Lamborghini said goodbye to the Huracán GT3 at the 2025 Macau Grand Prix and is now aiming for the Asian debut of the recently launched Temerario GT3, scheduled for November, on the streets of our city
The ninth edition of the FIA ​​GT World Cup, scheduled for the 19th to 22nd of November at the Guia Circuit, appears as the likely stage for the debut on the Asian continent of the latest competition car from the Sant’Agata Bolognese brand, in a season in which the new twin-turbo V8 engine model will mainly be in a phase of competitive consolidation in Europe and the United States of America.
Due to the limitations inherent in the production and delivery of new cars, Lamborghini Squadra Corse never seriously considered the introduction of the Temerario GT3 in the Asia-Pacific market in its launch year, despite the interest expressed by several teams, including JLOC, the formation of the Japanese Super GT championship that local driver André Couto represented. Even so, there is a clear desire on the part of Automobili Lamborghini's competition department to put its new GT3 on the track in Asia this year, precisely in the context of the Macau Grand Prix.
“I can confirm that no Temerario will be entered in the GT World Challenge Asia or other regional championships,” explained a spokesperson for the Italian brand to the Portuguese portal SportMotores.com. "However, we are working on the FIA ​​GT World Cup in Macau, a race of enormous importance for us, where we intend to be present in the best possible way. At this stage, we cannot provide any further details."
The possibility of Lamborghini competing this year in the Macao SAR race with the old Huracán GT3 is ruled out. The model faced difficulties in 2024 related to the introduction of the mandatory and controversial torque sensors. Edoardo Mortara had a particularly ungrateful weekend, seeing his third best time in Super Pole canceled for exceeding the maximum power limit, later ending up abandoning the main race when his car shut down.
Production limitations
Unlike other competition departments of major manufacturers, the Lamborghini Squadra Corse is a relatively small structure. The main limiting factor in the implementation of the Temerario GT3 this season, especially outside Europe, is related not only to the availability of units, but above all to the priority given to adequate technical support from the factory.
The United States of America, where the car will make its competition debut at the 12 Hours of Sebring in March, continues to assume a strategic role for Lamborghini, hence the brand's full-time presence in the IMSA SportsCar Championship through the Pfaff Motorsports team. For the current season, Lamborghini Squadra Corse has allocated seven examples of the Temerario GT3 to competition in Europe, divided between the GT World Challenge Europe and the DTM. The Italian manufacturer plans to field three cars in the GT World Challenge Europe and four in the DTM.
Mercedes-AMG evaluates return
The absence of Mercedes-AMG in last year's edition was one of the most talked about topics in the paddock. This decision was justified by the lack of opportunities for Asian client teams to test the complex torque sensors, at a stage in which the Stuttgart brand is going through a demanding process of transitioning its sporting activities from HWA to the new subsidiary Affalterbach Racing.
“At this stage, it is not possible to say whether a Mercedes-AMG GT3 will compete in the FIA ​​GT World Cup in Macau in 2026,” an official source from the German manufacturer, who maintains high interest in the MSAR event, told Hoje Macau. "The race is extremely appealing, both from a sporting and strategic point of view. We will carefully analyze the conditions at the appropriate time and evaluate them together with the interested teams."
It should also be noted that the Macau Grand Prix could symbolize the definitive goodbye of the current Mercedes-AMG GT3, as the star brand is already developing the next generation of its car for the category, whose debut in competition could take place in 2027.</description><pubDate>2026-02-09 03:50:25</pubDate></item><item><title>GP | The driver with the most victories in the history of the race has passed away</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/02/gp-faleceu-o-piloto-com-mais-vitorias-da-historia-da-prova/</link><description>British John Macdonald passed away last week, aged 89, after a prolonged illness. He was the most successful driver in the history of the Macau Grand Prix and the only one to triumph on the Guia Circuit in both car and motorcycle races.
The news was released on social media by his friend Eli Solomon, a historian and writer based in Singapore, who in recent years worked, together with Angus Lamont, on the production of the book “King of Macau”. The work portrays the life and career of Macdonald, who lived for decades in Hong Kong and was one of the central figures of motorsport in Southeast Asia in the 1960s and 1970s.
"It is with deep sadness that I announce the passing of John Macdonald, which occurred on Sunday, January 25th, at the age of 89, after a prolonged illness. His mind remained as clear as ever, and he and Angus Lamont continued to work on King of Macau until the end of last year", wrote Eli Solomon, adding that "the final text was presented to him for approval at the end of last year, with the book expected to be ready for distribution this quarter, possibly in time for the deliveries in the UK for the Goodwood Members’ Meeting in April”.
John Macdonald remains the only competitor to have won all the main races held on the Guia Circuit: four victories in the Macau Grand Prix (1965, 1972, 1973 and 1975), the triumph in the 1969 Macau Motorcycle Grand Prix and victory in the inaugural edition of the Macau Guia Race in 1972. However, his passion for motor sport was not limited to racing in circuit. After starting out on motorcycles in the United Kingdom, he participated in the 1962 Central African Rally, driving a Lancia B20, and in 1963 in the Scottish International Rally, in a Land Rover. That same year he moved to Hong Kong, where he joined the local police. Throughout his career he won three international rallies, two in Hong Kong and one in the Philippines, the country where he became National Champion in 1974.
During his stay in Hong Kong, he was the owner of Camlex Garage, in Kowloon, after leaving Hutchinson, where he held the position of Group Service Director of Far East Motors, at the end of 1967. After retiring from business activity, he sold Camlex Garage, in 1981, to German Motors, owned by businessman and also pilot Herbert Adamczyk.
Eternalized with the wax statue in the Macau Grand Prix Museum, Macdonald was also associated with the famous phrase: “Motor sport is the only truly exciting sport that can be practiced sitting down”.
Sum of successes in Macau
His debut at the Macau Grand Prix took place in 1964, with a sixth place at the wheel of a Lotus Elan, in what was his first experience in speed racing in cars. The following year he returned with a Lotus 18, a formula purchased for 7,000 patacas from the renowned Team Harper, and his performance at the wheel of an already aged single-seater was widely praised. After a race marked by incidents and some confusion, he took the checkered flag in first place and achieved the first of his six victories on the Guia Circuit.
With the introduction of the Macau Motorcycle Grand Prix into the program in 1967, Macdonald could not resist taking part, also benefiting from the experience gained in the two-wheeled races he had competed in the United Kingdom at the end of the 1950s. In that debut year, marked by Japanese dominance, he did not stand out, but went on to win the race in 1969.
His second victory at the Macau Grand Prix came in 1972, driving a Brabham BT36 ex-Graham Hill, after an absolutely dominating performance, crossing the finish line with a 30-second advantage over second place. On the same weekend he also won the first edition of the Macau Guia Race, in an Austin Mini Cooper S, a replica of which is now on display at the Macau Grand Prix Museum.
With sponsorship and equipment to match his talent, he returned in 1973 to defend the Macau Grand Prix title, this time in a Brabham BT40, with which he had won in the Philippines and at the Malaysian city circuit of Penang, in addition to achieving third place in Singapore. After taking pole position, he became the first driver to win the race three times, also setting a new lap record.
His fourth and final victory at the Macau Grand Prix came in 1975, nine years before the race adopted Formula 3 regulations, at the wheel of a Ralt RT1. Faced with the strongest opposition yet, Macdonald prevailed again, recording his final triumph in the competition. His last participation in the Macau Grand Prix occurred in 1976. His farewell to Grand Prix racing as a driver took place in May 1977, at the Penang Grand Prix, although in that same year he continued to be linked to Macau as a sponsor, giving his Ralt RT1 to Vern Schuppan. He left Hong Kong in 1983 and moved with his wife to Andorra. His last years of life were spent in Mauritius.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Coloane | Kartódromo hosts the Champions of the Future Academy Program</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/09/coloane-kartodromo-recebe-o-champions-of-the-future-academy-program/</link><description>The Coloane Kartdrome will start the year at high speed, hosting from the 16th to the 18th of January the first edition in the territory of the new Champions of the Future Academy Program competition, organized and promoted by the Swiss company RGMMC Group
The Champions of the Future Academy Program is an international Arrive and Drive karting competition designed to develop the next generation of motorsport talent. According to the promoter, the event is aligned “with FIA sporting standards and combines elite competition with comprehensive training for drivers, offering young people the experience and international visibility necessary to launch professional careers, while keeping costs under control”.
With three competitive categories — Mini, OK-N Junior and OK-N Senior — the concept aims to bring together emerging talents from around the world to compete in world-class events. According to the organization, this event in Macau “aims to expand the Champions of the Future Academy Program to national series”, reinforcing the presence of the concept outside its main calendar.
In addition to the event in Macao, RGMMC, founded in 2004, also has a non-championship event planned in the United Arab Emirates in February. The regular championship consists of six stages, taking place between February and December, with visits to Spain, Greece, Italy, Oman and the United Arab Emirates. The same entity also promotes a series along the same lines in the United Kingdom.
The Champions of the Future Academy Program Macau, which has the support of the General Automobile Association of Macau-China (AAMC) and the MSAR Sports Institute, will take place over three competitive days, with two final races that determine the classification of the event winner for each category. The paddock will open to teams on Thursday, followed by a full day of free practice on Friday, while timed training and racing will take place on Saturday and Sunday.
Equal for everyone
Each category admits a maximum of 24 competitors, a limit that remains the same in all events. The Mini Group 3 category, aimed at drivers between 9 and 12 years old, will use Parolin chassis and TM engines, with a registration cost of approximately 32,750 patacas. The OK-N Junior categories, for ages between 12 and 14, and OK-N Senior, for ages 14 and 17, will compete with Kart Republic chassis and IAME engines, with the registration fee being around MOP42,125 per weekend.
As the name Arrive &amp; Drive indicates, these values ​​include the kart and its engine, space in the tent, necessary tools, tires — supplied in all classes by LeCont Pneumatici —, fuel, lubricants and all associated logistics. This way, drivers can focus exclusively on driving and, thanks to mechanical equality, competitive and lively races can be expected at one of the best kart tracks in Southeast Asia.
In 2026, the Coloane Kartódromo will have a particularly busy calendar. In addition to the karting and motorcycling competitions organized by the AAMC, the route designed by architect Carlos Couto will host the Chinese Karting Championship, on the 11th and 12th of April, the IAME Series Asia, on the weekend of the 23rd and 24th of May, and the Macau International Karting Grand Prix, scheduled for the period between the 11th and 14th of December.</description><pubDate>2026-01-09 02:34:46</pubDate></item><item><title>Davis Cup | Tiago Pereira makes his national team debut with China</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/09/taca-davis-tiago-pereira-estreia-se-pela-seleccao-com-a-china/</link><description>Tiago Pereira is the new addition to the national tennis team for the Davis Cup match with China, on February 6th and 7th, which also includes Nuno Borges, Francisco Cabral, Jaime Faria and Henrique Rocha, it was announced yesterday. “Tiago Pereira has been improving a lot and, in recent months, he has obtained good results not only in singles but also in doubles, which makes him an option for both variants”, said captain Rui Machado about the debutant.
In addition to the 21-year-old Algarvian, ranked 265th in the world rankings, Rui Machado's bet was on Nuno Borges (45th) and Francisco Cabral (20th), the best Portuguese tennis players today in singles and doubles, respectively, in addition to Henrique Rocha (157th) and Jaime Faria (151st).
Portugal has not competed at home since September 2022, then against Brazil, and the visiting condition has been favorable, but Rui Machado is confident in the group he will take to China.
“We are aware that it will be a very difficult tie against a team with experienced players, with a lot of potential and who have already proven that they can play at a very high level”, he considered, without knowing his counterpart Di Wu's chosen ones. Portugal will visit China in the play-off of Group I of the Davis Cup in tennis, in which they will try to avoid relegation to Group II, where they have not been since 2015.</description><pubDate>2026-01-09 02:28:28</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
