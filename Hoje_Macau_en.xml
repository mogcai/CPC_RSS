About 900 Chinese soldiers and more than 1,300 Cambojan soldiers participate in the exercises, which will extend until May 28, according to a statement from the Khmer Royal Forces (RCAF, Cambodia).
According to the statement, will be presented state -of -the -art Chinese military equipment, including armored vehicles, helicopters, war ships, recognition drones and robotic combat dogs. The objective is to “develop narrower ties and cooperation” between the two armies.
"The exercises are larger than last year in terms of personnel and equipment," RCAF spokesman Thong Solimo told AFP, adding that a Chinese war ship, Chanbai Shan, attracted Ream Cambodian naval base with the equipment. The ream base in southwest of Cambodia was renewed by China and inaugurated on April 2 by Prime Minister Cambodian Hun Manet and a Chinese military delegation.
“China wants to show its muscles” and send the message that “it is a superpower”, through these exercises, nicknamed “Golden Dragon,” argued or Virak, a Cambodian political expert, quoted by the French news agency.
In addition to this demonstration of strength, China must also “give confidence to its partners, telling them that China is growing, developing and becoming stronger, both in terms of dimension and technological progress and military power,” he added or Virak.
Cambodia should also receive two China war ships. The first joint military exercises, called “Golden Dragon”, took place in 2016 and, in early 2017, Cambodia ended the “Angkor Sentinel”, a similar joint exercise that had been organized in the previous seven years with US forces.</description><pubDate>2025-05-15 01:10:16</pubDate></item><item><title>Consulate | Sea Policy Director in Macau and HK</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/15/consulado-directora-da-politica-do-mar-em-macau-e-hk/</link><description>Marisa Lameiras da Silva, Director-General of the Directorate-General of Sea Policy, an entity linked to the Portuguese Government Ministry of Economy, will be in Macau and Hong Kong today and tomorrow for a series of activities and meetings with rulers.

Authorities add that this year there were no deaths resulting from Covid-19
 
While in the neighboring regions of Macao, COVID-19 infection cases continue to increase, here infection rates have been gradually descended since half of March, health services indicated in a statement released on Tuesday night.
Authorities add that although the Mand has surpassed the most critical point of covid-19 infections, coronavirus remains active in the territory. As such, they appeal to the care and adoption of preventive attitudes, especially between risk groups, such as elderly, chronic diseases and people with weakened immune system, namely taking complete vaccination against the JN.1 variant.
Regarding the evolution of infection rates in Macao and neighboring regions, the entity led by Alvis Lo explains that Macau entered the infectious peak before the surrounding areas.
According to laboratory monitoring data, the positivity rate of the new coronaviruses detected in patients with flu symptoms in Macau began to increase in late February this year, reaching the peak in mid -March. In March 16 and 22, the authorities record a positivity rate of 44.3 percent, which was decreasing from there.
In the last three weeks, the positivity rate has come down to 12 percent, rose to 17 percent and then went back to 11 percent, "which indicates a slight recovery," the health services concluded.
Walk there
With regard to collective infections that result in flu symptoms, between the beginning of the year and this week 111 cases were recorded, of which 26 were from COVID-19, detected mainly in elderly homes. In these cases, the authorities ensure that they have adequate medical services to the elderly homes, prescribing antiviral medications.
Throughout this year, so far, Macao has not registered any critical or fatal case caused by Covid-19 infection, is indicated. The prevalent coronavirus variant in Macao is currently the XDV variant related to DN.1, which is basically the same that circulates in the surrounding areas. The latest data do not show that XDV causes more serious illnesses than JN.1, XBB and its descendant strains.
As such, health services ensure that the JN.1 variant vaccine remains effective in reducing “risk of infection and developing serious diseases caused by the currently prevalent variant.</description><pubDate>2025-05-15 01:03:13</pubDate></item><item><title>BNU | 133.2 million profits in the first quarter</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/15/bnu-lucros-de-1332-milhoes-no-primeiro-trimestre/</link><description>Positive results show a 30 million patacas reduction compared to last year's first quarter. The reduction of the financial net margin was the main factor to contribute to the reduction of gains
 
In the first three months of the year, the Nacional Overseas Bank presented a non -audited profit of 133.2 million patacas, according to a statement issued yesterday. The value represents a reduction of 30 million patacas, or 18.4 percent, compared to the first quarter of 2024, when the profit had reached 163.2 million patacas.
Despite the reduction of profits, the amount is still above 2023 levels, when the institution declared a profit to the first quarter of 122.4 million patacas. The amounts presented yesterday are also close to what was happening in 2019, the last year before the pandemic, when profits in the first in the first quarter reached 138 million Patacas.
The most recent results were explained with a decrease in the net financial margin, which presented a reduction of 31.2 million patacas, or 11.8 percent, compared to the same period. Among the facts that contributed to this amendment, the institution pointed out the “changes in the composition of deposits and the evolution of reference interest rates”.
However, there were areas where the bank was able to get better results, as happened with liquid commissions, an area where an increase in gains of 3.8 million patacas was generated, equivalent to 18.1 percent. The increase was explained with "greater economic activity and greater customer involvement."
Squeezed
In the first quarter of this year, impairment losses related to credit exhibitions, mischievous credit, and financial investments increased to 5.4 million patacas, compared to the value of 1.3 million patacas in the first quarter of 2024. According to BNU, this increase took into account the “prudent provisioning practices”. "Despite this increase, the quality of BNU assets remains solid, supported by conservative credit practices and a robust level of provisions to respond to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties," he was guaranteed.
At the same time, operating expenses increased by 1.1 percent in homologous terms, which according to the institution showed “the effectiveness of bank cost optimization initiatives”. “Efficiency gains resulting from process simplification and strategic review of service supply helped compensate added investments in digital transformation, talent development and brand reinforcement,” was considered.
Last year, the institution led by Carlos Cid Álvares ended the year with a profit of 585.1 million patacas.</description><pubDate>2025-05-15 00:48:49</pubDate></item><item><title>IAS | Number of families supported up to the highest value since 2020</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/15/ias-numero-de-familias-apoiadas-sobe-para-valor-mais-alto-desde-2020/</link><description>Although the value of the threshold of poverty in Macau was not up to date for almost five years, the number of families supported by the Inclusion and Harmony Program in the community again exceeded the 5,500 barrier. May registration represented an annual growth of almost 13 percent
 
The number of monoparental families, with people with disabilities, or with chronic patients who will receive the May Special Grant from the Inclusion and Harmony Program in the community has risen to 5,540. With a growth of 12.9 percent compared to the same period last year, this is the highest value, at least since 2020, according to the Institute of Social Action (IAS). This program is intended to “alleviate life pressure” of single-padded families, people with disabilities or chronic patients considered “vulnerable”.
Last year, the number of approved families to receive May support to face poverty had been 4,905, a reduction in the face of 2023, when the number of aided families had been 4,049. Since 2021 that the number of families gathering conditions to access this support has not exceeded 5,000, which totaled 5,043. However, the highest value of the recent years was recorded by 2020 during the pandemic when a total of 5,503 families were supported.
The community inclusion and harmony program foresees the distribution of two supports, one in May and one in October, which are accessed through applications approved by IAS. It should be noted that the data presented only consider only the distribution of support in May of previous years.
Natural Trends
Among the 5,540 subsidized families is a total of 1,300 household aggregates who also receive the allowance for people in economic lack.
These families are the poorest in the territory, whose monthly income is below what is considered the threshold of the social risk of poverty. This level represents yields of 4,350 patacas per month, in the case of a single individual, rises to 7,990 patacas per month in households with two people, 11,020 patacas, in families with three people, 13,390 patacas with four people, 15,120 patacas when the aggregate consists of five people, progressively rising up to 20,270 patacas for eight or more members. These numbers have not undergone any change since 2019, in the first month of the Ho IAT SENG term, so they do not take into account the inflation of later years, which makes these amounts of purchasing power less than December 2019.
Regarding families with income below the social risk of poverty, the number of supports has been falling every year since 2020. In this year, there were 1,618 aggregates to receive the May subsidy of the community inclusion and harmony program, which was reduced to 1,576 in 2021, then to 1,486 by 2022, 1,385, at 2023, 1,308, until 1,300 families this year.
Less is no longer
The increase in the number of supported families is explained by the growth of households with monthly income above the social risk of poverty, but lower than the maximum limits for these supports. For aggregates with more than one person, the maximum limit of monthly income to access this support is 7,830 patacas, rises to 13,983 patacas per month in the aggregates with two people, 18,737 patacas in families with three members, 22,094 patacas in four members, 24,192 patacas in families with five members. The value rises progressively until it reaches the limit of 29,392 patacas per month, when families have eight or more members.
In 2020, the number of families under these conditions was 3,885, but fell to 3,467 in 2021 and to 3,125 in 2022, the lowest value since 2020. However, since this year the number of families in this income interval increased to 4,240. This is an increase of 335 families compared to the first year of the pandemic.
Supports of 22.55 million
The community inclusion and harmony program foresees the distribution of a total of 22.55 million patacas in May this year, the highest value since 2020, when 23.67 million patacas were distributed.
The program foresees the distribution of supports ranging from 2,650 patacas to household aggregates with a single person, and 10,100 patacas, when the aggregate consists of eight or more members, so an increase in the number of supported families does not necessarily reflect an increase in total distributed supports.
This support is distributed intended for single people with children in kindergarten, primary school, secondary or higher education; as well as households with members with chronic diseases or disabilities that are not admitted to public homes or subsidized by the government or in medical establishments dependent on health services.</description><pubDate>2025-05-15 00:46:50</pubDate></item><item><title>Metro | People's Covenant defends acceleration of connection to China</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/15/metro-alianca-do-povo-defende-aceleramento-de-ligacao-a-china/</link><description>The covenant of the people wants the planning of the Light Metro Network to take into account the links to Zhuhai and the National Railway Network. A guardian linked to the Fujian community argues that the light meter should be the main transport in Macao, with buses playing a complementary role
 
The slight meter should be the main means of public transport in Macao, while buses move to a secondary and complementary role. The position was taken by Tong Ho Laam, vowel of the executive board of the Povo's covenant of Macao, the official name, in statements to the newspaper or Mun.
Given the expected increase in demand and pressure on the public transport network and traffic in the city, the official indicated that the government should actively promote the strategy of making the meter light the main means of transportation in the city to relieve road pressure. Tong Ho Laam understands that when the lightweight metro stations network is extended, it will increase the overall effectiveness of public transport and ensure better experiences to residents and tourists. One of the improvements that can be implemented in the short-term is the ability to use electronic payments and harmonize the connection with buses.
In addition, the People's Covenant leader argues that the planning of Light Metro stations should be done in articulation with the Regional Industrial Development Strategy. An essential point is to ensure the connection with the national rail network through Zhuhai, a work that should be accelerated to reinforce Macao's position in the Great Bay.
The vowel believes that the connection to China, namely Hengqin, can bring a new impetus to the local industrial sector to pursue emerging areas at the Traditional Chinese Technological Innovation and Mountain Medicine poles.
Cure for all ills
Given the energy challenges resulting from the fight against climate change, the associative leader argues that the development of the light meter should be thought of from a long-term perspective, taking into account environmental protection. To this end, the MSar should reserve land for green energy production facilities to feed the slight meter. Tong Ho Laam pointed out this objective as a way for the Mand to stand out in environmental terms in the Great Bay area, adopting leadership in the goal of carbonic neutrality, while promoting economic diversification.</description><pubDate>2025-05-15 00:39:39</pubDate></item><item><title>Teaching | IA contents transmitted to local students</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/15/ensino-conteudos-sobre-ia-transmitidos-a-alunos-locais/</link><description>The Macao government says it is preparing students, teaching system and teachers for artificial intelligence, providing didactic materials in schools, classes and organizing training actions. Deputies also want initiatives on artificial intelligence outside schools
 
Schools and teachers are preparing for the reality of Artificial Intelligence (IA). According to the secretary's explanations for Social Affairs and Culture, the LAM, the Directorate of Services for Youth Education and Development (DSEDJ) “intends to provide AI content or related to science and technology, with an average duration of 10 hours per year, computer teachers and 6 hours to teachers of other subjects”, was referred to yesterday in response to an oral interpellation of Deputy Lam Lon Wai. The first actions already took place in the current school year.
In addition, the secretary confirmed that schools can adhere to manuals that include AI teachings. "Several reference materials on the interior of China were introduced for adoption in schools," said Lam.
Last year, DSEDJ joined South China Normal University to "establish a new basis for learning and exchange focusing on AI teaching." In this context, “didactic materials of this institution on the AI” are made available, and invitations are foreseen to “interior experts and academics to provide training and support for teaching staff in the development of AI teaching activities”.
At the legislative level, the executive says he made the necessary changes to “the program and teaching of AI become part of the curricula of primary and secondary schools”, and it is intended that “AI contents can be integrated into the curriculum guidelines of information technology classes”. The government intends to make the “interleavement evaluation of the planning of non-higher education in Macao, to build an innovative technological support system”, taking into account the “general lines of planning for the construction of a large educational power (2024-2035)”.
LAM indicated that, through the financing of the Educational Fund, it is intended to “optimize facilities and school equipment” to improve science teaching and create the “AI” classrooms project.
In this context, DSEDJ launched this year the pilot project of “Intelligent Teaching” to which 25 schools joined. "The established goal is to make the platform available to all secondary schools in Macao in the school year 2026/2027," the secretary said yesterday.
I was going to everyone
One of the interveners in yesterday's debate was Deputy Zheng Anting, who defended the partnership with playing operators for the creation of “AI classes” in hotels, in conjunction with tourists who pass through these spaces or even in community neighborhoods, “so that populations have greater contact with AI”. "We can develop actions in partnership with the six dealers, because they already have visitors," he added.
Regarding the AI ​​relationship with the population and the promotion of literacy in this area for adults, a representative of the Macau Science Center said this space can be “an open classroom so that, outside schools, new knowledge and learning scenarios of AI can be provided”.
"We will collaborate with more technology companies, because we want to have more technological resources to support this scientific background. The Science Center will create different measures to improve the digital literacy of the population by introducing AI, and so we can generalize education for AI for the whole society. The evolution of AI has been fast and we will invite experts to share the most advanced techniques and employment trends in this area, in order to create an AI training platform.
The official said that "shift workers could access this type of resources." LAM has ensured that the future goes through the "generalization of AI education for residents" and, for this, the government will "dialogue with associations so that these measures have a greater effect."</description><pubDate>2025-05-15 00:36:13</pubDate></item><item><title>“Golden Dragon” | China and Cambodia begin the largest joint military exercises of their history</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/15/dragao-de-ouro-china-e-camboja-iniciam-os-maiores-exercicios-militares-conjuntos-da-sua-historia/</link><description>China and Cambodia began yesterday the largest joint military maneuvers ever between the two countries, involving state -of -the -art Chinese military equipment, including artillery, war ships and robotic combat dogs.

In the case of the “Seascape” series, created in 1980, the Japanese photographer “records an elementary scene, the sky and the sea”, in a “ancient one that connects today's people to ancient times and that thus reflects eternity”. In turn, in the series of works entitled "Theater", comes "an over-exposed screen that compresses a two-hour movie in a white beam of light, encompassing both our consciousness and our subconscious perceptions."
In the case of the "Opticks" series, "the red, blue and green tones, presenting small colored particles under the lens, show the multifaceted nature of light through the prism." The organizers of the exhibition intend to "awaken the collective memories that are dormant in the images, related to the old, ephemeral and eternity."
The place of philosophy
Born in 1948 in Tokyo, Hiroshi Sugimoto continues to work in this city, but also in New York. Considered a "of photographers with greater philosophical depth in contemporary art," with a work that "explores time, memory, history and the essence of existence through minimalist formats."
Sugimoto is also considered “excellent in using photography as a 'time container', condensing abstract concepts in eternal images that evoke the contemplation of life and cosmos through their serene stillness”.
Since 2023, he has been a member of the Japanese Academy of Arts, having received the National Arts Club photography medal in New York in 2018. The Japanese photographer also belongs to the Real Academy of Belgium, having an honorary doctorate attributed by the prestigious Parsons School of Design, also located in New York, USA. Has works in selected museum collections such as the Modern Museum of Art (MoMA), in New York, or or Metropolitan Museum, in the same city; As well as Tate in London and Getty Museum in Los Angeles, among others.</description><pubDate>2025-05-15 01:15:32</pubDate></item><item><title>Range and Route | Colombia confirms adherence to the Chinese initiative</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/15/faixa-e-rota-colombia-confirma-adesao-a-iniciativa-chinesa/</link><description>In the Chinese capital to participate in the China-Celac Forum (Latin American and Caribbean Community), Colombian President Gustavo Petro signed a memorandum to join the Track and Route International Trade Initiative
 
China and Colombia signed yesterday in Beijing a cooperation plan for the Latin American country to join the Chinese track and route initiative, confirmed the Colombian presidency through the social network X. The Memorandum, signed in Beijing by the leaders of both countries, Xi Jinping and Gustavo Petro, brings together Colombia to an initiative with which the Asian giant intends to generate an international trade network and Extend its influence worldwide through the construction of infrastructure, and to which more than twenty countries in Latin America and Caribbean have joined.
“Under this meeting, Colombia has signed an important economic cooperation agreement for the adhesion of our country to the [initiative] track and route,” says the Colombian presidency. Xi and Petro gathered yesterday to reinforce bilateral ties by signing new agreements, including this, among all the most emblematic.
Before traveling to China, Petro revealed that on his previous voyage to the Asian country in October 2023, he intended to sign this memorandum, but at the time it was not possible due to an alleged mistake of his previous Foreign Minister, Álvaro Leyva.
"This is what I am going to do now, an agreement of intent; future governments will see if the intention comes true, and must come true," the Colombian president said. Petro was with Xi on Tuesday at the opening of the China-Celac Forum (Latin American and Caribbean Community) in the Chinese capital, where he appealed to a dialogue between civilizations “free from authoritarianism and imperialism”.
The trade scale between Colombia and China is particularly unfavorable to the Latin American country, whose annual deficit is about $ 14 billion. By 2024, Colombia exported $ 2.38 billion from goods to China and imported $ 15.9 billion from Chinese products.
In addition, between 1994 and 2023, China invested $ 813.3 million in Colombia -yet a value far lower than the United States and Spain -concentrated in sectors such as infrastructure, mining exploration, energy and transport.
Other ties
In addition to trade, Colombia is trying to reinforce technological cooperation with China. On Tuesday, Petro visited the headquarters of the Huawei 'giant' in Beijing telecommunications, where, according to Colombian Minister of Information and Communications Technology, Julián Molina, eventual initiatives for cooperation in the domains of artificial intelligence, data infrastructure and connectivity were discussed.
Petro's government's interest in strengthening commercial ties with China during the visit has caused internal controversy, due to the fear of any negative repercussions on the relationship with the United States, Colombia's largest commercial partner.</description><pubDate>2025-05-15 01:05:51</pubDate></item><item><title>Macau maintains shipping by air to the United States</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/13/macau-mantem-envio-de-encomendas-por-via-aerea-para-estados-unidos/</link><description>The Macau Post Office Director told Lusa yesterday that, unlike neighboring Hong Kong, the region kept ordering orders to the United States (USA), but only by air. On May 2, the US government eliminated the exemption of customs rights on small orders from mainland China and Hong Kong, such as those sent by the giants of Electronic Trade Shein and Temu.
"In practice, now Macau is not included and the mail [which] goes to the United States is walking, except maritime. The rest, we keep normal," said Derby Lau Wai Meng. The Director of Post and Telecommunications Services (CTT) explained that the shipping of any goods, from sea to the US, implies a passage through Hong Kong, one of the busiest ports in the world.
That is, there is only the hypothesis of sending orders by air, confirmed Derby Lau. "This case is sensitive," admitted the leader. "I think it's better not to talk [this subject], because the best thing is not to remember us," he added.
Trump in Action
The end of the exemption of customs rights on small orders from mainland China and Hong Kong emerged in an executive order, signed by US President Donald Trump on April 2.
The document asked the US Secretary of Commerce, Howard Lutnick, to submit a report, within 90 days, if the end of the exemption should also cover Macao, "to avoid escape to these measures."
On April 16, Hong Kong's post office announced the suspension of sending orders to the United States in response to the imposition, "abusive", tariffs by US authorities.
A presidential decree issued by Donald Trump, still in the first term, in 2020, eliminated the preferential treatment granted to Hong Kong. The ancient British colony is therefore also affected by the 145 percent surcharge imposed on China.
Chinese Communist Party's main official for Hong Kong and Macao affairs and governments of both regions accused the United States of imposing tariffs in mid -April to sabotage China.
Macao Executive leader Sam Hou Fai criticized the United States for the “abusive imposition of customs taxes on all his business partners,” including China, “under various pretexts”. Yesterday, the US representative for the United States, Jamieson Greer, said Washington and Beijing will suspend the majority of customs rights and negotiate for 90 days.
In the negotiations made in Geneva, the United States and China agreed to reduce the reciprocal customs rights imposed on each other, passing Chinese imports to pay a 30 percent customs right, while US products will pay a 10 percent customs right.</description><pubDate>2025-05-13 05:36:16</pubDate></item><item><title>PAULO MAIA AND CARMO</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/autor/paulomaiaecarmo/</link><description>Liu Yuxi (772-842), Luoyang's poet (Henan), contemplating the heavens noticed in certain birds who liked to dwell with families and indicated a permanence within the constant change of stations.

In the epitome of its speed, this trait was designated Feiba, the "flying white", which left only the traces of the brush passage.

May 2025
In Chinese proverbial lessons I discovered great affinities between spontaneous Chinese popular philosophy, which runs from mouth to mouth, and the Christian proverbial wisdom, also made so that believers, in every corner of the globe, could memorize, repeat and disseminate.
Nothing like the other's knowledge to bring and dispel prejudice, being one of the most usual that Chinese are extremely pragmatic and cold. But when we come across proverbs such as “love others as yourself,” in a direct translation and faithful to the original “爱人如己” (ài Rú Rú Jǐ), such leads us to think twice, it seems not to be here just a matter of respect, uncharged and formal, but rather a strong feeling for the other, not any, only a deep affection, of those we understand well that we are good, we will be well, we will be well, we will be well, we will be better. Then he runs a love of the Christian way for China without Christ ever been. Such finding can lead us to the assumption of the existence of universal structures, not only logical, including as regards affections, therefore sentimental. After all, selfishness may not be a dominant tendency, there is everything: selfish, aggressive and competitive people, as others will be naturally altruistic, compassionate and cooperatives, ready to recognize the universality of the feeling of love, which crosses borders rather than erecting them, bringing people closer to the most diverse social classes, ethnic groups, geographies, as in "love has no borders", in a direct translation "" (Àiqíng wú jiējí zhī fēn), here is particularly emphasized social borders.
The content of the message gains full sense when one realizes that love to oneself takes place in a culture that many consider wrong and prejudiced only to focus on the whole, in the community.  Attention to the person, the particular and the style and feeling of each, lives, in philosophies such as Taoist for centuries with the valorization of the collectivity, this ultimate tendency manifestly inculcated and worked by Confucianism.  Love to itself, care for the individual body and mind, is emphasized in the so -called Proverbial “well -understood love and virtue must begin with us”, which has the following correspondence in Chinese “爱德从己起” (to Cong Jǐ qǐ).
Anyone who imagines that in proverbial wisdom there is only place to praise and sing relational love, since the Chinese do not have any religious philosophy that chants spiritual love above all, in the Christian way of St. Augustine, will be surprised to find the following proverb "where there is no other gentleman", that in a direct translation of the Chinese is "the love above all" 爱情至上 爱情至上 爱情至上ZHì Shàng).
If in doubt, there is another saying of complementary meaning and in which the idea of ​​the integrity and unity of this powerful affection, which moves mountains in the Christian sense, when it reads 爱情专一 （（（（iqíng zhuān yī）, in a possible translation "love cannot be broken", "one person cannot have a heart in two parts at the same time."
From a psychological point of view, the acceptance of the other in loving terms will have to be complete, so their tastes, affections, relationships, and objects cannot be rejected, as is clear from the lesson "Who loves Beltrão, loves their dog", in a relative correspondence for "爱屋及乌" (ài wū jí wū), which in a literal translation would be "love the house and the crums."
As is well known, proverbs are susceptible to various interpretations, so they say polysemic, but if they are perspective as a whole, and only then as pieces of a puzzle, there seems to be many doubts with regard to the proverb philosophy and psychology of Chinese love, which is echoed in the country's scholarly philosophies.
In Chapter 67 of the Book of the road and virtue (《道德经》), also known by the name of the Patriarch of Taoism, Lazi (老子), is the first of the three guiding virtues of the Wise Way, Love, as you can read in the translation of Claudia Ribeiro (2004, 139):
I have three treasures
What entesouro and retains:
The first is love (CI),
The second frugality,
The third is not daring to be the vanguard of the world.
(…)
For love,
In combat, it triumphs,
And in defense it is firm.
The sky will come to aid
And, with love, will protect
(我有三寶/寶而持之/一曰慈/二曰儉/三曰不敢為天下先 (……) 夫慈以戰則勝//以守則固/以慈衛之 1)
It is noted that while in proverbial philosophy the synogram used for love is 爱/愛 2 (AI), in the scholarly philosophy of the Patriarch of Taoism the term employment is 慈 (CI), that is, love with a strong relational and spiritual burden; Although they are different words, both refer to love, the first concerns the most physical and concrete feeling, centered on the heart of the person and the clutches that hold it;  The second to that most relational and general indicates that love comes from inside the heart (内心 nèixīn), where it has the roots, emerging like any plant. However, the truth is that both terms focus on people, or rather in their hearts, affectionate connection with others, such a strong connection that draws the attention of heaven (天 tiān), maximum impersonal power, it ensures victory on all battle fronts, whether in the forefront or rear, when fighting and defended itself for love.
Already the patriarch of Confucianism, Confucius (孔子), in the Chapter Twelve, later entitled the deep face, of the Analects (論語 • 颜渊第十二 ， 22) defines the main virtue of the school, benevolence or humanity, (仁 Rén) as an act of love to others, maintaining the term of the traditional vernacular 爱 (AI): “Fan Chi asked what was the benevolence was what answered, "love people". " (樊遲問仁 ， 子曰 「愛人 3。 ”) It is in this context of love of neighbor, that one of the main maxims of Confucian philosophy must be understood, which arises in the same chapter (論語 • 颜渊第十二 ， 2)“ Do not make the others what they do not want for you ”(己所不欲勿施於人 jǐ suǒ bù yù shunk yú rén).
The essentials in Confucian philosophy will then guarantee love of others in terms of respect or humanity towards others, in order to ensure the normal functioning of society, without extreme sacrifices or exaggerated explorations, given to the proverb containment of confusion in relation to feelings, they are important and useful but should not extravate the boundaries of rationality, that is, even the best of them, will have to be measured, controlled and ritualized in the name of harmony collective. Therefore, the love that moves friendships, especially intellectuals, is the most praised, as we remembered at the end of this chapter (論語 • 颜渊第十二 ， 24):
Zeng Zi stated: “A gentleman resorts to knowing to make friends and friends to cultivate benevolence4” (曾子曰：君以文會友 ， 以友輔仁。)
Finally, also the Buddhist philosophy, especially from the Chan (禅 Chán) or Zen meditation line, praises the love of humanity, but indirectly, drawing attention to the heart and the identification of Buddha with the heart, the way of the Daoxin Patriarch (道信) and its maximum proverbially known “the heart is Buddha and Buddha is the heart” (非心不问佛 ， 问佛不非心 fēi xīn bùwèn fu, wèn fi bù fēi xīn). Here you come to love indirectly, only an enlightened heart can love the Buddha, as it is not surprising in the picture of this philosophy, after all what is Buddha but the very love that expresses itself not in a selfish, sick, self -centered heart, but in a heart capable of establishing relationships, healthy, altruistic and without empty, but not indifferent to the other?  This confirms it the social and humanitarian actions of Via Mahayana Buddhism, which was accepted in China and unfolds in collective works such as the construction of educational institutions, hospitals, centers of social solidarity, in a proselytist action at all similar to the history of the Christian Church and its missionaries around the world.

"Now that we have a new Latin American Pope should be given an example in all Latin American episcopades that, by decision and by the Pope, there can be no double standard" among the various Catholic hierarchies around the world, "said Argentine Sebastián Cuattromo, from the adult collective for the rights of the child.
On the day the Pope made the first Sunday greeting in St. Peter's Square, praying Regina Caeli, a group of victims joined the square to ask the Vatican to impose common rules on the whole church.
Cuattromo, 42, set an example of what is happening "in the first world societies and Latin America that acts as a Vatican backyard, where the same [repair] demands are not felt, such as they are felt before European public opinion."
"As a survivor of childhood sexual abuse within the Catholic Church, with other companions survivors of this crime, we hope that the Pope will make an explicit mention of this question and an explicit reference to what he intends to do about it to pay off very large debts that, in our opinion, the Catholic Church still has to the victims," ​​said Cuattromo.
“We victims broke the taboo, silence, denial, concealment, with our struggles, with a huge sacrifice, and reached a level of visibility in public opinion,” which forced the church to face the problem.
Therefore, the global group of victims subscribed to a petition already delivered, in which they require “a true zero tolerance law that is established as canonical law”, which would “imply the immediate expulsion of the religious life of anyone involved in these acts”.
Moreover, they propose a “Truth Commission that should not be directed by the Vatican, but by international human rights organizations with the United Nations standards and with which the Vatican would have to fully cooperate, freeing all the archives he has on the subject”.
Finally, the victims intend a “justice process for the victims, where, among other things, there are concrete actions of reparation and justice for survivors around the world”, with the costs supported by the Church's own goods.

In the first person
In his particular case, Sebastian Cuattromo filed an action against a religious from a Catholic school of Buenos Aires for sexual abuse and won the process in 2012, even before the election to the Pope of then Cardinal Bergoglio, archbishop of the Argentine capital. "Then the city's Catholic hierarchy was against the victims and supported the school, which intended to silence the victims of this offense through a private economic agreement," he recalled.
"They made us feel a profound underestimation of the severity of the crime we were talking about," because, at that moment, "I was a young man who was fighting in solitude, with many doubts, with a lot less, with much anguish and felt an absolute lack of empathy and, instead, deep arrogance," he explained.
After Francis' election, "I invited him publicly and privately to meet with the victims of his country, especially those who had bad experiences," but the Pope "never had the courage or sensitivity of calling us."
For the new Pope, who is also accused of having ignored abuse complaints when he was a prior of the Augustinhos, Cuattromo expects Leo XIV to “assume this theme personally” and to be willing to “go to the last consequences”. Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost, 69, was elected Pope on Thursday after two days of Conclave, in the Vatican City, and took the name of Leo XIV.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Osaka 2025 | Japanese architect Kengo Kuma considers it to be friendly with architecture</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/12/osaka-2025-arquitecto-japones-kengo-kuma-considera-ia-amiga-da-arquitectura/</link><description>Japanese architect Kengo Kuma states in an interview with Lusa that she wanted to show the uniqueness between Portugal and Japan in the Portuguese Pavilion project at Expo 2025 Osaka and considers AI (artificial intelligence) friendly to architecture.
Asked if Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a friend or enemy of architecture, Kengo Kuma opts for the first option. "Yes, it's a friend", because in fact in the design process "we are working with AI".
Artificial intelligence “is a very strong team between us” and “we like to work” with this technology, he says. “We wanted to show the relationship with the ocean in Portugal,” says Kengo Kuma, when asked what was the project's inspiration. Portugal participates in Expo Osaka with the theme “Ocean, Blue Dialogue” and is located in the “Empowering Lives” zone, in a lot with 1,836.75 square meters, being close to the Japan Pavilion.
The Kuma Kuma project expresses the dynamics of the ocean moment, using 9,972 suspended cables weighing more than 60 tons, and recycled networks to create a perennial effect and exposed to natural elements such as sun and wind, according to the organization.
Sea connections
The life of Portugal and Japan is “very close to the ocean”, in the sense that “we eat fish, we travel a lot through the oceans and history and life are closely linked to the ocean,” adds the architect. There is this “uniqueness of Portugal and Japan and we want to show” this similarity between the two countries.
The volume of the Portugal Pavilion is characterized by a scenic facility that symbolizes the upper square suspended as a wave.
"This design is very, very new to the history of art. We have long tried to use lines as a resource for navigation. With these lines, we try to show the beauty of natural phenomena," in the sea "we see natural light and breeze," he explains.
“We tried to bring this kind of natural phenomenon to the Expo, perhaps the first attempt in the history of the expo to bring its own nature to the pavilion,” says the architect. About what will happen to the pavilion after finishing the Expo, the architect says he wants to bring the diversity of the project (which includes cables of various diameters and lengths) to different places.
“I want to bring this diversity to different places” and “now we are planning to work with some artists” about it. Kengo Kuma said that the Slaughterhouse Project in Porto is completing and has two more projects in Portugal.
The architect says he loves the side of the big cities in Portugal, but also the mountainous side and the ocean of the country. “We want to enjoy the diversity of Portugal,” he says.
Create Memories
Asked how can the more sustainable architecture become currently become, Kengo Kuma considers that "the most important for sustainability is to leave the memory of architecture forever." That is, "architecture, life, basically, are not so permanent."
However, “we can leave the memory of architecture forever, which is the connection between architecture and humanity” and this “is the most important for sustainability,” he says. Used to comment on the controversy around his choice to project the Portuguese pavilion, the architect points out that he has an international office working in Portugal.
"Maybe that's why we were invited," he concludes. Sobre os desafios que a arquitectura enfrenta actualmente, Kengo Kuma refere que o seu custo está a aumentar “drasticamente” e que todos querem reduzi-lo.
"But at the same time, people want to create a new monument" for this pillar. "And the cost and monumentality must walk together" today. Expo 2025 runs since April 13 and runs until October 13 on the artificial island of Yumeshima, located on the edge of Osaka, Kansai, Japan.</description><pubDate>2025-05-12 04:03:32</pubDate></item><item><title>Startups | Portugal interested in the SINO-LUSOPHONE TECHNOLOGY FUND</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/09/startups-portugal-interessado-no-fundo-sino-lusofono-de-tecnologia/</link><description>A delegation from Macao, with government representatives and local startups, is in Portugal to meet with leaders of Portuguese companies and participate in the SIM conference, which ends today in Porto.

The objective is to strengthen ties with the entrepreneurship ecosystems of Lisbon and Porto and reinforce Portugal's interest in the new Sino-Lusophone Technology Fund designed to support startups, which will be managed by Heng Qin Group's Zhuhai state company.
In this sense, a protocol between AEIMCP and the nascent Value, “Portuguese company with extensive investor capture” and also “accelerating small business growth (SME) and startups in Portugal and Portuguese-speaking countries, focused on innovation and cutting-edge technology”, is signed on Monday, in Lisbon, in Lisbon, in Lisbon.
The protocol signed on Monday signs the highest Portuguese access to the new Sino-Lusophone Technology Fund. The document was signed as part of a visit from the Macau Group to Lispolis - Lisbon Technological Pole.
The nascent Value thus becomes a “exclusive agent for investor capture services in Portugal, focusing on the involvement of investors in the background” SINO-LUSOPHONE, whose official name is “from Heng Qin Sino-Maluso Technology and Innovation Investment LPF”. This “promotes investments in high quality science and technology innovation companies in Portuguese -speaking countries”, explains the same note.
Thus, this protocol will allow AEIMCP, as a connecting entity between Portugal and the Fund via Macau, and the nascent Value, “reinforce its commitment to support startups, promote transfronhoring investment and create new opportunities for collaboration between Macau, Portugal and other Portuguese -speaking countries”.
Quoted by the same note, AEIMCP's Marco Duarte Rizzolio, said this new agreement shows how the entity, which also organizes the “929 Challenge” contest, is committed to “creating bridges for the global startup growth, facilitating the entry of Portuguese startups into the Chinese market through Macao, as well as the expansion of Chinese startups to Portugal and Europe”.
In turn, Rui Ferreira said that “the signing of this protocol is an important milestone for connecting innovation ecosystems and promoting synergies between macao startups and Portuguese investors”. "We are confident that this partnership will bring significant results for both sides," he added.
At HM, Rui Ferreira explained that the signature of the protocol represents the culmination of a work of about a year.
“We want to promote a model of welcoming startups and companies from Macao that want to enter Europe through Portugal, as well as in Portuguese-expression countries, and vice versa, that is, to place, through Macau, companies of these territories, but always through Portugal, in the East, in order to obtain easier connections with the Chinese market.”
Thousand Visits
Macao's group visited several essential points of the Portuguese entrepreneurship sector. In addition to the visit to Lispolis, considered the “key moment to foster dialogues between Deep Tech startups and potential investors, consolidating Macau's vision as an innovation and entrepreneurship hub with global range”, the entourage passed through the unicorns factory in Lisbon, and the PWC consultant.
Marco Duarte Rizzolio explained to HM the benefits to Macao from the journey through Portugal. “In addition to the interest in the Sino-Lusophone Fund and its preparation, as it will be released soon, our focus has also been the startups. On the visit to Lispolis macao startups made a pitch [attempted investment tarning], presented their products and had a networking session with other startups. Immersion in the Entrepreneurship Ecosystem in Portugal. ”
According to Marco Duarte Rizzolio, Macao's entourage only took to Portugal to startups with a more advanced business phase, namely Zence Object, founded by Calvin Sio and obtained a $ 2.5 million financing from the Alibaba Group entrepreneurs to the Great Bay area. Zence Object uses patented technology to transform organic waste, namely tea leaves, into alternative plastic and paper products. The idea is that these recycled and transformed products can be used on a daily basis, such as home or decorating utensils.
"There are startups in Macau who are very advanced in terms of business and we have brought to Portugal. We want to explore new opportunities for internationalization, so that they explore other markets, as these startups already have some development. We want to create partnerships, so that these representatives realize what the market is like and explore possible customers," said the representative of AEIMCP.
By unbeaten paths
Macao's entourage is today in Porto to participate in “SIM Conference” [Startups &amp; Investment Matching], where “it will have its own stand to present projects and connect with investors and possible customers”. This event was organized by the Entity Startup Portugal, which invited to be present.
Also today will be signed another protocol, this time between the association that organizes the contest “929 Challenge” and Startup Portugal. The idea is, according to Marco Duarte Rizzolio, “stimulate the connection of the Portugal ecosystem with Macau and help in the process of internationalization of the startups on both sides, both the Portuguese who are intended for the great bay, through Macau, both the macao startups that go to Portugal”.
The official has no doubt that what is lacking in knowledge is left in interest. “There is a great interest in China, but at the same time there is a great ignorance. The startup ecosystem in Portugal is much more linked to Europe. When we talk to the unicorns factory, it has been told that there was a great interest in the Macao and China market, but that these visits to Portugal were lacking. It is growing a lot in technology and artificial intelligence, with the launch of DeepSeek, for example. ”
According to Rui Ferreira, the presence of the delegation of Macao in “Yes Conference” will allow access to “privileged and wider contacts”, as it is a national event. "With this visit we have been able to do two things: starting the relationship with AEIMCP more formally and helping Macao companies know of partners and investors. We also want to bet on the work for the future Sino-Musso fund, to prepare companies with investment potential," he said.
For Rui Ferreira, the Macao market has the potential “to be used as a business exchange platform, thanks to linguistic connection, and there is conditions in the territory to establish all the part of reception, support and exchange with China entities and create an ecosystem”. In addition, “it will be interesting Macao to make a specialized innovation hub in strategic areas”, which in this case is technology. Highlight for the fact that the visit also had the organization of the Macao Sino-Lusophone Platform Association for sustainable development.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Leo XIV offers Vatican mediation to “silence the weapons”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/15/leao-xiv-oferece-mediacao-do-vaticano-para-silenciar-as-armas/</link><description>Pope Leo XIV yesterday exhorted world leaders to sit down and negotiate to “silence the weapons” and offered the Vatican's mediation to all belligerent parts. "The Holy See is available for enemies to meet and look in their eyes," Leo XIV told Vatican to speak at the representatives of the 23 Catholic churches of the East.
The Pope said it is necessary that "peoples can rediscover the hope and dignity to which they are entitled," the dignity of peace. "The people want peace and I, with my heart, say to the leaders of the people: We find, we speak, negotiate! War is never inevitable, weapons can and should be silenced, because they do not solve problems, but increase them," he said.
The US Pope's appeal appears on the eve of possible negotiations in the Turkish city of Istanbul about the Russian War against Ukraine. It is also unknown if today's conversations can include a meeting between Russian presidents, Vladimir Putin, and Ukrainian, Volodymyr Zelensky. Other wars have caused suffering in other latitudes, such as the Middle East, Africa or Asia.
First-hand
Leo XIV said in the Paul VI room, before thousands of people who moved to the jubilee of countries such as Syria, Ukraine, Lebanon and Iraq, which the oriental churches know "firsthand the horrors of war."
"To the point that Pope Francis has called martyrs to your churches," he said, quoted by the Spanish news agency Efe. "It is true: from the Holy Land to Ukraine, from Lebanon to Syria, from the Middle East to Tigray [Ethiopia] and to the Caucasus, so much violence," he lamented.
The Pope, applauded by the hearing, said the horror of war and "of the massacres of so many young lives" should cause indignation, "because in the name of military conquest people die."
He asked him to pray for peace, which he described as "reconciliation, forgiveness, courage to turn the page and start over." “For this peace to differ, I will do everything within my reach,” he promised. "The church will not get tired of repeating:" May weapons shut up, "he said.
Leo XIV said that others are not enemies, but human beings, "they are not bad people to hate, but people to dialogue." The Pope has asked to escape "from the typical manichaeist visions of violent narratives, which divide the world between good and bad."
Leo XIV prayed for the oriental and Latin Christians, who, especially in the Middle East, "resist their lands, stronger than the temptation to abandon them." He also launched a new appeal to be given to Christians the opportunity to remain where they live "with all the rights necessary for a safe existence."
Robert Prevost, 69, born in the United States, but with double American and Peruvian nationality, leads the Catholic Church since May 8, under the name of Leo XIV.

The linguist, who was born in 1842, was the subject of a lecture conducted by researcher Hugo Cardoso, linked to the University of Lisbon
 
Porto, 1883. José Leite de Vasconcelos writes a letter to the German linguist Hugo Schuchardt who had been developing studies, albeit at a distance, about the languages ​​spoken in Asia originated in Portuguese, the so -called Creoles. The letter, written according to the spell agreement of the time, however digitized and today to keep the Archive of the University of Graz, Austria, comes in the context of Schuchardt's own requests to Vasconcelos Milk on the Creole that was then spoken in Macao, known as Patuá.
“My respectable friend: I can only respond to you today. Here in Porto there are no books that say, but I wrote to Lisbon to my friend Vianna and he replied that the Balsmanha does not appear, and that in Macao's story there comes nothing about the dialect port. From Macau. Usual.
I have already asked for information about the Creoles, but I have not yet got anything; This study also interests me about regarding Portuguese. I look forward to the 2 new booklets that promises me. (…) Without anymore I am a friend, J. Vasconcelos Leite, Porto, S. Victor, 25 ”.
Hugo Schuchardt's interest in Luso-Asian Creole has been studied by Hugo Cardoso, a researcher and professor at the Faculty of Letters of the University of Lisbon (FLUL), a Creole specialist who developed investigation at the University of Macao.
The academic recently led a lecture at the National Library in Lisbon over the linguist born in Gotha, Germany, in 1842 and died in Graz, Austria, in 1927, being considered one of the most important linguists of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. The session was called “Hugo Schuchardt and the search for the Luso-Asian Creole”.
Despite Schuchardt's interest on Macao's Creole, he did not publish any academic work on the subject, as he told HM Hugo Cardoso. "Schuchardt did not publish any work on Macau. However, when he covered his correspondence, it is clear that Macau was also on his radar, since he discusses the Macao Creole with several of his correspondents, including Vasconcelos milk and Gonçalves Viana," he said.
After the German linguist, Hugo Cardoso highlights, “there were actually several people who leaned over Macau Creole, including Danilo Barreiros, José dos Santos Ferreira (Adé), Graciete Batalha, Ana Maria Amaro and, more recently, Prof. Raúl Gaião and Prof. Mário Pinharanda Nunes”. Also noteworthy is the study of Marie Arana-ward "about the Creole spoken by the descendants of Macanese in Hong Kong."
This is another change of correspondence with Vasconcelos milk, dated December 28, 1889, in which books and dictionaries about Portuguese and Chinese are mentioned. “Exmo. Friend: I hurried to respond to your ticket, since you are in a hurry. What I know from China-Portuguese is as follows: J. A. Gonçalves,-Portuguese Dictionary and China-Portuguese. Macau 1831;-China art, Alphabeto and Grammatica. (…) I estimate you to have good shoes. Friend thanks, José Leite de Vasconcellos ”.
The role of rabbit
Hugo Cardoso, whose doctoral thesis is called “The Indo-Portuguese Language of Diu”, former territory of the so-called Portuguese India along with Goa and Damão, spoke at the National Library of Hugo Schuchardt's Studies around this Creole and also the language of Batávia/Tugu in Indonesia.
For the professor at FLUL, pioneering in the study of the Creoles is an expression that rhymes with Schuchardt. The German linguist was “absolutely pioneering in this domain, not only in the study of the Luso-sieious Creole or even the Portuguese Lexical Base Creoles globally, but in the study of Creole languages ​​in general” and, for this reason, is “a larger figure in the history of linguistics”.
Hugo Cardoso also points out that "as regards the Portuguese lexical base creoles, before him, there had been some activity, especially by Adolfo Coelho, who, in 1881, had published" The Romanesque or Neo-Latin dialects in Africa, Asia and America, "in which he was a caught in several Portuguese-based Creole." However, in this work, Adolfo Coelho refers only to three Luso-Asiatic Creole: “Ceylon's (at Sri Lanka), Malaca and Macau's-giving some examples that he could get from previous publications (such as Macau's Ta-Ss-Yang-Kuo magazine)”.
The academic has no doubt that “Hugo Schuchardt was surely inspired by Rabbit's work, but his efforts to obtain primary data from many other Asian places greatly expanded the cartography of the Luso-Asian Creole and resulted in the first published news and the first grammatical descriptions of many of them (such as Diu, Cananor, Mahé, Mangolor, Mangar, Mangar etc.) ”.
Future inspirations
According to Hugo Cardoso, the German linguist left works that inspired future academics and many materials from the personal archive. "One effect of his work was to inspire other agents to develop similar work: there stands out the figure of Sebastião Rodolfo Dalgado, who led his own research and made his own publications about Indo-Portuguese Creoles that Schuchardt had not approached, about Damão, Bombaim, Ceylon and Negapatão."
In the case of José de Leite Vasconcelos, who wrote the letter cited at the beginning of this text, "it also corresponded with Schuchardt and reveals, in his linguistic studies, the impact of Schuchardt's work."
Asked by HM about the possible interconnections between the Creole of IUD, Batávia and Macao, Hugo Cardoso states that there are "continuities between the various Luso-Asian Creole, but also many differences." "The Batávia/Tugu Creole is the one that most resembles Creole de Macao, for example, at the Lexicon level. But this is understandable because it has already shown that Macao Creole has an important historical connection with the Creole that developed in Southeast Asia, in particular Malaca."
According to an academic article by Hugo Cardoso himself written in partnership with Tjerk Hagemeijer and Nélia Alexandre, entitled “Portuguese Lexical Base Creoles”, these “were, in most cases, oral languages ​​to the nineteenth century, when the first collections of oral traditions, texts and translations began to emerge, being linked“ to maritime expansion in Africa and Asia, the result of the contact, the result of the contact, the result of the contact, the result of the contact between the contact. Portuguese and different African and Asian languages ​​”.
Also according to the same article, "some of these Crioulos, namely in Asia, were extinguished, having only recorded from the transition from the nineteenth century to the twentieth century. With the exception of the Creole of Alta Guinea, the vitality of the living Portuguese Creole is generally decreasing."
In the case of Creoles of Portuguese origin in the southern Asia area, they emerged from the arrival of Vasco da Gama to Calecute, India, in 1498, especially from the phase in which the entire base of the Portuguese empire the East focuses on Goa. According to the same academic article, several Creole were developed, the so-called “Indo-Portuguese” in coastal areas of India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Burma. "Currently, its presence is much reduced: they survive those of IUD, Damão, Korlai, Cananor and Sri Lanka (Ceylon) - which, despite having, has once been used all over the island, is currently restricted to the cities of Batticaloa and Trinchomalee," is highlighted in the article. The author draws attention to the extinction in 2010 of the Vaipim Creole, in Cochim, due to the "death of what seems to have been the last fluent speaker in this region." There are then the Southeast Asia and East Asia Creole, which includes Macao. Patuá is currently “spoken with native fluency only by some people in Macau and the Macanese diaspora”, is mentioned.</description><pubDate>2025-05-07 01:19:43</pubDate></item><item><title>PME | Events promoted by Melco generated $ 1 million</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/06/pme-eventos-promovidos-pela-melco-geraram-1-milhao-de-dolares/</link><description>Melco Resorts claims to have generated about $ 1 million for small and medium -sized local businesses through events promoted last year. In the 2024 sustainability report, the game operator also highlights the results in terms of waste management and energy spending
 
The Melco Resorts &amp; Entertainment Sustainability Report has just been published last year, which highlights the gains obtained by small and medium -sized (SMEs) with the events promoted by the operator. With regard to the “community engagement and investment” part, it is read that “more than $ 1.02 million for local companies and [NGO] non-governmental organizations in Macao through 21 SME events, with 603 SME and NGO participants” were generated. In addition, in the volunteering area, Melco points out that "about 3,600 participants offered their time and effort in more than 359 volunteering initiatives," "more than $ 17.42 million that were donated to decent causes in our communities."
Quoted by the report, Lawrence Ho, Melco's president and executive director, says that "21 Heart of House initiatives and community events have generated more than $ 1 million for local companies in Macao, providing 603 SMEs and NGO opportunities to connect, expand and grow." According to the official, last year were "in -depth partnerships with PME and NGO".
Regarding the relationship with local SMEs, Melco also highlights the connection with the supply chain, because “86 percent of acquisitions arose from local companies in Macao”, and of this total, “59 percent were local SME acquisitions”. Similar scenario occurred in the other operators that Melco holds in Cyprus and Manila, with local acquisitions around 40 and 76 percent, respectively.
Regarding the company's training actions, Melco says it has invested on average "582 US dollars per full -time worker in learning and development activities, which is equivalent to an average of 38 hours of training." In this context, “100 percent of colleagues participated in training actions”, can be read. In addition, "over 758,000 participants have attended more than 1,400 courses offered by" Melco Learning Academy ", which is equivalent to over 870,000 hours of learning." Also noteworthy is that, in all Melco projects, "women represent 23 percent of the boards of business and 32 percent of the higher paintings."
The report also tells that “63 percent of positions at the vice-presidency level, or above this post, were filled from local communities, increasing to 70 percent in Macao”, can read.
All for the environment
Another of the areas highlighted in Melco's sustainability report concerns environmental policies. One of the areas that is “in progress” is the energy consumption, in order to obtain more reasonableness of consumption. "In 2024, despite an increase of 39 percent in terms of the number of visitors and the rise of 19 percent in the occupation rate of the hotel rooms, along with the addition of a property and a new resort integrated into our portfolio, the energy intensity increased by 10 percent from 2023, but was 19 percent lower than our year of reference 2019."
One of the “achieved” objectives is the energy efficiency measures, which “since 2018 has resulted in an annualized savings of more than 62.5 million kWh, an increase of 9 percent compared to 2023”. Another "achieved" goal concerns the installation of "over 25,000 photovoltaic panels on all properties in Macau, Manila and Cyprus, generating about 10,000 kWh annually." Thus, in the properties of Melco "the electricity consumption from renewable sources increased by 72 percent compared to 2023".
Regarding the group's means of transportation, “buses, electric and hybrid vehicles represent 55 percent of our combined fleet, with loading stations, an increase of 25 percent compared to 2023”.
In terms of materials and waste management, Melco says it has avoided plastic spending in the order of 13.2 million bottles, thanks to the installation of “the Nordaq water filtering system that serves almost every hotel rooms in Melco Integrated Resorts”.
In addition, the example of the City of Dreams venture in Manila is presented where “a circular economy system was established in which food waste is decomposed on site, and the excess donated to a local fifth to cultivate some of the vegetables served to guests”.
In terms of water consumption, the report indicates that “despite the increase in the number of visitors and the hotel occupancy rate”, “total water consumption and water intensity increased only 6 and 2 percent compared to 2023, respectively, and were 6 and 30 percent lower, respectively, to the 2019 reference year”. However, this is a goal that, according to the company, is still "in progress".
Another objective highlighted in the report was the “annual economy of over 510,820 cubic meters of water through water efficiency measures, an increase of 10 percent compared to 2023 ″.
"As we invest in people and communities, we continue to derive environmental efforts with the same determination. (…) The intensity of energy and water consumption, as well as greenhouse gas emissions, remained significantly below our 2019 base line, even adding a new property and an integrated resort," says Lawrence Ho.
The entrepreneur also referred to the increase "of the amount of valuable materials diverted through recycling and composting in global operations - 58 percent over last year." “In our restoration spaces we also fight food waste, with the 'clean dish challenge' to contribute to a 9 percent reduction in waste in the Macao and Manila restoration areas.”
“Mentality change”
For Lawrence Ho, greater sustainability in Melco requires "a change of mindset" verified in "small actions that, on scale, can have a significant impact."
Regarding the supply chain of the group's integrated hotels and resorts, good results are also highlighted. "Although the numbers do not always show exponential heels, our focus on responsible supply remains unshakable, 18 percent of all seafood bought by weight to be sustainable sources, and 100 percent of our points of sale of food and beverage in Macau and Manila to serve eggs of outdoor chickens," he reads.
There is thus "an effort that reflects a deeper ambition to incorporate sustainability into acquisitions," said Lawrence Ho, who added that "more than one service, hospitality has to do with the experience it creates, the people it supports and the impact it leaves."
“Every year, Melco challenges himself to go further, believing that luxury and responsibility are not opposite forces, but partners in progress, which is reflected in the way we defend strong governance, we manage our environmental impact, we support our people and communities and lead the responsible game. This commitment to progress shaped our approach in 2024, as a year of recalibration in which we continue to strengthen operations, operations, rekindle the impetus and ensure that our integrated resorts remain at the forefront of excellence, ”he concluded.</description><pubDate>2025-05-06 00:08:47</pubDate></item><item><title>Seismos | Macau will have a monitoring station in national partnership</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/02/sismos-macau-vai-ter-estacao-de-monitorizacao-em-parceria-nacional/</link><description>The Secretary for Transport and Public Works, Raymond Tam, presented on Wednesday the report of the 2025 government lines for his tutelage, and said to the deputies that a seismo monitoring station will be created in partnership with interior authorities from China will be created.
 
The Macao government announced on Wednesday the creation, together with the interior authorities of China, of a seismic monitoring station, as part of the authorities' plans to reinforce disaster prevention. “The meteorological and seismic monitoring network will be optimized, and is foreseen, in collaboration with the competent services of the interior of China, the construction of a seismic monitoring station,” said the secretary for public works and transport, by presenting, in the Legislative Assembly (AL), the lines of government action (LAG) for the guardianship, for 2025.

"Macao's earthly area is small and population density is very high, so it is difficult to find space for the creation of monitoring stations and now with the favorable policies with Guangdong province, we have been able to build a joint monitoring station in the cooperation zone [deepened between Guangdong and Macau]," SMG director Leong Weng Kun said. The official noted that the space should contribute to "increasing prevention capacity and public knowledge about weather information."
Agree
Macao and Zhuhai signed the “comprehensive and deepened cooperation project in the context of meteorology” to reinforce the cooperation and sharing of meteorological detection equipment, computer programs and data sharing, according to a statement released by SMG at that time.
Cooperation is also expected to reinforce the “joint prevention of weather catastrophs alert systems, promote scientific and technological research and the development of artificial intelligence applied to weather activity”.
Macao is often affected between May and November by the passage of Tuffons, being July to September the period in which the highest incidence of tropical storms is recorded. This year, the territory is expected to be affected by between five to eight tropical storms, SMG announced in March.
Light Metro | Secretary admits operating gaps
The Secretary for Transport and Public Works Raymond Tam said on Wednesday that the light meter is still short of the expectations of the population. "I have to confess that the services of the Light Metro, namely the electronic payment services, are still short of the expectations of the population of Macao," he said, promising measures for the means of transport to improve "gradually".
Environment | Policies planning will be studied this year
The Secretary for Transport and Public Works Raymond Tam announced on Wednesday that this year will be "Study for the Next Planning of Environmental Protection", to support new "environmental policies based on a scientific and prospective view." Still in the area of ​​the environment, the ruler promised measures to achieve the national objective of the “double carbon goal”. As such, concrete emission reduction shares will be driven, including legislative elaboration for the control of emissions from non -road mobile sources, the slaughter of highly polluting vehicles, the improvement of the electric vehicle charging network, the exploitation of the potential application of photovoltaic energy in public spaces and the optimization of the energy structure ”, concluded the report.

"We hope that Digital Pataca can be used as one of the digitized transaction instruments for Portuguese-speaking countries, commercial transactions, and sino-Portuguese transactions," said Anton Tai Kin IP.
In response to deputies' questions during the Legislative Assembly session, the secretary confirmed that the central digital currency system should be finalized by the end of 2025, following a series of technical tests. "The first phase of implementation will focus on retail transactions before expanding to gross applications," said Tai. "We then intend to leave Macau to connect with the Portuguese Language platform," he added.
It is recalled that a delegation led by Tai Kin IP was in Lisbon in early March, having met with leaders of Banco de Portugal, including administrator Luís Morais Sarmento.
At the end of March, the secretary's office announced in a statement that the various meetings served to “negotiate the consolidation and deepening of cooperation between Macao and Portugal in the areas of science, technology, economy and commerce”.
Tai Kin IP told deputies on Tuesday that he would continue to visit more Portuguese-speaking countries in the future to seek support for the use of Digital Pataca.
The secretary promised to take advantage of Digital Pataca as a currency whose circulation will be free through the borders of Macao, an economy open to the flow of capital. On the contrary, the Chinese currency, Renmimbi, is not entirely convertable in other currencies, and Beijing authorities impose a strict control on the flow of capital, especially out of the country.
Digital seeds
Trading between Portuguese -speaking countries and China reached $ 225.2 billion last year, 2 percent more than in 2023, according to data from China customs services.
The prototype of the Macao Digital Pataca System (e-Mop) was launched on December 12, eight days before the end of the term of the previous government leader, Ho Iat Seng.
In September, the then financial regulator of the region said that Pataca Digital could “serve as an example for Portuguese -speaking countries”. Macao Monetary Authority (AMCM) President Benjamin Chan Sa San spoke during the second conference of the central banks and financial banks governors between China and the Portuguese -speaking countries, which took place in Macao.
At the opening of the event, Ho Iat Seng said E-Mop's development was supported by the Government and Central Bank of China, which was the first major economy in the world to launch a digital currency, the Digital Renmimbi or E-CNY in August 2020.
In September, AMCM explained that, before the official launch of Pataca Digital, it would take tests to identify risks and “establish laws and regulations”.

The slight meter should be the main means of public transport in Macao, while buses move to a secondary and complementary role. The position was taken by Tong Ho Laam, vowel of the executive board of the Povo's covenant of Macao, the official name, in statements to the newspaper or Mun.
Given the expected increase in demand and pressure on the public transport network and traffic in the city, the official indicated that the government should actively promote the strategy of making the meter light the main means of transportation in the city to relieve road pressure. Tong Ho Laam understands that when the lightweight metro stations network is extended, it will increase the overall effectiveness of public transport and ensure better experiences to residents and tourists. One of the improvements that can be implemented in the short-term is the ability to use electronic payments and harmonize the connection with buses.
In addition, the People's Covenant leader argues that the planning of Light Metro stations should be done in articulation with the Regional Industrial Development Strategy. An essential point is to ensure the connection with the national rail network through Zhuhai, a work that should be accelerated to reinforce Macao's position in the Great Bay.
The vowel believes that the connection to China, namely Hengqin, can bring a new impetus to the local industrial sector to pursue emerging areas at the Traditional Chinese Technological Innovation and Mountain Medicine poles.
Cure for all ills
Given the energy challenges resulting from the fight against climate change, the associative leader argues that the development of the light meter should be thought of from a long-term perspective, taking into account environmental protection. To this end, the MSar should reserve land for green energy production facilities to feed the slight meter. Tong Ho Laam pointed out this objective as a way for the Mand to stand out in environmental terms in the Great Bay area, adopting leadership in the goal of carbonic neutrality, while promoting economic diversification.</description><pubDate>2025-05-15 00:39:39</pubDate></item><item><title>Teaching | IA contents transmitted to local students</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/15/ensino-conteudos-sobre-ia-transmitidos-a-alunos-locais/</link><description>The Macao government says it is preparing students, teaching system and teachers for artificial intelligence, providing didactic materials in schools, classes and organizing training actions. Deputies also want initiatives on artificial intelligence outside schools
 
Schools and teachers are preparing for the reality of Artificial Intelligence (IA). According to the secretary's explanations for Social Affairs and Culture, LAM, the Directorate of Services for Youth Education and Development (DSEDJ) “intends to provide AI content or related to science and technology, with an average duration of 10 hours per year, computer teachers and 6 hours to teachers of other subjects”, was referred to yesterday in response to an oral interpellation of Deputy Lam Lon Wai. The first actions already took place in the current school year.
In addition, the secretary confirmed that schools can adhere to manuals that include AI teachings. "Several reference materials on the interior of China were introduced for adoption in schools," said Lam.
Last year, DSEDJ joined South China Normal University to "establish a new basis for learning and exchange focusing on AI teaching." In this context, “didactic materials of this institution on the AI” are made available, and invitations are foreseen to “interior experts and academics to provide training and support for teaching staff in the development of AI teaching activities”.
At the legislative level, the executive says he made the necessary changes to “the program and teaching of AI become part of the curricula of primary and secondary schools”, and it is intended that “AI contents can be integrated into the curriculum guidelines of information technology classes”. The government intends to make the “interleavement evaluation of the planning of non-higher education in Macao, to build an innovative technological support system”, taking into account the “general lines of planning for the construction of a large educational power (2024-2035)”.
LAM indicated that, through the financing of the Educational Fund, it is intended to “optimize facilities and school equipment” to improve science teaching and create the “AI” classrooms project.
In this context, DSEDJ launched this year the pilot project of “Intelligent Teaching” to which 25 schools joined. "The established goal is to make the platform available to all secondary schools in Macao in the school year 2026/2027," the secretary said yesterday.
I was going to everyone
One of the interveners in yesterday's debate was Deputy Zheng Anting, who defended the partnership with playing operators for the creation of “AI classes” in hotels, in conjunction with tourists who pass through these spaces or even in community neighborhoods, “so that populations have greater contact with AI”. "We can develop actions in partnership with the six dealers, because they already have visitors," he added.
Regarding the AI ​​relationship with the population and the promotion of literacy in this area for adults, a representative of the Macau Science Center said this space can be “an open classroom so that, outside schools, new knowledge and learning scenarios of AI can be provided”.
"We will collaborate with more technology companies, because we want to have more technological resources to support this scientific background. The Science Center will create different measures to improve the digital literacy of the population by introducing AI, and so we can generalize education for AI for the whole society. The evolution of AI has been fast and we will invite experts to share the most advanced techniques and employment trends in this area, in order to create an AI training platform.
The official said that "shift workers could access this type of resources." LAM has ensured that the future goes through the "generalization of AI education for residents" and, for this, the government will "dialogue with associations so that these measures have a greater effect."</description><pubDate>2025-05-15 00:36:13</pubDate></item><item><title>Inclusive Education | Government says there are enough resources</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/15/ensino-inclusivo-governo-diz-que-existem-recursos-suficientes/</link><description>The Secretary for Social Affairs and Culture said that the education system has sufficient resources in the area of ​​inclusive education, there is currently 170 teachers with specific training. “We have enough resources to support students of inclusive education.
In the academic year of 2023-2024, there were 94 students, and 79 were able to have access to higher education at a rate of 84 percent. We want to improve these works and also at the level of teacher education, ”said Lam.
In this respect, between the 2019-2020 and 2023-2024 school years, 2,545 teachers were formed. "I think training actions can be reinforced according to the need," said the secretary.
The subject of inclusive education was raised by Deputy Ho Ion Sang, who in an oral interpellation wanted to know the most advances in this area. In response, the secretary said that there are 51 schools in Macao to provide inclusive education, 21 of which “teach inclusive education in the one Through Train format in child, primary and secondary teachings”, that is, in integrating students with special educational needs in “normal” classes.
In addition, “with a view to responding to the search for vacancies in the field of inclusive education and special education in small classes, eight schools, under construction in the ETS-2 zone, will provide inclusive education, of which one will provide small classes of special education”.
The secretary assured that the Directorate of Youth Education and Development Services (DSEDJ) “continuously visits schools to publicize this type of education and increase the number of school vacancies”.</description><pubDate>2025-05-15 00:34:25</pubDate></item><item><title>Government conducts a new inquiry to evaluate young unemployment</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/15/governo-realiza-novo-inquerito-para-avaliar-desemprego-jovem/</link><description>The lack of professional opportunities for young licensed was one of the topics most discussed at yesterday's session at the Legislative Assembly (AL) intended for government responses to oral deputies.
The Secretary for Social Affairs and Culture, LAM, said that “an inquiry into the continuation of studies [by young people] will be done to learn about the situation of the employment of young people”. "In addition, we will evaluate demand in several areas," added the ruler.
LAM stated that the executive can “offer specific support for young people”, following the position demonstrated by Deputy Lo Choi In, which suggested the creation of a subsidy for companies to hire young people with college.
"There are subsidies for young people to have employment in the Great Bay. Because it is not considered the implementation of a similar measure for Macao, so that more resources can be provided in order for companies to provide internships so that our young people can work? Companies have rent costs, for example," he defended.
Lo Choi in recalled that “the continuation rate of Macao Youth Studies is 95 percent”, but that the unemployment rate of 2.5 percent stands out the young people with ages between 25 and 34 years old. "People with higher levels of education are unemployed. Where does the problem reside? It has to do with the teaching system, which is out of date, or the job market? A new university city will be created to create more qualified paintings and jobs, and we have to give importance to the formation of paintings," he said.
It's not easy
The idea of ​​repeating the inquiry, previously performed by the authorities, was highlighted by Deputy Ngan Iek Hang. "It has been said that the qualified framework commission will conduct a study of the demand for qualified paintings, and an inquiry into the use of finalists have already been done, so what is the point of situation. It is important to follow whether the finalists get a stable job," he said.
Deputy Leong Sun Iok mentioned that "society has paid close attention to the employment of young people, who face many difficulties and cannot find a job."</description><pubDate>2025-05-15 00:33:25</pubDate></item><item><title>Trade War | Protected US operators</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/13/guerra-comercial-operadoras-norte-americanas-protegidas/</link><description>Macao government leader Sam Hou Fai assured yesterday that he will protect US casinos operators in the region in case of worsening the trade war between Beijing and Washington.
"The six gaming operators have followed the Macao law. Since, following the law, these operators develop their businesses, healthily, they are certainly protected and supported by the government," said the chief executive.
"We always welcome a good liking foreign investment," including "US capital investments, they are all welcome," said Sam. The government leader was speaking at a Six -Day Balance Sheet Conference to Macao from the Chinese Communist Party's leading manager for the affairs of the two semi -autonomous regions, Xia Baolong.
On Monday, the Director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, under the protection of the State Council, the Chinese executive, asked 20 local entrepreneurs to "work together to promote national prosperity."
After this meeting, the secretary for Macau's economy and finance told reporters that Xia Baolong also appealed to the unit against "the increase in unilateralism and commercial protectionism in the United States." “Hong Kong and Macao entrepreneurs have to be united and put themselves on the same side of the state. In this situation, there is no way out if we make commitments and concessions,” said Anton Tai Kin IP.
The leader spoke shortly before China and the United States announced an agreement on Monday, with effect from today, under which they will reduce mutual customs rights by 115 percentage points for 90 days. That is, United States Customs Rights on Chinese imports will be 30 percent during this period compared to 10 percent from China for US imports.</description><pubDate>2025-05-13 23:01:15</pubDate></item><item><title>The Great America (III)</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/15/a-grande-america-iii/</link><description>“We Are Going Through a Bad Stage in the Cold War-All Wars have ther Bad Stages.

Pietro Quaroni
In recent years, we have been watching an unprecedented interest from Americans in Europe. Initially it was "what do you want from us?" A mixture of condescension and sympathetic contempt, which raises embarrassing answers or simply silence, since we are not used to establishing what we can want. Then the sudden turn to "what would they do in our place?" Until Trump's counterattack. With it there are no questions, only pre-placed or improvised agreements. All extremely informal on the basis that "we want this, they can help us like this, in return they receive that other. Good luck." Of course, firepower is totally disproportionate. Deadly is retaliation in case of insubordination. The example may be that if we make state -of -the -art trade with Chinese technologies, we must at least expect reprisals on customs rights and visa regime over the table, with steps accompanied underneath.
Which forces us to know beforehand what we can want from the leader and at what price. Nothing extraordinary. Tactical variants of a strategy. This should be based on our geostrategic income, which we not only neglect but even undermine. The southern continent is Mediterranean first, European in second. But this privilege is lived as a shame. They did not take advantage of the advantage of the mid-oceanic turning point they enjoyed since the opening of Suez, which today risks closing disastrously due to the Red Sea crisis. His sea gaze sees his inner waters as a limit and not as a source that pushes them to the world and the world to them.
Among the harmful inheritances of their Europeanism and the inferiority complex associated with continental nations, hydrophobia is the most harmful. The secret figure of their strategy escapes them because they are Western because they are medium-oceanic, not because they are European. Its continental neighbors, starting with the Germans, are by anti-medium-ocean vocation. Since time immemorial. As the “School of Annales” states, the concept of Europe was born against Rome, when the Islamic tide broke the Mare Nostrum in two, between the 18th and eighth centuries. A fracture that continues to resolve and to get worse. The Italians remain the passive center, at best reactive hypotheses of the middle ocean, after their decisive pivot.
Ridiculous disguise themselves with pivots. It is urgent to make sense of its western advanced geography in the middle of the ocean. And that this counts more on Germany and France, which are directly facing the world ocean, while they have to defend with nails and teeth the exit through Suez and Bab-El-Mandeb (the Bab-El-Mandeb Strait in Arabic, “gateway” is the epicenter of the vast maritime region that extends from the Red Sea to the Indian Ocean Officer, Also encompassing the Gulf of Aden and part of the Arabic Sea. This strangulation, which is only twenty-seven kilometers wide at its narrower point, near the island of Perim, separates the horn from Africa from the Middle East and serves as an antechamber to the Suez Canal, the artificial passage that, since the second half of the nineteenth century, connects the Indo-Pacific Limits to the Atlantic system through the Mediterranean).
Together with those who will be willing to treat them as partners in the middle of the ocean. First, and certainly not only, the United States. They feel here in debt to the great Italian diplomat Pietro Quaroni (their thoughts and actions are described in “Pietro Quaroni, Italian Diplomacy and the Libyan Issue (1945-1949)” by Luciano Monzali) who belonged to this race of state servants who understood this privilege as a contribution to foreign policy. Even contrary to intellectual fashion, resisting the temptation of bureaucracy and politicking. Its golden pamphlet on the “Atlantic Pact and Freedom Security”, published sixty years ago, is of a fulminating current. Pietro Quaroni suggested that they "fit into an peripheral American policy" within NATO, evolving from a "sea power" into a "maritime power." The Thalassocratic Theater distinguishes them from their continental partners and gives them greater freedom of movement than France and Germany.
Expressed in the “peripheral defense based on the outer waist of Europe, England, Iberian Peninsula, Italy and Greece”. Not being a naval power, it is capital to revive them bilateral understanding with America as the first Mediterranean power, as happened with England while still dominating the waves. While their foreign policy remained firm in the beginning that they could take all freedoms except to turn against England, any foolishness they had done had serious consequences; The day they forgot this principle, the consequences would be such that they would still remember them. Today, instead of England, are the United States, and it is the first need for Italian politics to understand with the United States as Giorgia Meloni intends. They should not be dragged on behalf of a alleged Europe for a European policy that is in fact-the-American.

We all remember the radius that fell into the Vatican to when the abdication of Benedict XVI and the strange impression caused, a man who came from the end of the world after the succeeding one would sit in Peter's chair like a seagull, all in white, hovering papal purple with a little spending Argentine shoes remembering the fisherman's sandals.
The signs walk everywhere, sometimes emphatic and rude as it was the case with the image of Trump as Pope, this funestal desecration that can be subliminal and nauseating effect as measure for all things, calling, perhaps, attention to subjects concretely manufactured for a final resolution: but if we compare it to this one, we will know the differences, to look at the speech, to look at the speech, to look at the speech, to look at the speech, to look at essential. Superb-laden vestments have never dressed into anyone and still left their dresses, but a chance can put ourselves forever with something we did not know, that in this very short space of time we loose “robes” essences with wings in the promontory of temporal inheritance.
Yeats tell us about white birds believing that all poets love birds, speak to them and interpret them (each certainly in their own way) that always this ethereal nature is their pleasing being part of a wonderful conscience that insists on not lowering for bars, and that's what was there, that lonely seagull coming from the most beautiful soul corner: deleted, and did not disappear; And the light of the blue star, suspended in the twilight by the sake of the sky/… «in-white birds»
There are unexpected things, and this is good- sudden events- that life will not be this true big dazzle where all things communicate differently being those that maintain their essence the most contemplated? Continuity is a wing, a straight to eternity, a rhythm, a cross, or a work, and whatever we look at will be through the eyes of this soul that formed us on the way, but the vision of things is now insinuated in a very blind world that does not have the gift of true invisuals.
No one is irreplaceable and we all have faults, but there are the seagulls, the chimneys, the rays, the stone and the creative wedding that in this May live. Times are harsh but we still do not feel what may mean such an expression, that feeling is not probative of anything until some other than rescues and transcends it. Francisco left his white mobile pope for Palestine to make him an emergency room, and this is seagull.</description><pubDate>2025-05-13 22:59:51</pubDate></item><item><title>Hong Kong Queen's College's cadabulas</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/13/os-cabulas-do-hong-kong-queens-college/</link><description>Last April, during the Unified History Test of China at the Hong Kong Queen's College, several students from one of the classes copied. They shouted the answers to each other, consulted the books and the iPads. The vigilante tried several times to stop them, but failed. The board of the college said that it will only punish prevariculars students according to internal rules.
The college also notified parents about this incident, saying that as only a month left for final exams and, to avoid unnecessary pressures about the students, the test will not be repeated. The results of the China Unified History Test of this class will be canceled and the classification to this discipline will depend on the final exam. For the other classes, the classification of China's History discipline will take into account the results of the unified test and the final exam.
Students often happen to copy the tests. With new technologies, the tools that allow them to “make cheats” change every day. From traditional paper rackets to intelligent devices, the evolution of these tools reflects the erosion of academic integrity through the abuse of technology. In the past, the students wrote the answers to pieces of paper, commonly known to rabids, and took them to the exam room; Or asked to go to the bathroom and so they consulted the materials. With the popularization of intelligent clocks, real -time concerted communication functions allow remotely online cabular. If the vigilante is not aware, students can use smart watches for this purpose while sitting in their places. Real -time -time translation functions have recently appeared that can directly convert English to Chinese texts. The constant evolution of these tools makes the work of vigilantes increasingly difficult.
To get a thief, we need evidence. To get a gussy student, you also have to have tests. However, for vigilantes, it is always very difficult to obtain these evidence; If they can't prove that the student copied, it is complicated to accuse him. In the case of the "Cada on paper", the student can swallow or hide it as they are being exposed, or argue with the vigilante and refuse to deliver the rabula. Teachers are not police officers and are not entitled to review students, so several "jams" escape unpunished for lack of tests and naturally cannot be accused. These cases, to some extent, lead other students to risk.
There is certainly no lack of diligent students, scholars and workers in an exam room. When these students discover the colleagues' strokes, they can choose to report them, but if they do the most likely it is to be ostracized and subject to intimidation. In addition, the highly stressful exam environment makes most students focus on their own answers, and have no time or energy to observe others. Therefore, the reports of colleagues represent a small percentage and the exposure of these cases depends on the vigilantes to be committed and want to discover the offenders.
Copy, use fake certificates and plagiarize are all academic violations of the same nature - dishonesty and bad practices. In recent years, it is not difficult to find these cases in the news. Having this incident in one of Hong Kong's oldest elite colleges, reflects not only the moral deviation of the students, but also the distortion of learning values. The more students make glow, the greater the change of values ​​and the less they will study hard.
The “elite” group created by false achievements may seem knowledgeable, but in fact is devoid of value and will eventually expose their lack of knowledge in their areas in the future. Just think: Can a doctor without skills treat a patient? Can a lawyer defend the client without knowing the law? This hidden danger is like a clock pump. Its destructive power continues to manifest in the next decade or even later, and finally the whole society will pay its price. We have to stop this problem.
Schools have to take proper measures, prescribe the right medicine, improve situations that give it azo and cultivate the correct values ​​in students. Containing the jar requires multi-dimensional efforts.
Firstly, students who copy should be severely punished and this behavior cannot be tolerated. Schools must have rules for dealing with unusual behaviors. For example, if at least two vigilantes see a student swallowing papers, it should be disqualified from the exam. After the punishment must be re -educated. Schools must have subjects that deal with academic integrity and compulsory courses that shape the values ​​of learning.
It is necessary to make students understand that a grade of 60 is not shameful, but it is vital that they realize that a false 100 has to be punished. Since this pedagogical idea becomes consensual, society will no longer judge heroes by their grades, students will be able to maintain their moral values ​​and the entrepreneurial spirit of “knowing shame and then learning to be brave” will reappear. Only after stressing the importance of identifying the “real value” of students can education return to its original purpose of “teaching and sharing knowledge”, the reasons that lead to glow can decrease and the promotion of talented people will no longer be a game that compares large and small number.

It is perfectly seen that certain politicians have no level to govern and to present to the Portuguese alternatives that provoke them a better life. And there are other politicians who did not expect or were prepared for elections. An election campaign where it is immediately detected that people are not sensitized and are largely disillusioned with their promises never fulfilled.
The people do not want to know if Luís Montenegro have a family business and draw money from potential customers with state calls. The people do not want to know if Pedro Nuno Santos bought a lot in Alentejo or a Maserati.
The people want something concrete. You want your life to improve, not to go to the supermarket and always see the prices to increase; that when filling the deposit of your car finds that the same fuel in Spain is much cheaper; He wants to know when more electric centers are built around Greater Lisbon, so that a national blackout does not harm an entire country and a capital full of thousands of tourists, some sleeping on the floor of the airport -in this regard that the blackout was a shame regarding the dependence of Spain and the fiasco of wind and the endless stations -the people want to see their salaries at the level of Europe and that their salaries and their salaries The 200, 300 and 400 euros pensions end; wants their children and grandchildren to emigrate because there is no accessible housing for young people; Want to see several public homes, at a price accessible to poor elderly, with quality in well-being and good service; wants corruption to abandon state departments, namely in the municipalities where an investor of a charm hotel is waiting for two years for the opening license just because it was refused to deliver a particular peculius to the edil; The people want to stop seeing the vacant lots to serve as a large deal of certain presidents of parish councils; The people want them to end the emergency urgencies and that future mothers do not have to have their children inside an ambulance because the incompetence of a health minister continues not to solve anything about the closure of obstetrics; The people only want politicians to compete that the country are ruled, they are governor to more than four million citizens living in poverty level.
Pre and the election campaign itself has been a disappointment. The television debates had a very low hearing rate. Leader politicians of parties with parliamentary seat have shown a nullity of alternative proposals for a 20 or 30 -year -old future. Malously moderate television debates, where the channel employee intended to be the vedeta and could only interrupt who was there to discuss. The very debate between Montenegro and Nuno Santos was uninteresting, although Montenegro, surprisingly, appeared tense and nervous, and therefore lost the debate.
The election campaign is on the streets of the country and you, dear readers, do not believe: the multitude baths are over. People do not mobilize by loudspeakers who scream to the four winds that is the best for prime minister. The parties pay for “volunteers” that go after the party leaders with flags and shouting alive to the party concerned. No one cares for the passage of a party caravan and, this, is serious. It is a sign that democracy has not fulfilled its role. In such a way, the neo-fascist André Ventura, who even said that he would be a prime minister, had behind him in a certain fifty people, stopped, spoke to journalists in a critical tone against AD and PS, and there went to his “Trumpinha” life……
Then, in this election campaign we have something laughable but shameful. These are the polls. We are already used to never getting it right and being performed with maneuvering normality. This time, shame does not exist. We reached the point of a television station presenting a sort of probing daily, always giving a substantial advantage to AD, when it should be noted that that "information" only aims to maneuver potential voters to vote for AD.
There are polls for various tastes, but an intercampus poll, which presented the Socialist Party ahead, was not released on any television channel, which are in the hands of Cristiano Ronaldo and other millionaires like him. The polls, which maneuver the opinion of the potential voter are the reflection of the type of policy that is today practiced in an election campaign. "A" insults "B". "B" insults "a". "A" insults "C". "C" insults "a". "D" insults "C". "C" insults "d". Do you want you to draw a drawing? I do: Montenegro insults Nuno Santos. Nuno Santos insults Montenegro. Montenegro insults Ventura. Sumura insults Montenegro. Mortagua insults Ventura and Ventura responds in the same way.
And this is political, is it an alternative to have a better country? Don't even think. Portugal is living the worst moment of seriousness and political ethics of its 51 years of democratic regime. It's pity. And no medicine is guessed for the patient.</description><pubDate>2025-05-12 04:21:54</pubDate></item><item><title>FRC welcomes debate today with Sandro Mendonça</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/15/frc-acolhe-hoje-debate-com-sandro-mendonca/</link><description>Today, from 6.30 pm, the “Roda de Ideias - Creative Environments” session at the Rui Cunha Foundation (FRC), which is attended by Sandro Mendonça, Associate Professor of Economics at ISCTE - University Institute of Lisbon and Professor at the City of Macau. The session, more specifically, addresses the theme “Steering the Evolving Sandbox Economy 'from the Greater Bay to the Portuguese-Speaking Geographies”, focusing on the economies of the great bay in connection with Portuguese-speaking countries.
Thus, it is intended to “explore the concept of experimental innovation zones, the so-called 'sand boxes', such as children's recreational spaces, which allow future advances through the creation of controlled and secure test areas to test, replicate, evaluate, adopt, implement and launch new products, devices, technologies or systems, within a conditioned and provisional structure”.
With these “experimental” environmental processes associated with the economy, effective means of evaluating the development of innovative ideas and projects without ruptures in the normal functioning of business or institutional structures ”. "Greater freedom within these parallel systems [sand boxes] with more dynamic and flexible regulation can be promoted."
Sandro Mendonça focuses on concrete in the Greater Bay region, as it covers “a set of cities that form a techno-institutional innovation center, even Portuguese-speaking countries that begin to use these experimental models, namely in the sectors of telecommunications and energy”.
Long career
This is the third time Sandro Mendonça has a session at the FRC. The first was in 2023, with the lecture “The Change in Communications: from 5G to AI through digital platforms”, and then starred in 2024, the “The Future of Bigtech” session, where he described the balance of forces among the world giants, which include American companies Apple, Amazon, Google (Alphabet), and Microsoft, and Microsoft, and Microsoft, and Microsoft, and Microsoft, and Microsoft Chinese Alibaba and Tencent.
Sandro Mendonça is a full professor in Portugal, Italy and Macau, and also taught in Doctoral Programs in Chengdu (UESTC) and Guangzhou (SMU), China. Its main focus is on innovation and sectoral dynamics.
He received several recognitions in his career, including the German Marshall Fund member of the United States (GMF) and a young European leader from Friends of Europe Foundation. In 2024, he coordinated the report “The Futures of Big Tech in Europe” for the European Commission and was on the list of the world's leading scientists at Stanford University.

In the case of the "Opticks" series, "the red, blue and green tones, presenting small colored particles under the lens, show the multifaceted nature of light through the prism." The organizers of the exhibition intend to "awaken the collective memories that are dormant in the images, related to the old, ephemeral and eternity."

Authorities add that this year there were no deaths resulting from Covid-19
 
While in the neighboring regions of Macao, COVID-19 infection cases continue to increase, here infection rates have been gradually descended since half of March, health services indicated in a statement released on Tuesday night.
Authorities add that although the Mand has surpassed the most critical point of covid-19 infections, coronavirus remains active in the territory. As such, they appeal to the care and adoption of preventive attitudes, especially between risk groups, such as elderly, chronic diseases and people with weakened immune system, namely taking complete vaccination against the JN.1 variant.
Regarding the evolution of infection rates in Macao and neighboring regions, the entity led by Alvis Lo explains that Macau entered the infectious peak before the surrounding areas.
According to laboratory monitoring data, the positivity rate of the new coronaviruses detected in patients with flu symptoms in Macau began to increase in late February this year, reaching the peak in mid -March. In March 16 and 22, the authorities record a positivity rate of 44.3 percent, which was decreasing from there.
In the last three weeks, the positivity rate has come down to 12 percent, rose to 17 percent and then went back to 11 percent, "which indicates a slight recovery," the health services concluded.
Walk there
With regard to collective infections that result in flu symptoms, between the beginning of the year and this week 111 cases were recorded, of which 26 were from COVID-19, detected mainly in elderly homes. In these cases, the authorities ensure that they have adequate medical services to the elderly homes, prescribing antiviral medications.
Throughout this year, so far, Macao has not registered any critical or fatal case caused by Covid-19 infection, is indicated. The prevalent coronavirus variant in Macao is currently the XDV variant related to DN.1, which is basically the same that circulates in the surrounding areas. The latest data do not show that XDV causes more serious illnesses than JN.1, XBB and its descendant strains.
As such, health services ensure that the JN.1 variant vaccine remains effective in reducing “risk of infection and developing serious diseases caused by the currently prevalent variant.</description><pubDate>2025-05-15 01:03:13</pubDate></item><item><title>Housing | Incomes increase 0.4% in the first quarter</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/15/habitacao-rendas-aumentam-04-no-primeiro-trimestre/</link><description>In the first three months of the year, housing incomes registered an increase of 0.4 percent, compared to the period between October and December, according to “lace statistics for the first quarter of 2025”, released yesterday by the Directorate of Statistics and Census Services (DSEC).

The reduction of the financial net margin was the main factor to contribute to the reduction of gains
 
In the first three months of the year, the Nacional Overseas Bank presented a non -audited profit of 133.2 million patacas, according to a statement issued yesterday. The value represents a reduction of 30 million patacas, or 18.4 percent, compared to the first quarter of 2024, when the profit had reached 163.2 million patacas.
Despite the reduction of profits, the amount is still above 2023 levels, when the institution declared a profit to the first quarter of 122.4 million patacas. The amounts presented yesterday are also close to what was happening in 2019, the last year before the pandemic, when profits in the first in the first quarter reached 138 million Patacas.
The most recent results were explained with a decrease in the net financial margin, which presented a reduction of 31.2 million patacas, or 11.8 percent, compared to the same period. Among the facts that contributed to this amendment, the institution pointed out the “changes in the composition of deposits and the evolution of reference interest rates”.
However, there were areas where the bank was able to get better results, as happened with liquid commissions, an area where an increase in gains of 3.8 million patacas was generated, equivalent to 18.1 percent. The increase was explained with "greater economic activity and greater customer involvement."
Squeezed
In the first quarter of this year, impairment losses related to credit exhibitions, mischievous credit, and financial investments increased to 5.4 million patacas, compared to the value of 1.3 million patacas in the first quarter of 2024. According to BNU, this increase took into account the “prudent provisioning practices”. "Despite this increase, the quality of BNU assets remains solid, supported by conservative credit practices and a robust level of provisions to respond to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties," he was guaranteed.
At the same time, operating expenses increased by 1.1 percent in homologous terms, which according to the institution showed “the effectiveness of bank cost optimization initiatives”. “Efficiency gains resulting from process simplification and strategic review of service supply helped compensate added investments in digital transformation, talent development and brand reinforcement,” was considered.
Last year, the institution led by Carlos Cid Álvares ended the year with a profit of 585.1 million patacas.</description><pubDate>2025-05-15 00:48:49</pubDate></item><item><title>IAS | Number of families supported up to the highest value since 2020</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/15/ias-numero-de-familias-apoiadas-sobe-para-valor-mais-alto-desde-2020/</link><description>Although the value of the threshold of poverty in Macau was not up to date for almost five years, the number of families supported by the Inclusion and Harmony Program in the community again exceeded the 5,500 barrier. May registration represented an annual growth of almost 13 percent
 
The number of monoparental families, with people with disabilities, or with chronic patients who will receive the May Special Grant from the Inclusion and Harmony Program in the community has risen to 5,540. With a growth of 12.9 percent compared to the same period last year, this is the highest value, at least since 2020, according to the Institute of Social Action (IAS). This program is intended to “alleviate life pressure” of single-padded families, people with disabilities or chronic patients considered “vulnerable”.
Last year, the number of approved families to receive May support to face poverty had been 4,905, a reduction in the face of 2023, when the number of aided families had been 4,049. Since 2021 that the number of families gathering conditions to access this support has not exceeded 5,000, which totaled 5,043. However, the highest value of the recent years was recorded by 2020 during the pandemic when a total of 5,503 families were supported.
The community inclusion and harmony program foresees the distribution of two supports, one in May and one in October, which are accessed through applications approved by IAS. It should be noted that the data presented only consider only the distribution of support in May of previous years.
Natural Trends
Among the 5,540 subsidized families is a total of 1,300 household aggregates who also receive the allowance for people in economic lack.
These families are the poorest in the territory, whose monthly income is below what is considered the threshold of the social risk of poverty. This level represents yields of 4,350 patacas per month, in the case of a single individual, rises to 7,990 patacas per month in households with two people, 11,020 patacas, in families with three people, 13,390 patacas with four people, 15,120 patacas when the aggregate consists of five people, progressively rising up to 20,270 patacas for eight or more members. These numbers have not undergone any change since 2019, in the first month of the Ho IAT SENG term, so they do not take into account the inflation of later years, which makes these amounts of purchasing power less than December 2019.
Regarding families with income below the social risk of poverty, the number of supports has been falling every year since 2020. In this year, there were 1,618 aggregates to receive the May subsidy of the community inclusion and harmony program, which was reduced to 1,576 in 2021, then to 1,486 by 2022, 1,385, at 2023, 1,308, until 1,300 families this year.
Less is no longer
The increase in the number of supported families is explained by the growth of households with monthly income above the social risk of poverty, but lower than the maximum limits for these supports. For aggregates with more than one person, the maximum limit of monthly income to access this support is 7,830 patacas, rises to 13,983 patacas per month in the aggregates with two people, 18,737 patacas in families with three members, 22,094 patacas in four members, 24,192 patacas in families with five members. The value rises progressively until it reaches the limit of 29,392 patacas per month, when families have eight or more members.
In 2020, the number of families under these conditions was 3,885, but fell to 3,467 in 2021 and to 3,125 in 2022, the lowest value since 2020. However, since this year the number of families in this income interval increased to 4,240. This is an increase of 335 families compared to the first year of the pandemic.
Supports of 22.55 million
The community inclusion and harmony program foresees the distribution of a total of 22.55 million patacas in May this year, the highest value since 2020, when 23.67 million patacas were distributed.
The program foresees the distribution of supports ranging from 2,650 patacas to household aggregates with a single person, and 10,100 patacas, when the aggregate consists of eight or more members, so an increase in the number of supported families does not necessarily reflect an increase in total distributed supports.
This support is distributed intended for single people with children in kindergarten, primary school, secondary or higher education; as well as households with members with chronic diseases or disabilities that are not admitted to public homes or subsidized by the government or in medical establishments dependent on health services.</description><pubDate>2025-05-15 00:46:50</pubDate></item><item><title>Joey Lao calls for more action in the development of hengqin</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/13/joey-lao-pede-mais-accao-no-desenvolvimento-de-hengqin/</link><description>The time for compliance and passive and merely observant attitude has come to an end. This is how the President of the Macao Economic Association, Joey Lao, sees the way for the Executive of the Masters Finds Hengqin and the deepened cooperation zone.
The former deputy and economist argues that the Macao government has to surpass the "observer" attitude towards hengqin issues and actively participate in national governance, treating the development of the deepened cooperation zone as if they were building their own home.
The idea of ​​an opinion article signed by the former deputy and published yesterday in the newspaper or Mun, following the inspection visit to Macao from the Director of the Cabinet for Hong Kong and Macau affairs to the Council of State, Xia Baolong, which ended yesterday.
During the passage through Macao, the Communist Party representative of China stressed that the Government of the MSAR should face the development of Hengqin as its subject, as a priority of local politics.
Joey Lao pointed out that Macau has to break systematic barriers, promote complementary advantages and seek integration with Mountain Island to create a new space that boosts Macao's strong development.
The former deputy recalled that during President XI's visit to Hengqin at the end of last year, the Chinese leader stressed the need to achieve substantive results from the deepened cooperation zone between Guangdong and Macao in Hengqin at the level of economic diversification of masters and the quality of life and convenience of residents living and/or working in Hengqin.
On the other hand
In the face of the complex international conjuncture, Joey Lao considers that Macau should adopt a broader and longer perspective. "Mand and all sectors of society need to reinforce the country's defense conscience, love to Macau and to be prepared to face dangers," says the former legislator without specifying.
The economist also addressed what he calls “deep contradictions in the economy” and the industrial capacity of Macao, noting that they have long been subsisting without resolution, making the challenges and risks to the level of economic development unavoidable. Situations that cannot be ignored.
Still on the idea of ​​Macao facing Hengqin as his own home, Au Kam San shared on Facebook a disagreeing opinion from Xia Baolong. The former deputy understands that for Macau to treat Hengqin's development as a local subject, its own sphere, mountain island should be fully ceded to masters.
Au Kam San exemplified asymmetries with the fact that Hengqin Gross Domestic Product has no relationship with Macau, as well as the tax revenues on the other side of the border, where it is not possible to offer jobs to Macao residents with salaries that correspond to the Life Standards of the Masters.
The former deputy also warns of the possibility of Macao suffered economically, unable to diversify, applying too much investments in Hengqin, neglecting the local economy.</description><pubDate>2025-05-13 22:47:48</pubDate></item><item><title>Macau maintains shipping by air to the United States</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/13/macau-mantem-envio-de-encomendas-por-via-aerea-para-estados-unidos/</link><description>The Macau Post Office Director told Lusa yesterday that, unlike neighboring Hong Kong, the region kept ordering orders to the United States (USA), but only by air. On May 2, the US government eliminated the exemption of customs rights on small orders from mainland China and Hong Kong, such as those sent by the giants of Electronic Trade Shein and Temu.
"In practice, now Macau is not included and the mail [which] goes to the United States is walking, except maritime. The rest, we keep normal," said Derby Lau Wai Meng. The Director of Post and Telecommunications Services (CTT) explained that the shipping of any goods, from sea to the US, implies a passage through Hong Kong, one of the busiest ports in the world.
That is, there is only the hypothesis of sending orders by air, confirmed Derby Lau. "This case is sensitive," admitted the leader. "I think it's better not to talk [this subject], because the best thing is not to remember us," he added.
Trump in Action
The end of the exemption of customs rights on small orders from mainland China and Hong Kong emerged in an executive order, signed by US President Donald Trump on April 2.
The document asked the US Secretary of Commerce, Howard Lutnick, to submit a report, within 90 days, if the end of the exemption should also cover Macao, "to avoid escape to these measures."
On April 16, Hong Kong's post office announced the suspension of sending orders to the United States in response to the imposition, "abusive", tariffs by US authorities.
A presidential decree issued by Donald Trump, still in the first term, in 2020, eliminated the preferential treatment granted to Hong Kong. The ancient British colony is therefore also affected by the 145 percent surcharge imposed on China.
Chinese Communist Party's main official for Hong Kong and Macao affairs and governments of both regions accused the United States of imposing tariffs in mid -April to sabotage China.
Macao Executive leader Sam Hou Fai criticized the United States for the “abusive imposition of customs taxes on all his business partners,” including China, “under various pretexts”. Yesterday, the US representative for the United States, Jamieson Greer, said Washington and Beijing will suspend the majority of customs rights and negotiate for 90 days.
In the negotiations made in Geneva, the United States and China agreed to reduce the reciprocal customs rights imposed on each other, passing Chinese imports to pay a 30 percent customs right, while US products will pay a 10 percent customs right.</description><pubDate>2025-05-13 05:36:16</pubDate></item><item><title>Melco | “Employment + Training” plan offers 30 vacancies</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/13/melco-plano-de-emprego-formacao-oferece-30-vagas/</link><description>Enrollment opens today for another specific “Employment + Training” plan launched by the Directorate of Services for Labor Affairs (DSAL) and, this time, by Melco Resorts &amp; Entertainment, which will make 30 vacancies available to “entertainment ambassador”.

A renovated Ukrainian, with the same name of the president, guilty Zelensky about the extension of the conflict that destroyed his village. Zelensky, the village, who has never left his land, now lives mortified because his favorite gravedigger died in the bomber.
This Zelensky, the village, represents half the world that reproves the other Zelensky, the villain, for not wanting to negotiate with Putin.
Negotiate what? The invader enters us through the house, pies us the wife and daughter (cf. recent UN report on Ukraine violations in this “special operation”), an act that forced us to watch, and then we say: Alto there, we are for peace, but we have to negotiate: You have not said the name you want to give to children!
A peace that is not worthy is but a cessation of rights. As severe as Russophobia that Putin inflicts his people.

In a lunch with several guests I hear a friend, who declares himself a spiritist, explaining about the particularities of his belief, in a serene and balanced way, would even say, without "irrationalism". He discussed long and serenely, devoid of any fanatical proselytizing. “Here is someone to whom belief brought weighting!” I thought, a rare alliance.
However, at one point a phrase that horrify me. He says, “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!” And I enter the voracious fauces of holism. Because holismo has a pathological aspect like all good things, a side of shadow.
Two examples: In Hinduism there is less sensitivity to existential dramas, if that child suffers in this life this is only an expression of the strict karmic symmetry, an effect of the acts she committed in her previous life. In Africa it is not accepted that death may have been accidental, and many women are accused by the dead family of having caused her husband's death, in an act of manifest dementia, and, in the blatant majority of cases, in a huge injustice to his wife - madness that spreads and infiltrates the social fabric.
Buddhism has introduced compassion and Christianity to Caritas, trying to break with this logic, but in many other beliefs and religions the cage of causalities prevails over sensitivity to experience, the need to respond to the now.
It is a tremendous logic that transforms the world into a platonic stage, where we are just the shadows of something -an inextricable law -in a determinism that calcines all singularities, but strangely fascinates many.
The conquest of modernity has anchored in the conquest of chance and random, subtracting the incidences of a life to this fierce determinism that closed the world in a web. When the Renaissance freed the body from the influence of the stars, at this moment sexuality was relieved of guilt and individualism and their volition could emerge.
There is an unequivocal moral implication in the phrase “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!”, Which should work as a key to self-knowledge and self-judgment, but usually this phrase is managed to seek a reason for things abroad from us in the other. It is an alibi.
There is a holistic temptation in the world today, as in the Middle Ages there was a satanic temptation, without great reflection on its consequences. Because it is not enough we want to connect everything in a resonant chain of affection. Even the most unexpected: affection itself can kill.
I realize, thanks to this cultured, balanced, intelligent woman, that “the combat” moved at the beginning of this century. One of the great misconceptions of the twentieth century was the false dichotomy between "rationalism and irrationalism", a debate that extended to all fields, including art. First, rationality was confused (the positive side of reason) with rationalism (the pathological feature of reason), and articulated in this lack of discernment was confused irrationalism with freedom. Almost all the art of the twentieth century, with surrealism to the head, worked in this error. The fallacy still exists despite having consolidated the emergence of 'irrationalism' and the consequent relativist currents that followed it. Essentially much of what happened in the twentieth century, it turned around this shock between two paradigms: rationalism versus irrationalism.
Now, I see, the indetermination, chance, the random of the terrible temptation of the causal cage. Holism, in its pathological feature, can be the reductionism that is the way it puts the way as a new 'eschatological narrative'.
Is it "by chance" that the holism emerges at the moment when neo-liberalism and its cynical contempt for the human person besides all freedoms, all acquired rights?
Holistic consciousness has brought positively a greater ecological awareness but followed by scholastic rigor drifting reality under the blanket of a determinism that is much more than inconvenience: all great authoritarian ideologies are holistic.
My friend will know how to combine her holistic and transpersonal belief with the freedom and responsibility that every moment asks us - but how many will make the destruction, under a law that explains and encompasses everything?
How many will not be abandoned to what it is?
The awareness of the indeterminate brings tragic conscience, as the Greeks knew, but also brings the will and the courage of the decision. And of this we cannot abdicate.
In addition, as Drummond shows in Carlos Drummond de Andrade's poem “Quadrilha”:
"John loved Teresa who loved Raimundo/ who loved Maria who loved Joaquim who loved Lili/ who did not love anyone./ John went to the United States, Teresa to the convent,/ Raimundo died of disaster, Maria stayed to aunt,/ Joaquim suicide himself and Lili married J. Pinto Fernandes/ who had not entered the story."
Real always runs outside the track, in full exteriority to our concepts. This is what is worth a J. Pinto Fernandes at the exact moment we thought we had everything under control.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Nobel and others</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/17/do-nobel-e-outros/</link><description>9/10/22
Reading many people's reactions when the Nobel Prize in this year's literature was announced, I couldn't help but remind me of this repair of Jean-Pierre Siméon, in relation to another Nobel Prize: “An editor of a large national newspaper wrote five lines of indignation because the Nobel Prize for Literature, a complete stranger. But unknown to whom? How did not occur to this patented and paid literary columnist to do his work, that his apparent ignorance was a matter of incorrect professional conduct? Tranströmer was translated into many languages, it was available in French. »
There is always the choir of those who wait for the announcement of the prize to complain about not being invited to the jury of the prize, there is a subgroup of Irados that professes “never read and I will not bother to read”; It is an uncommon fauna, which inhabits social networks.
I don't always know all the winners-I was unaware of the existence of Louise Glück, who I find a great poet, or the Olga Tokarczuk, for example-but it only brings me the comfort of knowing that the world is not a soap opera where everyone knows each other and the joy of recognizing that the gauge of the world is not measured with my short measure and that on the contrary it gives me a new opportunity to face the unknown.
And perhaps the most cretin of reactions was the smart one who wrote, but there are still those who read French? Confirming only that today there is a new kind of ignorance that fires with a displeasure: the one who only read English.
I would also prefer that, in French, Pascal Quignard, Linda reads, or even Sollers, or, among the new ones, Mathias is awarded, but that does not take dignity to the work of Annie Ernaux (and it would be enough to have written the “Les Années”). There are books of her that I like less, like the vulgar "a simple passion," but this happens with almost every authors, they have a channel books and others that are like intervals in their itinerary. I advise reading a beautiful book of interviews with her, "L'Ecriture Comme un couteau".

Yesterday came an article in Maputo's morning “News”, realizing that the Pen Club narrative prize was assigned to my wife, Teresa Noronha, for her soap opera “Tornado”, which had already had the Maria Velho da Costa award.
The summary they made of the book does not even deserve comments, by pathetic, but what matters to highlight is the note of disqualification about their "Mozambicanity" by calling it Luso-Mozambican. It is not inaccurate, but for those who know the context, it is a dirty touch.
Because finally, following the same logic, Adelino Timóteo should be called Tsonga-Mozambican, to Álvaro Taruma-Mozambican, and Macua-Mozambican to the writers who are from the north, etc., etc. Which is not reported to happen.
At the beyond moment, in the soap opera, she writes:
«Our color has never been dominant. In colonial time we were not white, we were ripped from monories, gone mugs, the pejorative term to speak of a son of Goes and Portuguese. In the postcolonial period, I was not black and if, in Lisbon, they took me by Brazilian or Cape Verdean, already in France were lost in cogitations of where they would be and amazed when they found out it was African. There I had to explain my DNA's wanderings before relying on moorms. It took me a long time to accept that it was so because yes, and that it was no curse that were so; On the contrary, I could even discover intense patterns of fantasy and freedom in this shrewd cloak that is our genealogy… »
In the current Mozambique it is white… and this is overlapping it soon to what it does or what it is.
It is sad, but as Naipaul warned, through these stops the race is everything and is soaked in it as deeply as, elsewhere, in religion.

Bruno Latour, an anthropologist who studied the sciences and their procedures and legitimations, law, technique and religions died and entertained themselves to turn the guts to the dogmas of the “modern”. For him the place, the expert's function, was more defined by the perplexity he embodied than for the supposed truth he would support him.
He proposed, as an alternative to the kinds of multiculturalism and his mistaken password "all different all the same", the return to "diplomacy", given precisely not from the presupposition that "we are unified because participants of the same nature" but simply that we "do not yet share an ordinary world"; It is necessary to deal frontally with the "abyss of disagreement" that separates us, rather than wanting to delude it.
And about politics said, disassessedly:
«If transparency is required from the politician, we kill him; If one requires fidelity to what the other was or he says, kills him; If a mimetic relationship is required between what the crowd wants and what its representative says, the representation is killed. These must, therefore, by definition, betray, deceive, modify, distort the word. Without this ability to double the word and betray, political language would not exist. I put the perfectly plausible hypothesis that political vocabulary will become as inaccessible as the religious language of the last twenty, three or fifty years. (in “UN Monde Pluriel plus Commun”). I believe it will be missed to decipher this frantically complex world that fit us.</description><pubDate>2022-10-17 02:18:03</pubDate></item><item><title>The yo -yo</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/30/o-fuxi/</link><description>O my friends, companions of these funerals trips to countries as old as the stars and the moon, and as strange as the profound interior of our disgraceful souls, - that startle still awaits us, what secret spells we will have to overcome, what horrors will rise to our dilated pupils of amazement and terror?
Increasingly close to our precarious existences, howling the war monster, which threatens to merge humanity with the earth, incessantly traveled by the squalid spectrum of hunger and the invisible evil of ten thousand pests.
O human human, who cries superior to his own nature, but then reveals to you, once and again, unable to simply order your existence and do not understand that you are possessed by the fickle wrath and are slave to your own ambition! Do not be content with the white jade or the light gold, there is no treasure that gives you your inextinguishable thirst for other men, animals and things; for in you an eternal anguish in you; in you crawl the expelled snakes; For you grows, powerful and impossible, the very fertile ivy of evil!
This is perhaps why on the mound they call the white deer, where one of the eight immortals in sacred mount was evolved through the skies to Penglai, inhabits the fuxa, a bird whose form resembles that of the rooster, although topped by a human head. What strange copulas, what monstrous amplexes, what terrible procedures will have occurred to make the existence of this animal sinister possible? We do not know, but it is enough for our exhausted mind to dare to raise an answer, so we soon feel the skin traveled by horrendous goose bumps and the heart trigger in paraded, which wild horse beaten by the night whip of fear, oblivious to reins and containment.
May men refrain from going through the Mount of the deer, because although there are riches capable of calming the most misunderstanding ambitions, if they have the disgraced fortunate to glimpse a fuxa, it will be immediately triggered the cultivated fields, because it will be beheaded the soft animals, for it will be sacrificed the best young man and destroyed superb from countries.
Fuxi emits a sound that resembles its name. If you hear it, dark night or clear day, goose way, for the path where you find you is the most right of the ways for misfortune!</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Procrastinators Club</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/29/clube-dos-procrastinadores/</link><description>Walking in rereading of Easter, because of an article I prepare, I give this excerpt, extracted from “the universal man”:
«Every man morally is one and absolute; But you have to live with your personality to mitigate. (…) Coexistence is only possible among people reduced to a negative or hollow presence, which is constantly giving in. Hence, the emptiness of society, a huge ghost composed of numerous deceased. An upper man is antisocial or criminal. Its destination is jail and desert.
He is in thinking about whether she reflects here about the political-social conditioning that gagging, and worse, in a sad country as Portugal was in the middle of the Estado Novo (and the book is from 1931) where any possibilities of spontaneity and frankness in human relations were coarcet, or only lends the behavior of men (oppressed) a metaphysical frame, a “essence”, from a presumption of each one in the presumption of each one be in isolation “one and absolute”. Sometimes, to an excess of spirituality (or longing), it adds to Pascoaes to lack the world. He is a great poet, but he is a poet who takes gray-Jewish ampoules and is therefore written amiiude on a programmatic furor, ceasing to have pores; There is often a glass between him and the real, the same one who made him wring the Ballet, 1921: “Everything is ghost. There are only clouds, clouds of voices, clouds of souls, afflictions and tragedies! Clouds and more clouds, appearances and more appearances! It is a divine lightning that pierces them, the instant appearance that arises and throws us to the ground, dazzled! »
Sometimes I would like to remind him, as Antonio Sérgio did in the article “Regeneration and Tradition, Moral and Economy”, which dedicated to Easter: “Easter, Easter my dear friend: You are a pure, excellent and noble poet, but also a victim of this social environment, like us all: this horrible isolation that you praise and I”.
"As a child, he stole two melos," says Jacinto do Prado Coelho, stole him from a nest, and throb his lifetime remorse for it. The person, few more mischief is known to him. Only in Álvaro de Campos sprouts a twinge of evil and obscenity: “Oh, and ordinary and dirty people who always seem the same,/ who employs profanity as usual words,/ whose children steal at the grocery door/ and whose daughters at eight years-and I think this is beautiful and I love him! -/ masturbate decent -looking men on the stairs. » (Ode triumphal).
Both poets beaten by a certain idea of ​​holiness, they were identical to the inability of breaking the siege of the skin with the overflow of the dike, the same curse of sublimating Eros's concrete ferocity with the mansuity of the verses.
Of course, they are the two "Bigger Than Life", but sometimes unnerves to watch, from my hostor's post at the Procrastinators Club, to the tantrums between them, just to see who occupies, in the internal organization, the place of president and treasurer.
Although a person has guessed more, for example, this he wrote in the least known martial ode and that is declining in the situation we live today, differently, with the heart in his hands:
«Ode martial

About 900 Chinese soldiers and more than 1,300 Cambojan soldiers participate in the exercises, which will extend until May 28, according to a statement from the Khmer Royal Forces (RCAF, Cambodia).
According to the statement, will be presented state -of -the -art Chinese military equipment, including armored vehicles, helicopters, war ships, recognition drones and robotic combat dogs. The objective is to “develop narrower ties and cooperation” between the two armies.
"The exercises are larger than last year in terms of personnel and equipment," RCAF spokesman Thong Solimo told AFP, adding that a Chinese war ship, Chanbai Shan, attracted Ream Cambodian naval base with the equipment. The ream base in southwest of Cambodia was renewed by China and inaugurated on April 2 by Prime Minister Cambodian Hun Manet and a Chinese military delegation.
“China wants to show its muscles” and send the message that “it is a superpower”, through these exercises, nicknamed “Golden Dragon,” argued or Virak, a Cambodian political expert, quoted by the French news agency.
In addition to this demonstration of strength, China must also “give confidence to its partners, telling them that China is growing, developing and becoming stronger, both in terms of dimension and technological progress and military power,” he added or Virak.
Cambodia should also receive two China war ships. The first joint military exercises, called “Golden Dragon”, took place in 2016 and, in early 2017, Cambodia ended the “Angkor Sentinel”, a similar joint exercise that had been organized in the previous seven years with US forces.</description><pubDate>2025-05-15 01:10:16</pubDate></item><item><title>Range and Route | Colombia confirms adherence to the Chinese initiative</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/15/faixa-e-rota-colombia-confirma-adesao-a-iniciativa-chinesa/</link><description>In the Chinese capital to participate in the China-Celac Forum (Latin American and Caribbean Community), Colombian President Gustavo Petro signed a memorandum to join the Track and Route International Trade Initiative
 
China and Colombia signed yesterday in Beijing a cooperation plan for the Latin American country to join the Chinese track and route initiative, confirmed the Colombian presidency through the social network X. The Memorandum, signed in Beijing by the leaders of both countries, Xi Jinping and Gustavo Petro, brings together Colombia to an initiative with which the Asian giant intends to generate an international trade network and Extend its influence worldwide through the construction of infrastructure, and to which more than twenty countries in Latin America and Caribbean have joined.
“Under this meeting, Colombia has signed an important economic cooperation agreement for the adhesion of our country to the [initiative] track and route,” says the Colombian presidency. Xi and Petro gathered yesterday to reinforce bilateral ties by signing new agreements, including this, among all the most emblematic.
Before traveling to China, Petro revealed that on his previous voyage to the Asian country in October 2023, he intended to sign this memorandum, but at the time it was not possible due to an alleged mistake of his previous Foreign Minister, Álvaro Leyva.
"This is what I am going to do now, an agreement of intent; future governments will see if the intention comes true, and must come true," the Colombian president said. Petro was with Xi on Tuesday at the opening of the China-Celac Forum (Latin American and Caribbean Community) in the Chinese capital, where he appealed to a dialogue between civilizations “free from authoritarianism and imperialism”.
The trade scale between Colombia and China is particularly unfavorable to the Latin American country, whose annual deficit is about $ 14 billion. By 2024, Colombia exported $ 2.38 billion from goods to China and imported $ 15.9 billion from Chinese products.
In addition, between 1994 and 2023, China invested $ 813.3 million in Colombia -yet a value far lower than the United States and Spain -concentrated in sectors such as infrastructure, mining exploration, energy and transport.
Other ties
In addition to trade, Colombia is trying to reinforce technological cooperation with China. On Tuesday, Petro visited the headquarters of the Huawei 'giant' in Beijing telecommunications, where, according to Colombian Minister of Information and Communications Technology, Julián Molina, eventual initiatives for cooperation in the domains of artificial intelligence, data infrastructure and connectivity were discussed.
Petro's government's interest in strengthening commercial ties with China during the visit has caused internal controversy, due to the fear of any negative repercussions on the relationship with the United States, Colombia's largest commercial partner.</description><pubDate>2025-05-15 01:05:51</pubDate></item><item><title>Fentanil | China asks the US to stop blaming Beijing for the epidemic</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/13/fentanil-china-pede-aos-eua-que-parem-de-culpar-pequim-pela-epidemia/</link><description>China yesterday asked the United States to blame the Chinese for the fentanyl epidemic in the country and criticized the “irrational” customs imposed by Washington.
"If the United States wants to sincerely cooperate with China, they should stop defaming and blaming China and get involved in a dialogue based on equality, respect and mutual benefit," said China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian at a press conference.
The US has been responsible for China because it is the country of manufacture of most of the chemicals that come in the United States. Fentanil is a powerful synthetic opioid that has become a public health problem in the United States in recent years, being responsible for tens of thousands of deaths annually.
On Monday, US representative for trade, Jamieson Greer, revealed that the Fentanil crisis had been first approached in commercial talks between the United States and China.
Contacts between the two countries have taken place since the weekend in Geneva. The issue of Fentanil has been one of the main points of the tariff confrontation between the two powers, with Washington asking Beijing to suppress the illegal production and export of chemicals that allow the manufacture of the substance.
Asked yesterday about the perspectives of dialogue on the subject, Lin Jian said China was proactive, but was not responsible for the crisis. "The United States ignored China's goodwill and imposed irrational tariffs on Fentanil. This seriously impairs dialogue and cooperation between China and US in the fight against drugs and severely undermines China's interests," he said.</description><pubDate>2025-05-13 22:58:36</pubDate></item><item><title>Beijing puts an end to the prohibition of Chinese companies to receive Boeing planes</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/13/pequim-poe-fim-a-proibicao-das-companhias-chinesas-receberem-avioes-da-boeing/</link><description>China raised a ban that prevented Chinese airlines a month ago from receiving Boeing aircraft after commercial negotiations with the United States, which temporarily reduced the customs rights of each party.
Beijing authorities have begun to inform domestic carriers and government agencies this week that aircraft deliveries in the United States may be resumed, according to Chinese sources in statements to Bloomberg on anonymity, because the information is confidential.
Airlines were given freedom to organize deliveries in their own deadlines and conditions, one of the sources added. The resumption of deliveries to China is an immediate boost for Boeing.
Defrosting occurs when the world's two largest economies agreed to a tariff truce, with the United States to reduce to 30 percent for 90 days their combined rates of 145 percent over most Chinese imports.
China has agreed to reduce its 125 percent customs rights to US products to 10 percent and to eliminate other counterfeit against the United States since April 2.
How long?
Still, the restoration of aircraft deliveries may be short -term if the tariff war is not resolved during the three months of suspension.
In this scenario, the American aeronautical giant based in Arlington, Virginia, will be able to see the price of its aircraft increase compared to its two main competitors, European Airbus and Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac), which seeks to gain land in the domestic market with state support.
Boeing was spared the rates during the last episode of the trade war during the first presidency of Trump (2017-2021), but their sales to the Asian giant have been falling since 2019. In 2022, the expectation was that 25 percent of Boeing's international deliveries would go to China, but by 2023 the number dropped to 9 percent.
On the other hand, experts believe that if the trade war is not stuck, the dispute will make US companies of all sectors higher prices for parts and raw materials that buy to China, which means they will face the double challenge of relocating part of their production and losing competitiveness in the Chinese market.</description><pubDate>2025-05-13 22:56:03</pubDate></item><item><title>Celac | XI promises 8.3 billion in Latin America and Caribbean</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/13/celac-xi-promete-83-mil-milhoes-a-america-latina-e-caraibas/</link><description>Chinese leader Xi Jinping yesterday promised to grant loans worth 66 billion Yuan (8.3 billion euros) to Latin America and Caribbean, in a summit with leaders of these regions.

In Beijing, the leader praised the country's longstanding relations with Celac's member countries, in a moment of "confrontation between blocs." "Although China, Latin America and Caribbean are distant, both sides have a long history of friendly exchanges," said XI.
"Only through unity and cooperation can countries safeguard world peace and stability and promote development and prosperity around the world," said Chinese leader, denouncing "intimidation and hegemony," in reference to the United States.
XI promised support for Latin American and Caribbean countries to "reject external interference" and "follow a path of development aligned with their national conditions." "China supports the regional nations in defense of their national sovereignty and independence," he added.
On Monday, China and the United States announced an agreement, with a validity of 90 days, with effect from May 14, under which they will reduce mutual customs rights by 115 percent.
Unattended
In the first public statements after this agreement, Xi Jinping stated that "intimidating and authoritarian practices only lead to isolation" and that "there are no winners in a trade war." After the opening of the Forum, XI Jinping should meet with Brazilian counterpart Lula da Silva, with whom he will also sign agreements to expand bilateral cooperation.
In addition to being members of G20, Brazil and China, along with Russia, India and South Africa, they are founders of the BRICS Block.

The automobile group was deemed to confirm this information, which was also released by the Diário Económico Nikkei. Nissan, in which the French group Renault holds a 35 percent participation, is expected to publish on Tuesday the results for fiscal year of 2024-2025 finished in March.
Nissan is expected to announce a record annual loss in a context of restructuring the company and after the application of more tariffs by the United States.

"We hope that the parties involved will continue to use dialogue and negotiations to reach a fair, lasting and binding peace agreement that is acceptable to all parties involved," said Lin Jian, spokesman for the China Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Vladimir Putin proposed, on Saturday night, that Ukraine started direct negotiations between the parties on Thursday in Istanbul, the city that welcomed, in March 2022, the first and only negotiations between the parts in more than three years of war.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky reacted to the proposal considering it "a first step" of Kremlin to end the war, but insisted that first there must be a ceasefire before Ukraine feels to negotiate.
Russia's proposal was presented a few hours after Ukraine and the European allies demanded from Moscow to agree with a total and unconditional ceasefire for at least 30 days, otherwise it will face new economic sanctions.
This requirement arose after a meeting held on Saturday in Kiev among the heads of state and government of Ukraine, France, Germany, the United Kingdom and Poland, the so -called “coalition of the disposed”. The Russian proposal was also looked at with suspicion by the Ukraine European allies that required any conversations to be preceded by a lasting ceasefire.</description><pubDate>2025-05-13 05:32:42</pubDate></item><item><title>Tibet | Evaluation of damage after 5.5 earthquake on the Richter scale</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/13/tibete-avaliacao-de-danos-apos-sismo-de-55-na-escala-de-richter/</link><description>A 5.5 degree earthquake on the Richter scale yesterday shook the Chinese region of Tibet, where authorities are still collecting information on possible land damage and landslides, local media said.
The tremor was recorded at 5:11 places in Lazi County of the city of Xigaze, with the epicenter at a depth of ten kilometers, according to the center of seismological networks of China.
Firefighters and rescue teams of the affected county have already moved to the Epicenter Zone, where the tremor was strongly felt, according to local agencies, cited by the Official News Agency Xinhua. The same sources have added that they are collecting information about possible lands and injured.
Tibet and other areas of Western China are often the stage of seismos, due to the proximity of the friction point of the Asian-Indian tectonic plate, but due to the low population density of the region, the earthquakes often occur in poorly populated areas.
Still, on January 7, a 6.8 magnitude earthquake in the Tibetan region, with epicenter in Tingri County, near the northern Evereste field, killed 126 people, injured more than 200 and caused the collapse of hundreds of homes and infrastructure.</description><pubDate>2025-05-13 05:31:21</pubDate></item><item><title>Álvaro Barbosa, vice-rector of the University of São José: “Student visa is very limiting”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/07/alvaro-barbosa-vice-reitor-da-universidade-de-sao-jose-visto-de-estudante-e-muito-limitativo/</link><description>The University of São José continues the negotiation saga with the Chinese authorities to recruit students from the interior of China. Vice-rector Álvaro Barbosa expects, soon, the increase in master's students from 30 to 200. Regarding the internationalization of higher education, the official advocates changes in student visas to facilitate recruitment
 
Does the recruitment of students from the interior of China remain a matter pending to the University of Saint Joseph?
It is a process that is underway. We have had huge support from the Macao government in negotiations to obtain the quota for our university, and they have been tireless in the effort to try to resolve the issues raised by the central government. Many of the questions are legitimate and concern concerns that arise. We were granted a temporary quota of 30 students for masters ago over a probative period, which served to evaluate how we, as Western University, would host students from China. From China, there is this concern with the host of students in Macau. I think we have made a huge effort and the students who are there, included in this contingent, are quite satisfied.
Is this quota for masters just?
Yes. For a degree we do not have authorization yet. In this way, we are currently at the time we try to overcome this probative period in order to obtain a quota of about 200 students for masters. We are in the final phase of the evaluation process and everything has been doing well. We will have the possibility that, next academic year, expand this quota. That would be great, because for our university, to have a greater impact of our mission in Macao, it is essential to have access to students from mainland China. We cannot be a university in an integrated region in a country like China, and not contact with students from China.
Is it more difficult for USJ to compete with other universities, such as those of Hong Kong, by foreign students, outside China?
The issue of recruitment of international students has become a priority for Macao universities. In the last two or three years, it has become evident that this internationalization is very important. What difficulty is there? There is the issue related to student visas, as these visas currently do not allow students to do any kind of work, denying them that minimum local subsistence mechanism to be able to meet expenses. Nor is it contemplated the possibility of, when the student concludes his formation, to be in the territory and find work. What all countries and regions that are competitive in higher education do, such as Singapore, Hong Kong or Australia, is to have incentive policies. Allow students to work part -time, for example. In Hong Kong when a degree ends, the student can stay in the territory up to a maximum of two years to find a job. This kind of measures do not yet exist in Macau, but I think the government is pondering this possibility. From the moment the decision was made that the internationalization of higher education was important, this must be accompanied with the corresponding measures. The current student visa is extremely limiting and does not encourage the coming to Macao to study, only allows coming. This issue was not as present as it is now, but now there is a strategic policy of internationalization.
It is also a matter of survival for local universities.
Yes. Perhaps there is no greater example of a catalyst for the diversification of Macau's economy than higher education. We have ten institutions, 60,000 students in about 700,000 inhabitants. This is the potential of internationalization, to foster diversification.

And also the research that comes out of higher education.
The investigation, the dynamics of the work that is done. There are a number of vectors that higher education brings to a region or country, this happened to Portugal, for example, with the policy of doctoral scholarships for students from abroad, which completely changed the dynamics of higher education. Cape Verde developed thanks to the impact of higher education.
Then we need to make the system more flexible in Macau.
I don't know if it's a matter of having a holistic view of strategy. There may be an idea, but then it does not intervene in all the necessary dimensions to achieve a certain goal. But I am very optimistic. I believe this new student policy is a key step to be taken in Macau. The internationalization strategy followed by all these countries and regions I spoke, and were successful in capturing international students, was always the same. No need to invent much. First, one should increase the capacity and notoriety of universities, and then a policy of scholarships, which will enhance a student flow, creating a reference for the territory, so that studying there becomes a habit. After this flow of students for a few years, an image is already created and some scholarships can be removed, which students will continue to choose a particular territory to study in it. Australia has a huge higher education industry, for example, and I think that in Macau we just have to follow the same strategies. We do, at USJ, that a little.
How, in concrete terms?
We offer many scholarships, and in this sense the Diocese of Macao has helped us build this flow of international students that allow us to create this dynamic that we hope will be sustainable by itself in the future. I think the government is also doing this. There have always been scholarships in Macau, attributed mainly by the Macau Foundation, but this measure will be strengthened. Solving the student's visa issue, creating a scholarship incentive system for five to ten years, Macau will have a bright future as an international higher education destination. But we need to invest, continue, and it takes a few years.
USJ created the “Macau Hub” platform, in partnership with the Macau Scientific and Cultural Center (CCCM) in 2023. At what stage is this project?
This project has to do with our interest in developing a relationship dynamic of Lusophone countries centered in Lisbon in the area of ​​entrepreneurship, first. This cabinet we have at CCCM is not intended to offer training in Portugal, but we want to do something else. As we are positioned in the Great Bay and with Hengqin, where it is intended to activate a business ecosystem, we want to take advantage of the fact that we have relations with the Lusophone world to activate the access of the startups of Portugal, Brazil and Angola, above all, to the great bay and hengqin. We are trying to create a kind of incubator of transnational companies, in which we support the development of Lusophone businesses that want to settle in the large bay and also the reverse system. Strategically, for a university, it is absolutely fundamental to have a dynamic in the area of ​​entrepreneurship. Currently, more than half of our students do not want to go to the corporate world, but create their own businesses. Just as universities have to have employability solutions, they also have to have them for entrepreneurs, who are increasingly. So a university has to have a business incubator. My vision of the future for higher education goes around: a university, besides having a library and canteen, will also have its own business incubator. I would say that most students of management or economy courses dream of having their own business, especially in China. China is perhaps one of the most entrepreneurial countries in the world. The CCCM welcomes this initiative in Portugal, but we also work with the Portuguese Catholic University.
And concrete results, already have it?
We have a number of small initial projects that are starting now, and we also work with many business organizations. We have now negotiated a series of projects, and I think everything will develop very quickly, based on the manifestations of interest we have. We were in Angola in December and we have already aligned a series of initiatives, we also have projects with Brazil and Portugal.</description><pubDate>2025-04-07 22:56:36</pubDate></item><item><title>Adelina Moura, teacher and trainer: “The mobile phone is like a Swiss knife”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/07/adelina-moura-docente-e-formadora-o-telemovel-e-como-um-canivete-suico/</link><description>Graduated in the area of ​​educational technologies, Adelina Moura will conduct lectures to parents, students and teachers about the use of digital technologies in classrooms, within the “Letters &amp; Company” festival of the Portuguese Institute of the East. The teacher understands that prohibiting mobile phone in schools is not a solution
 
What are the challenges felt by teachers with the introduction of technologies in the classroom? Can the mobile phone actually be a complement to learning?
Yes. I've been saying this since 2005. The mobile phone can be an excellent learning tool, a means to motivate students and to enrich their learning. We have a kind of Swiss knife here, a very powerful equipment in the hands of the students and there is a school failure, because they do not work and help students enhance this equipment they have. What happens is that students learn in the worst way, in a destructed way, by attempt-rrove. There is a gap, as students are not alerted to the positive potential for mobile phone use. They face their mobile phones as a free time use, spending time on social networks and scrolling, and time consumes. It is essential that teachers are users, in their practices, mobile phones, and for the preparation of classes and other projects, to know how to prepare students. I consider that the school has lost several stages of students' preparation and awareness to use these equipment that lead to classes and with which schools have not spent any money. With the prohibition of bringing the mobile phone to the classroom we did not advance anything in this regard.
During the pandemic period, for example, the use of technologies, with distance learning, was quite enhanced.
But during the pandemic we also burned some steps regarding the use of digital by teachers, because before the pandemic many teachers did not believe or used. They thought it was a fashion and they saw no use in the use of mobile phones and other technologies. With the pandemic the use of these equipment proved that without them the situation of education would have been much worse. In these pandemic years, teachers have become more aware of the technologies that already exist and are available to anyone. With internet access on mobile phone, something that has existed since 2007 with the launch of the first iPhone, the e-learning system is enhanced and then we move to “Mobile Learning”, where you can learn anywhere and anytime with mobile devices. It is this reality that we see a little away from school.
And after the pandemic, how has it been?
I think we will take a few more steps towards digital literacy. With Artificial Intelligence (IA), it seems that we are as in the phase I created my first website in 1999 or email in 1995. We are at the beginning. But it is 30 years of technology where there have been many changes, and technology in fact goes on and if we immediately do not realize what we have available, we and students, we help create a moat that has happened in the past compared to digital. In the face of AI, if we do not look back and do not realize what was not done and should have been at school level, we are wasting time. Only a few years from now will people be alert to AI, and the gap is increasing. Hence it is very important to bet now, in this early stage, in the training of teachers, students and families.
Is there much ignorance of parents, removal from this reality?
We have parents who are from this century. That is, they were born with the existence of computers, internet, saw the appearance of the smartphone. But when they studied, the school did not talk about the potential of digital. So these former students came to society and did not bring this sensitivity to digital, to educate their children. We teachers, when we do digital training, are doing good to society because we are also preparing these young people for the future, because they will be parents and should be aware of educating their children. At school we do not only prepare for the job market, but for personal and family life. Hence teacher education is essential. The invitation I received from IPOR seems to me an excellent holistic view of everything, because the school includes several actors, connecting with society.
How should AI be introduced into the classroom?
We currently watch changes in search engines, in fact. We have search engines created from root to Age Age, for example. The best way to introduce AI into the classroom is to ask students and how they use it, and already resort to this tool. At the beginning of the academic year I always ask students to answer a questionnaire about their digital routines, and then I know more or less their practices. In 2023, when the chatgPT came out, I introduced AI in my classes, and realized that students were using this tool to deceive the teachers. Students have to realize that when using AI, they are falling into a certain trap because they are not learning. It is the law of the lowest effort, equal to the phase in which the internet emerged, when students selected, copied and sent to the teacher. We now have the problem that the answers are in Brazilian Portuguese, for example, and I see soon that AI was used. We have, therefore, to dismantle this action in the heads and face them. I tell them that they are being intellectually dishonest and that they have not read the AI ​​response, for example. Since 2023, I feel that students, in the answers to this questionnaire I do, say they are afraid to use chatgpt because they are afraid of being caught by teachers. That is, it seems to have gained some conscience.
It will give these lectures in a different educational context in Asia, where the use of mobile phone can be earlier. How will you deal with these differences, or do you understand that the problems of using technology in the classroom are transversal?
It is a transverse question. Do we have to wonder if the use of a particular equipment and tool will make us wiser? It seems to me not, because we may have the equipment, but the use we make it varies a lot. I tell my students that they should be ashamed, because they have much easier access to content than in my time, when we truly had to do research and read in physical format. I tell them that with this technology they should all have a grade 20, and that they are wasting resources, being dishonest intellectually, because they sign works that are not theirs and do not read, even, they deliver. One of the works we have with students is to teach them how to make bibliographic references, refer to the sources. But I am an optimistic by nature, and I hope that in a decade, secondary education students who are fathers and mothers will be able to deal with these problems of social networks and increase fraud with their children. It is this “school of parents” that the school can help create. We are in a moment with no return from digital, and forbidding is the most comfortable situation, but it is not the best to face reality. We have to use the right words to alert. We have in this time of alerts and consciences, encouraging the critical spirit of our students, which is little today.

Speaking to HM, the academic enhances the interconnection between tourism, economy and geography, and lists its possibilities, limitations and effects, including Macao
 
 
In this book it speaks of the concept of “spatial economy”, in connection with tourism and geography. How is this connection?
Economic geography combines the geographical context with economic processes, being studied the spatial distribution of economic activities. The economy of tourism is particularly sensitive to these geographical constraints, as they are the characteristics of each place that enhances the development of certain products or services. These characteristics widely exceed the physical aspects of the territory and also include culture, history, ways of life or even institutions and legal frameworks. The case of casino, something particularly important in Macao, is a good example of the importance of legal aspects to develop certain types of tourism. Economic geography has a wider scope than the spatial economy, more focused on strictly economic aspects. Being evident in tourism this relationship between economics and geography, this book establishes a double approach that systematizes the interdependence of these three aspects it refers. First explores how the concepts and theories of economic geography can apply to tourism. In the second half it makes the opposite route, discussing how the analysis of relevant problems of contemporary tourism justifies the use of economic geography. Examples are the degradation of local resources, environmental impacts, contribution to climate change, acceleration of gentrification processes or disturbance of community modes of life.
Can having an excessively -dependent economy of tourism constitute a problem or salvation?
The two things, and are both cases that economic geography can help to understand. The industrialization of economies is linked to the agglomeration processes of activities that reinforce each other when they reach a certain scale. This allows the massification of production and consumption, with reasonable costs. Contemporary industries, more associated with the integration of digital technologies and creative processes, are less clustered in specialized industrial development zones, but tend to focus on large cities and metropolitan areas. It also follows that rural areas, islands, or sites that have not followed industrialization processes, have more difficulty mobilizing investments, technologies or qualified people to innovate and develop new industries. In such cases, tourism often appears as the possible solution as it can be developed with incorporation of technology and relatively low knowledge. On the other hand, tourism consumption, not being essential to human life, is very sensitive to income fluctuations.
Can you give examples?
This was visible, for example, with the 2007/2009 international crisis. Tourism is also very vulnerable to safety problems or international epidemics, such as COVID-19 has demonstrated to the extreme. Economies too specialized in tourism are very vulnerable to external shocks and less resilient to crises. It is also visible that, being the tourist development often supported by intensive and weak labor services, the specialization in tourism can cause, in the long run, embarrassment in terms of population qualifications, the ability to innovate and integrate technology or to add value to the regional economy.
The book also speaks of “intelligent tourism” and “co-creation of experiences”, using the megados and IA. Is tourism definitely becoming more digital?
Social networks are fundamental instruments for new generations. However, they began to generalize the tools for planning or promotion of travel supported by artificial intelligence. The so-called “intelligent tourism” more generally designates the use of digital technologies to intensify information flows, consolidate the formation of networks and promote more informed and shared decision making, eventually contributing to the so-called “co-creation of experiences”. Tourism digitization has its origins in service distribution systems originally developed by airlines since the 1960s, but it would be the internet to accelerate and globalize digitization.
And social networks.
The emergence of social networks promoted the creation of a more interactive universe, potentially in real time and involving wide numbers of users and various types of supports. The generalization of the use of mobile phones permanently connected to the Internet, even on foreign travel, has further increased this potential for intensive and interactive use of data and information. This "co-creation", however, hides obvious imbalances of power.
Such as?
With regard to tourists, or consumer in general, it is usually the role of providing information, for example through social networks. This information is obtained, accumulated and marketed, sometimes without consent or even without knowledge, to eventually translate into the creation, adaptation or promotion of products and services. This process is particularly important in the case of tourism, because there is usually a long period between the decision to travel and the trip itself. This period of travel exploration and planning is used by tourist marketing companies to try to influence choices. This type of interaction also introduces a difference in the “spatiality” of the provision of tourist services, which are usually produced and consumed at the same time and in the same place, in a direct relationship between producer and consumer. The digitization of tourism anticipates most of these interactions and information flows and transfers them to large technological companies or marketing and distribution.
In a world where more and more travel, the routes are shorter and access to information is immense, how can countries and regions be competitive in the tourist offer?
Contemporary tourism lives in a highly competitive international environment. But just as there is a wide variety of destinations and offerings, there is also a wide range of preferences and consumption, what is called “hyper-personalization”, the result of such abundance of information and opportunity for interaction. The challenge that is placed on destinations is to identify the resources, products and services that can be adjusted to a particular group of consumers, to communicate effectively. This competitiveness greatly goes beyond the strict scope of tourist services because it also requires mobility and transportation services, varied infrastructure, safety, medical support, or easy communication. Anywhere you want to develop your tourist industry have to intervene about all these factors.
The book also addresses how “social processes” shape the development of tourism. In the case of China, for example, do you believe we are watching a change, which will have consequences for Macau?
It seems to me that Macau is in a highly privileged position to develop other forms of tourism. China is the largest issuing market in the world, the widespread rise of income in recent decades allows many million people to explore the opportunity to travel. Macao is a very close and distinct destination, with its historical and cultural particularities. For the Chinese population it was not easy to visit Macau and there is certainly a great interest.
How does the Great Bay project come in this?
The strategy that is being followed by integrating the Great Bay allows you to develop a cosmopolitan and diverse offer that can certainly attract Chinese tourists and other parts of the world. Moreover, these three areas have excellent hotel and tourism schools, which guarantee qualified personnel for tourism management and planning. The element of differentiation that Portuguese culture introduces in this context can certainly contribute to the success of the transition from a casinos focused on other forms that value culture and heritage more.
Is it possible to have sustainable tourism?
The problems and difficulties of tourism sustainability are more visible than in other sectors. This “spatiality” of tourism (where the consumer is obliged to move to the place of consumption) implies that the consequences of this consumption become more evident. These effects are less obvious when it comes to the unsustainability of industrial units or intensive forms of agriculture in relatively isolated areas. As mass reduction and investment reduction strategies also apply to tourism, the consequences of the environment or the quality of life of residents in destinations can be devastating. Sustainability implies a long -term perspective based on the idea that today's decisions do not imply future negative consequences. Sustainable practices depend on the control of the impacts that accumulate over time by individual and independent economic agents.
How can this control be done?
When a hotel or airline defines what ability to install on their services they may eventually estimate the impact that consumers will have on the local environment or economy. They will have more difficulties in anticipating that impacts will be generated in the next 10, 15 or 20 years to the investment. And surely it will be impossible to measure how this impact accumulates the impacts caused by other service providers, now or in the future. In other words, although the idea of ​​sustainability is widespread accepted, economic agents do not have mechanisms or instruments in practice. Regulating the use of resources and territories by public entities with a more comprehensive and future perspective can contribute to the sustainability more effectively than the regulation associated with market dynamics, which in many cases has been revealed highly predatory. The Chinese economy is one of these examples and may eventually benefit from it.
And in the concrete case of Macau?
Macao has historically known problems: ultra-urbanized and polluted areas, with large energy consumption and waste production; Great concentration of tourists in a relatively small area of ​​great historical and cultural interest; Great dependence on the game, with the resulting imbalances in the appropriation of tourism benefits. The ongoing transition to new forms of tourism should better solve these problems and state regulation will certainly have better results than based on market dynamics.</description><pubDate>2025-04-02 23:28:16</pubDate></item><item><title>José Paulo Esperança, Associate Rector of the City of Macau University: “Languages ​​cannot be controlled”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/01/jose-paulo-esperanca-reitor-associado-da-universidade-cidade-de-macau-as-linguas-nao-podem-ser-controladas/</link><description>Co-author of the “New Atlas of the Portuguese Language”, with Luís Reto and Fernando Luís Machado, José Paulo Esperança reveals to HM that the work edited in 2016 and 2018 is being updated, especially due to the growing global value of the language. The Associate Rector and Professor of the City of Macao University suggests partnerships with Macau under the Editorial Project
 
Launched the “New Atlas of the Portuguese Language”, in co-authorship, about the global value of the language. Plan a new edition or update?
Undoubtedly. We are working in this regard, there was a recent conference in Macao and Professor Luís Reto, former Rector of ISCTE, presented some more current elements that were developed. He has worked on a very important issue, which is the role of Portuguese as a frank language, which was for a few centuries in Asia. The exchange between Dutch and the kingdom of Zion was made in Portuguese, because it was the common language used at that time, before English became the contemporary frank language. Therefore, there is a whole interesting story of Portuguese and the role it had in the first pinyins that existed, with the Chinese and the use of the [Roman] alphabet in Vietname. There are a number of elements that are not, therefore, very publicized, and the work of Atlas is the same, to disclose some economic dimensions of the language.
What are these dimensions?
One is the exchange of foreign trade and investment, which is very facilitated by the language. We also talk about migrations, tourism, students' exchange that is greatly influenced by linguistic proximity. Therefore, today we have a set of elements that are very interesting, and we hope to develop some more important partnerships with Macau.
As?
More at work, Professor Luís Reto is doing, which maintains an investigation team about the value of Portuguese. He has collaborated with the Portuguese Language Museum of São Paulo, for example. It is a museum space that was renewed after the fire that destroyed it. In addition, there is a project with Cascais City Council to develop such a structure, and we hope to do some works with Macau, in order to create three poles for the projection of the Portuguese language. As for Atlas' materials, we would like to have a continued update model, as this data is out of date very quickly. The work was edited in many languages, including Mandarin. This is the moment when we would like to give the book a more historical and deep dimension, with more knowledge about the teaching of Portuguese in the world.
What balance does this teaching do today?
Portuguese is developing a great deal of mother tongue and is effectively one of the most expanding languages ​​due to demographic growth in Africa, with countries such as Angola and Mozambique, which around 2050 will have populations of over 100 million inhabitants, each. The Portuguese thus consolidates itself as a language of the southern hemisphere, but much more from Africa, supplanting Brazil itself as the place of largest number of speakers of the language. All of this generates enormous potential, and this also occurs due to the great exchange of universities and internationalization of teaching. Today there is the possibility of Portuguese being a language of science, there is more publications in this language. This is a great challenge because English is the contemporary language of scientists. We want to contribute to all these dimensions, and Macau can also play an important role there. Macao is indeed a platform between China and Portuguese -speaking countries, and can play a significant role.
Is Macao an ideal place to train Portuguese teachers who do not have Portuguese as a mother tongue? Do you fear that the territory loses relevance in this matter before the offer of courses in the interior of China?
I see this question more as complementarity than competition. We have identified about 60 higher education institutions in China that have Portuguese courses, but I think Macau has very interesting conditions to start teaching from primary to secondary education so that children have been able to have learning from an early age. It does not mean that there are no young Chinese who began to learn their tongue in adolescence that they speak fantastically, which surprises me, but it is easier to start earlier and earlier. This will be easier in Macau. What is important is to create conditions for greater economic collaboration to many levels, such as joint research. In this respect, Macau has a very interesting opportunity. At the City of Macau University we are very interested in increasingly collaborating with researchers who visit us and work with our teams.
Can you give me examples?
Brazil is today one of China's great business partners. There is a lot of exchange in both directions, but one of the themes that is little studied, and in which I work hard, is the internationalization of Chinese companies. To what extent do these companies follow a model of internationalization similar to that of other countries that started this process earlier? I speak of the United States of America, the European countries, but also of Japan and others. China has, in fact, different models of presence in countries that are not yet well known, and this is important to realize, so that we know how to facilitate this process of exchange in a world that lives periods of some setback. It is very sad. I always remember a great economist of Portuguese origin, David Ricardo, who clearly explained how world trade is beneficial to everyone and how countries can take advantage of this situation. Therefore, applying tariffs, making such commercial barriers harms countries that are major exporters, such as China or Germany, and countries that today have a cultural export capacity, for example, and are not just importers.
In relation to the new Orthographic Agreement. It continues without a standardization in Macau. Does it worry it?
Languages ​​are dynamic and cannot be controlled. We think today in English, and we realize that there are almost incomprehensible ways to each other, such as the English one in Nigeria or Australia. Americans have difficulty realizing the Australians. In the nineteenth century, Portuguese from Portugal and Brazil were closer, then some disagreement emerged. There was an effort in Brazil to propose an orthographic agreement, and the Portuguese joined, resulting in a series of negotiations. There have always been resistances. I remember that Fernando Pessoa suggested the famous phrase “My homeland is the Portuguese language”. It was curiously a manifestation of some conservatism, because he thought Pharmacy had to continue writing with pH [Pharmacia]. In fact it did not make much sense. Portugal ended up seeking to impose a certain standardization based on the most genetic changes in the spelling agreement. It is not a process that has been running a hundred percent well, and has been universally adopted. African countries have become more defenders of Portuguese from Portugal. There is sometimes some confusion, but I understand that intercomprehension still remains, achieving a homogeneous language, more perhaps than English.
 
Between words and numbers
José Paulo Esperança is a doctorate in Economics from the European University Institute and was president of the ISCTE Department of Finance and Accounting - University Institute of Lisbon. The “New Atlas of the Portuguese Language”, with editions in 2016 and 2018, contains “a large set of indicators that reinforce the idea of ​​the growth of teaching, speakers and the written use of Portuguese in the world”, having been the target of a series of recent initiatives in Macao.
One of them took place on March 17, at the Rui Cunha Foundation, with a session of the “Roda de Ideas” cycle, entitled “The Potential of the Portuguese Language in the Contemporary World”, which was attended by the former ISCTE Rector, Luís Reto, and José Paulo Hope himself. In addition to the “New Atlas of the Portuguese Language”, José Paulo Esperança is the author of other works in the financial area.</description><pubDate>2025-04-01 03:08:41</pubDate></item><item><title>Piménio Ferreira: “Anti-igan rhetoric has always worked in Portugal”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2021/04/26/pimenio-ferreira-a-retorica-anti-cigana-sempre-funcionou-em-portugal/</link><description>Piménio Ferreira, better known as Gitelles Ferreira, anti-racist militant, 34, physical engineer, national Romani. He is a man with a provocative speech, a corrosive, kind mood and a smile that leaves no one indifferent
Gitelles, we live in an intercultural land and the Gypsies - in particular - have lived about five centuries in Portugal. What is going on for Gypsy communities to remain “on the fringes” of the so -called society? 
The model of society remains to be changed. This is extremely stratified by placing people in subordinate places to privilege a violent minority. The white social structure is patriarchal and racist. What is called the "margin" of society is actually an intrinsic place to it, which belongs to it. In other words, Gypsy people have been included in this model of society since they discovered Europe and its kingdoms. The problem is the model of society that is maintained and the place to which they were relegated and how they were relegated: with violence, in inferior status against whites, without the right to human dignity, to constitute a family, to choose their own language and religion, expropriated from any and all cultural and material law. A place built and maintained to this day by violence and genocidal and ethnicidal persecution. In 1463, a Gitano Vasco was drowned to an estate. In 1521, Gitans, or Gypsies, were already used as a reference for all that is considered bad in the model of society. The "counter-exemple" in the face of the white that would stand out for the positive. The 'angel' and the 'devil'; the 'other', the enemy; That against whom any attack and persecution is legitimate. Including the prohibition of defending, having weapons, any kind of goods, and the right of permanence.
And is it for them to be denied this right to permanence that we still have nomadic gypsy communities within the country?
Yes, no doubt. There are many ways to force nomadism: directly, prohibiting permanence and expelling with police or military force; indirectly, refusing public or private housing to Gypsy people, as they are Gypsy; and even through the gentrification process.
I read the result of an inquiry from the European Union Fundamental Rights Agency, which is said to be approximately 80% of the Gypsies responded to the risk threshold of poverty in their country; One in three Gypsies lives in a housing without channeled water; One in three Gypsies belongs to a family where someone hungry at least once the previous month; and 50% of Gypsies aged 6 to 24 do not attend school. Why does this happen like this? 
It is the historical persecution, which continues. There is no impoverishment that has no external cause. In this case, a political system of total expropriation and imposed on the basis of violence. Already in 1648, D John IV, the restorer, prohibited ‘Giving or Rent houses to Gypsies’. The same D John IV who got the kingdom of Portugal thanks to D. Jerónimo da Costa and his 250 knights. The same D. Jerónimo da Costa who had died to defend Portugal's independence from Castile. Gypsy, like his wife and children. Between prohibitions of permanence, “that do not enter Gypsies in the Kingdom and leave those who are” (D John III, 1526), ​​with expulsions, degred to the galleys, expropriation of goods and properties, imposed with stripping, mutilation and death, systematically performed to this day (still in 2011 Faro City Council wanted to ban Gypsies in the municipality).
The prohibition of working on others (no one employs Gypsy workers, and those who accept they do it in total precariousness, for poorly paid positions and without decent rights and conditions). They cannot be dependent on their own work, they cannot get investment means due to extreme expropriation. Are dependent on precariousness. If you want to know what it is like to live in pure neoliberalism, know the lives of Gypsies. Their reality is paradigmatic of the aggression and depletion to which the "gentlemen" are willing to go to their benefit.
Are you talking about economic and political power?
The group of political, social, cultural and economic power. The owner, the colonizer. This group that has been in power since it established the system of current domination. And that only makes sense within the hierarchically stratified sociopolitical model in which we live. Hence the need to end 'gentlemen' and institute a new model of society, healthy, free, without hierarchies or strata, whether of race, class or gender.
The model we live in leads to the Gypsy (and not only) community to economic exclusion, removing it from access to product consumption or excluding them from its production process; political exclusion associated with lack of access to information; To education and consequently the social exclusion that is seen in inequality of access to quality community areas such as restaurants, libraries, theater, cinema, concerts, health care, etc. How do you feel a gypsy child when you realize that it is not part of a whole? Children who are never represented, neither in movies, nor in books, nor in cartoons, not even in an announcement to eat cereals, for example? Is this a disaster for self-esteem, is a priori condemnation?
The question is that. Gypsy people are not “excluded from society”, by contrast, they are included in it. The problem is the existence of what is cynically called 'social exclusion', which term Orwellian, and there be under coercion, people. Which field of concentration and extermination. Incidentally, Nazi concentration camps are a more visual realization than called 'social exclusion' and, as here, were not a 'excluded' part of Nazi society, but rather its fundamental and characterizing structure. It is a place of violence, where people are maintained by violence, dedicated to their extermination, and designed so that few people can leave. And yet they resist. As in Nazi concentration camps.
And what you have listed as an example of 'consequence' of this 'exclusion', is actually the means by which this exclusion also happens and remains. Gypsy people are out of theaters, both as consumers and producers (but go to the cinema). They are out of school, education and the gym. Either as 'users' or as producers (but go to school and are on the basis of knowledge construction and academic and scientific debates).
Even in attacking Gypsy children's self -confidence, we talk about a maintenance mechanism of this situation. But Gypsy people respond very well: with Gypsy pride. Another resistance, another aggression. Gypsy people are thus included in society. In a place that belongs to this model of modern society. And they resist and contradict the power of domination and make a point of being in the city, in the cinema, in the theater, in the gym, in all spaces. With a lot of struggle and always resisting, but they are there. Social exclusion, more than a “place outside of society”, is part of its social structure.
Do you want to say that there is a collective resistance?
At work, already in a context of absolute precariousness, during the pandemic, Gypsy people rolled up sleeves and showed once again proactivity and creativity in adversity. They learned seeing and doing. And here, it is again the women who jump to the front line, face, learn to use digital tools with their daughters or children, and throw themselves into the network. And so they explore online sales as well as application by application (transportation or rehabs). In housing, in a context of pandemic in which the evictions were not locked - as they owed and dictated the law itself - residents did not fail to organize and fight unjust evictions and claim dignity in housing; associations of allied residents in their action with other housing and anti-racist struggle organizations.
It should also be noted how they reinvented and intensified to raise and distribute dietary goods and kits of masks/alcohol gel to the most expropriated people. Gypsies and non -Gypsies. In the anti-racist struggle, new movements emerged and their actions intensified by social networks. People who had never been organized or militated before began their first steps in activism, thickening this way of the organization and popular gypsy and anti-racist action. People forget, or do not want to value, but Gypsy action has helped determine results in the political dispute. Gypsy citizens mobilized in large and determined electoral results in the municipalities of 2017, both in Alentejo and in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area, even causing electoral earthquakes.
And even in the presidential, second place was resolved by a value equivalent to the estimated number of Gypsy voters. Apart from the non -Gypsy votes that were mobilized by the action of Gypsy voters. Gypsy people are even co-considering power in the spaces of opinion, local media, social networks and party and institutional political dispute. And most importantly, in the popular Ação and alliances with other social movements. We have never stopped fighting for all means and continuing to resist.
In contrast there are more and more hate speeches, from the far right in particular. What do you have to say about it?
To start these speeches are historical and European. Not even current and even less “of the far right”. These speeches have been adopted and rendered for a long time, even in 'democracy and freedom', by several representatives of the center right, conservatives, left center, liberal, liberal left, even representatives of the PCP. Anti-egana rhetoric has always worked in Portugal as it is the whiter rhetoric [white genesis]. That is, it allows you to create and give the "white" as the superior of all. And so please the white electorate who, when feeling well, pays off with his vote. Even if the policies implemented by their elected harm him even more.
Finally, did you like them to talk a little about your personal experience and how did you get to the activist?
I studied, fought for studies, made alliances, graduated, went in the labor market of the “formal precariousness”. I started my militant action and here I am today. We can transform this society a better. This certainty combined with the fact that the current one has so much suffering makes anyone want to have a transformist attitude. I wanted to be 'inventor' (physical engineer) and anti -racist militant. And through study (not necessarily schooling) and organization with others, in turn, with other studies, formations and visions, I learned how the world works and how it can be changed. But before transforming, we need to survive.
Hence two types of actions arise: transformative and survival. The struggle against hate discourse arises as survival, but his defeat will be a transformative victory. There is a lot that - like people who want a better world - we have to do, namely working to criminalize hate speech; condemn and prohibit organizations with racist discourses and practices; denounce the racist institutional structure and logics that organize power and generate community resources. And in this sense, there have been various types of actions, of petitions, to manifestations. And we need more.
I, besides being a military man in the SOS Racism movement, participate in the “We came to stay” podcast, with Mamadou BA and Joseph da Silva. And if all goes well, we will soon start a new project. With friendly people, we also have the project “Gypsy Initiative”, dedicated to reflecting and promoting transformative movements. Essentially focused on educating against anti-agigarism, denouncing historical and continued genocide and working for a new society project. Also with new projects on the gutter. And finally, there are always voluntary actions without an organization, where I try to share what I found out about anti-egism and Roman history in schools and with interested people. In addition, there is still the struggle for housing, because the evictions did not stop during the pandemic. Due to housing and work precariousness, the subjects racialized especially the Roma nationals are the most vulnerable to COVID-19. There is essential to have actions in this area; Of all the struggles, this is the most structural, as it goes against one of the main enemies of a healthy society: the real estate speculation of this capitalist system, which places profit and goods above people and their humanization.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>GPM | Carlos Lemos presents volume II of his book in October</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/02/gpm-carlos-lemos-apresenta-volume-ii-do-seu-livro-em-outubro/</link><description>After the success of Volume I, Macaense Carlos Lemos, residing in Toronto since 1974, is prepared to launch, in October, the Macao Grand Prix-Victor H.'s personal collection, 1954-1978, volume II (1967-1978), the second part of a book that intends to honor his father, Victor Hugo Lemos-an enthusiast of the great prize of Macao that Life, collected a vast number of photographs and everything that was related to the car races in Macau since 1954, the date of the first edition of the event.
About the second part of the work, Carlos Lemos explained to HM that it will be “very similar to volume I, but contains more newspaper clippings in English and Chinese of each year, as well as some financial reports of the Grand Prix. It also includes a poster of the Jubilee Year, which I made three limited copies and initialed in Canvas, offering one to the Macau (Apomac) retirees and pensioners association (Apomac) Lusitano, as a sign of thanks for the support provided. ”
Docued with photographs of the time and newspaper articles, there are some of the most emblematic periods of the mashed event, such as the evolution of the guide circuit, the first victim (Arsenio Laurel, 1967), the birth of the Grand Motor Motor Prize and the Guide Race, the arrival of the first factory teams and the first sponsors, the first television broadcast in direct, and the attempted Hong Kong to create his own great prize itself. Also in addition to a new chapter, with "ten pages of another collection of my father, called Motor Racing World, with some copies of 1900, autographed photographs of pilots, leaders and personalities of world motorsport."
After releasing volume I in 2023, the presentation of Volume II is scheduled for October 15 in Macao and on October 17 in the neighboring Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong.
More and bigger
The truth is that sales of the first volume exceeded expectations. "It was really a success," the author acknowledges, because "there are only two dozen copies left, which I kept for myself, for offers and reservations, if someone outside Macau is interested." However, for Carlos Lemos, “the biggest success was to be able to raise more than 41,000 patacas for charity”, intended for the Macau IC2 [I Can Too] institution, which supports people with autism or disability.
For this second volume, with more recent content, the number of copies produced will increase slightly. "The impression of volume I was 500 copies, and I found it a little" tight "to get a satisfactory number to offer friends and certain personalities and entities linked to the Grand Prix. So I had 550 copies this time."
Carlos Lemos also underlines that "Apomac and the Lusitano Club of Hong Kong promised to support the launch of Volume II, which is very important." The book will have more pages - about one hundred more - and the author confirms: “I've received several reservations!”
Mission (almost) fulfilled
With the publication of the second volume, Carlos Lemos's first major goal will be fulfilled, because "my mission to honor my father is complete with regard to the Macao Grand Prix collection, though not entirely, because my father's biggest dream was to have his name in Guinness World Records."
This is also a curious story, as Victor H. Lemos has applied three times to Guinness World Records, to no avail. "God willing and all goes well, I will try once again, on his behalf, to present a new candidacy for the Guinness Book of Records and perhaps also to Fiva Hall of Fame." Fiva (International Federation of Old Vehicles) is a non -profit world organization dedicated to the protection, preservation and promotion of historical automobile heritage.
“This time, for Guinness World Records, I will submit the application with support documents, such as videos and photographs of the collection and books,” explains the former president of the Macao House in Toronto. "My father wrote only one letter without attaching any document, because in those days there was no ease we have today."
In addition to motoring, Carlos Lemos also reveals that he would like to “publish a book on the collection of matches of matches made in Macao. My father collected labels of matchboxes from around the world - has Portugal, Spain, several countries in Europe, etc. This project depends on the time available and the interest of people”. And we stay here for collections? Maybe not: "I have hundreds too, maybe thousands of old coins - so many that is complicated ... So I won't move (laughs)."</description><pubDate>2025-05-02 06:30:08</pubDate></item><item><title>GP | Tourism finding races took place in Zhaoqing</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/21/gp-corridas-de-apuramento-de-turismo-decorreram-em-zhaoqing/</link><description>The 2025 edition of the Macao-Macau Road Sport Challenge-Macao Touring Championship-began at the Guangdong International Circuit, with 67 cars divided into two groups, A and B, disputing a total of four races over the weekend. Hong Kong riders again showed their superiority, but there were positive results among Macau pilots
 
In addition to the titles at stake, the competition organized by the Macau-China General Automobile Association (AAMC), which is divided into two events, also serves to assign the thirty-six vacancies available to the most important race of the season: the Macao Grand Prix. As such, this first journey on the circuit of the surroundings of Zhaoqing was particularly tense, with very disputed races between the Toyota Gr86 (ZN8) and the Subaru BRZ (ZD8), all equipped this year with the new DMC compound pirelli tires.
In the group it aligned three well -known pilots of the Lusophone community: Rui Valente, Célio Alves Dias and Maximiano Mannão. However, a less achieved qualification left the three in the final part of the starting grid, forcing them to redoubled work in the first race, played on Saturday afternoon. This same race was eventually interrupted with a red flag a few turns from the end, due to an oil stroke on the track. Damon Chan, winner of the competition in 2024, triumphed, followed by Lo Pak Yu and Chan Ka Ping, in a podium entirely composed of Hong Kong pilots. The experienced Rui Valente starred in an excellent recovery race, rising from 29th to 14th position. Maximiano Mannão won three places and finished 22nd, while Célio Alves Dias climbed eight positions, ending at 25th.
In the second race, Rui Valente again printed a strong progress, spinning 5th, but the degradation of the tires prevented him from maintaining the position, ending in 7th. With a scoring system that privileges the top ten classifieds, this result may be decisive for their qualification for the Great Award. In his weekend debuts to the commands of a Maximian Maão Tourism car, whose Toyota boasts the colors and the logo of the historic Macau Racing Team, ended in 15th. Célio Alves Dias, on a complicated weekend, was only 23rd and knows that there is a lot to do if you want to qualify next month. The victory was up to Lo Pak Yu, pressured closely by Wong Chuk Pan and Leong Keng Hei. The best representative in the territory was Lou Check In with a 4th place.
MSAR VICTORY AND TOP-10 to Badaraco
Group B races were also marked by uncertainty and great animation inside the track. Chung Kwok Hei, winner in 2023, led the race until a hole forced him to leave. Cheng Kin Sang, representative of MSAR, took the opportunity and took the lead. Bayern Yip Wai Hei has released several attacks, all effectively defended by Cheng. However, an apparent accident on the main line, near the end, caused a new red flag interruption. Cheng Kin Sang won, ending ahead of Bayern Yip and Lam Tou.
In the second race, Bayern Yip exceeded Cheng Kin Sang on the second round and took command. Despite Safety Car's entrance twice, Bayern Yip kept his calm and secured the victory, winning a first and second place in the weekend. Rao Long, who left the eighth position, showed excellent pace and climbed to the 2nd place in the last two laps. Cheng Kin Sang concluded in 3rd place, adding two podiums on the opening day.
Jerónimo Badaraco, the last winner of the ACP Cup, in 1999, had a discreet beginning, ending in 19th Saturday's race. On Sunday, “Noni” showed that he still has a lot to give local motorsport, reaching a precious 10th place. Already Dionísio Albino Pereira completed the first race in 29th position and did not aligned in the second.
The next, final and decisive journey is scheduled for May 16-18, again at the Guangdong International Circuit.</description><pubDate>2025-04-21 23:40:23</pubDate></item><item><title>Fit F4 World Cup will be in Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/09/primeira-taca-do-mundo-de-f4-sera-em-macau/</link><description>The International Automobile Federation (FIA), announced on Wednesday afternoon that the 2025 Macao Grand Prix will feature its program with the first edition of the Formula 4 World Cup.
The World Motorial Council approved by electronic vote the creation of this Formula 4 World Cup in Macao, along with the return to the Territory of the Regional Formula World Cup, which in 2023 came to occupy the place of Formula 3, and the FIA ​​GT World Cup.
The concept of Formula 4 has been introduced by the FIA ​​for over a decade and has been one of the biggest success stories of motorized training sport, currently there are 13 different national championships within the technical and sports framework of the FIA. This will be the fourth time the discipline runs in Macao, having been a regular presence from 2020 to 2023, and was even “head of poster” in the three years the world was immersed in the pandemic.
The FIA ​​did not say how the pilots will be chosen, just referring in a statement that there will be "a rigorous selection process of pilots, with only the most talented young people to be authorized to compete." The International Federation also stressed that the Chinese company “Mintimes, organizer of the F4 Chinese Championship, will be the Single Operator, along with FFSA (Fédération Française du Sport Automobile), responsible for providing technical support to the F4 F4 World Cup”. This means that all competitors will have to use Mygale M21-F4 singleolugar, recently renamed Ligier JS F422.
Paris support
The chairman of the FIA ​​monoligae commission, the Italian Emanuele Pirro, said that “Macau is an essential part of the formation of a young pilot, and we have a duty to protect his legacy and future. There is as few challenges as the Macao Grand Prix that we feel that it was the right time to introduce the F4 Fia World Cup. From F4, which is a little more permissive than a regional formula car, so that when they return to a year or two to the FR world cup, they are prepared to truly show what they are capable. ”
Emanuele Pirro, a former guide race vender and a MSAR test enthusiast, also said that "we are also working hard to ensure that we take this opportunity to inspire and educate young Karting riders in the region. The growth and development potential in China and the Asia Pacific region is huge as we boost participating in motorized sport."
Thinking about Macau
The FIA ​​long statement also states that this initiative “also aims to bring students from Karting de Macao, China and the region in general to watch the event in an observational manner, offering them the opportunity to experience a racing test and to obtain valuable knowledge for the next steps in their careers”.
Without going into details, the international federation, which did not allow it to decline on the participation of Chinese teams in the regional formula Cup last year, says that “this big step will benefit undoubtedly local Macao pilots, which will have access to a complete range of international events - Karting, Formula 4 and Regional Formula - on national soil”.
In a statement of Chong Coc Veng, president of the Macao-China General Automobile Association, he said: “We are happy to see FIA ​​hold a F4 World Cup at the Guide Circuit in Macao, which represents an opportunity for young people in the region to find their way of development from international Karting events to F4 and FR singleoligles, and become world champions in the future.”
The participation of MSar pilots in this race has not yet been officially disclosed, but may be limited in number.</description><pubDate>2025-05-09 00:41:31</pubDate></item><item><title>ESPORTS | First Fia Girls on Track Esports Cup Decided in Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/06/esports-primeira-taca-fia-girls-on-track-esports-decidida-em-macau/</link><description>Next June, for the first time in its history, Macau will host the Extraordinary General Meetings and the Conference of the International Automobile Federation (FIA). This event, which will take place at Galaxy International Convention Center, from 10 to 13 June, will be complemented with extra activity: the first edition of the “Fia Girls on Track Esports Cup”
 
The worldwide body that governs motorized sport has announced this new competition of Sim Racing, which is being organized in partnership with the Advanced Simracing Race Simulation Cockpits and the popular SIM Racing Iracing game, will be directed to 16 or older female elements, regardless of the ESports previous experience. To apply, participants must register on the FIA ​​official website. In addition, it is necessary to have an active account in Iracing to compete.
Online qualifications for the competition, whose finals will be held at MSAR, have already started officially. The first phase consists of participants trying to record the fastest return on Iracing's Attack team. This online qualification phase ends on May 6th. After this first stage, the top 10 classifieds will be invited to participate in the Grande Final, which will take place at the Week of Extraordinary General Meetings and the 2025 FIA Conference, scheduled from June 10 to 13. In Macao, participants will compete in a several day -to -day face -to -face final, where the first champion of the “Fia Girls on Track Esports Cup” will be crowned.
"We know that eSports are the future, but for this discipline to grow and truly develop, we need to encourage more girls and women to get involved," said Ciscal Niroshan Pereira, the current chairman of the FIA ​​eSports committee. “We hope this competition will serve as a catalyst, encouraging aspiring pilot to experience our discipline and consider a career in motorized sport.”
According to FIA, the 10 finalists will also have access to a training program on how to deal with social communication and networking opportunities, gaining a valuable view of the motor sport industry.
Grow on all fronts
This is the first time the fia girls on track initiative has been involved in a eSports competition. His best known project was probably the Fia Girls On Track-Rising Stars program, an initiative aimed at promoting car sports with the female audience aged 13 and 18, and supported young women's pilots between 2020 and 2023. It is recalled that only 1.5 percent of the total sports licenses are women.
Burcu çetinkaya, the president of the FIA ​​Women in Motorsport committee, said that “FIA is committed to double participating in motorized sports and creating more opportunities for women and girls. Electronic sports allow us to reach more vast and younger audiences-especially those with discovering or with limited access to traditional motorized sports. The winner - at the event in Macau. ”
FIA's decision to launch a eSports competition exclusively for women also reinforces the body's bet on the digital landscape. Electronic sports are an increasingly important part of the FIA ​​base development program.
Last year, the Federation added an Appendix of ESPORTS (Appendix E) to the International Sports Code, allowing national sports authorities to regulate and manage national and international competitions. The FIA ​​also supported numerous regional eSports events, received a record number of 117 eSports participants in the Motorsport Games and further encouraged adhesion by offering 12 -month subscriptions from IRACING to member clubs.</description><pubDate>2025-05-06 00:31:27</pubDate></item><item><title>Table Tennis | Jieni Shao eliminated in the group phase of the World Cup</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/17/tenis-de-mesa-jieni-shao-eliminada-na-fase-de-grupos-da-taca-do-mundo/</link><description>The Portuguese Jieni Shao was eliminated yesterday from the Table Tennis World Cup in Macao, losing with Chinese Wang Yidi, the third of the world ranking, in the last game of the group stage.
The two players came to the last match to need a victory to be first in Group 3, the only position that guaranteed the passage to the qualifiers. This after, on Tuesday, the favorite Wang was surprised by the 39-year-old French veteran Yuan Jia Nan, who won three partials to one.
On Monday, at the premiere of the competition, Shao, current 52nd of the world ranking and the only Portuguese representative in the tournament, had tied two partials with Yuan, 44th in the world. In addition to winning the meeting, which lasted 27 minutes, for four partials to zero, the third in the world secured access to the qualifiers.
The World Cup will take place until Doming in Macao for the second year in a row, after a four-year break due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The tournament will distribute total awards worth one million dollars. The competition has 48 players in each of the categories, male and female, including the ranking number one, the Chinese Lin Shidong, and the world champion, also the Chinese Sun Yingsha.</description><pubDate>2025-04-17 00:53:34</pubDate></item><item><title>GP | Touring cars finding begins with greater presence Macaense</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/16/gp-apuramento-dos-carros-de-turismo-comeca-com-maior-presenca-macaense/</link><description>The Macao-Macao Road Sport Challenge Touring Car Championship will start this weekend at the Guangdong International Circuit in the city of Zhaoqing, 200 kilometers northwest of the ride. For this race, which will serve as qualification for the 72nd Macao Grand Prix, will be on the starting grid a dozen Macau pilots, including five Portuguese names
 
Among the sixty subscribers, all equipped with two types of vehicles - Toyota GR86 (ZN8) or Subaru BRZ (ZD8) - are well -known guys from Macau's motor racing. With the same enthusiasm recognized for decades, Rui Valente will again drive a Subaru BRZ, the same car with which he competed in the Guide Circuit in November last year. Premium Racing Team driver had, in the last Macao Grand Prix, one of the fastest in terms of tip speed in the platoon of his race. Therefore, the focus on pre-season has been in other technical aspects of the car that go beyond the engine.
Also back is Célio Alves Dias, after a difficult year in 2024, far short of his expectations. For this, the pilot Macaense bet on changing the chassis of his Toyota Gr86. This year, its objective is to account for the twenty -fifth participation in the largest annual sports event of MSAR, so all the details are important.
Back is also Jerónimo Badaraco (Toyota Gr86), a pilot who, in the Macao Grand Prix last year, reached second place at Macao Road Sport Challenge. After having been modest in the finding events, “Noni” was very strong in the city streets, where he was the best Macaense pilot, in a race won by law Kit Meng.
In debut this year will be Maximian Mannão. Bringing with him a nickname with a huge tradition in Macao's motorsport, the young Maximiano, who competed for several years in the local Karting events and, in 2022, participated in a Formula 4 Chinese Championship race, will make his debut at Macau Road Sport Challenge with a Toyota GR86.
The Macanese presence will be reinforced by Dionísio Albino Pereira, a pilot regularly seen in the coloane Karting events, which will conduct a Toyota GR86 from LW World Racing Team. In 2013, he competed in the Macao - Macau Touring Car Series Tourism Championship, then driving a Honda Integra DC5 from the Pas Macau Racing Team team.
The representation of the territory in these findings will also feature Chi Wang, Carson Tang, IP Tok Meng, Chan Chi Ha, Lo Kai Tin and Lou Check In.
It will be to hurt
In 2024, the Macao-China General Automotive Association (AAMC) was able to place all the drivers of the Macau Tourism Championship in the end of the Grand Prix. This year, it seems that the scenario of organizing two races for local pilots will be impossible. As such, these qualifying races will have a much higher impact, and only half of those now registered will have entry ticket for the largest annual sports event of MSAR.
Another novelty for this year is that all cars will be equipped with tires of the Italian brand Pirelli, as had already happened in the Grand Prix. However, this year there will be a new compound, the same for everyone, which may shuffle the favorite accounts. Centralins will continue to be drawn, as in the past.
Since the number of participants is high, AAMC will divide the pilots into groups A and B, not two but four races in total. Each race will have 15 laps, two of which will be played on Saturday and two on Sunday.</description><pubDate /></item></channel></rss>
