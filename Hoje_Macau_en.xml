In addition, about 153,000 people visited the facilities placed in four points of the city
 
The popularity of Pop Mart toys was used by the Macao government to stimulate tourism in the region. In the first phase of the “Pop Mart Macao Citywalk” project, which took place between June 6 and 28, “520,000 users of the six electronic wallets involved participated in 520,000 automatic draws generated by commercial transactions in a total of 680 million Patacas,” said the Board of Tourism Services (STD).

The closing of supermarkets in Macao is not a sign of a major economic crisis, but of a necessary trade adjustment by the brands. Who says it is IP Sio Man, president of the commercial agency Vang Kei Hong, who yesterday in a public event said that the recent closure of these commercial spaces was just a "strategic adjustment" by the companies.
“Firstly, when we talk about closing we realize that these are individual cases. Then we have a large proportion of supermarkets [by number of inhabitants in Macao]. There are supermarket chains that are adjusting because they opened on the wrong places and simply closed and changed to other zones.”
The official, who spoke to journalists on the sidelines of the company's 50th anniversary, said the market has changed and that there are some economic sectors that are reducing the number of spaces, not just supermarkets.
"Macao has about 680,000 inhabitants, but about 100,000 people do not usually live in the territory. The [supermarkets] number is too excessive, and the situation is similar in markets," he said. Vang Kei Hong provides foods and goods to retailers, restaurants, hotels and resorts.
Its president also set the example of banks, who are closing branches. In your opinion, this does not mean a scenario of economic retreat, but simply a strategy change, given that there are more and more online services that customers can enjoy.
Neighborhoods suffer
Asked about the panorama of the economy in the relationship with the social sector in the first half, IP Sio Man argued that the results are varied, with tourism to record a breakthrough. However, he said that traders in community neighborhoods, where there is less tourism, continue to suffer from the lack of customers.
For this reason, IP Sio Man argues that Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) themselves have to change their commercial strategy. The businessman believes that in the second half of this year, the business environment can improve, as Hong Kong has revealed prosperous growth, and Macau has also had a larger number of tourists.
IP SIO MAN, therefore, indicated that SMEs have to focus on ways to attract tourists consumption. "I don't think it's a matter that tourists don't want to spend money. They just consume products that guarantee them the best cost-benefit ratio," he added.
One of the examples referred to by the entrepreneur is the bitter tea brand in the interior of China Wanglaoji, which registered an increase in sales to about 30 containers, while in previous years sales were only one digit.</description><pubDate>2025-07-03 23:28:05</pubDate></item><item><title>Elections | At least 32 crimes oblige to serve a prison sentence</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/03/eleicoes-pelo-menos-32-crimes-obrigam-a-cumprir-pena-de-prisao/</link><description>The electoral law requires the application of effective arrest penalties that may vary between one month and more than 10 years. One of the cases in which convicts even need to spend time in Coloane's prison is the crime of public incentive to abstention, blank vote or null vote
 
The law provides for at least 32 crimes that always oblige to serve a prison sentence. One of these crimes is the public incentive to abstention, blank vote or null vote, which causes a penalty ranging from one month to three years.
According to the general rules of the Penal Code, when someone is convicted of committing a crime there is a possibility that the penalty is suspended for a period from one year to five years. In order for the penalty to be suspended, the law determines that the conviction cannot exceed three years in prison. This period is also time usually considered as a reference for the definition of small crime or a crime that is not serious.
However, the electoral law, through article 147, abdicates the regime of suspension of prison penalties, which means that the convicts, under normal conditions, will always spend at least one month in Coloane's prison establishment.
The law divides the crime in which it abdicates the suspension of penalty into “crimes related to the organization of the electoral process”, “crimes related to the electoral campaign” and “crimes related to suffrage and investigation”.
The list of crimes related to the organization of the electoral process includes six offenses and in at least five of them the application of a prison sentence is mandatory, as with the person who accepts to be recognized as a candidate when he does not gather the legal conditions, or when the coercion or fraudulent devices are resorted to condition the will to participate, or not, in an application committee, in the designation of the vote in the staff and the decision of the decision A person is a candidate, or not, to the elections.
Election campaign
One of the most controversial questions in the elections is the election campaign period and the ban on campaign activities before the legal period, which this year starts on August 30 and extends until September 12.
Earlier this week, the chairman of the Legislative Assembly Electoral Affairs Committee (Caeal), Seng Ioi Man, warned that despite not being received complaints about illicit, the authorities are attentive to potential infringements.
The law provides for seven campaign -related crimes, but most, four in seven, admits the application of a penalty of a fine, so that the prison sentence will not always be applicable.
However, in case there is fraudulent deviation correspondence from Caeal, slanderous denunciation of the crimes provided for in this law or electoral propaganda less than 100 meters from the vote assemblies, punishment always undergoes prison for periods ranging from one month to eight years.
Broader crimes
It is in the section of “crimes related to suffrage and determination” that the law has the largest number of illicit situations, with a total of 23 crimes.
Among the 23 illicit, in four is allowed to apply a penalty of fine, in addition to prison sentence, but only in certain circumstances. In most crimes planned, 18, it is always mandatory to apply a prison sentence that varies between one month and about 10 years and 8 months, depending on the crime committed.
Some of these crimes are specific and aim at security forces, as with forced entry at voting assemblies, and voting meeting for fraud at the time of counting the votes.
However, there are also crimes that can be committed by any citizen. It is in this category that is the public incentive to abstention, blank or null vote, which causes a penalty ranging from one month to three years in prison. The same can happen when, within the scope of work, someone threatens a worker with a professional sanction for the coercion targeted to reveal his sense of vote, or vote based on this coercion.</description><pubDate>2025-07-03 23:25:51</pubDate></item><item><title>Checks | Nick Lei calls for postponement of changes for one year</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/03/cheques-nick-lei-pede-adiamento-de-alteracoes-por-um-ano/</link><description>The deputy linked to the community of Fujian finds it unfair that the imposition of staying 183 days in Macao to receive the pecuniary check was implemented in relation to 2024, giving no opportunity to residents who live out to fulfill the obligation. Nick Lei argues that it is possible to verify the days of stay in the territory in the single account
 
Deputy Nick Lei thinks that the changes to the requirements of assignment of the pecuniary reimbursement plan in economic development, known as a pecuniary check, were hasty, harming the beneficiaries. "The measures were implemented too hurriedly and the imperfect application brought many inconveniences and obstacles to the residents," said the legislator in a written interpretation, adding that when the news was released "triggered discussions and social controversy."
The number two on the list of the Fujian parliamentary bench in the next September 14 legislatures suggested to the government that it “fully consider the impact and inconvenience” of measures or policy adjustments, “taking into account the real needs of residents”.
The deputy cites complaints of residents who criticized the hasty form as the changes were applied, which will take into account of the days past in Macau last year, "which makes many residents of Macao who live abroad to choose to be in Macau according to their personal will." Therefore, Nick Lei asks the Executive to Sam Hou Fai to consider postponing one year the implementation of the new measures to assign the cash check.
Lifelong
The deputy also suggests to the government to add functionality to the mobile application single account, allowing residents to verify the number of days of stay in Macau. Nick Law currently stresses, this registration can only be "processed at service posts or self-service kiosks."
The introduction of functionality in mobile application not only promotes administrative efficiency, but reduces treatment costs and inconvenience for residents, the deputy says.
The need to apply personally, through a third party or post documents to prove that if you are in an exception situation for those who have not spent 183 days in Macao also motivated complaints of Nick Law, who would like to see the whole process to be treated in the single account.
Despite the suggestions, the deputy points out that "it is necessary to optimize and improve the policy based on maintaining the original intention, so that public funds can be used accurately."</description><pubDate>2025-07-03 23:21:13</pubDate></item><item><title>Cape Verde | Évora family, between Macau and the rest of the world</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/03/cabo-verde-familia-evora-entre-macau-e-o-resto-do-mundo/</link><description>Tomorrow are 50 years of Cape Verde's independence, the country from which the first levada of the Évora family came out in the 1940s, towards Macao, where he won roots. Nowadays, only one member of the family remains in the territory, the cardiologist Mário Évora
 
There were once a dozen Évoras in Macao, where they arrived in the 1940s, but only Mario Évora resists, with the family repeating the migrations that mark both Cape Verde and the Macanese.
"We have been between eight and ten Évoras in Macau," Sports Medicine expert Humberto Évora told Lusa from Lisbon, where he has lived since he renovated. The maternal grandparents of Humberto (the last of the family to be born in Cape Verde) and Mário (the first to be born in Macau) arrived in the east in the late 1940s, with five of the couple's six children.
A year later, the daughter who had stayed with her husband in Cape Verde came to Macau, already with baby Humberto. The initial plan was for two years, but the couple ended up three decades and have three more children: Mario, Rui and Maria Helena.
In 1971, it was the turn of Humberto and Mário to leave to study medicine in Lisbon, but not without a great fright linked to the colonial war that had lasted a decade ago.
"As we went to the university we could postpone military inspection, but the papers did not come from Macao and we risk being considered refractory," said Humberto. The situation resolved, but Mario admitted to Lusa the fear of the mobilization. "We had this persecution, we had to go through the year not to go with the sides in the war," he explained.
“The Shock” in Lisbon
Upon arrival in Lisbon, “we were soon welcomed and integrated into the Cape Verdean student community,” said Humberto, at a time of student agitation and politics. "There were periods when it was almost daily, manifestations of students against the regime, the shock police enter the canteen inside and give some suckling," said Mario.
Humberto admitted that "it was a shock, for those who came from Macau, where there was little political culture and the colonial war was seen as a struggle against terrorists." In a summer, the young man, who was integrated into a Cape Verdean group of intervention music, left with a friend "to the overseas ride out of guitar on his back."
“I always remember the first time in France, that I saw the colonial war described on the contrary on television, the struggle for the liberation of a colonial power of occupation,” said Humberto.
Independence
When the two brothers finished the medical course, the independence of Cape Verde, on July 5, 1975, led them to the root return. "There was a movement of many of our colleagues to contribute to a new country, which was beginning to take the first steps," said Mario, then a formed cardiologist.
Also because, recalled Humberto, some of the friends of Lisbon had, however, became members of the Government of Cape Verde. "There was this possibility, but the return to Macao, a place where it had spent so long, was natural," he explained. “I was born in Cape Verde, I spent part of my life in Portugal, I grew up in Macao, I am also Macaense. I am a citizen of the world,” said Humberto.
Macanese are a Euro-Asian community, most of which Lusodescendants, with roots in Macau, although many have emigrated, due to the economic situation or fear created by the transition from Portugal Administration to China in 1999.
From the Évora brothers, Rui, engineer, left before the transition to Cape Verde, where he even worked on the project of the Hotel-Casino that Macau's businessman David Chow built on the beach, but was inaugurated.
The younger sister, Maria Helena, a documentary science expert who has even worked in the Macao Historical Archive, is currently in the City Council of Oeiras. The children “are all out” between the United Kingdom, Cape Verde and Portugal, said Mario. "Now the world is smaller and it is going where there are opportunities," he said.
Humberto also faces migrations "as a natural process, not only for Cape Verdeans, but even to the Macanese."
Nothing that has prevented the two brothers from keeping their ties with the archipelago. Humberto divides the time between Portugal and Cape Verde, and has been the official doctor of Cape Verdean sports for decades to the main international competitions.
Mario was one of the founders-and president for ten years-of the Macau-Cabo Green Friendship Association. "We had here Ildo Lobo, Tito Paris, and my cousin," said the cardiologist, before taking a break and adds, with a smile: "Cesaria Évora."</description><pubDate>2025-07-03 23:18:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Tariffs | Beijing evaluates the USA-VIETNAME Pact and promises to protect your interests</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/03/tarifas-pequim-avalia-pacto-eua-vietname-e-promete-proteger-os-seus-interesses/</link><description>The China Ministry of Commerce yesterday expressed “firm opposition to any trade agreement achieved at the expense of China's interests,” reacting to the announced pact between the United States and Vietnam, and admitted to adopting contracted.

During a meeting held on Wednesday in Brussels, with the head of European Union diplomacy, Kaja Kallas, Wang Yi argued that China and the EU “should not be seen as opponents for their differences, nor seek confrontation due to their disagreements,” according to a statement released yesterday by his ministry.
The day before, Kallas argued that Beijing should no longer threaten European security, pointing out alleged cybers, interference in democratic processes and unfair business practices. "Europe faces several challenges," said Wang Yi, adding that none of them, "in the past, present or future," was caused by China.
Alternative via
Chinese diplomacy head sought to introduce his country as a counterweight to Donald Trump's administration, which threatened to impose widespread tariffs on European imports. “The path followed by the United States should not be used as a mirror of China,” said Wang. "China is not the United States," he said.
According to the statement of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, both sides also addressed international issues such as the War in Ukraine, the Israelo-Palestinian conflict and the Iran's nuclear program.
Beijing and Brussels should act based on “mutual respect,” defended Wang Yi, appealing to a more “active and pragmatic” European policy in relation to China. Wang also met on Wednesday with the President of the European Commission, Ursula Von Der Leyen, and Belgian Foreign Minister Maxime Prevot.
Wang told both parts that China and EU should “defend multilateralism and free trade” and cooperate over global challenges such as climate change.

After buying the map, we realize the green spots that this city is filled with gardens. From Tricycle we arrived at a two -star hotel, despite the offering of the four -star accommodation, with discounts, just for some more exchanges allow us to enjoy superior quality of comfort. With the bags already in the room, it is at the reception that we learn about the existence in the city of a brush museum.
Considered the capital of brushes, because according to a saying, the huzhou brushes, the role of Xuan de Xuanzhou rice (Anhui), the paint from China de Huizhou (also in Anhui) and the Duan Stone for the Zhaoqing (Guangdong) paint, are the four treasures of Chinese painting.
Right on the trip to the hotel I could see it is the small town because, from the bus terminal, in ten minutes we are in the center, traveling half the main avenue that longitudinally divides it. Now walking, we will have a channel with terrace on the banks. It looks like a good place to in the shadow, quietly refreshing from the noon. We are in the Hebin Garden. Still sitting and then wave us with a glass and a bottle. After an affirmative gesture, they bring a glass full of green tea leaves and hot water in a thermal container, which on the table is to serve.
Soon appearances appear that for a Reminbi they remove the dust in their shoes, giving them a small polydela. Glasses quickly tormented rest and an EHRU player experiences, with amplifier sounds, captivating us to enjoy a few songs. But his little introduction to the song of “Yue Liang Wo Di Chin” (the moon represents my heart) proves to be more annoying than cultural.
Studying a busy but narrow pedestrian street where, despite the surrounding buildings, they are unmistakable from the environment, a recent dragon door gives access to the part of the city where a long time is perpetuated. Another longmen, this old and made of wood, gives the smoke temple, which will be from the same period and where the floor is arranged. Abroad, a number of antique sellers spread the articles on the floor.
We went through clothing stores and between two of these stores, a cubicle with a counter where some people expect that from the coal grill on the ember to be ready for the skewers of different pieces of meat stuck in a long toothpick. We snack on Carneiro to deceive the stomach because they start to be hours of dinner. We are walking attentive to the restaurants, which in the distance are distinguished, as marked by red round lanterns.
Hotel Avenue
It is on Hongqi Lu Street, where most hotels are found, which due to the appearance we chose the restaurant, after going through many fast food, both Chinese and the two main foreign brands. At the entrance, a part of sales abroad with a lot of demand, we refer to being in a good place. Thoughts disguise the waiting time, when they tell us to be the pre-payment restaurant and there is no list to choose the dishes. Meats already cooked are mostly barbecue and are exposed in the sales sector, behind glass.
Five in the afternoon and already with the passwords bought for the meal, chosen by the dishes of the tables of customers there for dinner. We are served to tofu soaked in soy sauce and a halted hazeln ease with meat stuffing, floating in a soup. Cheap food to serve as dinner after the job.
Smoken in flavor, we are interrupted by a corcovered beggar of a certain age that seems to ask for money. Offering what we are eating, so all the food is emptied for the bowl and not even the sauce. Faced with such hunger, found later when we saw her in the stairs to eat, we still offer you money to another meal.
Mendicity is a recent phenomenon in China, although there have always been two types of people who walk through the streets and seem beggars. Those who vague live their fate, indifferent and whose people offer them food and those who in poorer places migrate to cities. Of course there are already beggars as well.
The sound of music comes out of stores and the foreign fast food restaurant uses a powerful column where a young maid dances to the sound of children for children, waiting for them to accompany her.
We tried to prove the specialties of the land and therefore, at the Huzhou Hotel restaurant, of two stars, tasted referenced dishes as local kitchen. We were served a fish flower, fish dish that, after baking in a bittersweet sauce, is twisted with his skin to serve as a flower-shaped chalice and thus presented. But it is at the four -star Hotel Zhebei that an exquisite kitchen gives us a tofu we miss.
The price is cheaper than the previous one. This restaurant had been recommended by two young women, who were waiting for their friends and whom a maid asks for help communicating with us, when we one day we climbed to the second floor of a cooked food restaurant at the table, the vulgar Hot-Pot. Realizing that they only serve vegetables, meat or seafood, to be cooked in the heated pan over a gas nozzle in the center of the table, we get up and prepare to leave.
Requestly ask us in English the reason we leave. Then comes the two young college students in Hangzhou, who lived at the family home. Explaining this is not the food that feels like us, we took the opportunity to ask for other regional food restaurants. Since apologizing to Huzhou for not having many restaurants, they present the best and cheap price the restaurant of the Zhebei Hotel.
After a harrowing and as it is early, as in China starts dinner at five in the afternoon, we returned to the avenue and then the hotel from where we saw another, also four stars, the International Huzhou. Continuing on the same ride, we found the Tian Yun silk store. Then a brush store, where there is for all sizes and prices, reaching porcelain or bamboo cable brushes, costing thousands of yuans.
Brushes Museum
Diving into Huzhou's past, entering one of the city's most picturesque streets. A Christian church dominates the street and around, stores occupy the part under the two -story houses. By the solidoes in the heads of some people, we realize that some of the business belong to Muslims. After refusing to be photographed, a tangerine salesman offers us a delicious fruit piece. Continuing, curiosity leads us to meet the stone bridge with three arches built in 1539, with some embedded ornamental stones.
Hence and to southwest, we go to the garden of the painter and calciple Zhao Mengfu (1254-1322) Painter Museum. This was native of Wuxing (today Huzhou), named after courtesy and pseudonyms Songxue, Oubo and Shuijinggong Daoren. He was a descendant prince of the Song Dynasty, but he served the Mongols Yuan Dynasty as an official at the Hanlin Academy.
As a painter, he specializes in the representation of horses and used recreating themes and styles of the old masters, with simple colors to make the landscapes. In addition to being a master of Tang Dynasty techniques, he was an excellent Caligraph, considered one of the main four in the history of Chinese calligraphy.
Already in the garden, the serenity with which the green of the vegetation is combined in the lake with the brown of the rest pavilions, or in the woods of the tea houses, makes us there a long time, recreating figures with the reflection in the waters of the ornamental stones. We have to leave the garden to visit the Brushes Museum which, despite being encompassed in the same room, has an autonomous entrance. Huzhou brushes are referenced as the best in the country and so you have to see how they are made.
In chronological terms, the brush was invented in the late 3rd century A.N.E. By Meng Tian, ​​a military commander of the Qin Dynasty. However, it is perceived by the painted vessels of different neolithic cultures, which must have existed for at least five thousand years. Therefore, Meng Tian will be linked, not to the invention, but to the improvement of brushes. Also the city of Huzhou is not the real place of production of the best brushes, but has won this title since in ancient times Shanlian, in the municipality of Wuxing, province of Zhejiang, was over his jurisdiction. The handwriting brushes made had their heyday during the Yuan Dynasty and are still considered among the best in all of China.
Four steps are required to manufacture the HU brush, and the coat of the rabbit, the fingernail and the goat hair is used. After the fat is removed with tire juice, the hair is cut into equal sizes and enter a solution to clean them. They are then united at the base with arabic gum and after drying, united with a tile that unites them to the bamboo.
With the brush made in its structure, the other phase of the process is passed. The hair is bumped to a porridge made of algae to put them together and with the wire wrapped a tip is created, the most important part of the brush. This wire that goes through the hair, on a lap gives the cone shape and also serves to remove the excess of the agglutinator papa.
With extreme patience and skill, the brushes are clean, rounded, creating a tip, with good elasticity. Then the brush, ready, passes to the hands of another employee, where in the bamboo cable are recorded the characters Tian Kuan Trade Mark, which replaced the old “double goat” brand.
The goat hair (HAO) brushes (HAO) are soft and serve to write small characters, rabbit hair are hard and those of the fingernail are between the two, with great elasticity for the handwriting of large characters. Sometimes a mixture of different hair is made, using those of other animals.
There are brushes of all kinds of sizes, serving some to paint and others to call. The best for Chinese handwriting are the rabbit and goat hair mix. HU brushes were widely used in the imperial court.
In the other part of the museum is the painter's room Zhao Mengfu with its utensils and some works, where the recorded stones are not lacking. Although the museum has a sales section, after leaving the museum and already on the street, a set of stores is dedicated to the sale of products for Chinese painting.
Leaving the brushes, we visited the market and crossing a wooden bridge in Zig-Zag, we traveled another old part of the city. Clothing extenders hide salespeople with bags full of tea leaves finished spoon that belong to the first harvest of the year, the best.
Our stay in Huzhou also serves to visit places at an hour of bus, such as Anji, to see the Bamboo Museum and already outside Zhejiang province in Jiangsu, Dingshan, referenced as the place of production of the best tea services. The southern bank of Taihu is the border line between the Huzhou district in Zhejiang province and Jiangsu province, where Lake Tai expands.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Today Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/autor/hoje-macau/</link><description>Xu Yi, professor and researcher at the State Lunar and Planetary Science Laboratory at Macao University of Science and Technology (UCTM), first participated as a member of the Chinese delegation of the United Nations Committee (UN) for the outside space.

One of his neighbor and painter named Sheng Mao (1313-1362), by Lin'an (current Hangzhou), who had moved to Jiaxing, living as a professional of this art, always had in mind the ideal of literate painters. In two paintings in the British museum that are attributed to him he is a servant in the middle of the forest, carrying a book in his hand (vertical roll, 99.6 x 29.2 cm) paint), in another a literate with his hands hidden by the cold walking in a snow-covered bridge towards a pavilion.
The name given to the painting is: reading, alumiassed in the reflection of the snow. Together, the title and the two paintings seem to allude to a story referred to by Liu Yiqing (403-444) in Shishuo Xinyu, "new account of the legends of the world", about the historical figure of Sun Sheng (c.302-373) that from the most tender childhood to old age was always seen with a book in hand and so poor that at night, the reflection of the reflection of the winter. Moonlight over the snow to illuminate your reading.
An example of persistence of the desire to know certainly appreciated by literati, but also remarkably by an Emperor of the Yuan Dynasty who reigned twice, named Tugh Temur (1304-1332) known as Wenzong. And that, being a foreign, cultivated the arts, customs and traditions. From their efforts to impose local culture on the Mongoral rulers, the creation of Kuizhang Ge would be highlighted in the spring of 1329, the “Star of Literature Pavilion Academy”, which among other activities such as the compilation of classical texts also appointed literati capable of recognizing, studying and commenting on works of art. Some were painters, like a literate from Zhejiang.
Ke Jiusi (1290-1343) was one of those scholars (Boshi) of the Kuizhang Pavilion of which today can be read the comments on paintings and caligraffes of ancient masters such as Jing Hao (c.855-915) or Jiang Shen (c.1090-1138). In their own paintings, intuition in the composition of the landscape is notorious, which you see an example in the Mustard Garden Manual.
Or in a vertical roll where two high -sided Bambus stems painted for the 'hidden virtue pavilion' (Qingbige, paper on paper, 58.5 x 132.8 cm at the Palace Museum in Beijing). In these two rods that grow along with solid stones and when climbing cross, and in which he applied the rigor of the discipline of handwriting, he will have mirrored the will of the court to follow the great lonely masters like Wu Zhen.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>WHO | Study reveals that one in six people in the world feels</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/01/oms-estudo-revela-que-uma-em-cada-seis-pessoas-no-mundo-sente-se-so/</link><description>A World Health Organization report states that loneliness is a growing problem. Based on a study conducted between 2014 and 2023, the document concluded that one in six people in the world feel alone, with emphasis on young people from 13 to 29 years old. The Southeast Asian region has, however, less problematic values
 
More and more is spoken of the devastating impact of loneliness as a potentializing cause of diseases. This time, a report from the World Health Organization (WHO), released on Monday and carried out by the Social Connection Commission, brings data on the problem, concluding that one in six people say he feels alone, a state that is not synonymous with being alone.
Moreover, the problem is greater in younger ones, because one in five says it feels alone, which shows that one fifth of the world's population between 13 and 29 years old says it feels loneliness.
The study, entitled “From Solitude to Social Connection - tracing a path to healthier societies: WHO Commission on Social Connection Commission”, focuses on 2013 and 2024, thus encompassing the pandemic, a period when most of the world populations faced confinement periods, some of them alone in their dwellings. The study was sent to journalists from 194 WHO member countries, and the data were dealt with in line with other works already done on the subject and with the support of experts from around the world, including from China. Bin Yu, from the Medical College Tianjin University, was one of the project participants.
The report points out that between 2014 and 2023 "it is estimated that 16 percent of people around the world-one in six-felt loneliness," something that "affects all ages and regions." However, it is a “more common feeling among adolescents and young adults”, with a rate of 20.9 percent of young people between 13 and 17 years old, while the rate reduces slightly to 17.4 percent in the case of young adults from 18 to 29 years.
The feeling of loneliness "decreases with age", and is also "more common in low-income countries, where almost one in four people (24 percent) claimed to feel lonely."
The WHO study also points out that “the highest rates are in the WHO African region”, with 24 percent; Following the regions of the eastern Mediterranean (21 percent), and in Southeast Asia this feeling is less felt by respondents, registering only 18 percent.
"The European region has the lowest rate, with about ten percent," says WHO, which distinguishes loneliness of social isolation. In this field, “data is more limited”, but the isolation of the elderly stands out. "Estimates suggest that 25-34 percent of the elderly are socially isolated," it is data on the years between 1990 and 2022.
When it comes to adulthood, from 30 to 59 years, the percentage of people who feel only low to 15.1 percent, and in people 60 years or older, with 11.8 percent.
Regarding gender, “estimated rates of loneliness in women and men are similar (16.1 and 15.4 percent, respectively), with the highest estimated differences between adolescents (24.3 percent between women and 17.2 percent between men) and the elderly (13 percent between women and 9.9 percent among men)”.
Who else feels
The report states that nowadays “social disconnection is widespread in all regions and in all age groups”, with consequences that are “serious and underestimated, affecting mortality, physical and mental health, well-being, education, economy and society in general”. "Its widespread occurrence and its serious consequences make it a serious issue of global public health," it is mentioned.
And who feels more alone? The WHO highlights “marginalized groups”, namely “people with disabilities, lesbians, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex, queer (or sometimes in question) and other individuals (LGBTIQ+) and migrants”. These people “are more likely to feel loneliness and isolation than other groups”, making it the caveat that “previous data are too limited to determine whether social isolation and solitude rates have increased or decreased”.
In the case of disabled people, scenarios persist such as being unable to “access social facilities and take advantage of opportunities due to physical barriers in buildings, limited access to transportation and lack of affordable information and communication, while others face structural stigma that limits their job opportunities or other sociocultural barriers that lead to lower level of education, less stable relationships and more precarious housing conditions”.
"Many factors" are identified that lead people to feel alone, namely "modernization, industrialization and technological changes", and may be "responsible for what, often, it is presumed to be an increase in social isolation and loneliness, but most remain without proof."
"We know that certain factors increase the risk of individuals suffering from social disconnection. These include poor physical or mental health (especially depression), personality traits such as neuroticism, not having a partner or being single, living alone and characteristics of the built environment, such as poor access to public transport. The impact of digital technology is not yet clear, but experts recommend caution, especially to protect the mental health and well-being of young people." study.
The WHO highlights, throughout the text, how it is difficult to quantify feelings of loneliness, being relatively recent this type of definitions and, above all, differentiation between the feeling of feeling alone and being effectively only. The report includes testimonies from people from various countries and cultures that describe that, even though they are with a partner or friends, they feel alone in a scenario caused by many factors.
In the case of young people, "the realization of high loneliness rates between adolescents is consistent with the results of previous research, although the result may be subject to both developmental and methodological considerations."
“As loneliness results from a perceived discrepancy between real and desired or expected social connections, the highest rate in adolescence can be due to higher expectations of social connections during the development phase, which is marked by significant emotional and psychological changes. The elderly report comparatively greater satisfaction with their social relations. According to these estimates, the elderly have the lowest loneliness rates, which contradicts previous studies that enhanced the elderly as the age range with some of the highest rates. This may be due to the limited availability and quality of the previous data on the elderly, ”is explained.
The study highlights, however, that it is “possible that the prevalence of loneliness is greater among adults over 80 or older”, which is a “consistent conclusion with previous studies, in which there was a distribution in the form of 'U' of loneliness among older adults”.
More than 800 thousand deaths
We are in an era where so -called social health is at risk, being considered by WHO as "a vital but often neglected, health, as essential as physical and mental health."
"Social relations can reduce the risk of disease, increase life expectancy and strengthen the fabric of communities and society. Social relations improve life, giving us meaning and a feeling of belonging," it is also read, being mentioned that today loneliness affects one in six people worldwide and causes "about 871,000 deaths annually (2014-2019)".
"New estimates suggest that loneliness alone may be responsible for about 871,000 deaths a year. The economic cost of these comprehensive impacts on society is just starting to be understood. Estimates suggest substantial costs for employers, health systems and individuals. Stronger social connections provide important protection in health, social and economic domains," he reads.
The report points out that many of these issues only now begin to be perceived and analyzed. "This has probably been happening for years, but the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the growing concern for digital technology has brought more attention to the issue, including governments," he is explained.
The WHO also points to a correlation between poverty or low income and the feeling of loneliness.
"In general, the lower the performance group in a country, the higher the loneliness rate. It is estimated that low-yielding countries have the higher (24.3 percent), followed by the medium-low yield countries (19.3 percent), medium-high performance countries (12.1 percent) and high-performance countries (10.6 percent)," can be read.
Despite some worrying scenarios, WHO leaves some suggestions and even says that "there is hope" to get around the problem. "There are effective strategies for promoting social connection and these must be expanded," for example, by the "regular monitoring of the prevalence of social connection, social isolation and solitude at the global, regional and national level." This monitoring should be viewed as "a high priority", allowing "to track progress and measure the impact of strategies to deal with the issue."
It is also suggested the “international development and adoption of reliable measuring instruments, interculturally valid for social connection, social isolation and loneliness”, and as a priority ”should be viewed the creation“ of an instrument to measure social connection, as conceived in this report: in the three dimensions of structure, function and quality ”.
The study was based on reference documents on global and regional estimates of the prevalence of loneliness and mortality due to loneliness, “the first of this type”; a global review of political documents; Network mapping and analysis, the inclusion of 64 experiences experienced by people in relation to social connection, social isolation and loneliness, as well as “high quality evidence, prioritizing systematic revisions, meta-analysis and large-scale multinational studies”, without forgetting the experience of the WHO technical advisory group itself, “composed of 20 renowned global experts”.</description><pubDate>2025-07-01 23:24:44</pubDate></item><item><title>China-Portuguese | Chengdu Pavilion shows Portuguese products</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/26/china-portugal-pavilhao-em-chengdu-mostra-produtos-portugueses/</link><description>In the Euro-Asia National Commodity Pavillion venture in Chengdu, pavilions for foreign countries and entrepreneurs who want to establish business in China are installed. Portugal is also there, represented by the Portugal Pavilion, but according to manager Ângelo Sousa, there is a lack of support from the Portuguese government and strength to combat competition
 
“For us there are no barriers between Portugal and China. We are 365 days here and there.” This is the way the objectives of the team that is behind the Portugal Pavilion present at the Euro-Asia National Commodity Pavillion are presented in Chengdu and which is managed by two partners: Yinhui Tui and Ângelo Freitas de Sousa.
The two realized that the Shanghai zone had reached a saturation point in the trade of products and that it was necessary to go more to the interior of the country to try to sell things as Portuguese as wine, cod or olive oil.
HM talked to Yinhui Tui about this project on the fringes of a lunch in Lisbon by the Friends of the New Seda Route Association, chaired by Fernanda Ilhéu. The event served precisely for Yinhui Tui to present the objectives of the Portugal Pavilion and try to capture business interests.
“This is a very important market for Portuguese products. In China we have separated the country [in commercial terms] in four markets. We have the region of Beijing and Shanghai, which we call 'Yangtze River Economic Zone', and 'Pearl River Economic Zone'. The fourth zone is composed by the cities of Chengdu and Chongqing and which is a new economic area established in 2020. Portuguese have a lot of potential in these markets, ”he said.
The entrepreneur recalls that the marketing of Portuguese products is still below the one that is done by French, Spanish or other countries, but when the Chinese buyer discovers wine or olive oil, he is surprised.
"In Shanghai, for example, some customers already have their opinion on French or Australians. But many think that Portuguese products have more quality," said Yinhui Tui, noting that in the area where the Portugal Pavilion operates in Sichuan province, "people are a little more conservative and prefer to try, prove and feel before buying."
"Our pavilion is next to the French pavilion and we often see customers opt for French wine. But when they go through our pavilion, they see our brands and ask what we have. When they realize that we have cheaper wine compared to French, they are surprised and say it is better, and then buy."
This responsible explains that the population in the fourth economic zone is 130 million people, much more than the number of people living in the Iberian Peninsula. "Then I think it's a market with a lot of potential," he said.
The Role of Lusosino
Yinhui Tui and Ângelo Freitas de Sousa created Lusosino that it acts as the managing entity of the pavilion, which was born “with the intention of promoting Portuguese products in the Great Market of China”. Thus, there is a “showroom” of very Portuguese products, representing some brands known as is the case of Vieira crackers, Esporão wine, Sal Marnoto, the Prisca jams or Vista Alegre, among others. It is in this pavilion that "exhibitors display the best products, buyers discover trends and where they both find the conditions to realize business." Moreover, Lusosino, through this pavilion, helps Portuguese entrepreneurs in marketing campaigns and in the best way to contact potential Chinese customers.
Specifically, Lusosino promises to perform “producer and brands records, commercial representation, market analysis, market support and preparation, among other services”, reads on the website.
However, and according to Ângelo Freitas de Sousa to HM, there are many obstacles to putting Portuguese products in China. “[The Chengdu and Chongqing zone] has the advantage of being a growing market that is not overloaded with exporters and has no addictions as happens in the Shanghai zone. It is a very large market and where there are many producers.” By addictions, the entrepreneur refers to “competition” from other countries and buying habits of Chinese customers, who are faster looking for products from other nationalities than from Portugal. "There are habits of certain brands that are implemented and people don't even look at others or experience them."
The Portuguese Pavilion project began with an idea of ​​Ângelo Ferreira de Sousa, who has a Chinese wife who helps him in the business. “I met Yinhui Tui, he liked Portuguese products, we were friends and then we ended up joining energy,” he said, explaining that the interior of the country is still knowing foreign products, not just Portuguese.
"The Shanghai zone has nowhere to grow and this is a growing economic zone. There are many factories that are moving to Chengdu, so there will be more development," he said.
Absence of marketing
The Portuguese entrepreneur regrets that the Portuguese authorities have given little support to the project, except for any follow -up by AICEP - Agency for Investment and Foreign Trade of Portugal.
"All the investment was made by us and we have not had a lot of support. We had some help from AICEP, but nothing special. We do fairs, the showrooms, to prove and know our products in major cities," said Angelo Ferreira de Sousa.
The entrepreneur also regrets that, despite the list of hundreds of years between Portugal and China, there is still flaws in the commercial strategy for the export of Portuguese products in the country. "The Spaniards are much further ahead than us," he said.
Regarding the role of Macao as a platform, the entrepreneur says it is equally difficult to bring products from Portugal to China or Macau to China, due to lack of customs agreements and little flexibility.
"It is not because we call Macau that I can, for example, putting sausages, cod or preserves in China, or other Portuguese products. To pass from Portugal to Macau is easy, but it is no longer so easy to take after Portuguese products from Macau to China. We have not been able to do much through Macau, but we have not sought much," he said.
At the presentation in Lisbon, Yinhui Tui advanced some figures behind the construction of the Euro-Asia National Commodity Pavillion, and help to understand their size: about 70 billion euros of investment and a space of 300,000 cubic meters. The Portugal Pavilion does not only do contact sessions or fairs: if a businessman wants to leave tons of products there, he can do so. Then the pavilion is in charge of distribution through several areas of China. “In the southern market, closer to Macao, there is a lot of competition in some areas, so it should be betting inside China,” said Yinhui Tui, referring to the potential and factor novelty that exists in some areas of the country regarding commerce.</description><pubDate>2025-06-26 00:50:24</pubDate></item><item><title>Coloane | Filipe Afonso launches work that highlights the importance of staff houses</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/24/coloane-filipe-afonso-lanca-obra-que-destaca-importancia-de-casas-de-palafitas/</link><description>The latest book by Filipe Afonso, coordinator of the Architecture course at the University of São José, looks at a housing model at risk of disappearing, but can be seen in Coloane, or in old fishing zones of Hong Kong. “Coloane Grammar” presents alternative solutions for the reuse of these houses and their classification as a heritage
 
Taking the idea of ​​grammar that names the book, what are the main terms or concepts around Coloane, its tradition and preservation that can enumerate?
The “grammar” of the book introduces the concept of vernacular architecture, which reflects the knowledge of the informal, local construction and the maritime identity of this Coloane community. It addresses the assets at risk, proposing a method of cataloging existing houses, this digital method, which establishes a dialogue between tradition and modernity to preserve this cultural landscape.
What concrete proposals are suggested in the book for the protection and preservation of Coloane's stilts?
The book proposes (indirectly) the classification of stilts as a heritage to give them legal protection. By cataloging existing stilts, the book contributes to preserving the memory of this type of architecture and a broader discussion about its possible protection.
How could we reuse the stilts taking into account these specific ways of life and the economic diversification that the government wants to achieve?
The stilts could be reused for experience tourism, or centers of cultural interpretation, valuing local history. They can be transformed into creative and artistic spaces or in fact propose new wood buildings along the water line, with various uses and that can generate value to the Coloane community, contributing to Macao's cultural and economic diversification.
Why approach Coloane and the stilts? How did this project come about?
Coloane and the stilts were approached by their architectural and cultural uniqueness, representing a threatened memory and identity of Macao. This assets at risk has a significant potential. The project also emerged from the gap of scientific knowledge about these structures and the urgent need for documentation, consolidating itself as an academic-scientific investigation.
In the Asian or Southeast Asian context, are the coloane stilts or not unique in architectural terms?
Water constructions are common in various Asian countries, Coloane's stilts are not a unique case in terms of existence. See the example, in Hong Kong, of the well-known Tai o village, but are unique in their specific context. Its architecture is the reflection of local regional influences and materials, adapted to the history of the evolution of Colona's fishing community and the development of Macao. Its value lies in its particular architectural language and its persistence in a rapidly transformed urban environment.
What is the story behind the emergence of stilts? Are you associated with Coloane piracy reports, for example, which refer to the early twentieth century?
The stilts emerged as a practical and functional solution to the sea -related way of life, allowing sea access, tidal protection and efficient use of space in coastal areas. Piracy reports in Coloane were not the direct cause of their emergence. Shapes are essentially the response of an informal architecture of local communities to adapt to the maritime environment.
Museum Idea on Coloane Stop Stand since 2017
The need for preservation of coloane stilts is not a recent idea. Between 2017 and 2018, the Directorate of Tourism Services proposed the creation of a museum entirely dedicated to the stories of these dwellings arranged in Rua dos Navegantes, but the project was being postponed for legal reasons.
In 2018, the Tribuna de Macao newspaper (JTM) published an article where it referred precisely the absence of “legal foundations” for the construction of new infrastructure in the Maritime area of ​​Macao, something that has changed, however, given that the MSAR passed, from 2018, to include in its jurisdiction the management of 85 square kilometers of maritime zones.
Last year alone, the executive's plans for the creation of a “functional maritime zoning”, “maritime areas” and other related laws, and a concrete decision on what will be made on what will be made on the stilts. Both zoning and plan will be defined for a temporal period by 2040.
One of the objectives of the executive is environmental and ecological preservation, as well as certain experiences of the population. One of the points of the public consultation report speaks of “optimizing ocean exploration modalities according to Macau's development needs; coordinating the use of sea in production, daily life of the population and ecology” and performing “intensive and economizers uses to realize the rational allocation of maritime resources”.
In 2018, according to the JTM, STD assured that it would be necessary to “wait for the publication of the maritime area and administrative regulation on the administration of the use of maritime zones” and only then could you think of the planning of the museum. HM questioned STD of this article, and until the closing of this edition, obtained new clarifications.
A gradual development
In a master's dissertation in architecture, defended in 2023 at the University of Coimbra, Ana Rita Rodrigues made the study of the “Evolution of Macao Territory-Aterros and Urban Design in the Taipa and Coloane islands”, and concluded that “Portuguese occupation in the islands of Taipa and Coloane brought improvements in infrastructure, safety and village organization”. In the late nineteenth century, "there were already, in the islands, schools, hospitals and basic infrastructure, promoting the economic growth of the region."
Referring to the existence of stilts “used for the construction of fishing and housing boats for fishermen, naturally facing the river”, in a coloane zone composed “by precarious housing of one or two floors, unlike the type of common housing found in mud or macao, which was more focused on high development”.
The author also points out that “development was slower” in Coloane, as well as the absence, on both islands, of “a unified general plan and the need for better urban planning to ensure a cohesive and sustainable environment”.</description><pubDate>2025-06-24 23:53:24</pubDate></item><item><title>Cape Verde | Évora family, between Macau and the rest of the world</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/03/cabo-verde-familia-evora-entre-macau-e-o-resto-do-mundo/</link><description>Tomorrow are 50 years of Cape Verde's independence, the country from which the first levada of the Évora family came out in the 1940s, towards Macao, where he won roots. Nowadays, only one member of the family remains in the territory, the cardiologist Mário Évora
 
There were once a dozen Évoras in Macao, where they arrived in the 1940s, but only Mario Évora resists, with the family repeating the migrations that mark both Cape Verde and the Macanese.
"We have been between eight and ten Évoras in Macau," Sports Medicine expert Humberto Évora told Lusa from Lisbon, where he has lived since he renovated. The maternal grandparents of Humberto (the last of the family to be born in Cape Verde) and Mário (the first to be born in Macau) arrived in the east in the late 1940s, with five of the couple's six children.
A year later, the daughter who had stayed with her husband in Cape Verde came to Macau, already with baby Humberto. The initial plan was for two years, but the couple ended up three decades and have three more children: Mario, Rui and Maria Helena.
In 1971, it was the turn of Humberto and Mário to leave to study medicine in Lisbon, but not without a great fright linked to the colonial war that had lasted a decade ago.
"As we went to the university we could postpone military inspection, but the papers did not come from Macao and we risk being considered refractory," said Humberto. The situation resolved, but Mario admitted to Lusa the fear of the mobilization. "We had this persecution, we had to go through the year not to go with the sides in the war," he explained.
“The Shock” in Lisbon
Upon arrival in Lisbon, “we were soon welcomed and integrated into the Cape Verdean student community,” said Humberto, at a time of student agitation and politics. "There were periods when it was almost daily, manifestations of students against the regime, the shock police enter the canteen inside and give some suckling," said Mario.
Humberto admitted that "it was a shock, for those who came from Macau, where there was little political culture and the colonial war was seen as a struggle against terrorists." In a summer, the young man, who was integrated into a Cape Verdean group of intervention music, left with a friend "to the overseas ride out of guitar on his back."
“I always remember the first time in France, that I saw the colonial war described on the contrary on television, the struggle for the liberation of a colonial power of occupation,” said Humberto.
Independence
When the two brothers finished the medical course, the independence of Cape Verde, on July 5, 1975, led them to the root return. "There was a movement of many of our colleagues to contribute to a new country, which was beginning to take the first steps," said Mario, then a formed cardiologist.
Also because, recalled Humberto, some of the friends of Lisbon had, however, became members of the Government of Cape Verde. "There was this possibility, but the return to Macao, a place where it had spent so long, was natural," he explained. “I was born in Cape Verde, I spent part of my life in Portugal, I grew up in Macao, I am also Macaense. I am a citizen of the world,” said Humberto.
Macanese are a Euro-Asian community, most of which Lusodescendants, with roots in Macau, although many have emigrated, due to the economic situation or fear created by the transition from Portugal Administration to China in 1999.
From the Évora brothers, Rui, engineer, left before the transition to Cape Verde, where he even worked on the project of the Hotel-Casino that Macau's businessman David Chow built on the beach, but was inaugurated.
The younger sister, Maria Helena, a documentary science expert who has even worked in the Macao Historical Archive, is currently in the City Council of Oeiras. The children “are all out” between the United Kingdom, Cape Verde and Portugal, said Mario. "Now the world is smaller and it is going where there are opportunities," he said.
Humberto also faces migrations "as a natural process, not only for Cape Verdeans, but even to the Macanese."
Nothing that has prevented the two brothers from keeping their ties with the archipelago. Humberto divides the time between Portugal and Cape Verde, and has been the official doctor of Cape Verdean sports for decades to the main international competitions.
Mario was one of the founders-and president for ten years-of the Macau-Cabo Green Friendship Association. "We had here Ildo Lobo, Tito Paris, and my cousin," said the cardiologist, before taking a break and adds, with a smile: "Cesaria Évora."</description><pubDate>2025-07-03 23:18:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Teaching | I was entering local schools, but resources are scarce</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/23/ensino-ia-entrou-nas-escolas-locais-mas-recursos-sao-escassos/</link><description>The government has been betting on the introduction of artificial intelligence in territory schools, but with a few hours in the curriculum. In addition, schools complain of few resources to meet government goals
 
Macao schools have integrated artificial intelligence tools (AI) in classrooms, such as smart paintings and linguistic models, but some teachers warn that most are not prepared to comply with outlined policy for the sector.
After classes, students at Pui Va Secondary School remain in the classroom, distracted to explore a smart condition. These staff - explains Ruan Zhan Teng, school teacher at the school - act as interactive projectors and are used as soon as the first year, to write, watch videos or participate in classes with digital media.
"In the third year, students begin to learn to identify artificial intelligence in everyday life, basic programming and photos and videos generated by AI," the computer teacher added to Lusa.
The change took place in 2024 and is stipulated in the law: AI should be included in primary education (with a workload of 17 hours and 20 minutes per year), from 7th to 9th grade (19 hours and 20 minutes) and from 10th to 12th (18 hours and 40 minutes).
Despite the requirement, Andy Chun Wai Fan, professor and director of the University of Macao Information and Communication Center in Education, Note that schools face two obstacles: lack of resources and faculty formation.
“Some schools have only one information technology teacher,” said Fan, also referring that institutions generally have computer classes only once a week.
Do not update
Pedro Lobo, a teacher in this area, with 30 years of experience in the territory, including at the Portuguese School of Macau, is concerned about the lack of training. "Most teachers are already a certain age, they have not grown with this new technology ... So the mindset is still short of all this evolution, and change is being so fast that it can hardly follow," explained the Portuguese.
Education authorities require teachers 30 hours of annual IA training, however, Pedro Lobo considers not sufficient. Although this year has already studied almost 40 hours, the teacher says he is "little prepared".
Regarding this government policy, Andy Chun Wai Fan also remembers that it is required to schools that address ethics, innovation and collaboration in the domain of AI, although it fits the institutions the creation of the manuals themselves. “We do not have a manual about what to teach (…), each school has its own ideas about what to do with its students,” wolf reacted, explaining that he teaches “transferring AI to school work”, either through image generation, small game development, AI ethics approach and copyright issues.
Since 2021 at PUI VA
In a different record, the Pui Va Secondary School, which introduced AI in 2021, assumes to be “well prepared” to “the change”. The institution spends about two million patacas a year on AI tools, employs seven information technology teachers (IT) and hired a university professor in Beijing to support. “We want students to be able to use artificial intelligence to identify problems and solve real -life problems,” noticed the IT Office Director of Chinese educational establishment, Chong Wai Yin.
Here, students work, for example, with programming languages ​​(Python, Tencent, Iflytek), and AI models such as Deepseek and ChatgPT, engaging in intelligent city projects, in the first cycle, and in the creation of applications, at a later stage, said Zhao Qihao, former professor at the University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, who taught in Puija VA.
“In the first cycle, we developed smart cities, automated houses and AI -powered parking systems (…). In the second cycle, students create mobile applications and sustainable technological projects,” he explained.
In April, the Secretary for Social Affairs and Culture, LAM, announced that Macao's educational reforms for 2025 will focus on AI and include plans for an intelligent classroom in all schools.
The Government of Macao attributed to the school network under the direction of the Directorate of Youth Education and Development Services (DSEDJ) 15 million PATACA for AI software for this academic year.
In an email sent to Lusa, DSEDJ stated that the government “attributes great importance” to the teaching of information technologies. "The medium and long term plan for non-higher education (2021-2030) identified 'reinforcement of creativity and technological education' as one of the main directions of development," he explains in the note.
However, Pedro Lobo questions the pressure on young students: "Are we seeing children 8, 9, 10 years old to develop applications? Maybe 1 percent is capable. The rest does the best they can. They have classes and homework that never end."
Concerned deputies
In the last debate of the Legislative Assembly, last Thursday, two deputies, Iau Teng Pio and Kou Kam Fai, linked to education, defended the need for “high quality development of education in Macao”, namely with the bet on AI.
One of the suggestions, referred to during the interventions before the order of day, was the reinforcement of the “coordinated development mechanism between education, scientific and technological innovation and talents”, with the increase of “Stem resources [science, technology, engineering and mathematics] and artificial intelligence on basic education, rooting the basis of scientific literacy”.
In the debate on the 11th of this month, it was up to Deputy Ma Io Fong to appeal to AI regulation to avoid scams, but also to increase the awareness of society in relation to this new reality.
“With the rapid development of technology these days, the use of AI functions is gradually becoming important help for society and residents in daily life and work. However, AI can give rise to illicit acts, especially the worsening cyber attacks and the diffusion of false information.”
Also during the period of interventions before the agenda, the deputy asked the executive to “reinforce sensitization and education on the prevention of AI fraud, to sensitize the elderly and young people, emphasizing that the dissemination of false videos generated by AI can be a legal offense with serious consequences”.
In this context, the systematic integration of “AI safety knowledge in school curricula and the realization of different awareness and education activities with community associations was requested to increase public knowledge about AI technology and the risk derived for its abuse”.
"It is also due, through cooperation between the government, society, schools and the family, to reinforce the ability to respond to information and the internet discourse, allowing to react, clarify and follow up on useful time, when the public faces information that can cause negative influences or be misleading," said Ma Io Fong in the 11th debate.</description><pubDate>2025-06-23 23:45:47</pubDate></item><item><title>History | The MA-chan escape to the colonial and macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/23/historia-a-fuga-dos-ma-chan-para-o-portugal-colonial-e-para-macau/</link><description>The MA-chan family is from Mozambique with Chinese roots, sought its new path in the then colonial Portugal and since 1976 that set roots in Macao. José Manuel Machon, resident in the territory since he was 13, told Lusa the very peculiar trajectory of his family, which reflects many of the family directions taken in the years of war and the end of the Portuguese colonial empire
 
The MA-chan, the Mozambican family with roots in China, fled twice to communism and twice resumed in colonial Portugal. In 1976, they landed in Macao, where Mozambique's memory had erased with the departure of the Landins, African troops who parked in the territory for decades since 1912.
According to a report by Luís Andrade de Sá published in Macau magazine in 1992, and quoted by the blog "Chronicles Macanese", the Landins were in Macao "for about five decades", and "the Chinese never used to their conviviality, suspiciously who had the huge blacks who played a horrible drumsticks while returning the ostensiva. ferocity ”. The term Landim became a reference “to identify all indigenous battalions that passed by Macau”, is described in the same report.
Massá Ma-chan went in 1963 to the Namphlam, northern Mozambique Conservatory to register the fifth son, but once again denied this Chinese, with roots in Guangzhou, the transmission of the nickname to descent. José Manuel was the same as his brothers: the nickname Machon, corruption of MA-chan.
The identity of José Manuel Machon, embryoly marked by this bureaucratic detail imposed by the then Portuguese Mozambique, is not only a reflection of the colonial past of Portugal, but from the beginnings of Sino-Mozambican relations.
“I don't have great confusion, I tried to adapt to life,” he tells Lusa in Macau, where he has lived since he was 13. The grandfather-also MA-chan-was the one who defined that this story began in Africa, leaving China looking for better life, in the starter of the twentieth century, and settling in Nampula, alongside Sharing, a Macua woman, Mozambican ethnic group.
Massá, the son -and father of José Manuel -was sent to Guangzhou at 14, to receive formal education there. When he returns to Mozambique, he is a married man with a bullet mark near his left shoulder.
In China, he faced the Japanese in World War II and married a Chinese, which he met on the day of the marriage, until, on the threshold of the civil war, which would give victory to the communists of Mao Zedong, fled. He dedicated himself to Nampula to the cucumber of the cucumber-the 'Magojojo'-and the tubar bit, which he exported to Hong Kong.
The Great Return
However, unable to adapt, the woman returned to Macao with her four children, where she died. Massá returned to marry, this time with a Mozambican - José Manuel came first, Carla later.
When the Frelimo flag raised on the mast in Mozambique on June 25, 1975, the MA-chan-headed Macao, with a brief passage in Portugal, where they inhabited a pension paid by the then IARN.
“We are nothing returned, because we have not returned anywhere, we are refugees,” says Carla Machon, residing in Portugal.
“When my father heard again about communism, he fled,” says his brother, José Manuel. While speaking, bowling balls pack on the floor and travel the track to a new crash. The noise in the center of Bowling Future Bright does not seem to bother this big man, 61, fluent in Cantonese and Portuguese and president of Macao Bowling Club. “This is what keeps me stable. Instead of going to the glasses, I come here,” he notes.
For Joseph, independence "it was an open openness, an opening to the world." It doesn't even talk about political reasons, but how important it was to cross half a world until you arrived in Macau.
A new life
In this page turn, the MA-chan/maachon family came to find, in 1976, a city with little civil presence abroad. José and Carla do not remember other Mozambicans, who began to arrive after independence, many from Portugal.
Mong-Há's fortress is an old witness to Mozambique's presence in Macau. Then the Landins, Mozambican soldiers at the service of the Colonial Army were quartered, recalls journalist João Guedes, a scholar in the history of Macao. It is this historical circumstance that baptized the hill of Mong-há of “Mountain of Black Ghosts”.
These troops, with the “greatest warrior instinct”, in the expression of Emperor Gungunhana, remained in Macao half a century, until around the 1960s. They were responsible, for example, by the storage of the siege gates, border of the territory with China and recurring incident place.
“They passed by and faded as if they had never been,” resumes Guedes, indicating that there was no material heritage attesting this military presence. Not far from Mong-Há, but at the Riquexó restaurant, troops are still there, eternalized in photos hanging on the walls.
This serves African chicken, macanese dish, whose origin is still today the target of debate. Two theories: It was created by the Portuguese chief Américo Ângelo, inspired by a trip to Mozambique. Another version realizes that, seeing the African soldiers missing roasted chicken, Americo made the dish.
And the memory of macau-moca-mandamous relationships is not complete without evoking the trafficking in leaf. If, on the one hand, it is known that the Portuguese took slaves from the African colonies by settling in the doors of China, in reverse, were also sent via Macao, Chinese to work in Mozambique, often in slavery conditions.
The sons were part of a migratory movement from the late nineteenth century, “to develop the Mozambican colony,” explains the professor at Joaquim Chissano University in Maputo, Fatima Papelo, who investigates Sino-Mozambican cooperation. The first group, he says, was sent in 1858 and "consisted of 30 men."
More than a century later, in the struggle for Mozambican independence, Beijing supported the Liberation Front of Mozambique (Frelimo) and is one of the first countries to recognize the new sovereign state. In Macao, the reinforcement of the ties was later paid, with the transition from the territory of Portugal to China in 1999.
But for José Manuel, Mozambique was always present. The last time it went, tells, visited and cleaned the family campaign, "there at Machamba". "It's a Chinese custom," he explained.</description><pubDate>2025-06-23 02:46:38</pubDate></item><item><title>Elections | “Soldier of Mao” claims innocent and says he was six days unable to take a shower</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/18/eleicoes-soldado-de-mao-afirma-se-inocente-e-diz-que-esteve-seis-dias-sem-conseguir-tomar-banho/</link><description>Accused of electoral corruption and having an illegal Mahjong business, Wong Wai Man yesterday returned to the load to cry out his innocence. The president of the Iron and Steel Shipowners Association says he was “provoked” to climb to the roof where he was a few hours, and was six days without being able to bathe or change clothes
 
The panorama of the legislative elections for the hemicycle already boils. In addition to these elections with the smallest number of candidate lists since the creation of the MSAR, the controversy is installed with the almost candidate Wong Wai Man, who tried to submit his candidacy without success.
Also known as the “Soldier of Mao” and “Captain of Macao”, and after being accused of electoral corruption and having an illegal Mahjong business, behold Wong Wai Man yesterday returned to explanations: refuses the accusations that he is targeted, says he was persecuted by the authorities and refers to “torture” how it was dealt with.
The president of the Iron and Steel Association was on Monday, several hours on a roof of a house made with a metal plate in the mud, having been rescued by the Fire Department. A solution that says it was “provoked” after being detained by the Judiciary Police (PJ), referred to the Public Prosecution Service and receiving the Commissioner's Call against Corruption (CCAC), which accuses him of having the illegal business.
Wong Wai Man explained that, shortly after leaving the CCAC Office in the Nape area, he was intercepted by an employee of this body that alleged the lack of signature in some documents. However, not satisfied with the situation, Wong Wai Man picked up a taxi towards the mud, eventually taking refuge on the roof. "I had no other option, CCAC wanted to chase me to death. So I was on the roof," he explained.
Regarding accusations of electoral corruption, man says he is poor and is unable to commit such illegalities. Regarding Mahjong's alleged illegal business, Wong Wai Man stressed that the Association's headquarters in fact has Mahjong tables, but only for the enjoyment of the partners.
Regarding the use of money in these games, Wong Wai Man said there was always a sign to say that it was forbidden to be bets on money and that there was, at the association's headquarters, a box for donations, but that was intended for voluntary support of the members to help the association's operation.
This is because, according to this, besides being president is also the only one to support all expenses of the Iron and Steel Association, namely those related to income, water and light, given that since 2014 that the entity has not received subsidies.
One thing is certain: the association's headquarters will close doors tomorrow due to the end of the lease. Wong Wai Man says that for now, he will not look for a new address for the association because, for now, he has a more pressing subject: looking for a place to live. Wong Wai Man made the association's headquarters to his home.
Life lesson
Despite having missed the opportunity to submit a list and be a candidate for elections for the Legislative Assembly by Via Direct, Wong Wai Man argued that the most important thing was to participate in the whole process and learn new things. The "captain of Macao" also said that he is dedicated to society of heart and not by selfishness. Your ideal is to do things justly for society, since it argues that traditional associations do not defend the people.
Wong Wai Man also told journalists a personal episode to justify their participation in social and public causes. "In 2007 my wife was pregnant and the hospitals convinced her to end the pregnancy because the baby's survival rate would be 50 percent, due to the fact that a fetal anomaly was detected after the exams. I insisted and the government eventually paid the operation worth 70 thousand patacas. So I want to make my contribution to return a favor" to heaven "," he said.
Six days without bathing
According to the All About Macau newspaper, Wong Wai Man reported that he was still six days without bathing and sleeping, having remained a week missing until he performed with CCAC this Monday. Before he did, he said he was a total of six days detained, which for himself was “torture”, and that in total was all this time without bathing, sleeping or changing clothes. On Sunday, you will have been able to go home.
“Last night [Tuesday] I was finally able to sleep well and shower. I was six days without being able to bathe or change my clothes,” he explained. The climb to the roof of the house in the mud was also a form of protest by the way it was treated, he said.
The detention took place at dawn last Wednesday, the 11th, between 3 am and 4 am, with the argument that Wong Wai Man would maintain an illegal Mahjong business. It was then that he was detained for 48 hours in a squad in the mud, and was then transferred to the Public Prosecution Service (MP) to continue to make statements.
After this process, he was notified to present himself with CCAC, having signed the requested documents. He was then arrested again for another 48 hours and transferred again to the MP. When, already on the street, he was again informed that he would have to return to CCAC to sign more documents, decided to escape and take refuge on the roof.</description><pubDate>2025-06-18 23:46:24</pubDate></item><item><title>PME | Macau Commercial Association calls for flexibility in the supports</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/03/pme-associacao-comercial-de-macau-pede-flexibilidade-nos-apoios/</link><description>The Macao Commercial Association (ACM) calls for greater flexibility in financial support systems to small and medium enterprises (SME) taking into account the end of two support programs last year.
At issue, there is the end of the “interest payment only, without capital amortization” and “Refund Adjustment Plan for Small and Medium Enterprises”, and according to the newspaper or Mun, some entrepreneurs were informed by banks that they had to begin to return the amounts borrowed.
Quoted by the same newspaper, Vong Kok Seng, ACM vice president, said it was delivered by the association an opinion to Sam Hou Fai, chief of the Executive, on June 12, which suggests that the monetary and currency authority of Macao (AMCM) coordinates with the bank to reevaluate the reimbursement deadlines in the case of interest payments where there is no capital, extending them extending deadlines. Vong Kok Seng also said that the opinion suggests that there is a greater balance between risk control by financial institutions and companies' financing needs.
On Wednesday, after issues posed by Radio Macau's Chinese channel, AMCM explained that the bank does not ask for the SMEs to reimburse, in the short term, the accumulated loan amounts granted in the last four years.</description><pubDate>2025-07-03 23:29:16</pubDate></item><item><title>Elections | At least 32 crimes oblige to serve a prison sentence</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/03/eleicoes-pelo-menos-32-crimes-obrigam-a-cumprir-pena-de-prisao/</link><description>The electoral law requires the application of effective arrest penalties that may vary between one month and more than 10 years. One of the cases where convicts even need to spend time in Coloane's prison is the crime of public incentive to abstention, blank vote or null vote
 
The law provides for at least 32 crimes that always oblige to serve a prison sentence. One of these crimes is the public incentive to abstention, blank vote or null vote, which causes a penalty ranging from one month to three years.
According to the general rules of the Penal Code, when someone is convicted of committing a crime there is a possibility that the penalty is suspended for a period from one year to five years. In order for the penalty to be suspended, the law determines that the conviction cannot exceed three years in prison. This period is also time usually considered as a reference for the definition of small crime or a crime that is not serious.
However, the electoral law, through article 147, abdicates the regime of suspension of prison penalties, which means that the convicts, under normal conditions, will always spend at least one month in Coloane's prison establishment.
The law divides the crime in which it abdicates the suspension of penalty into “crimes related to the organization of the electoral process”, “crimes related to the electoral campaign” and “crimes related to suffrage and determination”.
The list of crimes related to the organization of the electoral process includes six offenses and in at least five of them the application of a prison sentence is mandatory, as with the person who agrees to be recognized as a candidate when the legal conditions, or when the coercion or fraudulent devices are resorted to condition the will to participate, or not, in a commission, in the designation of the vote in the staff and the decision of the decision A person is a candidate or not to the elections.
Election campaign
One of the most controversial questions in the elections is the election campaign period and the ban on campaign activities before the legal period, which this year starts on August 30 and extends until September 12.
Earlier this week, the chairman of the Legislative Assembly Electoral Affairs Committee (Caeal), Seng Ioi Man, warned that despite not being received complaints about illicit, the authorities are aware of potential infringements.
The law provides for seven campaign -related crimes, but most, four in seven, admits the application of a penalty of a fine, so that the prison sentence will not always be applicable.
However, in case there is fraudulent deviation correspondence from Caeal, slanderous denunciation of the crimes provided for in this law or electoral propaganda less than 100 meters from the voting assemblies, punishment always undergoes prison for periods ranging from one month to eight years.
Broader crimes
It is in the section of “crimes related to suffrage and determination” that the law has the largest number of illicit situations, with a total of 23 crimes.
Among the 23 illicit, in four, the application of a penalty of fine is allowed, in addition to prison sentence, but only in certain circumstances. In most crimes planned, 18, it is always mandatory to apply a prison sentence that varies between one month and about 10 years and 8 months, depending on the crime committed.
Some of these crimes are specific and aim at security forces, as with forced entry at voting assemblies, and voting meeting for fraud at the time of counting the votes.
However, there are also crimes that can be committed by any citizen. It is in this category that is the public incentive to abstention, blank or null vote, which causes a penalty ranging from one month to three years in prison. The same can happen when, within the scope of work, someone threatens a worker with a professional sanction for the coercion targeted to reveal his sense of vote, or vote based on this coercion.</description><pubDate>2025-07-03 23:25:51</pubDate></item><item><title>Public function | Private institutions will be able to pass medical certificates</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/03/funcao-publica-instituicoes-privadas-vao-poder-passar-atestados-medicos/</link><description>With the changes that are being discussed in the Legislative Assembly to the Statute of Public Administration Workers of Macai, non -profit health institutions will be able to pass medical certificates to civil servants. According to Radio Macau, this aspect was guaranteed by the president of the 2nd Permanent Commission of the Legislative Assembly, Chan Chak MO, after a working meeting of the deputies.
With these changes, institutions such as the Workers' Health Clinic, or the Women's Association Health Clinic will be able to pass the certificates, which has not happened so far. However, the law does not go so far as to allow the private sector certificates to be accepted, an option justified with the difficulties added to oversee a larger sector.
"According to the government, for now, because of the inspection, private doctors are many, there are many clinics in Macau. Therefore, at this time, it is only allowed that the non -profit medical entities that have approved agreements with the government, can spend a medical certificate," explained the deputy.
However, Chan Chak Mo did not rule out the possibility of in the future the private sector's medical certificates could be used to justify civil service absences. "In the future, the possibility of alleviating the pressure of the public sector, health, can be able to see this extended scope," he said.</description><pubDate>2025-07-03 23:23:16</pubDate></item><item><title>Dsal | Job Fair for Youth this month</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/03/dsal-feira-de-emprego-para-jovens-este-mes/</link><description>The Directorate of Services for Laboral Affairs (DSAL) again organized, on July 18 and 19, the “Young Job Fair 2025”, an initiative organized in partnership with the New Youth Association of Macao, General Association of Macao and Macau Youth Development Service Center.

Nick Lei argues that it is possible to verify the days of stay in the territory in the single account
 
Deputy Nick Lei thinks that the changes to the requirements of assignment of the pecuniary reimbursement plan in economic development, known as a pecuniary check, were hasty, harming the beneficiaries. "The measures were implemented too hurriedly and the imperfect application brought many inconveniences and obstacles to the residents," said the legislator in a written interpretation, adding that when the news was released "triggered discussions and social controversy."
The number two on the list of the Fujian parliamentary bench in the next September 14 legislatures suggested to the government that it “fully consider the impact and inconvenience” of measures or policy adjustments, “taking into account the real needs of residents”.
The deputy cites complaints of residents who criticized the hasty form as the changes were applied, which will take into account of the days past in Macau last year, "which makes many residents of Macao who live abroad to choose to be in Macau according to their personal will." Therefore, Nick Lei asks the Executive to Sam Hou Fai to consider postponing one year the implementation of the new measures to assign the cash check.
Lifelong
The deputy also suggests to the government to add functionality to the mobile application single account, allowing residents to verify the number of days of stay in Macau. Nick Law stresses currently, this registration can only be "processed at care posts or self-service kiosks."
The introduction of functionality in mobile application not only promotes administrative efficiency, but reduces treatment costs and inconvenience for residents, the deputy says.
The need to apply personally, through a third party or post documents to prove that if you are in an exception situation for those who have not spent 183 days in Macao also motivated complaints of Nick Law, who would like to see the whole process to be treated in the single account.
Despite the suggestions, the deputy points out that "it is necessary to optimize and improve the policy based on the maintenance of the original intention, so that public funds can be used accurately."</description><pubDate>2025-07-03 23:21:13</pubDate></item><item><title>Islands Hospital | Urgencies start in the fourth quarter</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/03/hospital-das-ilhas-urgencias-arrancam-no-quarto-trimestre/</link><description>The Islands Hospital may have the emergency service operating in full in the last quarter of this year, with 24 -hour consultations for non -severe clinical situations and ambulance entry into limited cases. For this month, the hospital is expected to begin to provide artificial insemination services
 
The opening of services at the Peking Union Medical Hospital, also known as Hospital das Ilhas, happens progressively. The hospital's subdirector, Law Wai Seng, revealed yesterday that the emergency service is expected to start operating in the last quarter of this year.
At the end of 2023, the Emergency Post of the Conde de São Januário Hospital Center (CHCSJ), installed at the Macao University Hospital of Science and Technology, was transferred to the Islands Hospital and, at the time, it was reported that the emergency service would make available for 24 hours.
About a year and a half later, the subdirector of Hospital das Ilhas confirms that this service will start in the last quarter of this year.
Speaking on the Macao Macao Forum Morning Program of Radio Macau, Law Wai Seng pointed out that emergency services would not receive ambulances with urgent patients, taking in some exceptions.
"Emergency services and first aid services are different levels. Emergency services mean that we provide 24 -hour consultations for residents who are not in a serious clinical situation. As for the cases of embarrassment by ambulance, with demanding clinical condition, our facilities are not yet prepared to provide this service," explained the official.
However, the official admitted exceptions in which the islands hospital can receive ambulances with urgent patients. "When it is bad weather and traffic between the peninsula and the islands is interrupted, our experts will coordinate with the medical team that CHCSJ will send, to provide limited first aid," he added.
The Miracle of Life
In addition, Law Wai Seng revealed that it was agreed with health services that if the health centers users in the islands need specialized care, they can be referred with priority to the islands Hospital.
Another featured subject at the Macao Forum yesterday, was the activity of the assisted procreation center of the new hospital center. The center team's head of the center, Ku Sio Kuan, pointed out by the end of this month the deadline for artificial insemination services to be available to the public. Since February, when the center began to operate, so far, 230 couples have been consulted, whose clinical condition has been evaluated and diagnosed.
Ku Sio Kuan pointed out that the average age of these couples is around 37 and 30 percent are over 40 years old. The clinic also indicated that the most frequent cause of infertility is endometriosis, a disease that affects the ovaries and fallopian tubes.</description><pubDate>2025-07-03 01:11:10</pubDate></item><item><title>AL | Buildings for Canceled Specialist Doctors</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/03/al-edificios-para-medicos-especialistas-cancelados/</link><description>The government has given up building the homes building for medical specialists at Hospital das Ilhas. After the suspension of the project last week was announced, Deputy Chan Chak Mo, who chairs the Standing Commission that he analyzed the law that will review this year's budget, confirmed the cancellation of the project. The deputies of the second standard committee have already signed the opinion that culminates the process of analysis, lacking the law to be voted in the specialty in the hemiciclo.
According to the newspaper or Mun, Chan Chak MO revealed that health services requested this year's budget cancellation for the construction project of housing buildings for SQ2 Lot SQ2 experts from Seac Pai Van. The project was budgeted at about 40 million patacas.
After weighting, the authorities decided to use the UT Koi building in the black sand to houses the experts. It is recalled that this building was intended to provide temporary accommodation to residents of buildings subject to urban renewal works.
Chan Chak Mo pointed out that the government understands that this way can enjoy this type of housing, while quickly solving any problems of accommodation of specialist doctors of the new hospital.</description><pubDate>2025-07-03 01:09:46</pubDate></item><item><title>The rise of the waters</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/03/a-subida-das-aguas/</link><description>It is not only when the water retains that one realizes who was using a bath and who was not. When the level of the water rises, perhaps swimming is saved and who does not know drown.
In neighboring Hong Kong, there is news of the successive closing of many insurance companies, bakeries and theaters. It is a city that claims to be an international financial center and constantly seeks ways to “break the impasse” and improve the current situation. If the method adopted is correct, it will naturally find a way out, but if an incorrect or inappropriate method is adopted, the situation will get worse.
Since the beginning of the new mandate of the Government of Misrees, Macau has not faced less problems than he faced during the Covid-19 pandemic. Some difficulties have arisen due to the national and international scenario, others already have root in the past and some have recently appeared. Citibank has removed from Macau, ending its activity in the city, which, despite everything, involved a relatively small amount of assets, but the departure of an international financial institution cannot be ignored.
The chief executive of Macao, as well as many government officials, will rarely have had the opportunity to use public transport. Unfortunately, I recently caught a bus on Rua do Campo and, during the short trip, a passenger sitting near the driver continually expressed his dissatisfaction with the policies of the Government of MSAR, stating that it would participate in good will in protest demonstrations if there was someone who organized them. For safety reasons, the driver did not answer him and I was standing near the door and I also chose to be silent.
Given the current circumstances of Macao, it is difficult to find some group that organizes protests to demand “guarantees of employment and the quality of life of the population”. The RAE government is aware of the problems that exist. The Secretary for the Economics and Finance has just submitted in the Legislative Assembly the proposal of law entitled “Change to the Budget Law of 2025”, to recommend a budget increase of 650 million patacas to support small and medium enterprises and revitalize the landfill area (ZAPE) in response to the wave of stores and the increase in unemployment. However, there was no reference to the moment when the support and revitalization program would be started.
During the mandates of the former heads of executive Hau Hau Wah and Chui Sai On, Macau exceeded significant obstacles to achieving structural economic transformation, which allowed GDP to reach new maximums in Asia and stabilize the political and social scenario. The impact of Covid-19 pandemic in Macao represented an unforeseen disaster, but man's losses are preventable.
Confronted with the wave of closing business, unemployment and uncertainties caused by international commercial conflicts, then waves of shocks will appear behind each other. When water level rises, and to prevent us from driving ourselves, it is necessary to find the true way to survival. In the national development of the central government, Macau appears positioned as “a center, a platform and a base” defined by the country.
When it is mentioned that Macau is “a center” refers that it is the world center of tourism and leisure, and not just the Great Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Bay Tourism and Leisure Center. Attract more international tourists to Macao and encouraging them to consume while in the city is absolutely crucial. Turning the deepened cooperation zone between Guangdong and Macao into Hengqin into a commercial service platform between China and Portuguese -language countries can be more practical and beneficial for Macau than actively promoting the proper diversification strategy of the “1 + 4” economy.
Chinese culture emphasizes harmony and inclusion, and only adopting this guiding principle becomes possible coexistence and diversity, thus shaping a healthy society through the exchange between Chinese culture and western culture. Can Macau reach true harmony and inclusion? If we row toward the ends of the world, instead of being stopped on the beach, it doesn't matter if the water level rises or not.</description><pubDate>2025-07-03 23:46:33</pubDate></item><item><title>Climate change and contradictions of Lula da Silva</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/03/as-alteracoes-climaticas-e-as-contradicoes-de-lula-da-silva/</link><description>The fact that Brazil is the fifth largest country of the globe and the seventh in terms of the number of inhabitants justifies that its president, Lula da Silva, is a politician who arouses curiosity globally. It was partly thanks to its governments that Brazil's Human Development Index (HHP3) has significantly progressed, having reached a list of 193 countries, 89th in 2024, according to the Human Development Report 2023/2024, prepared by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP).
Elected three times, Lula da Silva held the presidency from 2003 to 2011 and 2023 until today. From its policy stand out the programs “Bolsa Familia” and “Hunger Zero”, recognized by the United Nations as having contributed to considerably alleviating hunger in Brazil.
In addition to the fight against hunger, they are also areas where there was greater development, health and longevity, due to investment in the Unified Health System and increased vaccination programs. In the field of education there were significant progress thanks to incentives for more children and adolescents to attend primary and high school. Initiatives such as the “University for All Program” (ProUni) and the “Student Financing Fund” (FIES) contributed to a larger number of college students from low -income population layers.
It is due to this large country that the Portuguese language is one of the most spoken in the world and the most used in the southern hemisphere. On the internet it occupies fifth place 4, far above the eighth place on the list, according to the translation company “Gama!”.
Brazil is also a cause for attention mainly because it has much of the Amazon, the largest rainforest in the globe5. This forest, which extends to 9 countries, has about 60% of its extension in Brazil, hence the great responsibility of the governments of this country to preserve it, not only in its own benefit, but also from the whole planet.
In the time of the government of Jair Bolsonaro (2019 - 2022), steps have taken back regarding the protection of the Amazon, namely the increase in clandestine mining exploitation and agribusiness, resulting in increased deforestation, pollution of numerous water courses with strong health repercussions of indigenous populations and biodiversity.
It was the time when the “land grabbers” 6 again had more freedom in their activity of falsifying documents that were intended to be proof of land ownership that were actually occupied illegally. After these four years of a far-right government, the country has been directed again by rulers who care about the primary role that Amazon has in the regulation of climate on the global scale and the well-being of indigenous populations.
The biosphere is one of the components of the climate system that the most influence has the regulation of climate on the global scale. Much of this component consists of the Amazon, given the most extensive tropical rainforest, with almost seven million square kilometers.
It is a vast carbon dioxide sink, contributing to the reduction of the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and a source of oxygen. The attacks that it has been targeted, motivated by human greed, in the form of deforestation for agricultural exploration make it possible to turn into an extensive savannah, the risk of reaching the point without return of regeneration, in which the forest would move from Co₂ sink to a source of this gas.
Lula da Silva, despite being a recognition to be a fighter for the preservation of the Amazon and defender of the measures to alleviate climate change, is the subject of pressures to alleviate these characteristics, which has caused some government tergiversals in the application of environmental protection measures and fighting climate change. Take, for example, the case of Bill No. 2159 of 2021, nicknamed Lula's critics for “PL of devastation”.
In discussion since a few years ago, it was approved by the House of Representatives on May 13 this year, before the passivity of the president, who did not give due support to Marina Silva, her minister of the “environment and climate change”. After a few amendments likely to increase the environmental impact, it was recently approved by the Senate. There are even those who claim that the setbacks in environmental policy implicit in this decree-law would not embarrass the government of Jair Bolsonaro, explicitly considered antiamybientalist.
Given this situation, the path is open to oil exploration at sea, relatively close to the mouth of the Amazon River, which contradicts the recommendations expressed at the conference on the Cost287 climate, in which it was established, for the first time in this type of conferences, the explicit commitment regarding the need to transition from fossil fuels in energy systems in a “fair, ordered” way to achieve Carbonic neutrality until 2050.
This “decree of devastation” allows the existence of “special environmental licenses” (LAE) for projects classified as strategic. These would be subject to the assessment of the body responsible for licensing only for a year, after which they would be automatically approved. The chronic scarcity of personnel of this agency, the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Natural Resources (Ibama), would often allow their approval, paving the way to unpredictable environmental impacts.
Given this situation, the accusation of passivity by Lula da Silva is understandable regarding the procedures involving the approval of this decree. The position of the President of Brazil is very uncomfortable, especially more than the next parts of the parties to be promoted by UNFCCC8, COP30, will be held in Belém, Brazil, next November.
The approval of the infamous “PL of devastation” illustrates well the contradiction between theory and practice in politics led by the Brazilian government.

What if this boat had arrived in Goa, or Macao? However, the writer died only five years after his trip to the attached Atlantic archipelagos, and neither Angola even went, much less the Canton. It would be hard to imagine where we would read a travel diary of this soul contemplator south of China, that another contemporary, in the same born year, Camilo Pessanha, described as the land of evil. Especially in view of the others, the happy islands of Macaronesia. Jorge Arrimar (n. 1953), Angolan poet, who in the 1980s directed the Macao Central Library, after passing through the Azores, reflects on this duplication or island triangulation in “Travel to the Memory of the Islands” (2002). Deep down, Macau is also an island, unfolds peninsularity in insularity.
Now the Azores and Macau maintain old bonds, where the weight of moisture is not the only common denominator. There was a time when, it was said, only Azoreans and the transmontanos ventured to these stops, hence the large number of sword born to the straw or candle, St. George, who were off the Senate. This is the case of Father Teixeira and José Silveira Machado, who arrived here in the same wave. The latter, Azorean who became a citizen of Macau, is one of the examples of someone who contributed to the literature, journalism and education of this peninsula and two islands over about seventy years. For its part, Rodrigo Leal de Carvalho (n. 1932)-outsider from Praia da Vitória, which performed high functions in the Macao judiciary for several decades-has also dedicated himself to writing, not even documenting the lives of these other archipelagic.
Already the Azorean tradition to provide the “Portuguese world” of ecclesiastical hierarchy had its pinnacles in two figures: D. João Paulino de Azevedo and Castro (1852-1918), born in the slabs of Pico, which was the 19th Bishop of Macao, between 1902 and 1918. She was pastored not only in Macau, but throughout the vast area of ​​the southeast Asia, some good sheep. D. José da Costa Nunes (1880-1976), born in Candelaria do Pico, accompanied D. João Paulino as secretary in 1903, being later Bishop of Macau (1920-1940), Archbishop of Goa and Patriarch of the Oriental Indies, even receiving Cardinal Barrete in 1962.
In this regard, I recently read the volume of the Azoreanophyl researcher Vasco Rosa (n. 1958), published in 2019, about the critical reception of the Brandonean work on the Azores, “Raul Brandão and the Azores” (from the Pico's Company), and I came across a book that although heuristically very competent (that is, by the survey of sources that promotes forgotten sources, this one vast morgue of ideas), however, proves to be analytically insufficient. Exhaustively presents the entire context of the reception of the unknown islands ”(1926) of Raul Brandão, both in the Azores and the continent. Identifies contemporary writers who also leaned over the Azores, distinguishing the supporters of the North Writer's detractors. However, it could have established further comparisons between Brandão and the other authors, even demonstrating how Brandão himself probably inspired by these other sources.
Rosa prefers to present the author as an absolute genius - I do not question him - devoid of influences, only generator of disciples. It would have been more enriching to situate his work in the context of a dialogue with other continental and island writers, abandoning the conception of an isolated book, an island. Paradoxically, despite all the evidence that Vasco Rosa presents, suggesting precisely that this is not a unique work in the literary landscape, this dimension remained by explore in his, despite everything, very useful book.
Macau has also been the subject of numerous travel reports, discovery with or without fascination, and everyone quotes, rewrite each other. This is how it works. The textual authorities are repeated, new appear, others disappear, but a lot is quote. Their names will be for the next chronic, but we may ask us why Brandão's beautiful volume would not work on the islands for knowing.</description><pubDate>2025-07-01 23:54:54</pubDate></item><item><title>The Jacky Cheung concert</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/01/o-concerto-de-jacky-cheung/</link><description>Jacky Cheung (張學友), the famous Hong Kong singer presented a concert in Macao who received great criticism from which two comments stand out in particular.
First, the concert increased the casino's recipes. On average, the daily revenue of the game in May was 684 million patacas, but in the first 22 days of June, reached 14.8 billion, with a daily average of 670 million. June is unfortunately a low period of time for tourism, but the daily recipes of the game were comparable to May, which proves that the concert attracted many Jacky Cheung fans to Macao and helped the city's economy.
Jacky Cheung will make six concerts in Macau between June and July. Citibank issued a report that it is stated that Jacky Cheung concerts boosted Macao's economic development, with June's revenue from the expected 19 billion to 19.75 billion. HSBC also issued a report where it is said that the revenues of the game in June can reach values ​​between 19.7 and 20.4 billion. An international singer has the ability to bring an additional 700 million profit to Macao. This shows how Jacky Cheung is dear to his fans and the size of his charisma.
Jacky Cheung premiered in the 1980s and has been on the asset for almost 40 years. His fans grew up with him and are representatives of all age groups, young people, middle-aged people and also people from the age of Cheung. With a very wide fan base, not surprising that your concerts are always exhausted.
If Macau wants to develop the economy by attracting to its international singers, it should take into account its fan base. The higher it is, the greater the number of people moving to Macau to see the concert and the greater the economic benefits for the city. To achieve this goal, Macau may consider the possibility of offering these artists discounts on the rental of the rooms and providing fans to transport facilities to facilitate the trips of and to their places of origin; You can also organize transport so that fans visit the areas most frequented by local inhabitants and non -tourist sectors can benefit from the influx of consumers. Macau can also take this opportunity to develop activity sectors beyond the game industry, which will bring hundreds of benefits and no damage.
The second focus of the concert is the use of Cantonese and Mandarin. During the concert, fans from mainland China asked Jacky Cheung to speak Mandarin, to which he replied:
"I apologize, but I don't speak mandarin."
They then asked Jacky Cheung: "How many people speak Cantonese?"
The fans who spoke Cantonese shouted immediately "wow."
Then Jacky Cheung said in Mandarin, "Sorry, but don't. Go there, learn Cantonese."
The "wow" shouts of the fans showed that most spoke Cantonese.
Even so, Jacky Cheung sang some songs in Mandarin and the mainland China fans were very happy. In addition, Jacky Cheung's phrase, "I don't speak mandarin, go there, learn Cantonese," was halted by the cybernauts, who called him "Ambassador of Cantonese promotion" and praised him for his great emotional intelligence.
Concerts are part of the entertainment industry. As long as fans are happy, what difference makes if you use Mandarin or Cantonese? People who will watch a concert should forget the barrier of their tongue, dive into the show, enjoy each moment, integrate into the festive atmosphere and do everything to provide themselves as much happiness as possible. This is what it serves to watch a concert. Music is the common language of humanity and can eliminate barriers among people. Think about this, whenever you hear music, can we only appreciate songs sung in your own language? In addition to songs in Cantonese, we also heard songs in Mandarin, in English, Korean, Japanese, etc. By understanding this, we can break the barrier and tongue and have all fun.
In recent years, China's power has increased a lot, the economy has developed rapidly and foreign investment has also increased. Based on the principle that guides business transactions “economic interests first”, it is beginning to be common for foreign business men to use Mandarin to communicate with their Chinese partners.
In 1972, the United Nations classified the “simplified Chinese characters” as one of six “commercial languages” alongside English, French, Russian, Arabic and Spanish. All united nations official documents are written in these six languages, and April 20 was chosen as the “United Nations Chinese Language Day”. Currently, about 1.5 billion people speak Chinese around the world and the importance of this language is evident.
“Business Communication” and “necessary for state affairs” demonstrate that from a political and economic perspective, global demand for the learning of Mandarin grows from day to day. In the future, people who speak Mandarin will have an advantage when they negotiate with Chinese.

In addition, about 153,000 people visited the facilities placed in four points of the city
 
The popularity of Pop Mart toys was used by the Macao government to stimulate tourism in the region. In the first phase of the “Pop Mart Macao Citywalk” project, which took place between June 6 and 28, “520,000 users of the six electronic wallets involved participated in 520,000 automatic draws, generated by commercial transactions in a total of 680 million Patacas,” said the Board of Tourism Services (STD). Among those drawn, about 59,000 Pop Mart -limited edition thematic awards were issued, the STD added.
The “large -scale cultural tourism project” results from a partnership between STD and the popular Chinese toy brand. Until September 21, places such as sidewalk of the São Lázaro church, Luís de Camões Square, Santo Agostinho Largo and Pai Kok da Taipa Street will be taken by facilities with the popular Baby Molly, Crybaby, Dimoo and Labubu characters.
According to the preliminary data advanced yesterday by STD, in the first three weeks of the initiative the facilities located in the four neighborhoods, and the base of the event installed in Largo do Senate, attracted about 153,000 visits, generating 620,000 consumer draws.
Gifts and social networks
As current times, vacation and leisure do not result in social networking publications is as if they do not exist. During the period under analysis, the authorities indicate that 11,500 shares were published on social networks “in exchange for limited edition thematic postcards at the points of the activity”. STD states even that due to the high look for the postcards frequently exhausted within the first hour of daily service.
The sharing of tourist photographs where pop Mart dolls are culminating the promotion work on social networks that STD has done before the project was opened, to which it was attended by “digital influencers” from the interior of China to create content, “including live broadcasts and publications with short images and videos”. In total, 190 publications were generated that helped “viral” the theme “Pop Mart Macao Citywalk”, reaching more than 36 million online views.
To compete for the Chinese toy brand draw raffles, just make a purchase of more than 100 Patacas through Macau MPay, Alipay de Macao, Alipay from China, Alipay of Hong Kong, True Money from Thailand and Touch ‘N Go Ewallet Malaysia.</description><pubDate>2025-07-03 23:31:12</pubDate></item><item><title>Commerce | Supermarket closure is “strategic adjustment”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/03/comercio-fecho-de-supermercados-e-ajuste-estrategico/</link><description>IP Sio Man, president of the Vang Kei Hong Commercial Agency, discourages the recent closure of some supermarkets in the territory and states that it is only an “adjustment” in the commercial strategy, related to poor location of spaces and the necessary reduction in the number of establishments
 
The closing of supermarkets in Macao is not a sign of a major economic crisis, but of a necessary trade adjustment by the brands. Who says it is IP Sio Man, president of the commercial agency Vang Kei Hong, who yesterday in a public event said that the recent closure of these commercial spaces was just a "strategic adjustment" by the companies.
“Firstly, when we talk about closing we realize that these are individual cases. Then we have a large proportion of supermarkets [by number of inhabitants in Macao]. There are supermarket chains that are adjusting because they opened on the wrong places and simply closed and changed to other zones.”
The official, who spoke to journalists on the sidelines of the company's 50th anniversary, said the market has changed and that there are some economic sectors that are reducing the number of spaces, not just supermarkets.
"Macao has about 680,000 inhabitants, but about 100,000 people do not usually live in the territory. The [supermarkets] number is too excessive, and the situation is similar in markets," he said. Vang Kei Hong provides foods and goods to retailers, restaurants, hotels and resorts.
Its president also gave the example of banks, who are closing branches. In your opinion, this does not mean a scenario of economic retreat, but simply a strategy change, given that there are more and more online services that customers can enjoy.
Neighborhoods suffer
Asked about the panorama of the economy in the relationship with the social sector in the first half, IP Sio Man argued that the results are varied, with tourism to record a breakthrough. However, he said that traders in community neighborhoods, where there is less tourism, continue to suffer from the lack of customers.
For this reason, IP Sio Man argues that Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) themselves have to change their commercial strategy. The businessman believes that in the second half of this year, the business environment can improve, as Hong Kong has revealed prosperous growth, and Macau has also had a larger number of tourists.
IP SIO MAN, therefore, indicated that SMEs have to focus on ways to attract tourists consumption. "I don't think it's a matter that tourists don't want to spend money. They just consume products that guarantee them the best cost-benefit ratio," he added.
One of the examples referred to by the entrepreneur is the bitter tea brand in the interior of China Wanglaoji, which registered an increase in sales to about 30 containers, while in previous years sales were only one digit.</description><pubDate>2025-07-03 23:28:05</pubDate></item><item><title>Cape Verdeans who learned to manage casinos in Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/03/os-cabo-verdianos-que-aprenderam-a-gerir-casinos-em-macau/</link><description>A group of 17 Cape Verdeans went to study in Macao, with the aim of integrating the management of a Casino Hotel under construction on the beach. Nine years later, the work was over and most emigrated.
In November 2016, Belany Lopes, then 22, wore the skin of 'Croupier' and, behind a table, separated and scattered chips of different colors, methodically, through the green cloth while numbers. “I was doing Blackjack calculations. At first it looks difficult, but with practice it is easy! It's interesting,” he told Lusa, months after reaching the Chinese region to study at the then Macao Polytechnic Institute.
Nine years later, Belany Lopes recalls that she decided to register for the Business Management Degree, variant in game management and amusement, partly “due to the promise of already having a guaranteed job”.
"Any young man who comes from a more humble family and goes to the university will think that the job is certainly the main focus," said the young woman, who had given up a biochemistry course in Brazil.
The lost venture
In 2015, the Macau Legend group had signed an agreement to build a tourist project at the Santa Maria Island and Gamboa waterfront, in Praia, which included a 25 -year concession contract. It was the largest tourist venture for the country, scheduled for 2019 and an estimated investment of 250 million euros - about 15 percent of the annual economy of Cape Verde.
Shortly after they arrived, Cape Verdean students had a dinner with Macau Legend leader, businessman David Chow Kam Fai. “He told us that when we finished the course, the Cabo Verde-Casino Hotel would be ready,” recalls Lania Fernandes. “In the first year, it has always been very reinforced that we were important, that we would be the first, that there was a plan for us,” says Belary Lopes.
But in April 2019, the Cape Verdean government agreed to review the deal, with Macau Legend to promise to invest 90 million euros in a first phase of the project, opening in 2021.
In January 2020, most young people were in Cape Verde on vacation when Macau decided to end all schools to try to control the new coronavirus. Cape Verdeans finished the course with classes only online. “We didn't have any undergraduate ceremony,” laments Jeremiah Fortes Vaz.
The current Polytechnic University of Macao (then Polytechnic) confirmed to Lusa that the degree in Business Management, variant in gambling and amusement, has not since received any student from Cape Verde.
Lania Fernandes stresses that the Polytechnic staff still tried to help Cape Verdeans get work in the Macao casinos. "But because of Covid, we didn't do that," laments the young woman.
Macau Legend suffered a new setback in November 2020, when the Cape Verde financial regulator rejected the company's request to create the Sino-Atlantic bank. "They have always remained very optimistic. But many people always said that perhaps if that bank was not approved, the project would not walk," recalls Jeremiah Fortes Vaz.
Many dropouts
The newly granted still sought work in the archipelago, but eventually gave up. “I left Cape Verde's interior to go to Macau, then came back, but had no contacts. I speak four languages, sent curriculum to different sites, got one or two interviews. After a year in it, I thought, 'Here's nothing to me,'” explains Fortes Vaz.
Lania Fernandes was internship at the Family Ministry, Inclusion and Social Development, for ten months, through the Institute of Employment and Vocational Training. "I have dreams, I have ambitions. I can't stay in Cape Verde to win 20,000 shields [181 euros] a month," says the young woman.
Both Lania and Jeremiah Fortes Vaz eventually emigrated in 2022 to Massachusetts in the northeast of the United States. But do not regret the passage through China.
“My trip to Macao has changed my life completely,” says strong Vaz. “I learned things I took to life, different cultures, gastronomy, how a first world city works. So everything was worth it,” he says.
For Belany Lopes, the degree in Macao led to a master's degree in Hungary and a work at a wind turbine manufacturer in Portugal. “Everything I learned at the university, with the people I met in Macau, I feel they opened the doors to be where I am today,” says Cape Verdean.</description><pubDate>2025-07-03 23:19:44</pubDate></item><item><title>Massages | Detained for obliging maid to masturbate customers</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/03/massagens-detidos-por-obrigar-empregada-a-masturbar-clientes/</link><description>Two brothers, local residents, were arrested on Tuesday on suspicion of obliging a maid of a massage salon in the Nam Van zone to masturbate customers.
The Judicial Police received the complaint of the employee, a non-resident worker of Indonesian nationality, on June 3. According to the report of the police authorities, quoted by the newspaper or Mun, the massage hall was opened in May last year and about two months later the complainant was hired through an employment agency.
From September, the suspects will have begun to ask the maid to masturbate customers. The center received 1680 patacas for each massage with “happy ending”, while the victim received 150 patacas.
The complainant indicated to the authorities that she felt she had no choice to deny the order, since she had to pay the employment agency commission and feed the family. As such, since then, it will have provided the “extra service” about 100 times. The two brothers, who refused to collaborate with the PJ, were referred to the prosecutor on suspicion of the crime of lenocym.</description><pubDate>2025-07-03 01:19:04</pubDate></item><item><title>Real Estate | Number of transactions drops to half 2024</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/03/imobiliario-numero-de-transaccoes-cai-para-metade-de-2024/</link><description>Within a year, the number of housing transactions has dropped to less than half, taking into account data from the first half of June. In turn, the average price of the square meter had a reduction of 29 percent
 
In the first half of June the number of housing purchases and sales fell more than half compared to the same period, with a total of 80 transactions. The numbers were revealed yesterday by the Directorate of Finance Services (DSF).
According to the data presented, the first 15 days of June recorded 80 transactions, of which 53 took place on the Macao Peninsula, 25 in the mud and two in Coloane.
Compared to the same period, 77 transactions had been recorded on the Macau Peninsula, 59 in the mud and eight in Coloane.
The real estate market situation shows a slowdown not only in relation to the number of transactions, but also at the average value of the square meter, which sank 29 percent.
In the early days of June, the average price of the square meter was 65,618 patacas, with the average to be 67,332 patacas in the Macao peninsula and 61,813 patacas in the mud. Coloane's average price was not specified as the number of transactions was less than three, which leads to the data not published for privacy reasons.
In comparison, in the first half of June last year the average housing value was 92,439 patacas per square meter. In the peninsula the average square meter was 82,718 patacas, in the mud of 105,106 patacas and in coloane of 102,862 patacas.
More stabilized
If the comparison only takes into account the first half of May this year, the market is in a situation of greater stability, both at the level of transactions and the value of the square meter.
In terms of the number of transactions, the beginning of June presented an increase in two purchases and housing sales compared to the first half of May, from 78 transactions to 80 transactions, a growth of about two percent.
In May, 66 housing purchases and sales had been registered on the Macao Peninsula, nine in the mud and three in Coloane.
In terms of prices, the market presented a six percent devaluation of the average value of the square meter. In May, the average value was 69,634 patacas per square meter. However, in early June it did not go beyond the 65,618 patacas. In early May, 66 transactions were recorded on the Macao Peninsula, nine in the mud and three in Coloane.</description><pubDate>2025-07-03 01:17:41</pubDate></item><item><title>Zelensky vs Zelensky</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/31/zelensky-vs-zelensky/</link><description>10/27/22
A renovated Ukrainian, with the same name of the president, guilty Zelensky about the extension of the conflict that destroyed his village. Zelensky, the village, who has never left his land, now lives mortified because his favorite gravedigger died in the bomber.
This Zelensky, the village, represents half the world that reproves the other Zelensky, the villain, for not wanting to negotiate with Putin.
Negotiate what? The invader enters us through the house, pies us the wife and daughter (cf. recent UN report on Ukraine violations in this “special operation”), an act that forced us to watch, and then we say: Alto there, we are for peace, but we have to negotiate: You have not said the name you want to give to children!
A peace that is not worthy is but a cessation of rights. As severe as Russophobia that Putin inflicts his people.

In a lunch with several guests I hear a friend, who declares himself a spiritist, explaining about the particularities of his belief, in a serene and balanced way, would even say, without "irrationalism". He discussed long and serenely, devoid of any fanatical proselytizing. “Here is someone to whom belief brought weighting!” I thought, a rare alliance.
However, at one point a phrase that horrify me. He says, “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!” And I enter the voracious fauces of holism. Because holismo has a pathological aspect like all good things, a side of shadow.
Two examples: In Hinduism there is less sensitivity to existential dramas, if that child suffers in this life this is only an expression of the strict karmic symmetry, an effect of the acts she committed in her previous life. In Africa it is not accepted that death may have been accidental, and many women are accused by the dead family of having caused her husband's death, in an act of manifest dementia, and, in the blatant majority of cases, in a huge injustice to his wife - madness that spreads and infiltrates the social fabric.
Buddhism has introduced compassion and Christianity to Caritas, trying to break with this logic, but in many other beliefs and religions the cage of causalities prevails over sensitivity to experience, the need to respond to the now.
It is a tremendous logic that transforms the world into a platonic stage, where we are just the shadows of something -an inextricable law -in a determinism that calcines all singularities, but strangely fascinates many.
The conquest of modernity has anchored in the conquest of chance and random, subtracting the incidences of a life to this fierce determinism that closed the world in a web. When the Renaissance freed the body from the influence of the stars, at this moment sexuality was relieved of guilt and individualism and their volition could emerge.
There is an unequivocal moral implication in the phrase “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!”, Which should work as a key to self-knowledge and self-judgment, but usually this phrase is managed to seek a reason for things abroad from us in the other. It is an alibi.
There is a holistic temptation in the world today, as in the Middle Ages there was a satanic temptation, without great reflection on its consequences. Because it is not enough we want to connect everything in a resonant chain of affection. Even the most unexpected: affection itself can kill.
I realize, thanks to this cultured, balanced, intelligent woman, that “the combat” moved at the beginning of this century. One of the great misconceptions of the twentieth century was the false dichotomy between "rationalism and irrationalism", a debate that extended to all fields, including art. First, rationality was confused (the positive side of reason) with rationalism (the pathological feature of reason), and articulated in this lack of discernment was confused irrationalism with freedom. Almost all the art of the twentieth century, with surrealism to the head, worked in this error. The fallacy still exists despite having consolidated the emergence of 'irrationalism' and the consequent relativist currents that followed it. Essentially much of what happened in the twentieth century, it turned around this shock between two paradigms: rationalism versus irrationalism.
Now, I see, the indetermination, chance, the random of the terrible temptation of the causal cage. Holism, in its pathological feature, can be the reductionism that is the way it puts the way as a new 'eschatological narrative'.
Is it "by chance" that the holism emerges at the moment when neo-liberalism and its cynical contempt for the human person besides all freedoms, all acquired rights?
Holistic consciousness has brought positively a greater ecological awareness but followed by scholastic rigor drifting reality under the blanket of a determinism that is much more than inconvenience: all great authoritarian ideologies are holistic.
My friend will know how to combine her holistic and transpersonal belief with the freedom and responsibility that every moment asks us - but how many will make the destruction, under a law that explains and encompasses everything?
How many will not be abandoned to what it is?
The awareness of the indeterminate brings tragic conscience, as the Greeks knew, but also brings the will and the courage of the decision. And of this we cannot abdicate.
In addition, as Drummond shows in Carlos Drummond de Andrade's poem “Quadrilha”:
"John loved Teresa who loved Raimundo/ who loved Maria who loved Joaquim who loved Lili/ who did not love anyone./ John went to the United States, Teresa to the convent,/ Raimundo died of disaster, Maria stayed to aunt,/ Joaquim suicide himself and Lili married J. Pinto Fernandes/ who had not entered the story."
Real always runs outside the track, in full exteriority to our concepts. This is what is worth a J. Pinto Fernandes at the exact moment we thought we had everything under control.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Nobel and others</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/17/do-nobel-e-outros/</link><description>9/10/22
Reading many people's reactions when the Nobel Prize in this year's literature was announced, I couldn't help but remind me of this repair of Jean-Pierre Siméon, in relation to another Nobel Prize: “An editor of a large national newspaper wrote five lines of indignation because the Nobel Prize for Literature, a complete stranger. But unknown to whom? How did not occur to this patented and paid literary columnist to do his work, that his apparent ignorance was a matter of incorrect professional conduct? Tranströmer was translated into many languages, it was available in French. »
There is always the choir of those who wait for the announcement of the prize to complain about not being invited to the jury of the prize, there is a subgroup of Irados that professes “never read and I will not bother to read”; It is an uncommon fauna, which inhabits social networks.
I don't always know all the winners-I was unaware of the existence of Louise Glück, who I find a great poet, or the Olga Tokarczuk, for example-but it only brings me the comfort of knowing that the world is not a soap opera where everyone knows each other and the joy of recognizing that the gauge of the world is not measured with my short measure and that on the contrary it gives me a new opportunity to face the unknown.
And perhaps the most cretin of reactions was the smart one who wrote, but there are still those who read French? Confirming only that today there is a new kind of ignorance that fires with a displeasure: the one who only read English.
I would also prefer that, in French, Pascal Quignard, Linda reads, or even Sollers, or, among the new ones, Mathias is awarded, but that does not take dignity to the work of Annie Ernaux (and it would be enough to have written the “Les Années”). There are books of her that I like less, like the vulgar "a simple passion," but this happens with almost every authors, they have a channel books and others that are like intervals in their itinerary. I advise reading a beautiful book of interviews with her, "L'Ecriture Comme un couteau".

Yesterday came an article in Maputo's morning “News”, realizing that the Pen Club narrative prize was assigned to my wife, Teresa Noronha, for her soap opera “Tornado”, which had already had the Maria Velho da Costa award.
The summary they made of the book does not even deserve comments, by pathetic, but what matters to highlight is the note of disqualification as to their "Mozambicanity" by calling it Luso-Mozambican. It is not inaccurate, but for those who know the context, it is a dirty touch.
Because finally, following the same logic, Adelino Timóteo should be called Tsonga-Mozambican, to Álvaro Taruma-Mozambican, and Macua-Mozambican to the writers who are from the north, etc., etc. Which is not reported to happen.
The given moment in the soap opera, she writes:
«Our color has never been dominant. In colonial time we were not white, we were ripped from monories, gone mugs, the pejorative term to speak of a son of Goes and Portuguese. In the postcolonial period, I was not black and if, in Lisbon, they took me by Brazilian or Cape Verdean, already in France were lost in cogitations of where they would be and amazed when they found out it was African. There I had to explain my DNA's wanderings before relying on moorms. It took me a long time to accept that it was so because yes, and that it was no curse that were so; On the contrary, I could even discover intense patterns of fantasy and freedom in this shrewd cloak that is our genealogy… »
In the current Mozambique it is white… and this is overlapping it soon to what it does or what it is.
It is sad, but as Naipaul warned, through these stops the race is everything and is soaked in it as deeply as, elsewhere, in religion.

Bruno Latour, an anthropologist who studied the sciences and their procedures and legitimations, law, technique and religions died and entertained themselves to turn the guts to the dogmas of the “modern”. For him the place, the expert's function, was more defined by the perplexity he embodied than for the supposed truth he would support him.
He proposed, as an alternative to the kinds of multiculturalism and his mistaken password "all different all the same", the return to "diplomacy", given precisely, not from the presupposition that "we are unified because participants of the same nature" but simply reveal that we "do not yet share an ordinary world"; It is necessary to deal frontally with the "abyss of disagreement" that separates us, rather than wanting to delude it.
And about politics said, disassessedly:
«If transparency is required from the politician, we kill him; If one requires fidelity to what the other was or he says, kills him; If a mimetic relationship is required between what the crowd wants and what its representative says, the representation is killed. These must, therefore, by definition, betray, deceive, modify, distort the word. Without this ability to double the word and betray, political language would not exist. I put the perfectly plausible hypothesis that political vocabulary will become as inaccessible as the religious language of the last twenty, three or fifty years. (in “UN Monde Pluriel plus Commun”). I believe it will be missed to decipher this frantically complex world that fit us.</description><pubDate>2022-10-17 02:18:03</pubDate></item><item><title>The yo -yo</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/30/o-fuxi/</link><description>O my friends, companions of these funerals trips to countries as old as the stars and the moon, and as strange as the profound interior of our disgraceful souls, - that startle still awaits us, what secret spells we will have to overcome, what horrors will rise to our dilated pupils of amazement and terror?

O human human, who cries superior to his own nature, but then reveals to you, once and again, unable to simply order your existence and do not understand that you are possessed by the fickle wrath and are slave to your own ambition! Do not be content with the white jade or the light gold, there is no treasure that gives you your inextinguishable thirst for other men, animals and things; for in you an eternal anguish in you; in you crawl the expelled snakes; For you grows, powerful and impossible, the very fertile ivy of evil!
This is perhaps why on the mound they call the white deer, where one of the eight immortals in sacred mount was evolved through the skies to Penglai, inhabits the fuxa, a bird whose form resembles that of the rooster, although topped by a human head. What strange copulas, what monstrous amplexes, what terrible procedures will have occurred to make the existence of this animal sinister possible?

«Every man morally is one and absolute; But you have to live with your personality to mitigate. (…) Coexistence is only possible among people reduced to a negative or hollow presence, which is constantly giving in. Hence, the emptiness of society, a huge ghost composed of numerous deceased. An upper man is antisocial or criminal. Its destination is jail and desert.
He is in thinking about whether she reflects here about the political-social conditioning that gagging, and worse, in a sad country as Portugal was in the middle of the Estado Novo (and the book is from 1931) where any possibilities of spontaneity and frankness in human relations were coarcet, or only lends the behavior of men (oppressed) a metaphysical frame, a “essence”, from a presumption of each one in the presumption of each one be in isolation “one and absolute”. Sometimes, to an excess of spirituality (or longing), it adds to Pascoaes to lack the world. He is a great poet, but he is a poet who takes gray-Jewish ampoules and is therefore written amiiude on a programmatic furor, ceasing to have pores; There is often a glass between him and the real, the same one who made him wring the Ballet, 1921: “Everything is ghost. There are only clouds, clouds of voices, clouds of souls, afflictions and tragedies! Clouds and more clouds, appearances and more appearances! It is a divine lightning that pierces them, the instant appearance that arises and throws us to the ground, dazzled! »
Sometimes I would like to remind him, as Antonio Sérgio did in the article “Regeneration and Tradition, Moral and Economy”, which dedicated to Easter: “Easter, Easter my dear friend: You are a pure, excellent and noble poet, but also a victim of this social environment, like us all: this horrible isolation that you praise and I”.
"As a child, he stole two melos," says Jacinto do Prado Coelho, stole him from a nest, and throb his lifetime remorse for it. The person, few more mischief is known to him. Only in Álvaro de Campos sprouts a twinge of evil and obscenity: “Oh, and ordinary and dirty people who always seem the same,/ who employs profanity as usual words,/ whose children steal at the grocery door/ and whose daughters at eight years-and I think this is beautiful and I love him! -/ masturbate decent -looking men on the stairs. » (Ode triumphal).
Both poets beaten by a certain idea of ​​holiness, they were identical to the inability of breaking the siege of the skin with the overflow of the dike, the same curse of sublimating Eros's concrete ferocity with the mansuity of the verses.
Of course, they are the two "Bigger Than Life", but sometimes unnerves to watch, from my hostor's post at the Procrastinators Club, to the tantrums between them, just to see who occupies, in the internal organization, the place of president and treasurer.

"What Washington designates as 'reciprocal tariffs' about its trading partners is a unilateral intimidation practice, to which China has always opposed," Tutelae spokesman He Yongqian said at a press conference.
According to the official, Beijing "has taken a note of the situation and is assessing it", stressing that China encourages the parties to solve economic and commercial differences "based on equality and through dialogue", but firmly rejects agreements that harm their interests.
"If such a situation is confirmed, China will be resolutely adopted and will protect its legitimate rights and interests," he said.
On Wednesday, US President Donald Trump announced on social networks a tariff agreement with Vietnam to reduce to 20 percent customs imposed at April to imports from that Southeast Asian country, but raises to 40 percent on Hanoi-re-exported goods and originating from third countries.

During a meeting held on Wednesday in Brussels, with the head of European Union diplomacy, Kaja Kallas, Wang Yi argued that China and the EU “should not be seen as opponents for their differences, nor seek confrontation due to their disagreements,” according to a statement released yesterday by his ministry.
The day before, Kallas argued that Beijing should no longer threaten European security, pointing out alleged cybers, interference in democratic processes and unfair business practices. "Europe faces several challenges," said Wang Yi, adding that none of them, "in the past, present or future," was caused by China.
Alternative via
Chinese diplomacy head sought to present his country as a counterweight to Donald Trump's administration, which threatened to impose widespread tariffs on European imports. “The path followed by the United States should not be used as a mirror of China,” said Wang. "China is not the United States," he said.
According to the statement of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, both sides also addressed international issues such as the War in Ukraine, the Israelo-Palestinian conflict and the Iran's nuclear program.
Beijing and Brussels should act based on “mutual respect,” defended Wang Yi, appealing to a more “active and pragmatic” European policy in relation to China. Wang also met on Wednesday with the President of the European Commission, Ursula Von Der Leyen, and Belgian Foreign Minister Maxime Prevot.
Wang told both parts that China and EU should “defend multilateralism and free trade” and cooperate over global challenges such as climate change. The Chinese diplomat now goes to Germany and then to France, where he will meet with French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot, who visited China in March.
These visits precede the China - EU Cimeira, which will bring together in Beijing Chinese President Xi Jinping and several senior European responsible.</description><pubDate>2025-07-03 23:40:11</pubDate></item><item><title>USA / China | Closed agreement that provides for rare land and chip design software</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/03/eua-china-fechado-acordo-que-preve-envio-de-terras-raras-e-de-software-de-design-de-chips/</link><description>The two nations resumed the path of understanding last month in Geneva
 
United States and China formalized a commercial understanding reached last month in Geneva, which includes Beijing's commitment to resume rare land exports, US Secretary of Trade, Howard Lutnick said.
According to Lutnick, the agreement was signed two days ago and consecrates the terms negotiated between Washington and Beijing throughout this year after successive mutual accusations of violation of previous agreements. "They will give us rare lands and, when they do, we will raise our contracted," he said in an interview with Bloomberg.
Siemens AG, one of the world's leading semiconductor design software suppliers, has been released by the United States Department of Commerce from the need to request licenses to operate in the Chinese market, according to the German company in a statement.
Export restrictions had been imposed in May, as part of a package of measures adopted by the United States in response to Chinese limitations on rare land exports.
Siemens has confirmed that it has restored full access to its software and technology for Chinese customers. The other two main world companies in the Electronic Design Automation Software sector (EDA) - Cadence Design Systems Inc. and Synopsys Inc. - They have not yet responded to commenting on whether they received similar communications, according to Bloomberg news agency. The United States Department of Trade has not commented either, the agency added.
The rare lands are crucial materials used in the production of wind turbines, aircraft, semiconductors and advanced technology. Under the commercial agreement last week, Washington has committed to authorizing the shipping to China's chip software, ethane and jet engines, as long as Beijing meets the promise of accelerating the approval of critical mineral exports.
An White House official confirmed that the two countries agreed with the terms necessary to apply the Geneva Agreement. The China Embassy in Washington refused to comment, while the Chinese Foreign Ministry did not respond immediately.
Markets applaud
The signing of the agreement generated optimism in the markets: Asian shareholders and European futures have advanced, and a global stock index has reached a new historical maximum.
Lutnick indicated that US President Donald Trump intends to conclude, by July 9, a series of ten commercial agreements with major US partners. "We will close the ten main agreements, organize them by categories, and the other countries will align after that," he explained.
Although he did not specify which countries involved, Trump suggested yesterday that the US is close to an understanding with India. The main Japanese negotiator, Ryosi Akazawa, also has scheduled meetings in the US capital, and reiterated that Japan "cannot accept" 25 percent tariffs on cars.
Trump has already stated that, in the absence of agreements until July 9, he will send "letters" to each country with the proposed terms, applying unilateral tariffs - the so -called "reciprocal tariffs", which may reach up to 50 percent. Most of these measures were announced on April 2, but suspended for 90 days to allow negotiations.
The actual scope of the agreements remains uncertain, as commercial pacts usually require years of negotiations. An earlier agreement with the UK, for example, continues with pending issues, including tariffs on imported metals.
Out
The agreement now reached with China does not address more sensitive topics, such as fentanyl trafficking or full access from US companies to the Chinese market.
The first round of negotiations in Geneva resulted in a rate reduction by both parties, but was quickly followed by mutual accusations of non -compliance. After new talks in London this month, negotiators announced an understanding, subject to the approval of Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping.
According to Lutnick, the survey of US counterfeit depends on the effective arrival of the rare land. This week, the US Department of Commerce has already authorized ethane loading to China, although its landing remains conditioned on specific authorization.</description><pubDate>2025-07-03 23:39:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Timor-Leste | PR IMPACORA Ambassador of Portugal</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/03/timor-leste-pr-condecora-embaixadora-de-portugal/</link><description>The president of Timor-Leste, José Ramos-Horta, yesterday awarded the necklace of the Order of Timor-Leste the Portuguese Ambassador in Dili, Manuela Bairos, and the European Union ambassador, Marc Friedrich, who will cease duties in the country.
"Ambassador Friedrich and Ambassador Bairos were true partners in the course of our nation towards prosperity and international recognition," said the president, quoted in a statement.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) said yesterday that it provides 3.9 percent economic growth for this year in Timor-Leste and insisted that the government should give priority to quality expenses in infrastructure, health and education sectors.
"Growth is expected to remain robust, being 3.9 percent by 2025, supported by tax expansion and strong credit growth, predicting a slowdown to 3.3 percent in 2026," Carrière-Swallow said, who led the IMF team, which ended a visit to the country yesterday.
The team arrived in the country on June 19 to make discussions under Article IV of 2025. "Inflation, which had fallen sharply last year due to the descent of global food and energy prices, should moderately increase by rising international food prices," said Carrière-Swallow. The IMF predicts that inflation is 0.9 percent this year and increases to 1.8 percent by 2026.
The financial organization, which held meetings with the Timorese authorities, private sector, development partners and civil society, also considers that the state budget for 2026 should give priority to “quality expenses in the areas of physical infrastructure and human capital, including health and education, while controlling recurring spending”.
"The government is rightly centered on the identification of measures to contain the public sector wage, which has grown sharply in recent years, and the implementation of an added value tax (VAT) from January 2027," says Carrière-Swallow.
Reform, it takes
The IMF recommends structural and budgetary reforms for 10 years to allow the Timorese government to support the development of the private sector through the gradual reduction of budgetary deficits to preserve debt sustainability.
"By 2026, the reforms we propose would be compatible with an expense envelope of about $ 1.85 billion to the central government," read the statement. In the statement, the IMF congratulates the government for “continuous progress in the reforms of the financial sector” at the level of legislation, “whose implementation will support the development of the private sector”.
"We also recommend accelerating the issuance of ownership securities and establishing a national digital identification system, crucial reforms to improve access to credit, diversify the private sector and increase the efficiency of public spending," adds the IMF.

Expense
The Timorese government set this week the expense for the state's general budget of 2026 by $ 1.85 billion, a significant reduction in 2025. At the end of last year, the Timorese Parliament approved the state's general budget proposal to 2025 worth $ 2.6 billion.
Predictions of the Timorese government point to an economic growth of 2.7 percent by 2026 and 4.3 percent for this year. Regarding inflation, the Ministry of Finance predictions indicate that the descending trajectory will continue in 2025, and it is expected to reach 1.8 percent, and to stabilize at 2 percent over the next five years.</description><pubDate>2025-07-03 01:41:30</pubDate></item><item><title>Alibaba launches offers of 6.5 mme to stimulate consumption</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/03/alibaba-lanca-ofertas-de-65-mme-para-estimular-consumo/</link><description>Chinese technology electronic trade platform Alibaba announced yesterday that it will provide $ 7 billion in offers for certain products in an attempt to stimulate domestic consumption.
TAOBAO, a platform launched by Alibaba in 2003 and leader of electronic trade in China, indicated, in a statement released through the Wechat social network, that the 50 billion Yuan will be attributed “directly to consumers and traders” over a period of 12 months, starting yesterday.
Incentive measures, focused mainly on the functionality of “lightning purchases” of the application, will include “red envelopes” -digital version of traditional monetary gifts -product discounts, free deliveries and commissions reductions for sellers.
According to the company, offers aim to "provide consumers experiences and preferential and more convenient services, further encouraging the vitality of consumption."
Combat ongoing
The decision arises at a time when Beijing tries to counteract deflationist pressures that threaten economic growth, in a scenario already marked by a prolonged crisis in the real estate sector, drop in exports and domestic consumption in slowdown.
Since last year, Chinese authorities have implemented several measures to boost internal demand, including cuts in interest rates, real estate stimuli and incentives for purchase of automobiles and electrodomestics.
The results, however, have been mixed: although retail sales - the main indicator of private consumption - have registered an acceleration in May, sales prices in the real estate continued to fall in that same period.
On Tuesday, Chinese President Xi Jinping called for efforts to “promote the construction of a unified national market” during a high level meeting on economic policy, according to the Xinhua official news agency.
During the meeting, the Chinese leaders also advocated a better regulation of “disordered competition based on low prices” between companies.
"At a time when the Chinese economy faces deflationary pressures and a fragile job market, the government seeks to respond to these challenges on the side of the offer," said Pinpoint President Asset Management, Zhiwei Zhang, after the meeting.

"By invitation, the Prime Minister of the Council of State, Li Qiang, will participate in the 17th BRICS Summit in Rio de Janeiro, July 5 and 08," said a spokeswoman for Chinese diplomacy, quoted in a statement.
The same source added that Li Qiang will then move to Egypt, where he will make an official visit between July 9 and 10, at the invitation of the Egyptian Prime Minister. This is the first time that Chinese President Xi Jinping is missing a summit of Brics Emerging Block leaders since reached power in 2013.
Chinese sources cited by the Hong Kong South China Morning Post newspaper reported that the fact that XI and Brazilian president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, had frequent meetings last year weighed on the decision.
The two leaders gathered during the G20 summit in Brazil last November, before a state visit to Brasilia. A few months later, Lula moved to Beijing to a meeting with Latin American countries and Caribbean. Xi rarely visits the same country two consecutive years, except Russia.
The absence of XI could weaken Beijing's efforts to reinforce China's global influence through the BRICS group and build an alternative to the United States's international order.
Growing
The summit could also provide to the Chinese leader a first meeting with Iran's guardians since the beginning of the war with Israel, after Tehran joined the block in 2024. Under Chinese leadership, the Brics group doubled in size last year, joining nine members with the entry of the United Arab Emirates, Iran, Egypt and Ethiopia, who joined Brazil, Russia, China, China and China and South Africa.
Lula is considered one of Xi's closest partners in the international level, along with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Open, there is the possibility of Xi Jinping to participate in the United Nations Climate Conference, which will be held in Brazil later this year, although Beijing has not yet confirmed the trip.</description><pubDate>2025-07-03 01:38:16</pubDate></item><item><title>Independencies | China greet Cape Verde and highlights solidity of the bilateral relationship</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/03/independencias-china-sauda-cabo-verde-e-destaca-solidez-da-relacao-bilateral/</link><description>Beijing greeted the former Portuguese colony for development in the last 50 years and has been open to continue to develop cooperation ties with the African country
 
China today greeted the 50th anniversary of Cape Verde's independence, highlighted the solidity of the bilateral relationship and said it was available to reinforce cooperation in areas such as infrastructure, education and health.
In a written response sent to Lusa, the Chinese Foreign Ministry has congratulated the archipelago by the birthday, which is marked Saturday, and said that the African country "has achieved important progress in its national development," wishing it continues to "move firmly on the path of revitalization."
In the note, it refers that relations between the two countries have been marked by “mutual political confidence” and “fruitful” results in multiple domains, in a partnership that both governments consider strategic.
"China is willing to work with Cape Verde to deepen pragmatic cooperation and apply the consensus achieved under the Beijing Cimeira of the China-Africa Cooperation Forum (FOCAC)," the ministry said.
In recent decades, China has consolidated its presence in Cape Verde through investments in public works, technical cooperation and assignment of scholarships. Among the projects funded by Beijing are the National Stadium and the new headquarters of the National Assembly.
Good partners
Speaking prior to the islands Express Weekly, former Cape Verdean Foreign Minister Rui Figueiredo Soares described China as "a safe and first-rate partner for the development of Cape Verde."
Cooperation extends to the area of ​​education, with more than a dozen scholarships annually by the Chinese government. Since 2010, hundreds of Cape Verdean students have attended higher education institutions in China, in areas such as Engineering, Medicine, Tourism and International Relations.
“I arrived 17 and felt right at home,” said Helder Fernandes, a natural Cape Verdean of Santiago Island, who studied computer engineering on the tropical island of Hainan, southern China, where he opened, however, a restaurant.
In the diplomatic plane, Cape Verde has reiterated his support to the “one China” principle, recognizing Beijing as the country's only legitimate government over Taipei. On the other hand, Cape Verde benefited from multiple debt by China - namely about 1.18 million euros in 2007 and 1.39 million euros in 2016 - and received technical support in the areas of agriculture, fishing and health, including sending medical teams and fishing projects.
Through FOCAC, Cape Verde has also sought to reinforce access to financing and external technical support, with a view to compliance with the objectives set in its strategic sustainable development plan.</description><pubDate>2025-07-03 01:37:02</pubDate></item><item><title>HK | Jimmy Lai in solitary</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/02/hk-jimmy-lai-em-solitaria-ha-mais-de-quatro-anos/</link><description>The Hong Kong government has ensured that Jimmy Lai Chee-Ying, founder of the pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily, has asked to be solitary since he was arrested four and a half years ago.

Today, Beijing seeks “alternative mechanisms” of cooperation in the “global south” and tries to build an alternative model to the World Health Organization
 
 
Let's start with the concept of Global Health Governance (GGS). Is this a more contemporary concept or relating to the post-war period and the Foundation of the World Health Organization (WHO)? What have been the main actors of this governance until China's growth?
GGS is a concept whose prominence and relevance have grown significantly in the 21st century, largely driven by economic globalization and worldwide interconnection. Although global health has always transcended national borders, demanding multidisciplinary approaches and international cooperation, only from the 1990s it was made greater awareness of it. Historically, GGS has been predominantly influenced by western powers and neoliberal values. The main actors of this governance, until China's growth, were historically marked by interventions of entities such as WHO and non-governmental, predominantly American and European organizations.
One of the findings of its doctoral thesis is that China has been progressively positioning itself in this leadership. This position started specifically when and why?
Yes, China has been progressively positioned as a relief actor in the evolution of the GG system. Although it is not possible to point out an exact date of start, China has evolved from a relatively isolated country to a main actor in global political, economic and technological arenas. Its growing economic and political influence also represents a change in GGS's historical dynamics, and in the 1960s China tried to play a humanitarian health care role in neighboring countries and Africa. The thesis points out that China's experience can be seen as an example of what is achievable when a state chooses its own way rather than a pre-established model, aligning itself with the 21st century prediction as the "century of Asia."
Did the pandemic years influence this position? How?
Covid-19 pandemic highlighted the need for global health cooperation, as well as the potential consequences of the failure to prioritize global health. The thesis explores the evolution of the Health Silk Route before and after the pandemic, indicating that the pandemic years allowed greater awareness of the need for instruments such as the Health Silk Route as the most effective cooperation platforms among nations. Although not detailed in this specific section, it is implicit that the pandemic intensified China's performance in health diplomacy and health development assistance.
Looking at the internal reforms that China has carried out in the health area, which highlights as the most important?
I approach, in the thesis, the reforms of the China Health System and I point out that the Chinese governance model is a unique combination of state -oriented economic reforms and development by the state, incorporating elements of neoliberalism and authoritarianism into political issues in general, and the health sector is nothing different from the rest. One of China's mentioned contributions, recognized by WHO, is its primary health care model based on the recognized good practice of “barefoot doctors” (barefoot doctors). In addition, the thesis analyzes the main reform policies and their progress and challenges in the period 2009-2018, which comprise the reforms of primary health care, hospital and pharmaceutical reform. The “Healthy China 2030” program is also an important and ambitious reference of China's domestic reforms in health, also encompassing social determinants.
Is Beijing's intention to create an alternative entity to WHO, or simply create an alternative movement that can coexist with WHO, in the context of the relationship with the global south? How could this work?
The thesis suggests that China adopts a "dual approach": while integrating in existing global structures, forging simultaneously alternative paths, particularly through regional alliances such as BRICS and partnerships with Global South. This indicates an intention to create an alternative movement that can coexist and complement the role of WHO, rather than a direct alternative entity. China demonstrates a clear commitment to align the objectives of the “Belt and Road” initiative with the united nations sustainable development objectives, showing their willingness to present these initiatives as complements to the existing cooperation mechanisms in the international liberal order. President Xi Jinping's view of a “future community shared for humanity”, which includes the notion of a “global health community for all”, also points to a new perspective in international cooperation.
Traditional Chinese Masks, Vaccines and Medicine (MTC): What are China's products or instruments to position itself as an increasingly global actor in GGS?
The thesis points out that China is an indispensable provider of global public health, essential for the product supply chain, such as masks and vaccines. The MTC is also mentioned as one of China's great contributions to global health governance, with its chinese herbal treatments, some of which already recognized by WHO in 2017. In addition, Chinese medical assistance and medical teams sent to other regions of the globe are important instruments of Chinese health diplomacy.
In creating an alternative movement or reality to WHO, China may be taking advantage of the lack of full representativeness in the same WHO, or gaps in its operation?
The thesis does not address directly whether China is taking advantage of a lack of full representativeness in WHO or gaps in its operation. However, it emphasizes that the work aims to fill a gap in scientific knowledge in relation to the paradigm of health governance from a non-western and liberal perspective, emphasizing China as an actor of the global south. This suggests that China seeks to strengthen alternative models that can offer more personalized health challenges, different from those defended by Western countries, positioning itself as a moderate reformist actor.
How has the European Union (EU) foreign policy in relation to China affecting or influenced this position of the country in global health governance?
In the thesis, the fourth publication, entitled "Challenges on the European Union-China Cooperation in Higher Education from" People-To-People Dialogue ’Perspective: The Case of Health-Related Joint Projects," explores cooperation in higher education, in particular that includes health-related projects. Therefore, despite the strategic and economic dialogue, the deterioration of UE-china bilateral relations intensified, with the commission to assume a decline of enthusiasm due to “China's countermeasures to EU human rights sanctions, economic coercion and commercial measures against the single market, and the positioning of China in the war in Ukraine”. Although challenges and tensions are recognized, cooperation in higher education, including health projects, is seen as part of a broader picture of strategic partnership between EU and China. However, it is evident that there is no long tradition of health cooperation between EU and China in higher education, and that there are few joint projects compared to the general panorama. It is suggested that both EU and China should make more efforts to align medical study curricula and promote more joint research in areas related to health, infectious diseases, among others.
In the Trump 2.0 era, and without pandemic, what could be China's role in global health governance?
Although the thesis is published this year, it focuses on the preceding period and includes the pandemic, where it does not speculate directly on a future scenario of “Trump 2.0” without pandemic. However, the thesis argues that China is not just a participant, but a moderate reformist force in the formation of global health standards. Regardless of future political scenarios, their growing economic and political influence, strategic health diplomacy, internal reforms and initiatives such as the Health Silk Route will continue to shape their role in global health governance. The view of a “global health community for all” also remains a guiding principle for China's efforts.
Does this power of China in GGS verify more with bilateral or multilateral agreements?
The thesis suggests that China's power in global health governance manifests itself through both bilateral and multilateral agreements, but with a growing emphasis on certain forms of cooperation that strengthen their role in the global south and through alternative mechanisms. Although the thesis does not explicitly quantify the predominance between bilateral and multilateral, the focus on regional alliances (BRICS) and partnerships with the Global South (which often involve bilateral agreements and group cooperation initiatives) and the Health Silk Route indicate a hybrid approach.</description><pubDate>2025-06-30 23:46:26</pubDate></item><item><title>Macao Forum | Secretary-General says it has never discussed widening to Hispanic countries</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/30/forum-macau-secretario-geral-diz-que-nunca-se-discutiu-alargamento/</link><description>In an interview with Lusa agency, the secretary general of the Macau Forum, Ji Xianzheng, assured that “never discussed” the widening of action to Hispanic countries, but that the willingness already stated by the government of Sam Hou Fai will have to be the authorities to decide a new direction to the cooperation strategy.
 
The Secretary-General of the Macau Forum stated that the institution “never discussed” the creation of an entity to extend to Hispanic countries to promote economic cooperation similar to those that provide the connection between China and Portuguese-speaking countries.
“Within the Macao Forum, we have never discussed this topic,” said the Forum Secretary-General for Economic and Commercial Cooperation between China and Portuguese-speaking countries Ji Xianzheng.
The official acknowledged that, "in society, there were some conversations to discuss or address the possibility of promoting more contact and cooperation with Spanish -language countries, but at the Forum level we have never addressed this theme."
The Macao executive announced in mid -April the intention of creating a center to promote economic services between China and the Portuguese and Spanish languages ​​in the neighboring special Economic Zone of Hengqin.
The idea is to provide companies in Hispanic countries services in the “linguistic, legal, fiscal, verification of compliance with norms, formation, arbitration and mediation”, according to the Secretary for Administration and Justice, André Cheong.
Days earlier, the chief executive, Sam Hou Fai, had also announced the intention of “promoting exchange and cooperation” through Macao, between China and the universe of Spanish -speaking countries.
Although Macau wants to widen focus to Castilian -speaking countries, “the forum will remain the forum for China and Lusophony countries,” said Ji Xianzheng. The secretary general clarified that the institution that directs "can contribute contributions to the greater opening of Macao in international cooperation", as is the intention announced by the new government of MSAR.
Complementary forum
Personally, the secretary general has ensured that he had “pleasing to work with all parties,” but stressed that this is a “decision that is up to central governments to make” and that the forum was never contacted in this regard.
"Yes, I worked in Latin America, Spain, nine years in Madrid and Caracas. But this is not a decision of personal interest, it is up to politicians to make the decision," he said, explaining that the idea will be to promote the relationship between Macao and Brazil and then to other Latin American countries, as well as expanding the relationship with Portugal to Spain.
"There is no limit. The Macao Forum is complementary. It does not restrict any promotion of the cooperation of the other parts," he said.
According to the Macao Government Communication Office, Sam Hou Fai admitted on June 21 that he postponed a trip to Portugal, scheduled for July, and should also pass through Spain and the European Union headquarters in Brussels.
Bad interpretations
In the same interview with Lusa, the Secretary-General of the Macao Forum imputed to national governments the responsibility for conducting development and economic cooperation policies, stressing that the institution “has no investment projects”.
Ji Xianzheng attributes criticism to the Macao Forum to an wrong interpretation regarding the body's mission. "The forum is a mechanism of cooperation between central governments. Many people think it is to the secretariat that it is up to the execution of policies, but we have a limited number of people," added Ji.
"The secretariat has no investment projects, it is a mechanism for preparing the ministerial conference, connecting with governments, not a promotion agency. It has not been thought of, connects with the promotion agencies. We are four people sent by China and one delegate for each country," he said.
At the last ministerial conference, in April 2024, then Portuguese Economy Minister Pedro Reis argued that the Portuguese Language China-Parais Cooperation and Development Fund should bet more on small and medium enterprises (SMEs).
The Cooperation Fund was created in 2013 by the China Development Bank and the Macao Industrial and Commercial Development Fund, with a thousand million dollars, of which about 60 percent have already been invested, according to the secretary general.
Action plans
Ji Xianzheng has admitted that SMEs are "a difficult theme for any government" and that "international cooperation for the promotion of development and cooperation of small and medium enterprises is even more difficult. It is a topic that is being debated daily worldwide." But admitted, "here, little."
"But it is stipulated in the action plan [2024-2026]. It is up to central governments and commerce chambers, promotion agents, to work together to do this. The secretariat assumes responsibility as authorized by the central governments, specifically, in the activities program," he said.
Politicians from various countries, including Portugal, Angola and Mozambique, have appealed to a change in the rules of the fund's candidacy. The current rules require, for example, that candidate projects have a minimum investment of five million dollars, and the fund only covers 20 percent of total investment, referring the rest to governments or companies.
Ji Xianzheng said the new fund's new direction "is committed to promoting a broader investment, with better coverage for all forum countries, [relatively] to projects that have a strategic or significant impact on the socioeconomic development of participating countries."
According to the secretary general, "the terms of application [of the rules of access to the background] will be more flexible and the forms of application will also be more diverse." “Instead of being just direct investment, they are also studying ways to apply the fund, in cooperation with other funds or with other financial institutions,” he gave as an example.
"This fund has an operation according to market rules. It is not a humanitarian aid fund. Therefore, it has to guarantee the minimum return of benefit. But, on that, they are very open to study, in this case, the conditions of each project," added Ji Xianzheng, but to give examples of "flexibilization of the rules."
Regarding the approximation of the China universe and countries of the Iberian Peninsula, already cemented in official speeches, economist Maria Fernanda Ilhéu, president of the Seda's New Route Association, told HM, earlier this month, that this intention is “very objective and pragmatic and can be summarized to the Macao economy diversification project, for which companies and investors are not only in Macao, but also from Macao, but also from Macao, but also from countries, but countries Portuguese Language ”.
"But the fact is that companies and institutions from Portuguese-speaking countries are not being effective in responding to this need for Macao. Therefore, widening companies and Spanish-speaking institutions this invitation to cooperation seems logical to me," the economist said.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Isabel Rio Novo, author of the biography of Luís de Camões: “Time in Macau was of tranquility”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/26/isabel-rio-novo-autora-da-biografia-de-luis-de-camoes-tempo-em-macau-foi-de-tranquilidade/</link><description>It will be launched tomorrow, at the Consulate General of Portugal in Macau and Hong Kong, the biography of Luís de Camões, by Isabel Rio Novo.

Why did you decide to get in the writing of another biography of Camões?
It is true that Luis Vaz de Camões has been biographed many times over 500 years. However, 50 years ago there was no biography about him. From my point of view and the editor, Camões deserved a more current biography that revised all kinds of prejudices, seeking known sources, the uncovered information research and where the rereading of all previous works were rereading. This biography is not only a summary, but also the reinterpretation of what has been known, but which had rarely been related. The book also brings some new data with some documentation that was discovered.
How was your relationship with the writing of Camões born?
I fell in love and went to those young readers who was not tormented with Camões. On the contrary, I liked it soon and let myself be seduced by Camões Lyric. I am from the areas of comparative literature and history, and in this sense I always understood the dimension and importance of the work of Camões.
And what are they?
It is a work and an author of its time and its time, which was extraordinary, with the Renaissance, Humanism and the travels of navigation. But at the same time, it is a work that is the product of an outstanding literary genius, one that we can tell a handful in the history of universal literature.
What camões we find in this biography?
I tried to go to the bottom, remove layers of the meaning that these 500 years were adding to Camões, in the sense that each season read its Camões and produced its interpretation. I wanted to discover the substrate, the man of flesh and bone he lived and wrote 500 years ago.
He was a man suffered, with many financial difficulties.
He was a man with a complex and difficult relationship with reality, not only of his time, but also with reality [itself]. The theme of the time, the disconcerting of the world, how society seems to work instead of what should work, being a literary topic of the Renaissance, it was something Camões felt personal and genuinely.
How?
He lived a series of disagreements, of extreme experiences. Suffice it to say that you have been stuck several times and for various reasons. He made great trips at a time when these were absolutely risky, long, and complicated enterprises. Camões was involved in military expeditions, and almost all his life was soldered. But this set of experiences allowed him to be almost everything someone could be at the time he lived.
He was one of the most traveled authors of the time, having been in Brazil, Goa…
Yes. Even the connection to Macau, which is contested by some scholars, but not by me… I am persuaded, given the existing documentation and indirect testimonies, which Camões passed through China with the position of Dead and Missing Provider. When this happened, albeit very incipiently, the Portuguese establishment in China, which was already Macao. It is not known whether Camões held this position assigned to him by Viceroy D. Francisco Coutinho, if he was exactly assigned to be a provider during the trip, or a provider at Macao's establishment. But what he knew from China was surely this little warehouse that Portugal had achieved, at a lot of cost, with great difficulty and after many attempts to obtain in China.
What did a deceased provider?
Whenever a Portuguese died in the East, a soldier or merchant, it was necessary to ensure the rights of the heirs, the families who were normally in Portugal. The provider had to identify the deceased, his naturalness, origin and make the heirs known. He also had to keep the deceased's assets before they were stolen, auction them, keep the coins that would result in, and then take it all to Lisbon. It was a process that, if it went well, took many months, because it was necessary to send this money to the authorities of Goa who later sent him in the career from India to Lisbon.
Can we talk about a period of stability in Camões's life in Macau?
Yes. Until this appointment as a deceased provider, everything Camões knew from the East had been as a soldier. As soon as Goa [1553] arrives weeks later in a first military expedition. We know why: Not because I had some war appeal, but because only participating in expeditions earned your welding. Although everyone said that the soldiers lived very poorly, the welding was what Camões had to survive. The time lived in Macao, when he was free from soldier obligations, was a time of tranquility regarding subsistence, which was assured. He had some time and calm to continue the work with "the Lusíadas." More than that, as much as the sources allow to deduce, Camões met in Macau a phase of balance in terms of personal and loving life, as, on the return trip, he brought with him, according to the testimony of Diogo do Couto, a Chinese girl.
Dinamene.
This was the term used by the chronicler. We don't know if it would be a Chinese or Asian girl. This girl with whom Camões lived maritally was someone who liked it very much, according to the testimony of Diogo do Couto. But Dinamene would certainly not be her name, as it was a mythological name that, by the way, Camões used in her lyric, even before she boarded the East. Chinese girls with whom soldiers and merchants in Macao lived amanced were baptized and received a Christian name. Therefore, Dinamene would even have a Christian and Portuguese name. But as we do not know her name, and if we are aware that we use a kind of metaphor, we can call it Dinamene.
She dies later on a trip and makes Camões very shaken.
On Macao's return trip to Goa, probably at the end of his mandate as a provider, Camões suffers the celebrated wreck, in which he loses the personal assets he had ease, including the assets of the deceased that he was guardian, and this will bring him complications. It also suffers the loss of dynamine. The wreck went with some in the seas of China, probably by the mouth of the Mekong River.
Considers unlikely to have lost part of "the Lusíadas."
The first biographers say Camões was saved from this wreck with a board. It is not unreasonable that he managed to save the manuscript of the Lusíadas on this board. But it is also no excluding that Camões knew his poem by heart. The memory of people in the sixteenth century was different. They were very used to keeping things from memory. And we know, because the proof is obtained in the work of Camões, that it had an extraordinary memory. I have a way to prove it, of course, that Camões is one of the rare authors who knew his poem by heart.
Do you think Camões had a lower life to his true talent?
Undoubtedly. According to a too extensive set of concordant testimonies, he dies poor, even in miserable conditions, and according to an eyewitness, without having a blanket with which he covered himself. On the other hand, Camões was known to follow the publication of the Lusíadas, who were commented and read [in the poet's life time]. We have the testimony of Faria de Sousa, one of the first biographers of Camões, which says that when he passed the streets, people stop and pointed. Camões also had a figure that stood out, with a leaked eye and using a pale. By then, I would be quite sick, using crutches. But there is a set of poets, which is very unreliable that they did not know Camões, who never refer to them. There are, on the other hand, other humanists, such as Pedro Magalhães Gândavo, who from the outset praises him as the prince of Portuguese poets.
But the king gives him a tendency for deeds provided and the publication of "The Lusíadas."
This famous tendency, which should not be a big deal, because all ancient biographers say it was derisive, is attributed to him as a kind of military reform, because of the 17 years of service in the East, and not as a reward for the publication of "The Lusíadas." D. Sebastião's mercy letter, which attributes him the title of nobleman knight, had no repercussion in practice, but gave him 15 thousand reais. [The publication of “the Lusíadas”] was an additional argument [for the letter] and not the main argument. This leads us to believe that D. Sebastião will not even have read or heard “the Lusíadas”, will have received indirect information, favorable about the poem.
How did the process of editing “Os Lusíadas” occurred?
It was an event, because both the press and the books that were published a year were a very small amount. In the year in which “the Lusíadas” are published were the only work of non -religious caress [to be edited]. Para custear a edição é mais que provável que Camões tenha tido o apoio de um mecenas, provavelmente D. Manuel de Portugal, da família dos Condes do Vimioso. Getting the work was a press was a mere and complicated process, as it had to go through the prior examination of the civil authorities, the royal authority and the censorship of the Inquisition. The resident of the Holy Office does not only let the book pass, but to make an amount of almost unprecedented compliments in the license that authorizes the publication of the work. If we go to the opinions emitted by the same rear, there is no other work on which he is as compliments as it was with the epic of Camões.
In Indonesia, he befriended a slave on the island of Java.
Camões was, at least once, on the island of Ternate, Indonesia, in the archipelago of molucas, at a time when there were conflicts motivated by an extremely cruel Portuguese captain towards the king or sultan of Ternate, which originated a kind of war between the Portuguese and the places. Camões has a song that describes the island of Ternate. We do not know if it was at this time, or in another passage to the Far East, that Camões turned on to a Jaú, or Javanese, but could not be exactly from the Far East, but a freed slave who had been linked by friendship to Camões. And this is because in one of the first biographies of Camões it reads that Jaú, with the Christian name António, asked for alms at night. This freedom of movements of a slave indicates that he would probably be a freed slave. He asked for alms to Camões, for himself and the mother of Camões, with whom Camões will have lived in recent years of life.</description><pubDate>2025-06-26 23:30:50</pubDate></item><item><title>Filipe de Saavedra, Teacher: “A Camões Interpretative Center in Macau is missing”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/21/filipe-de-saavedra-docente-falta-um-centro-interpretativo-de-camoes-em-macau/</link><description>Professor at the University of Science and Technology of Macao and a scholar of the presence of Camões in Asia, Philip de Saavedra understands that Macau is missing an interpretative center about the poet's life and work. The academic spoke yesterday at the National Library in Lisbon, about the correspondence written by Luís de Camões in Asia
 
He participated yesterday at the “from Lisbon to Goa: What the Letters of Camões” participated. What path does the East arise portrayed in these letters, and who were directed?
The letters Camões wrote from Asia are in the order of the dozens. There is in them scholarship, philosophy, and also a lot of humor, sarcasm, and satire of humanist nature. Some were written from Ternate, others from Malaca, Macau, probably others from Cambodia, to recipients in India and Portugal. With the exception of the letters of Goa, where the identification of the writing site is generally present, maping those that were written during the rest of it would be a complex task. They are only given as written in Asia.
Can you give examples of written letters in this context?
I mention here two of the first he sent to the kingdom. The epistle whose first line is “The Poet Simony speaking” was written in January 1554, when Camões has just arrived in Goa, destined for his pupil, D. António de Noronha. It is a very emotional letter, giving it the storm that had plagued the Armada in the Cape of Good Hope, "seeing the death of the before me." Camões survived this limit experience aboard the São Bento ship, the only one to arrive that year to Goa, and which was lost in the turn of the Christmas lands, dying in this second bid the Captain Fernão de Álvares Cabral, and many of those who traveled with him. In addition to the news of his salvation, the poet was equally eager to tell his friend the expedition of D. Afonso de Noronha to Malabar, in which he had taken part in the previous month. In Irenal pages, Camões vehemently condemns the massacre of the few native troops by the “thick armed” of the disproportionate vice-king army. In his radical compliment of peace, the poet calls "true remedy" to the early death that cure the war crazes of those who want to live "by knights", for "who will walk by following the fero Mars always brings their eyes to their danger." Cruelly prophetic words: by irony of fate, at the moment the poet wrote these lines and sent them, that recipient diletus, for whose life he feared, already lay, lying during a military foray in Ceuta on April 29, 1553, only 17 years old.
And the second letter?
A year later, in January 1555, he wrote to a friend a different epistle in tone and in purpose, whose first line is "I wished so much", where he evoked the shock he suffered from the death of D. António, gathering a sonnet that had composed to his memory. It is clear that Camões also had great intimacy with this correspondent, who knew D. António and the poetry of Camões, Petrarch and Boscán. Interestingly, the letter includes some male lines, which Camões says they are mandatory in private letters, containing what can be called a resort conversation, so being worship or scholar did not prevent it if it were "bon vivant".
The presence of Camões in Macau is still wrapped in a certain myth. What are the concrete tests of your presence in the territory?
It is necessary to separate the waters. The landing of Camões in Patane's busty, then called “cave”, is surrounded by a beautiful legendary aura. But the presence of Camões in Macao, this is not involved in "myth", is a factual and historical reality, founded on a wide variety of testimonies, all independent of each other. Insisting on a chronology that contained in the sources, but which was flagrantly erroneous, it was deliberately sought to confuse the doubts that could have about his permanence in the sinned, although unjustified, with false doubts about the poet's stay in Macau, which are laughable and devoid of the minimum foundation. The joke ran a swimming, and little by little it was embedded in the collective imagination, to the point that some less informed people take it for a supposed “discovery” recent. However, nonsense was released in 1907, and soon dismantled in 1911 by Jordan de Freitas. Judge Eduardo Ribeiro put more “points in the iis” in this regard. In your time I will publish the full documentation about the presence of Camões in Macao, putting a definitive end to the mythical “myth”.
What life did Camões in Macau?
We can say that these two years were those of the greatest professional, economic and affective in his life. Is it written poetry? Constantly, as the dimension of the work attests. A significant part of “the Lusíadas” was composed here, although the poem had neither began nor ended in Macao. Not least in his life was that it was in Macao who publicly assumed a relationship with a young Chinese, most exactly the Tanka ethnicity of poor fishermen. This asymmetrical connection is not surprising and with a modest young woman: only disadvantaged families would not prevent daughters from relate to foreigners. This explains the fact that she left with Camões in 1565 to Goa, with concubine status. But the private vessel in which they followed, belonging to Chinese merchants, suffered a wreck by Cambodia, and Camões lost there the “kind lamp I loved so much”. It was only after his death that he would come to chrisma as Denamene, a Greek nymph of the waters, so that she could live forever in the ocean. The Chinese of Macao have a special relationship with Camões, such as the Portuguese and the Macanese.
How is this relationship?
It existed in the eighteenth century in Macao the first monument in honor of Camões, something that in Portugal only began to think about the following century. He even received an inscription on Chinese, and even a Chinese pavilion was built on his sanctuary. The Viscount of Juromenha says that in 1845 the Viceroy of Canton and Imperial Commissioner Ki-A there was worshiped Camões as the “Portuguese Confucius”. And rightly, Camões shares many aspects of the sages of Chinese tradition: he established a dialogue with the masters through the recreation of larger works, cultivated a millennial tradition (he gloss two thousand years prior to his own time), practiced itinerary as a source of "sagesse", said the primacy of poetry, conceived the rivers as mythical entities, even personifying them, even personifying them, even He showed a marked tendency to moralize, and epitomously his thinking in masterful sentences.
What connection did Camões have with Goa?
Unlike Macao, Goa raised in Camões mostly negative feelings. The first impressions he had, like a lawless land in which only the little turns were worse, could not have been worse, as read in the initial letter to which he alluded: "long land, from all the poor honorable grave." In the second letter, he goes on, "I can say that it is the mother of bad villains, and stepmother of honorable men." These impressions would not improve over time, as corroborated the satire that led to the expulsion to Ternate in 1556. Goa, where he became the deputy protected, to fall later in the greatest disfavor under D. Antão de Noronha, was in his texts the inverted mirror of the Kingdom, the corrupt and corrupt Babylon, theil of God, and the betrayal of God, King and the law. In what is not original, as there are other sources that reinforce this Jeremiac and apocalyptic portrait of the capital of the Portuguese East Empire. Remember Bocage: "From the land to worst you are, O goa." This said, obviously that he will also have lived there sweethearts, especially under the viceroyalty of his protectors, and in living with some companions of the poetic lines that then lived there, and which he evokes in the so-called “feast of trovas”. To one of these cultured spirits, the poet Luís Franco, even a copy of his almost complete works, including the 'self of filodemo' that had composed there, that they could be saved if another adversity survived in the kingdom to the kingdom.

Do you think Portugal should pay more attention to your writings, streamlining your work more? How?
In Lisbon it is necessary to build a great literary museum dedicated to Camões and its creations. The ideal place will be the Convent of St. Bento de Xabregas, where his friend Dom António had a grave at the Pantheon of the Line Chapel. Also in Goa the statue of Camões left for exile in the cruelly called “Archaeological Museum”, which is not the right place to end the poetry or image of a poet. Being the greatest intangible heritage of Macao, Camões has been poorly used in this region. multimedia.
What about Macau? Is Camões studied at higher education?
Two students from the Macao University of Sciences and Technology will now defend their master's theses. The first is an in -depth technical study of the translation of Zhang Weim of the Camões Odes. The second runs through the literary survival of the figure of Dinamene in contemporary Portuguese fiction, and are both excellent, bringing novelty.</description><pubDate>2025-05-21 22:42:45</pubDate></item><item><title>Piménio Ferreira: “Anti-igan rhetoric has always worked in Portugal”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2021/04/26/pimenio-ferreira-a-retorica-anti-cigana-sempre-funcionou-em-portugal/</link><description>Piménio Ferreira, better known as Gitelles Ferreira, anti-racist militant, 34, physical engineer, national Romani. He is a man with a provocative speech, a corrosive, kind mood and a smile that leaves no one indifferent
Gitelles, we live in an intercultural land and the Gypsies - in particular - have lived about five centuries in Portugal. What is going on for Gypsy communities to remain “on the fringes” of the so -called society? 
The model of society remains to be changed. This is extremely stratified by placing people in subordinate places to privilege a violent minority. The white social structure is patriarchal and racist. What is called the "margin" of society is actually an intrinsic place to it, which belongs to it. In other words, Gypsy people have been included in this model of society since they discovered Europe and its kingdoms. The problem is the model of society that is maintained and the place to which they were relegated and how they were relegated: with violence, in inferior status against whites, without the right to human dignity, to constitute a family, to choose one's own language and religion, expropriated from any and all cultural and material law. A place built and maintained to this day by violence and genocidal and ethnicidal persecution. In 1463, a Gitano Vasco was drowned to an estate. In 1521, Gitans, or Gypsies, were already used as a reference for all that is considered bad in the model of society. The "counter-exemple" in the face of the white that would stand out for the positive. The 'angel' and the 'devil'; the 'other', the enemy; That against whom any attack and persecution is legitimate. Including the prohibition of defending, having weapons, any kind of goods, and the right of permanence.
And is this right to permanence that we still have nomadic gypsy communities within the country is denied?
Yes, no doubt. There are many ways to force nomadism: directly, prohibiting permanence and expelling with police or military force; indirectly, refusing public or private housing to Gypsy people, as they are Gypsy; and even through the gentrification process.
I read the result of an inquiry from the European Union Fundamental Rights Agency, which is said to be approximately 80% of the Gypsies responded to the risk threshold of poverty in their country; One in three Gypsies lives in a housing without channeled water; One in three Gypsies belongs to a family where someone hungry at least once the previous month; and 50% of Gypsies aged 6 to 24 do not attend school. Why does this happen like this? 
It is the historical persecution, which continues. There is no impoverishment that has no external cause. In this case, a political system of total expropriation and imposed on the basis of violence. Already in 1648, D John IV, the restorer, prohibited ‘Giving or Rent houses to Gypsies’. The same D John IV who got the kingdom of Portugal thanks to D. Jerónimo da Costa and his 250 knights. The same D. Jerónimo da Costa who had died to defend Portugal's independence from Castile. Gypsy, like his wife and children. Between prohibitions of permanence, “that do not enter Gypsies in the Kingdom and leave those who are” (D John III, 1526), ​​with expulsions, degred to the galleys, expropriation of goods and properties, imposed with stripping, mutilation and death, systematically performed to this day (still in 2011 Faro City Council wanted to ban Gypsies in the municipality).
The prohibition of working on others (no one employs Gypsy workers, and those who accept they do it in total precariousness, for poorly paid positions and without decent rights and conditions). They cannot be dependent on their own work, they cannot get investment means due to extreme expropriation. Are dependent on precariousness. If you want to know what it is like to live in pure neoliberalism, know the lives of Gypsies. Their reality is paradigmatic of the aggression and depletion to which the "gentlemen" are willing to go to their benefit.
What do you talk about is economic and political power?
The group of political, social, cultural and economic power. The owner, the colonizer. This group that has been in power since it established the system of current domination. And that only makes sense within the hierarchically stratified sociopolitical model in which we live. Hence the need to end 'gentlemen' and institute a new model of society, healthy, free, without hierarchies or strata, whether of race, class or gender.
The model in which we live leads to the Gypsy (and not only) community to economic exclusion, removing it from access to product consumption or excluding them from its production process; political exclusion associated with lack of access to information; To education and consequently the social exclusion that is seen in inequality of access to quality community areas such as restaurants, libraries, theater, cinema, concerts, health care, etc. How do you feel a gypsy child when you realize that it is not part of a whole? Children who are never represented, neither in movies, nor in books, nor in cartoons, not even in an announcement to eat cereals, for example? Is this a disaster for self-esteem, is a priori condemnation?
The question is that. Gypsy people are not “excluded from society”, by contrast, they are included in it. The problem is the existence of what is cynically called 'social exclusion', which term Orwellian, and there be under coercion, people. Which field of concentration and extermination. Incidentally, Nazi concentration camps are a more visual realization than called 'social exclusion' and, as here, were not a 'excluded' part of Nazi society, but rather its fundamental and characterizing structure. It is a place of violence, where people are maintained by violence, dedicated to their extermination, and designed so that few people can leave. And yet they resist. As in Nazi concentration camps.
And what you have listed as an example of 'consequence' of this 'exclusion', is actually the means by which this exclusion also happens and remains. Gypsy people are out of theaters, both as consumers and producers (but go to the cinema). They are out of school, education and the gym. Either as 'users' or as producers (but go to school and are on the basis of knowledge construction and academic and scientific debates).
Even in attacking Gypsy children's self -confidence, we talk about a maintenance mechanism of this situation. But Gypsy people respond very well: with Gypsy pride. Another resistance, another aggression. Gypsy people are thus included in society. In a place that belongs to this model of modern society. And they resist and contradict the power of domination and make a point of being in the city, in the cinema, in the theater, in the gym, in all spaces. With a lot of struggle and always resisting, but they are there. Social exclusion, more than a “place outside of society”, is part of its social structure.
Do you want to say that there is a collective resistance?
At work, already in a context of absolute precariousness, during the pandemic, Gypsy people rolled up sleeves and showed once again proactivity and creativity in adversity. They learned seeing and doing. And here, it is again the women who jump to the front line, face, learn to use digital tools with their daughters or children, and throw themselves into the network. And so they explore online sales as well as application by application (transportation or rehabs). In housing, in a context of pandemic in which the evictions were not locked - as they owed and dictated the law itself - residents did not fail to organize and fight unjust evictions and claim dignity in housing; associations of allied residents in their action with other housing and anti-racist struggle organizations.
It should also be noted how they reinvented and intensified to raise and distribute dietary goods and kits of masks/alcohol gel to the most expropriated people. Gypsies and non -Gypsies. In the anti-racist struggle, new movements emerged and their actions intensified by social networks. People who had never been organized or militated before began their first steps in activism, thickening this way of the organization and popular gypsy and anti-racist action. People forget, or do not want to value, but Gypsy action has helped determine results in the political dispute. Gypsy citizens mobilized in large and determined electoral results in the municipalities of 2017, both in Alentejo and in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area, even causing electoral earthquakes.
And even in the presidential, second place was resolved by a value equivalent to the estimated number of Gypsy voters. Apart from the non -Gypsy votes that were mobilized by the action of Gypsy voters. Gypsy people are even co-considering power in the spaces of opinion, local media, social networks and party and institutional political dispute. And most importantly, in the popular Ação and alliances with other social movements. We have never stopped fighting for all means and continuing to resist.
In contrast there are more and more hate speeches, from the far right in particular. What do you have to say about it?
To start these speeches are historical and European. Not even current and even less “of the far right”. These speeches have been adopted and rendered for a long time, even in 'democracy and freedom', by several representatives of the center right, conservatives, left center, liberal, liberal left, even representatives of the PCP. Anti-egana rhetoric has always worked in Portugal as it is the whiter rhetoric [white genesis]. That is, it allows you to create and give the "white" as the superior of all. And so please the white electorate who, when feeling well, pays off with his vote. Even if the policies implemented by their elected harm him even more.
Finally, did you like them to talk a little about your personal experience and how did you get to the activist?
I studied, fought for studies, made alliances, graduated, went in the labor market of the “formal precariousness”. I started my militant action and here I am today. We can transform this society a better. This certainty combined with the fact that the current one has so much suffering makes anyone want to have a transformist attitude. I wanted to be 'inventor' (physical engineer) and anti -racist militant. And through study (not necessarily schooling) and organization with others, in turn, with other studies, formations and visions, I learned how the world works and how it can be changed. But before transforming, we need to survive.
Hence two types of actions arise: transformative and survival. The struggle against hate discourse arises as survival, but his defeat will be a transformative victory. There is a lot that - like people who want a better world - we have to do, namely working to criminalize hatred speech; condemn and prohibit organizations with racist discourses and practices; denounce the racist institutional structure and logics that organize power and generate community resources. And in this sense, there have been various types of actions, of petitions, to manifestations. And we need more.
I, besides being a military man in the SOS Racism movement, participate in the “We came to stay” podcast, with Mamadou BA and Joseph da Silva. And if all goes well, we will soon start a new project. With friendly people, we also have the project “Gypsy Initiative”, dedicated to reflecting and promoting transformative movements. Essentially focused on educating against anti-agigarism, denouncing historical and continued genocide and working for a new society project. Also with new projects on the gutter. And finally, there are always voluntary actions without an organization, where I try to share what I found out about anti-egism and Roman history in schools and with interested people. In addition, there is still the struggle for housing, because the evictions did not stop during the pandemic. Due to housing and work precariousness, the subjects racialized especially the Roma nationals are the most vulnerable to COVID-19. There is essential to have actions in this area; Of all the struggles, this is the most structural, as it goes against one of the main enemies of a healthy society: the real estate speculation of this capitalist system, which places profit and goods above people and their humanization.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>FIA | Conference helped perceive future of motorsport</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/13/fia-conferencia-ajudou-a-perceber-futuro-do-automobilismo/</link><description>For the first time in its history, in 2025, Macau welcomed the Extraordinary General Assemblies and Conference of the International Automobile Federation (FIA). Organized in partnership with the Macau-China General Association (AAMC), the FIA-affiliated sports territory, and Galaxy Entertainment Group, this event brought together more than five dozen FIA senior delegates from 147 countries in the field.
 
In the Galaxy International Convention Center, to this day, the future of motoring and mobility worldwide is discussed. However, some details about the future of sport in the territory have already been revealed between the lines. Focused on obtaining information about the growth of motorsport and promoting safe, sustainable and accessible mobility to everyone in the Asia Pacific region, the FIA ​​conference opening session highlighted the importance of communication and collaboration, as well as the region's ability to innovate and create solutions that respond to specific questions it faces.
Roberto Carlos Osório, president of the Macau-China General Automotive Association (AAMC), said the association has a strong tradition in motor racing and that following FIA's guidelines is being able to grow rapidly competition at the base level in the region.
“We organized the first GT Macau Cup in 2008,” said the AAMC leader. "Currently, we also have the GT Cup - Great Bay Race for GT4 cars. In addition, in 2008, we created Road Sport Challenge," he explained. “And today, in 2025, we are proud to announce that we have 68 tourism cars in the region to compete in the qualification race to enter the 72nd Macao Grand Prix.”
In a year when AAMC celebrates 30 years of existence - was born as Macao Automobile Club - we also learned that the association's bet for the future will be in the basic disciplines of motor sport. Roberto Carlos Osorio also revealed a curious fact: Macau has 135 pilots with sports license from the territory.
“This growth was achieved following FIA's guidelines to promote grassroots motorsport and create accessible races for riders in the region,” added the manager of the territory. “With the interest of pilots, teams and promoters in developing state-of-the-art activities in Macau, we will focus even more on base competitions and affordable races, not only to support tourism, but also to make Macau in a Karting international center of international events, where champions can be selected for F4 and, later, for regional formula.”
Confirmed GP program
The Macao Grand Prix Organizing Committee (COGPM) held a press conference on June 8 at the Macao Grand Prix Museum to confirm the 72nd Macao Grand Program races, which will take place from November 13 to 16 this year.
As last year, there will be seven races in total, respectively, the Macao Grand Prix - FR da Fia World Cup, the GT Macao Cup - FIA GT World Cup, the Macao Guide Race - Kumho Fia TCR World Tour Event of Macau, the Formula 4 Formula 4 World Cup, the 57th Macao Motor Motor Prize, GT Cup - Great Bay Race (GT4) and Macao Roadsport Challenge. For the first time, the guide circuit receives four different cups under the FIA ​​seal on the same weekend.
Other news
Between meetings and communications, other information was revealed about the November edition of the Macao Grand Prix. The FIA ​​World Council approved in Macao that the winner of the first Formula 4 World Cup of the FIA ​​will receive two points for the super license. We have also noticed that Pirelli will equip all the monologes that participate in both the FIA ​​Formula 4 World Cup and the FIA ​​regional formula World Formula Cup. In turn, the supply of tires and fuel to the FIA ​​GT World Cup remains in the contest phase.
Registration for the Formula 4 World Cup will be open until July 30. The final selection of 20 pilots will be confirmed by the FIA ​​through an official invitation letter, taking into account the current classification of the pilots in the respective championships.
In the case of the FIA ​​Regional Formula World Cup, registrations will also remain open until July 30, and the grill will be able to host a maximum of 27 Tatuus regional formula -equipped with alpha Romeo engines built by the autotechnic. As with Formula 4, participation will be by invitation, with priority assigned to pilots who have reached the best positions in the five regional formula championships of 2025.</description><pubDate>2025-06-13 18:43:57</pubDate></item><item><title>GP | Jaguar that won in Macau in 1984 returned to the tracks</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/06/gp-jaguar-que-venceu-em-macau-em-1984-regressou-as-pistas/</link><description>The more than seventy years of history of the Macau Grand Prix are people, machines and great moments. We were in 1984, when Tom Walkinshaw won Jaguar's only victory in the guide race. After years away from the audience, for the affected man, this same car returned to the tracks at the hands of an enthusiast of the MSAR MOTOR EVENT
 
Richard Meins, an English maritime transport entrepreneur who lived many years in Hong Kong, who participated on several occasions at the Macao Grand Prix, led this Jaguar XJs of Group A in the Historic Touring Car Challenge race, a competition for classics during the Donington Historic Festival. This “Big Cat”, Chassis No. 5 and one of the four original XJs still existing, is practically as it was in 1984, but given the limitations of tobacco advertising, today boasts the colors used in the European Tourism Championship, instead of the iconic black and gold decoration of John Player Special (JPS) that marked the ticket through the guide circuit.
Interestingly, this return to the tracks, from a car that was still still in New Zealand and Japan, was scheduled for the Algarve International Race Track, but the Historic Touring Car Challenge canceled its race in early April in Portimão. So it was in lands of his majesty that Richard Meins made his first race with the British car.
“The car won in Macao in 1984, so I'm a big fan of this model,” Ricard Meins told the English magazine Motorsport News. “I still have the photographs I took this weekend in Macao,” said this avid classic competition car collector who, besides driving, supported several riders at the Macao Grand Prix.
In Donington Park, Richard Meins shared the imposing Jaguar XJS, equipped with a 5.3 -liter V12 engine with Jack Tetley, and ended in sixth place, winning in his class. Richard Meins had only guided the car once or twice, but plans to participate in more historic touring car challenge rounds with XJS 1984. “Let's try to put it on track more often now,” Ricard Meins said, who revealed that he was a stake in the Silverstone Festival in August with this very rare and striking copy of the 1980s tourism cars history.
Premiere of an iconic decoration
In the summer of 1984, Tom Walkinshaw accepted the challenge of the Portuguese organization of the Grand Prix to travel later this year to Macau. With the European title in his pocket, the English driver and team boss was accompanied by one of his usual riders, German Hans Heyer. The guide race was a BMW fiefdom and the controversial English wanted to put an end to the Bavarian domain in the race. To this end, it had the precious support of JPS, which was relaunching the brand, decorating its cars with the famous black and gold colors that would later be eternalized in Ayrton Senna's Lotus. At the time, the guide race took place three weeks before 1000 km from Bathurst, another important race on the worldwide calendar of tourist racing, and so TWR made a "two in one."
The 100 -mile race on the streets of Macau would not have much history, such as the cars built in the Kidlington workshops against the competition headed by the two BMW 635i Schnitzer officers, guided by Hans Stuck and Dieter Quester, and painted by rival Marlboro. Tom Walkinshaw ended first and Hans Heyer and m second.
At the end of the race, quoted by the Portuguese newspaper Autosport, Tom Walkinshaw said: “The circuit is fantastic. Tight, but with many curves, climbs and descents, which made the race become difficult. But I like difficult things and, for me, the race was great from beginning to end.
The Jaguar were again invited by the Macao Grand Prix committee to run in 1985, but Tom Walkinshaw had other plans for his cars. Fortunately, thanks to Richard Meins we will continue to see this beautiful car on the tracks.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>TCR China | André Couto participated in the Zhejiang race</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/01/tcr-china-andre-couto-participou-na-prova-de-zhejiang/</link><description>Over the weekend, André Couto had an unexpected return to the TCR China Championship, in what was his first race of this season. The rider of the sgas showed that "who knows, never forgets", despite having had a troubled passage through the Zhejiang International Circuit
The Portuguese pilot residing in Macao, who has not competed since November last year-when he played the World Lamborghini Super Trofeo World Finals, having won the title in the Lamborghini Super Trofeo Asia Pro-AM category-received a last-minute invitation from MacPro Racing Team to conduct one of the Honda Civic Fl5 TCR Team in the third race of the Chinese Championship. TCR.
Without any prior training, André Couto came back to sit in a car he already knew, also with a technical structure that was familiar to him. By 2023, the territory pilot had already played some TCR China events with this set, then at the service of the official team Dongfeng Honda Racing Team, showing a progress right from the beginning.
"Free training did not go wrong, but in qualification a less attentive pilot hit me on my first departure lap to the track. He hit me from behind and did not realize why. Damaged me the rear, dislocated the convergence and the car was crooked. Hm. "Still, I qualified myself in fourth in Q1, five tenths of the first, which, with the car in the conditions it was, was not bad. The car had potential."
In Q2, due to the damage, the Japanese car “became much harder to guide” and Couto ended in tenth. However, this ended up having a positive effect: “With the reversal of the starting grid, the tenth place of Q2 allowed me to start first to the second race.”
The first race, played on Saturday on the shaoxing track, did not go as well as the pilot wanted, not being able to follow the official links, nor the best Honda and Hyundai. "I ended up eighth. The car was not as good as expected and we found that there was a damaged damper, still from the crash in the qualification, which was exchanged for the Sunday race."
Inglorius Sunday
In the 20 Sunday round race, André Couto had everything to shine as he departed from pole-position and Honda finally seemed in a position to fight for the first places. "On the way back, the car was good. I didn't feel strange anymore and I was optimistic."
The idea was to get well to distance themselves from the fastest competitors in the first laps and then manage the race with new tires. However, it all faded quickly when it was wrapped by Wu Yi Fan right in the brake for the first curve.
“That was my mission, but I couldn't,” acknowledged the winner of the 2000 Macao Grand Prix. “He hit me on the first curve and the car was damaged. Sports commissioners, but that does not change the fact that I have given up. ”
With Honda's damaged direction, André Couto had no choice but to leave. "I was a bit disappointed because I hope to get a good result for MacPro Racing Team that had given me a good car.</description><pubDate>2025-07-01 00:26:00</pubDate></item><item><title>GP | FIA AFINA REGIONAL Formula Rules</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/23/gp-fia-afina-regras-da-formula-regional/</link><description>The International Automobile Federation (FIA) took advantage of the holding of the Extraordinary General Assemblies and its annual conference to publish the Macao Grand Prix Regulation - FIA Regional Formula Cup of 2025. There are not many changes compared to 2024, but the changes introduced aim to browse gaps from the first edition of this competition in Macau
The twelve red flags during last year's qualification session called for the level of pilots at the Guide Circuit, which was the premiere of the FIA ​​regional formula in Macau regional formula. This happened after the controversial decision of the FIA ​​to consider that Formula 3 was no longer adequate to the Macao Citadino layout.
Unsurprisingly, the sports regulation is now clear that, to compete in the FIA ​​regional formula world, “all pilots must have participated at least 3 competitions with a monolugar that has been projected and/or built to reach a weight/power ratio of more than 3.0 kg/hp.”
Emanuele Pirro, a former F1 pilot, winner of the Guide Race and president of the FIA ​​monoligai committee, said during the weekend of the 71st edition that, in the future, the FIA ​​will be more demanding about track discipline. Thus, from now on, “any pilot who, in the opinion of sports commissioners, is solely responsible for the display of a red flag during the qualification training session, will not be able to continue to participate in this session and its best time back can be annulled.” The new regulation also states that “if a qualification training session is interrupted with less than four minutes remaining, it will not be restarted.”
On the other hand, the FIA ​​maintains the limit in the participation of more experienced pilots, except only “pilots who participated in a maximum of 3 FI F2 Championship competitions of 2025.” This measure goes a little against the spirit and history of the Great Prize, which has always gathered pilots from higher categories in its main race. In fact, this was a fervent question between Macao and the International Federation on two previous occasions.
In 1985, Alfredo César Torres, then responsible for Portuguese motorsport, convinced Jean-Marie Balestre, against his will, to allow the participation of F1 pilots in the F3 Intercontinental Cup in the name of the economic viability of the race. In 2016, the controversy returned with the veto da FIA to the participation of Nelsinho Piquet, a decision badly received by the teams and then coordinator Barry Bland, which would eventually abandon the co-organization of the race a year later.
Bet on continuity
In sports terms, registrations for this second edition of the FIA ​​regional formula Cup will remain open until July 30. The grill may include a maximum of 27 Tatuus regional formula monologues, all equipped with Alfa Romeo engines built by the Italian Autotechnic. Pirelli will once again be the official tire supplier.
The identities of the invited teams have not yet been revealed, but some news is expected in this field compared to 2024. To avoid any behind -the -scenes disputes, it has already been defined that “the position on the boxes for the teams that participate in the Macao Grand Prix will be based on the ranking of the previous year” and, in turn, “the position in the roadway for new teams will be attributed based on the order of application.”
Equal awards and more restricted advertising
The values ​​of monetary awards remain unchanged this year, with a total of US $ 68,500 to distribute, the equivalent of just over 550,000 patacas at the current exchange rate. The race winner will receive $ 12,000, an amount that is still far from covering the costs of participation in this nature.
On the other hand, the sports regulation introduces two new prohibitions on advertising into the monoligales. In addition to the existing prohibition of advertising to fortune or bad luck, tobacco or pornography, also the promotion of electronic cigarettes and alcoholic beverages - a measure that follows the legislation in force in the territory.
The 72nd Macao Grand Prix, the largest international sports event of the MSA, will take place between November 13 and 16, 2025.</description><pubDate>2025-06-23 03:31:16</pubDate></item><item><title>MOTOR EMBALISM | Project for new track in Zhuhai emerges</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/30/automobilismo-surge-projecto-para-nova-pista-em-zhuhai/</link><description>With a very black cloud to turn to the future of the Zhuhai International Circuit, there is a potential good news for the great bay of motoring: a project for a new permanent circuit in the Chinese city adjacent to the MSAR.
According to Hong Kong's Ta Kung Pao newspaper, Guangdong's provincial government recently published the document “Measures to promote high quality tourism and accelerate the construction of a strong tourist province”, which proposes, for the first time, the creation of an “industrial circle of culture and tourism of the Great Bay”, offering political support to the integrated development of culture and tourism in the region. With this, the first industrial and tourist complex of motorized sports in the Great Bay may emerge.
The project of the Zhuhai Chaoyue international circuit was recently presented at the Zhuhai Ocean Spring Resort, located in Doumen, not far from the city's airport, with an initial investment of 250 million Renminbis.
According to the first information, the project of this circuit provides for welcoming evidence such as Formula 3 and foster collaborative development between motorized sports sectors, cultural events and exhibition industry. The plan includes the holding of several international tests per year and foresees collaboration with Hong Kong and Macau to connect cities such as Jiangmen and Zhongshan, promoting “Multiple stops” and boosting the innovative development of “Event Economics + Cultural Tourism”.
According to Zhou Jian, China Travel Service (Zhuhai) Executive Director General Ocean Spring Resort Co., the FIA ​​grade certification-will also include a karting track, drift track and an interior space of 2,400 m² for exhibitions and events related to the automobile sector. With more than 50 international events projected annually, the goal is to become a "super IP" that joins running, leisure and tourism under the same concept.
The first phase of the Zhuhai Chaoyue International Circuit project will include international certification professionals, as well as support facilities. This project aims not only to fill “a gap in the high -end motorized sports sector in Zhuhai, but will also promote the modernization of the Great Bay's cultural, sports and tourist industries by conducting international racing and themed cultural events linked to motorsport.”
Uncertainties in the air
Last summer, the company Malay LBS Bina Group BHD announced that it sold its participation in the Zhuhai International Circuit (ZIC) - the first permanent circuit built in the interior of China - by 124.7 million ringits (about 214.15 million patacas). In a statement to Bursa Malaysia Securities BHD, the group reported that their subsidiary, Dragon Hill Corporation Ltd, sold all his participation in Lamdeal Investments Ltd (Lil) to Huafa Urban Operation (HK) Ltd, a well -known real estate operator. Lil Detinha 60 percent of Zhuhai International Circuit Limited (ZICL), circuit operator.
Raised in 1996 in order to receive the first major award from China from Formula 1 - something that never materialized - ZIC was still the initial motor of motoring in the country and a reference in Asian motorsport. Since its opening, it has welcomed several international evidence, such as the FIA ​​GT, A1 GP or the Intercontinental Le Mans Series. In recent years, track administration has chosen to organize its own events, abdicating the most costly international evidence.
Despite having received, in the past, MSAR automobile competitions, ZIC has been losing protagonism in local motorized sport, due to high prices, limited availability and reducing sports activity in favor of the most profitable commercial activities. The future of the circuit remains uncertain: it is only known that lease agreements between resident teams and the circuit have been frozen and are not being renewed. The track approval will also be about to expire, requiring a new certification to continue to receive competitions in the future.
However, on the weekend of June 14 and 15, the still only circuit of Zhuhai will host the third race of the Formula 4 China Championship season.</description><pubDate>2025-05-30 01:53:33</pubDate></item><item><title>Macao's historicals get a GP clearance</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/20/historicos-de-macau-conseguem-apuramento-para-gp/</link><description>The Guangdong International Circuit welcomed, last weekend, the second and decisive double journey of Macao - Macau Road Sport Challenge cars, proof of finding for the most important motor racing of the season: the Macao Grand Prix. In a journey with few celebration reasons for the colors of the sinters, the veterans Jerónimo Badaraco and Rui Valente managed to ensure the qualification.
With a list of 68 subscribers, the grill was divided into two groups, A and B, with all the pilots competing with Toyota Gr86 (ZN8) or Subaru BRZ (ZD8) models. This year, with only one race scheduled for the Grand Prix Program - due to the inclusion of the FIA ​​Formula 4 World Cup - the number of riders was reduced to 36, which placed a supplementary pressure for both missing races. To complicate, the rain came, changing the turns to teams and riders.
In Group A, where Rui Valente faced a complicated weekend on the track around Zhaoqing, Célio Alves Dias and Maximiano Mannão failed to qualify, in a series dominated by Hong Kong riders. In Saturday's race, the podium consisted of Wong Chuck Pan, Lo Pak Yu and Chan Ka Ping. On Sunday, these three repeated the feat, but with a new order: Lo Pak Yu, Chan Ka Ping and Wong Chuck Pan.
In difficult atmospheric conditions on Saturday, Rui Valente ended only 25th, due to an error in tuning, improving to 15th on Sunday, with the track dry. A penalty after the second race fired him to the 27th place. Still, the 7th place obtained on the first round was enough to secure a place in the Macao Grand Prix.
On the contrary, Maximiano Mannão, behind the wheel of a Toyota with the colors of the historic Macau Racing Team, ended on 26th and 14th, a result below the finding, but it turns out to be positive given that it was Jove Pilot's debut in these wanderings. Célio Alves Dias, with difficulties in his car since the first race, was 24th and 28th, far from the usual level of this experienced Macaense pilot.
Badaraco with final sprint '
On a weekend, where the lively races were broadcast on live streaming in Group B, Hong Kong riders stood out again. On Sunday, Adrian Chung won, with Leung Tsz Wa and Tsang Pak Yin completing the podium. In the second confrontation, Cheang Kin Sang reached a deserved victory, followed again by Leung Tsz Wa and Tsang Pak Yin.
Jerónimo Badaraco came to this challenging weekend without the assured clearance. A modest qualification and 11th Saturday place maintained the open outcome. However, a solid race on Sunday and an excellent 4th place assured veteran Macanese the much desired place on the grid of the Macao Grand Prix, along with countrymen Cheng Kin San, Leong Keng Hei, Lou Check In and Carson Tang.
Also outside the Grand Prix was Dionísio Albino Pereira, who finished 23rd in Saturday's race, but closed the time more forcefully, cutting the line of goal in 13th place in the second race.
At the end of the races, competitors provisionally calculated had an extra technical verification, being forced to open engines and gearbox, to verify the legality of these two decisive organs of their vehicles.</description><pubDate>2025-05-20 01:57:43</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
