In a two-hour meeting, 97 percent of members voted to disband the party, once one of the biggest forces in Hong Kong's Legislative Council.
At the annual assembly, according to the South China Morning Post, a total of 117 members, 97 percent of those present, agreed to the party's dissolution, following the decision taken by the party leadership in February. Veteran member and former deputy Fred Li Wah-ming said a mainland Chinese official had urged the party to dissolve before December's Legislative Council elections.
This dissolution of the party eliminates what little remains of the city's main political opposition, following a similar decision by the League of Social Democrats in June and the closure of the Civic Party in 2023. The Hong Kong Association for Democracy and People's Welfare, which focuses on social issues and advocates for residents to vote under the revamped electoral system, is the only remaining pro-democracy force.
The patriots
Currently, with the various arrests of leaders and activists and the limitations on candidacies, the democratic party did not have any representation in the legislative council or district councils. The issue became even more complex in March 2021, when the Chinese government passed a law designed to ensure that only those it designated as 'patriots' could govern in Hong Kong.
This regulation significantly reduced democratic representation in the assembly, consolidated control over electoral processes and established a candidate selection panel aligned with Beijing's interests.
Since this legislation and electoral reforms came into force, the future of the Democratic Party has been at risk, following constant police raids and arrests of activists or family members in recent years. A few months ago, party members authorized the sale of their headquarters for 11 million Hong Kong dollars to prepare for eventual dissolution and prevent the property from being handed over to the courts. The party's remaining funds are to be donated to the Association for the Rights of Victims of Industrial Accidents.</description><pubDate>2025-12-15 02:11:55</pubDate></item><item><title>Light Rail | Public consultation on route in 2026</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/15/metro-ligeiro-consulta-publica-sobre-percurso-em-2026/</link><description>The Government plans to move forward with a public consultation on Light Rail planning in the first half of 2026.

In a statement, UPM indicated that the cooperation protocol also provides for the strengthening of ties in the area of ​​sharing academic resources and the training of qualified staff bilingual in Chinese and Portuguese. Both jurisdictions have Portuguese as one of their official languages, along with Chinese, in the case of the semi-autonomous region of Macau, and with Tetum, in the case of East Timor.
The agreement was signed by the vice-rector of UPM, Vivian Lei Ngan Lin, and the rector of UNTL, João Soares Martins, on the sidelines of the 15th conference of the Forum for Higher Education Management in Portuguese-Speaking Countries and Regions (Forges). The annual meeting of Portuguese-speaking universities and polytechnics took place in the capital of Timor-Leste, Díli, in a joint organization of UNTL, the Timorese Catholic University São João Paulo II and the University of Díli.
The Forges conference, which had as its theme “The Promotion of Scientific Research in the Portuguese Language in the Face of Global Challenges”, took place between the 24th and 27th of November. During the event, the deputy director of the Faculty of Languages ​​and Translation at UPM, the Portuguese Joaquim Carvalho, gave a presentation in which he invited students and teachers from Portuguese-speaking countries to invest in exchanges with Macau.

The UPM delegation also took advantage of the opportunity to discuss academic exchange and cooperation projects with the Portuguese Catholic University, the Pontifical Catholic University of Campinas (Brazil) and the University of Luanda. In November 2024, during the 14th Forges conference, in Macau, João Soares Martins told Lusa that UNTL wanted the support of the Instituto Português do Oriente (IPOR) to start certifying proficiency in the Portuguese language.
Also in the Chinese region, UNTL and the University of Macau (UM) signed a cooperation agreement on Monday that provides “more opportunities for the mobility of teachers and students”, highlighted the rector. The Timorese delegation visited the Department of Portuguese at UM, the State Reference Laboratory for Quality Research in Chinese Medicine and the Faculty of Law, where some of the current UNTL teachers were trained.

This is the fifth time that Macau's artistic and cultural projects have been selected for the national financing plan.
The central authorities began to allow applications from Hong Kong's special administrative regions from 2021. In a statement, the Secretary for Social Affairs and Culture, O Lam, thanked the motherland for the recognition and support given to the development of Macau's arts and culture and warmly congratulated Macau's authors.
The selected projects include dance performances, Chinese opera, paintings celebrating nationalism, a musical and creative talent training programs from the Hou Kong Dance Association, Macau University of Science and Technology and City University of Macau.
In 2022, nine Macao SAR projects were selected for the first time and the following year 11 applications were distinguished. For the years 2024 and 2025, 10 projects were financed per year, while next year the support will cover the largest number of projects.</description><pubDate>2025-12-15 02:03:17</pubDate></item><item><title>ONE | Construction of the new campus has started</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/15/um-arrancou-construcao-do-novo-campus/</link><description>The construction start ceremony was attended by Sam Hou Fai. The new campus will include UM's first medical school
Construction of the new campus of the University of Macau (UM), which will include the first public medical faculty, in collaboration with the University of Lisbon (ULisboa) began on Friday. In a statement, UM indicated that the laying of the first stone ceremony, presided over by Government leader, Sam Hou Fai, took place in the Guangdong-Macao Deep Cooperation Zone, in neighboring Hengqin (Mountain Island).
The new campus will occupy an area of ​​almost 376,000 square meters in the special economic zone and construction is expected to take around three years, with a partial inauguration scheduled for 2028 and completion of works in 2029. Four new faculties will be created in the new UM campus on Ilha da Montanha, including those of Information Sciences, Design and Engineering, as well as the first public medical faculty in Macau.
The University of Science and Technology of Macau, a private institution, has had a Faculty of Health Sciences since 2008, officially renamed the Faculty of Medicine in 2019. In June, the director of the Faculty of Medicine at Ulisboa told Lusa that doctors trained at the future Faculty of Medicine at UM will also be able to practice in Portugal.
ULisboa is collaborating with UM to create a curriculum with a layout “close to the structure” of courses at the Portuguese institution, said Luís Graça. The director explained that the courses will work in co-supervision, allowing doctors trained at UM to obtain “equivalence and recognition” by the ULisboa Faculty of Medicine.
Doctors for Portugal
Among the advantages will be “thus allowing doctors trained in the territory to also practice medicine in Portugal”, highlighted the researcher. In December, the vice-rector of UM, Rui Martins, said that the new campus will focus on "'dual degrees' [courses in co-tutelship] with foreign universities. Medicine is already with Lisbon and now we are defining it for the other faculties".
The new campus on Ilha da Montanha should allow UM to increase from the current 15 thousand to a maximum of 25 thousand students, highlighted the vice-rector for Global Affairs, in an interview with the Portuguese-language channel of the local public television TDM. Luís Graça, a specialist in transplant immunology, also expressed enthusiasm about potential collaborations between the two universities in the area of ​​scientific research.
“If we think in terms of science, strengthening the scientific potential of both institutions with close collaboration between them is something that will clearly benefit both sides of this partnership”, stated the director. Luís Graça said that the ULisboa Faculty of Medicine is organizing the first symposium to bring together researchers from the institution and UM, with a view to promoting joint research projects.</description><pubDate>2025-12-15 01:53:33</pubDate></item><item><title>Justice | Jerónimo Santos at TSI and Ho Wai Neng confirmed at TUI</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/15/justica-jeronimo-santos-no-tsi-e-ho-wai-neng-confirmado-no-tui/</link><description>Despite the departure of Portuguese people from Macau's courts in recent years, the only Portuguese judge remaining in the territory was promoted to the Court of Second Instance
The only Portuguese judge working in Macau, Jerónimo Alberto Gonçalves Santos, was appointed to the Court of Second Instance (TSI), while Ho Wai Neng was confirmed as judge of the Court of Final Instance (TUI). The decisions were communicated on Friday and the appointment order was published yesterday in the Official Bulletin.
The promotion of Jerónimo Santos comes at a time when the continuity of Portuguese magistrates in Macau is being called into question by the Portuguese authorities. In October of this year, fellow Portuguese judge Rui Ribeiro brought forward the end of a service commission, which lasted until May of next year, due to the uncertainty regarding the renewal of the special license, to be in Macau, from the Superior Council of Judiciary (CSM).
Also in October, the president of the Supreme Court of Justice (STJ), João Cura Mariano, who inherently also presides over the CSM, stated that the Portuguese justice system is having “some difficulty in contributing judges”, due to the lack of qualified and experienced human resources. “Just now we removed a judge who had been here for many years and we needed him”, highlighted João Cura Mariano, in October.
In 2024, the CSM rejected the stay of Portuguese TJB judge Carlos Carvalho, who had been in Macau for 16 years and had been invited by the Independent Commission for the Nomination of Judges in the territory to continue for another two years. The council did not authorize the renewal of Carlos Carvalho's special license and promoted him to judge, with placement at the Court of Appeal.
Despite the nuances, João Cura Mariano assured that he was willing to help Macau, “despite the difficulties that currently exist in Portugal in recruiting judges”.
Ascent confirmation
The moves announced on Friday confirm Ho Wai Neng's elevation to the Court of Final Appeal, where he had been serving since Sam Hou Fai announced his candidacy for Chief Executive in April last year. Furthermore, Choi Mou Pan was appointed for a period of three years as president of the TSI, a position previously held by Ho Wai Neng.
Among the promotions to the TSI, the name of Lou Ieng Ha also stands out, the judge responsible in the first instance for some of the most publicized cases in recent years, such as the Public Works case, which resulted in the convictions of former directors Jaime Carion and Li Canfeng, and also the Suncity case, which led to the businessman of Macau's largest gambling promoter, Alvin Chao, in prison.
In terms of appointments, Io Weng San and Rong Qi were promoted to presiding judges of the Collective Court of First Instance Courts.
All appointments take effect next year, and nominations came from the Independent Commission for the Nomination of Judges. The committee is made up of Lau Cheok Va, president, Ho Teng Iat, Ieong Tou Hong, Chan Hong, Wang Yu, Song Man Lei and António José Dias Azedo.

The increase in public spending was balanced with casino revenues
Public expenditure increased by 2.7 percent in the first 11 months of 2025, compared to the same period last year, following a budget review to reinforce social support, it was announced on Friday. According to data published online by the Financial Services Directorate (DSF), the Macao SAR spent 86.1 billion patacas by the end of November.
The main reason for the increase was spending on social support and subsidies, which grew 4.1 percent compared to the first 11 months of 2024, to 49.7 billion patacas. At the beginning of July, the Legislative Assembly approved a Government proposal to increase the expenses foreseen in the budget by 2.86 billion patacas, to reinforce social support. The review includes the creation of a subsidy, worth a total of MOP54,000, for children up to three years old, in an attempt to increase the lowest birth rate in the world.
On the contrary, spending on public works, the Administration's Investment and Expense Plan, fell 2.7 percent until November, to 14.7 billion patacas.
Tax revenue
The increase in expenditure was balanced by Macau's current revenue, which rose 2.8 percent in the first 11 months of the year, to 104.6 billion patacas. The main reason for the increase was a 7 percent increase, to 86.7 billion patacas, in revenue from gambling taxes – which represent 81.3 percent of the total.
The city's six gaming operators pay a direct tax of 35 percent on gaming revenue, with 2.4 percent going to the Macau Social Security Fund and urban and tourism development, and 1.6 percent given to the Macau Foundation for cultural, educational, scientific, academic and philanthropic purposes.
Total revenue from Macau's casinos reached 226.5 billion patacas in the first 11 months of the year, 8.6 percent more than in the same period in 2024. The territory ended November with a surplus in public accounts of 20.6 billion patacas, 11.4 percent more than in the same period last year. Macau closed 2024 with a surplus of 15.8 billion patacas, more than double that recorded in the previous year.
The Government's initial forecast for the entire year 2025 pointed to a surplus of 6.83 billion patacas. But the revised budget, approved by the Legislative Assembly at the beginning of July, predicted a surplus of just 191.1 million patacas.</description><pubDate>2025-12-15 01:41:46</pubDate></item><item><title>Japan | Interference in the cancellation of events denied</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/15/japao-negada-interferencia-no-cancelamento-de-eventos/</link><description>The Government denied any interference in the cancellation of at least three concerts with Japanese artists scheduled for Macau and guaranteed that these were solely commercial decisions by the organizers
"I think that different parties have their own consideration factors", said, at a press conference, the president of the Cultural Heritage Council, Deland Leong Wai Man. "It is normal to have adjustments regarding concerts or different events. Situations of cancellation due to force majeure, is something common", added on Friday, also the leader of the Cultural Institute.
On Tuesday, the Venetian Macau hotel-casino announced the cancellation of a concert by Japanese pop singer Ayumi Hamasaki, on January 10th. This is after Hamasaki's concert in Shanghai on November 29th was cancelled. On Wednesday, a Christmas show, scheduled for December 25th, at another hotel-casino, Studio City, which included the female band Say My Name, which includes the Japanese Hitomi Honda, the group's leader, and Terada Mei, was also cancelled.
On the same day, a third show was cancelled, this time by the band Hi-Fi Un!corn, a group that includes Japanese artists, and which was scheduled for December 21st, at a third hotel-casino, Galaxy Macau.
Asked by Lusa whether there were instructions from the Government not to hold cultural events with artists from Japan, Leong Wai Man assured that “this is a matter for the commercial sector, it is the organizer's decision”. “I have nothing more to add”, stressed the leader.
Even so, Leong defended that the wave of cancellations “will not have a major impact” on the Executive's plan to position Macau as an international city of shows.
Several fronts
On November 15, Macau asked residents and tourists of the territory in Japan to raise their state of alert, after Beijing advised against traveling to the country following statements by the Japanese leader about Taiwan.
The warning from the Tourism Services Bureau came “given that since the middle of this year, the trend of attacks in Japan against Chinese citizens has been increasing”, without citing data or examples. However, the Hong Kong Government did so, citing just one incident in Tokyo, in which two Chinese citizens were attacked by locals in late July.
China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has issued a warning advising against travel to Japan due to the deteriorating security environment. The main airlines in Mainland China, Macau and Hong Kong announced full refunds for flights to Japan, following the Government's appeal. The measure was taken at a time when tensions between Beijing and Tokyo worsened again, following statements by Japanese Prime Minister, Sanae Takaichi.</description><pubDate>2025-12-15 01:29:03</pubDate></item><item><title>Crime | Government does not release data on suicides and attempts</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/15/crime-governo-nao-divulga-dados-sobre-suicidios-e-tentativas/</link><description>After the Health Services, the Security department also stopped publishing data on suicides and attempts, after ten years of publication. The absence was noted in the release of crime data for the months of January to September this year, which show the increase in sexual abuse of minors to almost double
 
The Government stopped publishing data on suicide cases in Macau, as well as attempts. The absence of these numbers was noted by the newspaper Cheng Pou when it released crime data for the months of January and September this year on Friday.
The publication even questions whether “the data on suicide has become ‘the secret that cannot be said’ of the authorities, committed to building a happy Macau”, remembering that this data began to be released in 2015. Highlight is the fact that the Health Services also stopped publishing the statistics, something that was done every three months. In the case of the Security Secretariat, the data was monthly and was broken down by sex, age group and methods used.
The lack of numbers comes after Macau broke records in terms of suicide cases in 2024, registering 90 deaths, 2.27 percent more than in 2023. Compared to 2022, the increase was 12.5 percent. Of the 90 cases, 48 ​​concerned male victims and 42 female victims, aged between 12 and 76 years. The most recent data, for the first half of this year, reveals 41 deaths by suicide and 101 attempts.
In the release of crime statistics, on Friday, only one case of death by suicide appears in relation to an episode of homicide between brothers, which occurred in August this year, in the north zone. Here, the older brother jumped from the balcony, being suspected of having killed his younger brother due to financial disputes.
Break in crime
Looking at the crime panorama in general terms, there is a drop of 7.1 percent in the months under analysis, compared to the same period last year. The territory's authorities highlighted the sharp drop in computer crimes. The Secretary for Security, Chan Tsz King, said that the drop is due to the “decreasing trend” of “crimes that attract more attention from society”, including serious violent crime, theft, robbery, fraud and computer crimes.
In the first nine months of the year, 187 violent crimes were recorded, which represents a drop of 11 percent compared to the same period in 2024 (210). Thefts, robberies and frauds fell by 7.7, 5.9 and 23.6 percent, respectively. Computer crime, which recorded 770 cases in the first nine months of 2024, showed a decline of 52.1 percent in the period under analysis, with 369 cases.
The decline in cases of fraud using telecommunications, cyber fraud and computer fraud, said Chan Tsz King, “reflects the effectiveness of the prevention and combat work carried out by the police, and the significant increase in public awareness about fraud prevention”, he said.
The Government also highlighted that crime related to illicit gambling increased by 985 percent between January and September this year, with 394 more cases compared to the same period in 2024. The increase is due to the entry into force, in October last year, of the law to combat illicit gambling crimes, which introduced “the new crime of ‘exploitation of illicit exchange for gambling’ and expanded the scope of coverage of some crimes related to illicit gambling”.
For the same reason, said the secretary, gambling-related crimes soared in the first three quarters of 2025 – 1,737 cases, 70.1 percent more than in the same period last year. In the past, the official said, fraud committed by people illegally exchanging money outside casinos “could not be identified as related to gambling”. “However, with the criminalization of ‘illegal money exchange’ and the improvement of legal provisions”, these cases “are now included in gambling crime statistics, thus increasing the number of crimes”, he indicated.
More abuse of minors
Chan Tsz King, who took office in October and presented the crime report for the first time on Friday, also referred to a 6.1 percent increase in crimes against the person, with child sexual abuse increasing by 86.7 percent, from 15 cases in the first nine months of 2024 to 28 cases in the same period this year.
The secretary explained that these are essentially “voluntary sexual acts between people of the same age”, with “transmission of photographs and pornographic images”, without forgetting cases of “less serious sexual harassment”.
“Cases involving people with family relationships were also identified, which deserves the attention of society”, said Chan Tsz King, who released data on awareness-raising actions on this problem: more than 70 activities carried out by the police, which saw the participation of more than 12,000 people, including students, guardians and teaching staff.
Drug trafficking and sale and drug consumption, in turn, registered an increase of 37.1 percent, with 13 more cases, and 72.7 percent, eight more cases, respectively. According to the secretary's presentation, the 48 cases registered in the three quarters and the respective increase are due to “the discovery of several cases of cross-border drug trafficking through the reinforcement of internal and external police cooperation”, highlighting a case that occurred in September, when 31 kilos of cannabis flower worth 31.77 million patacas were seized. Chan Tsz King said that this was “the biggest case of cannabis smuggling seized in the history of Macau”.
Between walls
In the case of the crime of rape, there was a decline in the number of rape crimes, to a total of 24 cases, 40 percent less than in the same period of the previous year.
The Secretary for Security added that “more than 70 percent of the victims were not residents of Macau”, and “the majority of these crimes occurred in hotel rooms”, while “a number of these involved pecuniary conflicts between the victims and the suspects, and it is not possible to rule out the hypothesis that some of the cases occurred in the context of a sexual transaction”.
In this context, the secretary clarified that the police authorities have been “in close communication with the hotel sector”, and “police devices and inspections in peripheral areas of hotels and casinos” have been reinforced. Between January and September, more than 160 police actions were carried out to combat prostitution, with 192 people suspected of engaging in prostitution activity being intercepted.
Além disso, no período em causa foram resolvidos 17 casos da prática dos crimes de lenocínio ou de exploração de prostituição, com a detenção de 26 suspeitos.
Silence as always
Questioned by Lusa during the press conference about the first case to be investigated in Macau within the scope of national security, the secretary made no comments. “The case (…) is being handled by judicial entities and, due to secrecy, it would not be appropriate for the Secretary of Security to comment”, added Chan Tsz King, who was a Public Prosecutor when former deputy Au Kam San was detained.
At the end of July, the territory's police announced the arrest of Au Kam San, the first under the state security defense law, which came into force in 2009, with the scope being expanded 14 years later. The accusation is not yet known and there is no information about who will defend the former deputy.

The hostilities, which broke out on December 7, have so far caused at least 33 deaths and more than 200 injuries, in addition to around 800,000 people being displaced on both sides of the border.
The two countries accuse each other of having unleashed hostilities and attacking civilians. Last Friday, Donald Trump stated that the leaders of the two countries had agreed to a ceasefire after a phone call from him, but the Thai Government denied this commitment and the fighting continued this Saturday and continued yesterday.
According to Thai Defense Ministry spokesman Surasant Kongsiri, Cambodia shelled several border provinces on Saturday night and yesterday. The Cambodian counterpart, Maly Socheata, accused Thai forces of continuing to bomb and fire mortars in areas close to the border since midnight on Sunday.
Cambodia closed its land borders with Thailand this Saturday, leaving thousands of people stranded on both sides of the border. The decision, according to Phnom Penh, aims to protect civilians — including foreigners of various nationalities, who were unable to cross the border into Thailand — from the risks associated with military clashes, which last week included the use of fighter jets and artillery fire along the border, which is around 820 kilometers long.
Cambodia has asked its citizens living in Thailand and Thais hoping to return to their country to remain where they are “until the ceasefire is fully enforced.”
Thailand, in turn, expressed concern about this decision by Phnom Penh, especially as it expected the return on Saturday of around 7,000 Thais who had been waiting for days at the border to enter the country and who are now prohibited from crossing it by land.
"These actions violate numerous provisions of international law that, for our part, Thailand respects. I guarantee that Cambodians and other foreign citizens living in Thailand will receive assistance in accordance with international law", said deputy spokesperson for the Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Maratee Nalita Andamo, at a press conference yesterday.
An old case
Thailand and Cambodia dispute the sovereignty of territories where Khmer Empire temples are located along a border of around 820 kilometers, drawn at the beginning of the 20th century during the French colonial period. In July this year, a first episode of violence caused 43 deaths in five days and forced around 300,000 people to leave their homes in areas close to the common border, before a ceasefire under the auspices of the United States, China and Malaysia.
The two countries then signed a ceasefire agreement on October 26, under the aegis of Donald Trump, which Bangkok suspended a few weeks later, following the explosion of a mine that injured several of its soldiers, and which Thailand accuses of having been installed after the ceasefire.</description><pubDate>2025-12-15 02:08:12</pubDate></item><item><title>Takeaway | No labor regulation plans</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/15/take-away-sem-planos-de-regulamentacao-laboral/</link><description>Chan Un Tong, director of the Department of Labor Affairs (DSAL), said there are no plans on the table to regulate the courier profession, which is intended to deliver take-away meals.
According to TDM Rádio Macau, the person in charge responded to a written question from deputy Ngan Iek Hang, explaining that the labor and legal protection of couriers depends on the link they have with the platform that provides the delivery service.
If there is a signed contract, the current labor law applies, but if there is only a service provision contract, the conditions agreed between the parties apply.

Geniuses, the ancient Greeks knew about the Earth's sphericity and that's why they attributed a maximum circle to the planet, which they named Ison. Today we call it Ecuador. However, these Hellene geographers considered these regions to be unreachable and uninhabitable.
Torrid Zone: there, unbearable heat would boil the oceans, preventing the passage to temperate zones, postulated further south of this line that marked the maximum circle of the sphere.
A simple islet, named “das Rolas”, a mere hundred meters from the island of São Tomé, in the Gulf of Guinea, is crossed by this equatorial line. This location of the former Portuguese colony provides it with a type of climate that is only found with such intensity close to the equator: the temperature varies little and, contrary to what the Greeks thought, it does not reach excessive values. Its range is between 20 and 29 degrees Celsius, but the “normal” temperature remains between 23 and 25 degrees. Night, day and throughout the year.
In the permanently cloudy sky, the Sun and Moon are rarely seen. And when this happens, they never fail to appear wrapped in veils of clouds, which gives them an unreal character, invoking ancient magic, witnessing moving skies.
When, towards the end of the afternoon, the rain extends its reign for more than two or three hours, often presented to plants and animals by a thunderstorm, the light dies and a very dark night reigns over the land and sea. The stars fall beyond the clouds that cover everything. On a night like this, there is no moonlight to illuminate or pierce the clouds. A deep pitch falls on the earth, a darkness that is impenetrable to our eyes. And it was like that, at three in the morning, that I woke up. My eyes opened to an abysmal darkness. Nothing, absolutely nothing could be seen. He knew he had the window open, but not a ray of light deigned to enter the room. I reached out, but the lamp didn't work. The electricity was out again. I waited for some time, hoping to get used to the blackness and discover some shapes in it. In vain. He was immersed in a well of black, warm water, he could feel the humidity on his skin, which had just woken up sweaty from a nightmare. I decided to get up and leave the house, looking for some light.
The rain had stopped. Outside, the forest celebrated, hummed, reverberated with sounds. There would be millions of insects, amphibians, vertebrates, all of them nocturnal animals, also immersed in the dark, where they found food, sex and salvation. Life didn't need light. It was heard, deafening.
At the edge of that spontaneous excess of trees and plants, nothing could be seen either. Dark, impenetrable dark. Only the sound prevailed, louder and louder, and suggested movements among the trees. That mixture of buzzing, squealing, buzzing, ringing, rales, loudly surrounded my ears, building a helmet that blocked all other senses, including the one that affects me in space. I was dizzy. And in that half-daziness, I groped my way back to the house, to my bed.
There was nothing he could do. Forget the coffee, eliminate the possibility of reading or consulting a computer. Lying in the dark as if waking up in a coffin.
Our mind cannot handle fear for long. Mostly irrational. As was the case. I can't really talk about fear, fear, but about discomfort, derived from the fragile situation that I attributed to myself. Everything could happen in that dark, and I wouldn't see him. If for some reason you had to leave the room, where would you go, if everything was plunged into darkness? But nothing was happening in the darkness of my room, nor would anything happen that would force me to grope through the pitch black, looking for a light. On the contrary, in that bed I was protected by the dark and if I saw nothing nothing would see me either. This thought provided some comfort. All things considered, that abysmal pitch was strangely comfortable for me. I made it a protective cloak and not a space of threats. And so I remained.
The ancient Chinese say that everyone has an excellent place to stay. A place where you can develop and enjoy who you really are. Maybe this dark package is mine. Perhaps in it I can be for myself what I really am, setting aside what surrounds me, instructs and distracts me. I am undoubtedly alone. Without the possibility of communicating with another person or even acting in my surroundings. I'm left. With me. Alone. Isolated. Here I am not the anthropologist, nor the editor, none of my social titles perform any functions. I am not the husband, the friend or the lover. From the outside I only have the language that inhabits me and my brain rebels in search of meaning. And even this takes second place in daydreams whose material seems to emerge from another place, from knowledge not conditioned to a language — an impression of the world and not its explanation.
I am a consciousness separated from things, which in the dark finds its most intimate relationship with the universe, of almost dissolution, a chamazita, a fiery being, whose interior insists on shining in the dark night. The universe and me. I'm unique. Nothing can divide me without destroying me. I know I am an individual, because I feel it deeply, with an almost painful acuity, even though neurologists tell me about the Self as an evolutionary fiction, structuralists see me as a product of Culture, psychoanalysts as a Family and Marxists as History.

The Taoist philosophy of the beginnings, that of Laozi and the Book of Way and Virtue (《道德经/經》), will choose the water of the ocean and the sea as the privileged image of the Tao (道 Dào), that which cannot be said, without form, on which the universe itself and the ten thousand beings (万物 wânwù) that inhabit it depend, as well as the first principles of existence, the void (無/无 wú), the masculine yang (陽/阳 yáng) and the feminine yin (阴/隂yīn).
This choice of an indigenous Chinese philosophy finds its echo in popular language and philosophy, for example in expressions such as “enormous capacity” (海量Hǎiliàng), which can have both an affective and social interpretation of portentous generosity or magnanimity, as well as a physical and concrete one, applying to someone who can ingest large quantities of alcohol. The sea is also linked to the word good and constant, for example in the “oath of eternal love as energetic as the sea and firm as the mountain”, where mountain lends added firmness to the promise (海誓山盟 or 山盟海誓Hǎishì-Shānméng or Shānméng-Hǎishì).
The ocean, the sea, but also the great rivers are made up of generous water, both in popular and erudite Taoist philosophy.  Here water is the figurative model of the Tao, as read in the Book of Way and Virtue and in the best sinology, which is why we recommend additional reading of Alan Watts Tao: The Watercourse Way.
It is worth paying special attention to the chapters in which water appears as the closest representation of the Tao in the Book of Way and Virtue, namely: chapters 8, 14, 34, 66 and 78.
In chapter 8 we are informed that the Tao is the supreme good “like water” (上善如水) (Abreu, 2014, 43), but it is not water itself. Therefore, it will be due to the similarity of functions that both are compared. Now water is generous, granting life to all beings, without establishing any distinction between them, its gift reaches even those that no one likes and I am thinking, for example, of parasites. It remains close to the earth to fertilize it, it is deep, simple, true, fair and correct and very timely, when it washes and cleans at the right time.
This is also the case with the Tao.  In the first verses of chapter XIV, regarding the Tao, an aquatic image appears again:
 
You look and you don't see,
It's called Indistinct.
You listen and you don't hear,
It's called Silent.
Touch and don't get caught,
It's called Subtle.
This trio is not decipherable
For it merges into a unity
2 (Ribeiro, 2004, 32-33)
And a little later we are told that he is nameless and uninterrupted (繩繩不可名) (Ibidem)
The Tao is like an ocean, an uninterrupted and inexhaustible unity in which someone easily imagines themselves swimming in water that is neither too bright nor too dark, as would happen to Michael Saso in his 14th meditation on the Tao, in A Taoist Cookbook. with Meditations from the Laozi DaodeJing, which he called “Nadar no Tao” (Saso, 1994,47), a meditation that he accompanied by a recipe for spinach, soy paste and sesame, since the wise man is the one who “empties the mind and fills the belly” (虛其心實其復) (Ribeiro, 2004, 10-11), here one feels how the author is immersed in the great Tao, following with the current.
Water can also be represented in a large river, as in chapter 34:
The great Tao floods like a river,
To the left, to the right,
Ten thousand beings depend on him.
（大道泛兮/其可左右/万物恃之而生）
(Abreu, 2013, 94-95)
In the same chapter we are told that the Tao not only gives life but nourishes and feeds, being an essential shelter in the return to the origins, not for death, but for eternal life diluted in the great unity, which is why it is great, as big as the sea, or rather the great sea, which is the ocean.
Whoever wants to be as it should be in existence or even correctly govern the world, must follow the model of the water in rivers and seas, as we read in chapter 66:
Rivers and seas are greater than a hundred valleys
Because they remain below them,
and so they are princes, dominating waterfalls and streams.
(江海所以能为百谷王者/以其善下之/故能为百故王)3
(Abreu,2013, 158-159)
The wise man's behavior is distinguished by its malleability and spontaneity. He does not impose himself, which is why he is respected by everyone, only he should then govern, because he acts naturally, without oppressing, without hurting, letting everyone follow their course as freely as possible, as is reiterated in chapter 78:
Nothing in the world is more malleable and flexible
as for water,
but in attacking what is hard and rigid
nothing can surpass it
and there is nothing to replace it.
(天下莫柔弱於水/而攻堅強者莫之能先)
(Ribeiro, 2004 160-161)
Laozi's Taoist water is among the Five Chinese Elements (Water, Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal) the one that evokes great oceanic unity, source of life for everything that exists, but also of death, or rather, of return to origins and eternal life, when this image represents the philosophical principle Tao. And if water, fresh and salty, is the supreme good of the world, the Tao is the origin, the supreme good, including of Heaven. As a root or mysterious female (chap 6) it is the root of the cosmos as we know and experience it. He is a source of spiritual and material life, but so is water, since his model must be followed in all circumstances, from the material source of beings to complex human conduct. People who act correctly, and especially Taoist sages and saints, are aware of the physical and concrete model of water that helps them practice another invisible one, that of Tao.  They will then be malleable and adaptable, capable of nourishing themselves from the inside and giving life to any form on the outside. You will know how to transform yourself to better nourish and vivify.
The Taoist oceanic model differs from the one that inspired the Portuguese throughout history, who looked to the sea as their ocean. Taoist water is not challenging nor does it call for conquest, it does not have cables of storm or hope to bend, it does not require weapons or boats, nor maps, nor nautical instruments. It is the dominant, conquering element within all beings, who will adapt to this most malleable element, without needing to develop their inventive spirit. The philosophy it leads to does not ask for vigilance or a critical spirit, but adaptation to the world as it is and generosity to accept it with a minimum of suffering and a maximum of joy.

Four years ago, in 2021, James inherited more than 300 pieces of antiques from his elderly father. The family heritage dates back to the Song dynasty (10th-13th centuries) and the collection includes exquisite jade items, porcelain, bronze wares, incense burners and high-value jewelry from various periods. During the turbulent war years, these treasures were buried in a hole in the backyard for decades. Now, through their interdisciplinary curatorial project, they are about to enter a dynamic dialogue with the worlds of fashion, art and sport.
Joy: How did you feel when you received the family inheritance?
I was completely surprised! My brothers and I had no idea that our family had such things. We were ignorant about our family history.
Joy: Tell me about your family history.
James: Our original surname was Zhao and we belonged to the imperial family of the Song dynasty. Our roots are in the heart of Chinese civilization. Chinese history has been complicated and turbulent, and my family has failed to preserve the details of our specific ups and downs. All I know is that in 1931, to escape the Japanese occupation, my grandmother took my father and other family members and together they walked to Chongqing in the south. My father was still a boy. To survive and take better care of her son and family, my grandmother decided to remarry into a local clan called the Xing. The Xing family accepted the proposal, as long as my grandmother paid them 300 taels of silver, a significant amount in wartime China. That's how we changed our imperial surname Zhao to Xing. After remarrying, my grandmother asked my father to dig a hole in the yard. That's where the family heirloom was stored, until my father decided to pass it on to me. My father didn't want to divide the collection between my brothers, as he knew I was the only one who could appreciate its true value. To repay my father's appreciation for me, I immediately gave my private collection a name: Jade Ambience, 琼华幸境 in Chinese.
Joy: Why that name?
James: I feel like I've always been lucky in life, like I've always been protected by some supernatural force with which I could cure strange illnesses and save people. You know, I love helping people and I can't stand seeing sadness and injustice in the world. Since he was a child, he saved lives during the annual floods of the Yangtze River in Chongqing. I didn't fear for my own life, because I knew I was protected. Will it be a gift? I would like to believe so. I even abandoned my career as a successful businessman and decided I wanted to be a soldier, so I could actually contribute to my country instead of earning a lot of money. I even turned down an opportunity to go to the USA and run a company there. That was in 1989. My experiences in the army made me stronger, both physically and mentally. I value life's experiences because they make me understand the human world better and give me positive energy to appreciate each day. In some inexplicable way, I attribute all of this to the jade items in my collection (laughs).
JOy: In fact, Chinese people believe that jade stone radiates positive energy. Since ancient times, jade has been associated with protective power, healing power and immortality. What is the true value of your collection, in your opinion?
As I said, jade has a very special place in Chinese culture. Jade symbolizes moral integrity and virtue, which is the stone's central symbolic value.
Confucianism inextricably linked jade to the ideal of the “exemplary person” (junzi 君子), who should embody the virtues reflected in the physical qualities of jade, including benevolence, righteousness, wisdom, courage (“It is better to be a broken jade than an intact tile”) and purity.
Jade served as a material expression of authority and was made into ritual objects used to communicate with divine forces and symbolized imperial power—most notably through the legendary Imperial Seal made of jade. For ordinary Chinese people, jade offers protection and good luck and has long been considered a talisman against evil forces. Jade carvings also carry auspicious meanings: bats for blessings, peaches for longevity, and fish for abundance. In ancient belief systems, jade was believed to preserve the body and soul after death. This concept found its ultimate expression in the jade burial suits of the Han dynasty, intricately assembled from thousands of pieces of jade to ensure immortality. Jade was also seen as the essence of the cosmos—a fusion of the vital energies of heaven and earth. The Chinese language is rich in jade-related expressions that convey admiration and virtue! Therefore, jade items are timeless symbols of love, symbolizing lasting and sincere affection. Today, jade remains a precious heirloom, a solid investment, and a powerful emblem of cultural identity — connecting contemporary Chinese to our heritage. In this way, jade contains old and new life! Jade is not just a precious stone full of vitality. It is a cultural landmark — a bridge between old China and new China.
Joy: What do you want to do with your collection?
James: Right now, I'm planning to organize a traveling exhibition in Beijing, Shanghai and maybe Macau. As I said before, jade is full of vitality. Jade is a bridge between ancient China and modern China. So I don't want to limit my collection to the usual antique circles. I'm thinking about doing cross exhibitions with fashion, art and sport. I want jade to have a lively dialogue with contemporary, young and modern Chinese audiences!</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Crime | Government does not release data on suicides and attempts</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/15/crime-governo-nao-divulga-dados-sobre-suicidios-e-tentativas/</link><description>After the Health Services, the Security department also stopped publishing data on suicides and attempts, after ten years of publication. The absence was noted in the release of crime data for the months of January to September this year, which show the increase in sexual abuse of minors to almost double
 
The Government stopped publishing data on suicide cases in Macau, as well as attempts. The absence of these numbers was noted by the newspaper Cheng Pou when it released crime data for the months of January and September this year on Friday.
The publication even questions whether “the data on suicide has become ‘the secret that cannot be said’ of the authorities, committed to building a happy Macau”, remembering that this data began to be released in 2015. Highlight is the fact that the Health Services also stopped publishing the statistics, something that was done every three months. In the case of the Security Secretariat, the data was monthly and was broken down by sex, age group and methods used.
The lack of numbers comes after Macau broke records in terms of suicide cases in 2024, registering 90 deaths, 2.27 percent more than in 2023. Compared to 2022, the increase was 12.5 percent. Of the 90 cases, 48 ​​concerned male victims and 42 female victims, aged between 12 and 76 years. The most recent data, for the first half of this year, reveals 41 deaths by suicide and 101 attempts.
In the release of crime statistics, on Friday, only one case of death by suicide appears in relation to an episode of homicide between brothers, which occurred in August this year, in the north zone. Here, the older brother jumped from the balcony, being suspected of having killed his younger brother due to financial disputes.
Break in crime
Looking at the crime panorama in general terms, there is a drop of 7.1 percent in the months under analysis, compared to the same period last year. The territory's authorities highlighted the sharp drop in computer crimes. The Secretary for Security, Chan Tsz King, said that the drop is due to the “decreasing trend” of “crimes that attract more attention from society”, including serious violent crime, theft, robbery, fraud and computer crimes.
In the first nine months of the year, 187 violent crimes were recorded, which represents a drop of 11 percent compared to the same period in 2024 (210). Thefts, robberies and frauds fell by 7.7, 5.9 and 23.6 percent, respectively. Computer crime, which recorded 770 cases in the first nine months of 2024, showed a decline of 52.1 percent in the period under analysis, with 369 cases.
The decline in cases of fraud using telecommunications, cyber fraud and computer fraud, said Chan Tsz King, “reflects the effectiveness of the prevention and combat work carried out by the police, and the significant increase in public awareness about fraud prevention”, he said.
The Government also highlighted that crime related to illicit gambling increased by 985 percent between January and September this year, with 394 more cases compared to the same period in 2024. The increase is due to the entry into force, in October last year, of the law to combat illicit gambling crimes, which introduced “the new crime of ‘exploitation of illicit exchange for gambling’ and expanded the scope of coverage of some crimes related to illicit gambling”.
For the same reason, said the secretary, gambling-related crimes soared in the first three quarters of 2025 – 1,737 cases, 70.1 percent more than in the same period last year. In the past, the official said, fraud committed by people illegally exchanging money outside casinos “could not be identified as related to gambling”. “However, with the criminalization of ‘illegal money exchange’ and the improvement of legal provisions”, these cases “are now included in gambling crime statistics, thus increasing the number of crimes”, he indicated.
More abuse of minors
Chan Tsz King, who took office in October and presented the crime report for the first time on Friday, also referred to a 6.1 percent increase in crimes against the person, with child sexual abuse increasing by 86.7 percent, from 15 cases in the first nine months of 2024 to 28 cases in the same period this year.
The secretary explained that these are essentially “voluntary sexual acts between people of the same age”, with “transmission of photographs and pornographic images”, without forgetting cases of “less serious sexual harassment”.
“Cases involving people with family relationships were also identified, which deserves the attention of society”, said Chan Tsz King, who released data on awareness-raising actions on this problem: more than 70 activities carried out by the police, which saw the participation of more than 12,000 people, including students, guardians and teaching staff.
Drug trafficking and sale and drug consumption, in turn, registered an increase of 37.1 percent, with 13 more cases, and 72.7 percent, eight more cases, respectively. According to the secretary's presentation, the 48 cases registered in the three quarters and the respective increase are due to “the discovery of several cases of cross-border drug trafficking through the reinforcement of internal and external police cooperation”, highlighting a case that occurred in September, when 31 kilos of cannabis flower worth 31.77 million patacas were seized. Chan Tsz King said that this was “the biggest case of cannabis smuggling seized in the history of Macau”.
Between walls
In the case of the crime of rape, there was a decline in the number of rape crimes, to a total of 24 cases, 40 percent less than in the same period of the previous year.
The Secretary for Security added that “more than 70 percent of the victims were not residents of Macau”, and “the majority of these crimes occurred in hotel rooms”, while “a number of these involved pecuniary conflicts between the victims and the suspects, and it is not possible to rule out the hypothesis that some of the cases occurred in the context of a sexual transaction”.
In this context, the secretary clarified that the police authorities have been “in close communication with the hotel sector”, and “police devices and inspections in peripheral areas of hotels and casinos” have been reinforced. Between January and September, more than 160 police actions were carried out to combat prostitution, with 192 people suspected of engaging in prostitution activity being intercepted.
Furthermore, during the period in question, 17 cases of pimping or exploitation of prostitution were resolved, with the arrest of 26 suspects.
Silence as always
Questioned by Lusa during the press conference about the first case to be investigated in Macau within the scope of national security, the secretary made no comments. “The case (…) is being handled by judicial entities and, due to secrecy, it would not be appropriate for the Secretary of Security to comment”, added Chan Tsz King, who was a Public Prosecutor when former deputy Au Kam San was detained.
At the end of July, the territory's police announced the arrest of Au Kam San, the first under the state security defense law, which came into force in 2009, with the scope being expanded 14 years later. The accusation is not yet known and there is no information about who will defend the former deputy.

“The co-legislators agreed on a target of a 90 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2040, compared to 1990 levels, with the aim of achieving climate neutrality in the EU by 2050”, is announced in a statement released in Brussels.
After several hours of negotiations, the European Parliament and the Council thus reached, this morning, a provisional political agreement (which will have to be confirmed by both) on an amendment to the EU Climate Law, establishing a new intermediate and binding target for 2040, that of reducing net greenhouse gas emissions by 90 percent compared to 1990 levels.
Even so, MEPs and countries agreed to introduce new forms of flexibility to meet the 2040 target, “believing that the green transition and European competitiveness must advance hand in hand”, according to the note.
Under review
Specifically, from 2036 onwards, up to five percentage points of emissions reductions (two more than the Commission's initial proposal) could come from high-quality international carbon credits, compatible with the Paris Agreement. In the case of Portugal, for example, this means that sustainable projects in countries such as Portuguese-speaking African Countries (PALOP) can count towards the Portuguese target.
“Thanks to Parliament's insistence, additional safeguards were integrated, including the prohibition of financing projects in partner countries that contradict the Union's strategic interests”, highlights the European assembly. It is up to the European Commission to analyze different options for the role of international credits in future EU climate legislation to reach the 2040 target.
Furthermore, the community executive will assess progress every two years, taking into account the most recent scientific data, technological advances and the EU's international competitiveness.
"The review will analyze the situation of net removals at European level, comparing it with what is necessary to meet the 2040 target, as well as possible implementation difficulties and the potential to strengthen the EU's industrial competitiveness. Trends in energy prices and their impacts on companies and families will also be considered", according to the European Parliament.
This will allow Brussels to modify the 2040 target or take additional measures to strengthen the support framework, for example to protect the EU's competitiveness, prosperity and social stability.
Parliament will now vote on the informal agreement and the Council will also have to approve it, with the text coming into force 20 days after its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union. The European Climate Law makes each country's effort to reduce its polluting emissions legally binding.</description><pubDate>2025-12-11 04:37:47</pubDate></item><item><title>Europe | Merz considers aspects of Trump's geostrategy unacceptable</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/10/europa-merz-considera-inaceitaveis-pontos-da-geostrategia-de-trump/</link><description>The head of the German federal government, Friedrich Merz, declared yesterday that there are certain unacceptable points in the document on Defense and geostrategy of the North American Administration led by Donald Trump, from a European perspective. “I don’t see any need for Americans to want to save Democracy in Europe,” he said, on a visit to Rhineland-Palatinate (a southwestern state), which is home to several United States of America (USA) military bases.
In a strategic document on US national security, released last week, there is a warning about the danger of “civilizational extinction” in Europe if “current trends” continue.
Trump, in the preface, summarizes: “we put America first in everything we do”. “It is more than plausible that, in a few decades at most, the members of NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) will become predominantly non-European”, he wrote, adding that “it is legitimate to question whether they will perceive their place in the World or their alliance with the USA, in the same way as those who signed the organization's charter”.
The White House regrets European decisions that “undermine political freedom and sovereignty, the migration policies that are transforming the continent [Europe] and creating tensions, as well as the censorship of freedom of expression and the repression of political opposition, the drop in birth rates and the loss of national identities (…)”.
Washington expresses the desire for “Europe to remain European, regain its civilizational self-confidence and abandon its fruitless obsession with regulatory suffocation.”</description><pubDate>2025-12-10 03:31:29</pubDate></item><item><title>Australia | Twelve killed in attack during Jewish festival</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/15/australia-doze-mortos-em-ataque-durante-festa-judaica/</link><description>At least twelve people died and many injured were transported to Sydney hospitals yesterday, after a shooting attack on the Australian beach of Bondi, while a Jewish celebration was taking place. “There are two people in police custody on Bondi beach”, reported the New South Wales State Police on its X account, which asks “the public to avoid the area”.
Citing police sources, the AFP news agency reports that the attack caused ten deaths. The New South Wales ambulance service confirmed to ABC television that at least 16 people were transported to six hospital centers in the region.
Several witnesses report that it was a shooting attack carried out by an as yet undetermined number of armed people, but the authorities have not confirmed this information either. A British tourist told French news agency AFP that he saw “two gunmen dressed in black and armed with semi-automatic rifles”.
Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has already issued a statement lamenting the “shocking and distressing scenes” coming from Bondi and confirmed the existence of injuries.
Part of the beach was the scene of a celebration of the Jewish festival of Hanukkah, which began yesterday and, although Australian authorities have not yet made any connection with the incident, the President of Israel, Isaac Herzog, denounced what he classified as a “vile terrorist attack against the Jews who were lighting the first candles” of the religious festival.
"Our heart is with them.

The testimony was written in Macau by former resident and university professor Duarte Trigueiros. 50 years after the occupation, the author reminded HM of the work launched in 2022
This year has been marked by the celebrations of the 50th anniversary of the independence of many former Portuguese colonies. Timor-Leste went to one of these territories. However, shortly after the unilateral proclamation of independence, on November 28, 1975, there was a period of confrontation that culminated in the Indonesian occupation, on December 7 of the same year.
This Sunday marks 50 years since the invasion that marked the fate of the young country. In connection with this date, the book “Regresso a Uaidora, the childhood and youth of Domingos Gusmão” was released in 2022, which reveals the story of the Timorese, who was a student in Macau and a student of the author Duarte Trigueiros, former economist and professor at the University of São José. HM spoke to the author about the reflection of the pain and struggle for self-determination of a people that can be seen in the life of a man and his family.
"When I was teaching in Macau, I collected the testimony of this Timorese from Baucau. Domingos Gusmão, knowing that he had taught at the National University of Timor-Leste for several years, told me how he and his family lived through all these terrible events."
This is how the book was born, with Trigueiros merely reporting the testimony, later corrected in partnership with Domingos Gusmão. The work only has an online version, but at the time of launch it had the support of Fundação Oriente in printing some copies. Matebian, East Timor
O contacto de Duarte Trigueiros, que viveu vários anos em Macau, com Domingos Gusmão deu-se na Festa da Lusofonia, em 2015. “Fui à barraca de Timor-Leste e ele disse-me que tinha coisas interessantes para me contar, mas que não conseguia falar bem português, e que gostava de deixar o seu testemunho escrito. A dada altura propus fazer-lhe perguntas a partir da sua infância, como era a vida na aldeia, e assim nasceu o livro, com nove chapters.”
The beginning of the work describes, “through the eyes of a child, the day-to-day life of farmers in the Baucau mountains in Timor-Leste, the determination in which they reacted to the invasion of their country in 1975 and the brutal repression that followed”. "The book follows not only his life, but also his family and the few who remained. In the end, there was practically no one left", describes Duarte Trigueiros.
According to the work, Domingos Gusmão was born on November 1, 1969 in the village of Uaidora, belonging to the municipality of Baucau, the son of Julião, a farmer, and Juliana, a maid. "But only the place where I was born is correct. The date of birth is nothing more than a conjecture and the names that appear on the certificate as being my parents, Julião and Juliana, are also not those of my real father and mother, but of relatives who adopted me when I was an orphan. In fact, I am the son of Martinho Gusmão, whose code name was 'Maunoco' and he was the chief of the Uaidora village until his death in 1983; and my mother was Ricardina, Martinho Gusmão’s second wife, the one who gave him offspring.” This is how Domingos’ story begins.
Going to Baucau
The work recounts very difficult years, with thousands of Timorese fleeing into the bush to escape the Indonesians, organizing armed struggle. One of the chapters, highlights Duarte Trigueiros, reports how Domingos and his family "were deported and left without any type of support, without doctors or food. "A huge number of people died at that time, until the beginning of the 80s, and they [Dominicos Gusmão's family], already in the place where they were cultivating the land, began to have fruits from the land, and send children to school. This boy [Domingos Gusmão], during that time, started preparing to go to Baucau to study, something that was not easy, as it was necessary to find a place, and there were many children.” Domingos and Xanana Gusmão
It was there that the family decided to leave the village and go to Baucau, finding jobs “at the service of the troops, judges, nurses and doctors”, which gave them their first contacts with the Timorese resistance.
"He [Domingos Gusmão] began organizing what they called a clandestine front with his colleagues. The book reports all these adventures that clearly reveal how the resistance worked. This boy then felt the desire to continue his studies and applied to a Catholic seminary", recalled Duarte Trigueiros.
The connection to the Catholic religion was not an accident. "The purpose was to go abroad, because the only thing that Indonesians really respected was the Catholic Church, they didn't respect anything else. And he left, spent a number of years training. He was in the Philippines, where he also participated in resistance activities, and returned as a priest, in 2012."
Writing this book was important to Domingos Gusmão because he “wanted to mention the names of the [Timorese] commanders of the first phase, when the Indonesian troops entered through Baucau, towards the interior, and there were a large number of resistance commanders who resisted, almost without weapons, and were killed”. “When he spoke to me about this subject, he was very insistent, he told me ‘Write down the name of that commander.’ Everything so that the names would not be forgotten”, he recalled.
"What he told me is that nowadays, in Timor-Leste, people are compensating the members of the resistance who are alive, but there are many dead who gave their lives for this and are being forgotten. But this book also talks about everything on a personal level, about what happened to the uncle, how the father died at that stage, thrown to the ground, with a gun butt, with kicks, because he refused to accept an order and they threw him to the ground. He was the head of the village and had to accept the order [of the Indonesians], but he refused”, highlighted Duarte Trigueiros.
For the author, the work tells “a truer version” of what the Indonesian occupation was, and very specifically about the experiences of the town of Uaidora and the interior of the country.
In the book, you can read Domingos' testimony about this phase of resistance in Baucau, starting in 1986. “I owe my enlistment in the resistance to the clandestine fronts and also to my colleague Domingos de Oliveira. (…) A few weeks later, on the 16th or 17th of September 1991, the centenary of the Dili cathedral was celebrated and young people were invited to participate. 14 left from Baucau. Buses full of teenagers and I was one of them. The next day, during the return trip, FRETILIN flags appeared and we all sang hymns to independence.
As we passed through Manatuto, the troops ordered us to stop, but then they told us to continue; and at the entrance to Baucau, before the airport, the road was blocked and we were surrounded by a strong military device. There were only three assault cars!”
Gusmão continues his account of this tense moment. "After having cornered us like this, the troops, with the assault vehicles on the right side, occupied the left side. The 14 trucks were lined up with the military device, which had its weapons in position, ready to fire. They were like a very long firing squad. There we stayed, with all those weapons pointed at us, in silence while time passed and nothing happened."
Support from Portuguese
Duarte Trigueiros and Domingos Gusmão kept in touch, but a stroke took away the Timorese's quality of life. "He hardly responds to my emails. Maybe he has a different outlook on life", confesses the author.
Another perspective that the work gives, according to Trigueiros, is the position of the Portuguese authorities during the years of Indonesian occupation, dispelling the idea that there was abandonment after independence. "I simply show what Domingos told me, and he told me that many of the resistance commanders had been Portuguese soldiers and that, therefore, they knew how to use weapons. He also told me that they were extremely patriotic. There is a report that in the 90s they tried to get a satellite phone from Portugal to give to the resistance, and there are references to the support of the Portuguese Embassy in Manila. I think we looked good in the photograph", he concludes.
Duarte Trigueiros taught in Timor between 2004 and 2009, where he found higher education very weak. "The students practically didn't know Portuguese and we had to teach in Portuguese. That alone was a huge effort. In general, the students were weak, they were very poorly prepared. The [educational] preparation of the Indonesians had been of a low level, as there was discrimination against students for being Timorese. The book describes this, how only good students had the right to move up, so to speak, and that didn't even mean going to university."
Even so, Duarte Trigueiros highlights the training of “a good number of people, engineers, law graduates, economists”. “It took a lot of work and that was the great support that Portugal was able to give”, he added.
Today, the former economist says that the Timorese look at the Portuguese with immense gratitude. "It's amazing, because when we go on a street with an Australian, they despise the Australian and don't talk to him, but with the Portuguese they shower him with all kinds of affection. This happens a lot in Timor-Leste", he concluded.</description><pubDate>2025-12-09 02:47:45</pubDate></item><item><title>Evolution | African genomes point to the origins of the human species</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/05/evolucao-genomas-africanos-apontam-origens-da-especie-humana/</link><description>Homo sapiens has existed for at least 300,000 years, but its exact origin remains unknown and a new study has ruled out the hypothesis that it evolved in East Africa and expanded south. The study, based on the analysis of ancient genomes of people who lived from the Stone Age – 10,200 years ago – to 150 years ago in southern Africa, argues that a group of individuals lived in partial isolation for several hundred thousand years.
By analyzing their genomes, researchers found genetic adaptations that likely shaped H. sapiens as a species. Details of the study – the most comprehensive to date on ancient African DNA – conducted by researchers from Uppsala University (Sweden) and the University of Johannesburg, were published on Wednesday in the magazine “Nature”, reported the agency Efe.
“We have long known that Southern Africa was inhabited (…). We can now demonstrate that Homo sapiens existed and evolved in Southern Africa over a long period and that this region played a significant role in human evolution, perhaps the most important of all”, highlighted Mattias Jakobsson, geneticist at Uppsala University and main author of the study.
The team analyzed the ancient genomes of 28 individuals from southern Africa and compared them with those of their contemporaries from other parts of the world. They discovered that the Stone Age inhabitants of southern Africa lived in isolation for a long period.
“This group appears to have remained genetically isolated for at least 200,000 years, and it was only around 1,400 years ago that clear traces of genetic flow within this group began to emerge, when DNA from individuals from East and West Africa began to appear in individuals from Southern Africa,” explained Jakobsson.
Although no new groups migrated to southern Africa until about 1,400 years ago, genetic data suggests that members of the southern population migrated north during certain climatic periods. In fact, genetic material — dating back to around 8,000 years ago — from this southern population has been found in individuals from present-day Malawi, making it possible that southern migrations also occurred earlier.
Techniques and variations
A large part of the human remains analyzed were found in the Matjes River Rock Shelter (South Africa), an archaeological site with remains dating back approximately 10,000 to 1,500 years. This site also revealed different tools from each historical period, made with different techniques.
However, the individuals are genetically practically identical throughout the entire period, that is, there is no evidence of immigration or population exchange, “exactly the opposite of what happened in Europe, where cultural changes tend to coincide with population migrations”, analyzed Jakobsson.
In the study, researchers identified 79 DNA variants unique to Homo sapiens, distinct from those found in Neanderthals, Denisovans, chimpanzees and gorillas. Seven of these variants, related to kidney function, were “clearly overrepresented”.
The authors believe that these variants are linked to the unique human ability to cool the body through sweat, which requires a good ability to regulate the body's water balance. They also found variants involved in the immune system and neuronal growth. More than 40 percent of these variants are associated with neurons and brain growth, suggesting a role in cognitive evolution.
Additionally, several genes have been linked to attention, a mental ability that may have evolved differently in Homo sapiens compared to Neanderthals and Denisovans.</description><pubDate>2025-12-05 01:56:30</pubDate></item><item><title>Fire in Hong Kong | Considered future of bamboo scaffolding</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/04/incendio-em-hong-kong-equacionado-futuro-dos-andaimes-de-bambu/</link><description>The fire in Tai Po sparked a debate around bamboo scaffolding, a tradition that was already at risk of extinction due to the lack of new specialized workers. Architect Nuno Soares believes that, before questioning the safety of bamboo, it is necessary to reinforce monitoring of the illegal use of flammable materials

Could an industry already at risk of extinction disappear more quickly than previously thought, due to the tragic fire in Hong Kong? The issue has been raised since, last week, a major fire in a residential complex under construction, in the Tai Po area, resulted in at least 159 deaths, according to the most recent report.
The skyscrapers had bamboo scaffolding and other flammable materials used in the construction process. On Friday, Hong Kong authorities concluded that the fire was worsened by flammable bamboo scaffolding and foam insulation panels. Furthermore, Hong Kong fire chief Andy Yeung corroborated what many testimonies interviewed by AFP stated. “We found that the alarm systems in the eight buildings were not working properly,” he said.
According to the Lusa agency, the report, still a preliminary expert, concluded that the materials used in works contributed to higher temperatures.
“Based on the initial information we have, we believe that the fire started in the protective screen (plastic material to protect against the spread of dust and falling objects) located on the outside of the lower floors (…), and quickly escalated due to the panels” that protected the windows, said the security chief of the neighboring special administrative region, Chris Tang.
To HM, the architect Nuno Soares, linked to the study of bamboo construction, and who has fought for its preservation, considers that before pointing blame at the material, it is necessary to reinforce the supervision of the shipyards.
"We know that bamboo is difficult to ignite. In other words, bamboo burns, but it is difficult to burn and, when it does, the combustion is slow, and it is easy to fight [a possible fire]. Now when there is a net around it, which is not fireproof, everything catches fire very quickly, right? There is already known data [on the incident], and we know that the scaffolding was, in fact, made of bamboo, but there was a plastic net around it which was not fireproof, in addition to the use of Styrofoam to cover the windows, which is a highly flammable material”, he highlighted.
Nuno Soares also referred to the occurrence, in Tai Po, of “problems with the fire detection and fighting system in the building itself, built in the 1980s, and which was already out of date”. “Several problems in inspection are also known, and with the data we have we are unable to conclude, in summary, that bamboo was the guiding principle in this situation, and we have to be rigorous in this type of analysis”, he added.
Therefore, Nuno Soares considers that caution is needed and not to enter into simplistic or hasty analyses. “We cannot, with the data we have at the moment, say that bamboo has no responsibility whatsoever.” "If there had been that nylon net around the metal scaffolding, a very similar situation would have happened, because the fire would have spread through that net and then through the Styrofoam on the windows. Fire safety regulations are already quite strict in Macau and Hong Kong, but where I think there is room for improvement is in inspection," he said.
A material question
The Global Times newspaper wrote on Monday about the difficulties in putting an end to the construction of bamboo scaffolding in a short period of time. In an article entitled “Tradition under fire”, we read that “some defenders argue that bamboo scaffolding, as a traditional construction technique, is low-cost, flexible to assemble and disassemble, and especially suitable for the tight spaces of old urban neighborhoods”, with “contrary voices that focus on security risks”.
Quoted by the same newspaper, Lee Kwong-sing, president of the Hong Kong Institute of Security Professionals, said that, given the available information, “the flammable materials on the external walls set fire to the safety nets, not the bamboo itself”. Demonstrating a similar position to Nuno Soares, the person in charge added that “even if metal scaffolding had been used, safety nets would have been necessary, and if flammable materials were not removed, the risk of fire would not change much”.
Zhao Shixing, chief engineer of the Sichuan Provincial Institute of Architectural Design and Research, told the Global Times that bamboo's weaknesses lie in its safety and stability, as raw and untreated bamboo has a B2 combustibility rating according to China's standards, and can easily ignite when exposed to other flammable materials. Zhao said, therefore, that “this vulnerability was completely exposed in this fire.”
According to the state newspaper, authorities in the neighboring city of Shenzhen had already banned the use of bamboo in 1994, and in January 2022 the country's Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development banned the use of “bamboo (or wooden) scaffolding” in construction and municipal engineering works across the country.
Difficult to erase tradition
In special administrative regions, the construction of bamboo scaffolding continues to be a reality, despite the alleged lack of younger personnel interested in learning the technique.
Nuno Soares highlights that the technique “is very deep-rooted”, having “existed for decades in Macau and Hong Kong”, surviving due to its versatility and being adaptable to local climate conditions. The architect also highlights among the decisive factors for the use of bamboo the “workmanship and type of high-rise constructions that are carried out in Macau and Hong Kong”.
In the hours following the accident, Macau authorities carried out a series of inspections of construction sites, in addition to organizing dozens of lectures to raise awareness of the risks of fires.
Such a stance was “wise and preventive”. "The bamboo scaffolding was not removed, but the flammable nets that were in several buildings in Macau were removed. What we need to do is more testing, that is, it is not enough to have the manufacturer's certificate saying that the material is fireproof. Inspection must be more rigorous."
“One of the reasons why I think bamboo scaffolding has been so successful throughout the recent history of Macau and Hong Kong is because it is safe, in the sense that it resists winds and typhoons well, and protects workers who wear protective elements”, highlighted the architect.
In general, Nuno Soares says that “it doesn’t make sense” to have a sudden, total ban on the use of bamboo in the construction of scaffolding. “Taking into account the data we have, this measure of preventing bamboo construction makes no sense.”
When the fire was still far from being extinguished, the police had already announced the arrest of three suspects for “gross negligence” after the discovery of flammable materials abandoned during work, which allowed the fire to “spread quickly” due to the strong wind. Investigations continue.
Quoted by CNN, Xinyan Huang, associate professor at the University of Hong Kong, declared that bamboo is “definitely a flammable material”. "This season is very dry in Hong Kong, so the possibility of the bamboo burning is very high. Once the combustion takes place, the fire spreads very quickly", he concluded.
In a joint note from the Fire Department, Directorate of Land and Urban Construction Services, Directorate of Labor Affairs Services and Institute for Municipal Affairs, on Friday, the Macao SAR Executive said it was “extremely attentive to the serious fire that recently occurred in the neighboring region”, but did not reveal whether or not it will ban the use of bamboo.
“After checking fire-fighting equipment, hazardous substance storage management and emergency evacuation routes, they all comply with applicable safety requirements.”
Furthermore, and mentioning more recent statistical data, it is stated that “there are currently around 566 construction sites in Macau, of which more than 60 involve works with scaffolding”, with the promise of carrying out “intensive inspections of all works with scaffolding, requiring contractors to strictly comply with their fire prevention responsibilities”.
However, the Executive admitted yesterday that it could replace bamboo scaffolding with metal ones, but only if there is “social consensus” between the population and construction companies, said Mak Tat Io, deputy director of Land and Urban Construction Services.</description><pubDate>2025-12-04 03:05:41</pubDate></item><item><title>Light Rail | Public consultation on route in 2026</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/15/metro-ligeiro-consulta-publica-sobre-percurso-em-2026/</link><description>The Government plans to move forward with a public consultation on Light Rail planning in the first half of 2026.

According to Radio Macau's Chinese language channel, the secretary indicated that the consultation will be carried out after the data on the different routes that are being analyzed in a strategic study that is underway has been completed. The plans under study include a Southern Line, which will connect the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge border post to Barra station, passing through Zone A of New Landfills, NAPE, Nam Van and Sai Van.
A West Line is also planned, from the port of Qingmao to Barra, and a North Line from Taipa, to connect Zone A of the New Landfills to the Oceano station via landfill zones E, D and C. The plans also include a connection from Seac Pai Van to the entrance to the urban area of ​​Coloane.</description><pubDate>2025-12-15 01:43:50</pubDate></item><item><title>Administration | Sónia Chan will head Identification Services</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/15/administracao-sonia-chan-vai-dirigir-servicos-de-identificacao/</link><description>The former secretary for Administration and Justice, Sónia Chan, will now head the Identification Services (DSI), TDM said yesterday.

The event is a Government initiative, organized by the Cultural Institute, with the support of the Chinese Academy of History and the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. The 2025 International Civilization Exchange Forum will take place tomorrow and Wednesday, with 40 government leaders and representatives of international organizations from a dozen countries.
Among the guests are experts and academics from Portugal, mainland China, Egypt, Indonesia, Tunisia, Italy, Germany, the United Kingdom and Canada, said the Cultural Institute (IC), in a statement.
After a meeting of the Cultural Heritage Council, Maria José de Freitas, an architect based in Macau, confirmed to Lusa that she will be one of the Portuguese experts to participate in the Forum. Freitas is also the president of the international scientific committee of the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) on shared built heritage.

Deland Leong Wai Man recalled that 20 years have passed since the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) classified the historic center of Macau as a World Heritage Site. “Macau’s cultural heritage has its own particularity, Chinese and Western characteristics, some monuments with a fusion of cultures”, highlighted the also president of the IC.
In addition to “unique construction elements”, the history of the city, which for more than 400 years was under Portuguese administration, is reflected in “customs, traditions, way of life and even intangible heritage”, defended Leong.
“All of this has rich cultural value to share with the world”, said the leader, who also highlighted what she said was Macau’s success in safeguarding its cultural heritage. “Macau can serve as an exchange platform for experts from various countries and serve as a link between different civilizations,” added Leong.</description><pubDate>2025-12-15 01:37:09</pubDate></item><item><title>Japan | Interference in the cancellation of events denied</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/15/japao-negada-interferencia-no-cancelamento-de-eventos/</link><description>The Government denied any interference in the cancellation of at least three concerts with Japanese artists scheduled for Macau and guaranteed that these were solely commercial decisions by the organizers
"I think that different parties have their own consideration factors", said, at a press conference, the president of the Cultural Heritage Council, Deland Leong Wai Man. "It is normal to have adjustments regarding concerts or different events. Situations of cancellation due to force majeure, is something common", added on Friday, also the leader of the Cultural Institute.
On Tuesday, the Venetian Macau hotel-casino announced the cancellation of a concert by Japanese pop singer Ayumi Hamasaki, on January 10th. This is after Hamasaki's concert in Shanghai on November 29th was cancelled. On Wednesday, a Christmas show, scheduled for December 25th, at another hotel-casino, Studio City, which included the female band Say My Name, which includes the Japanese Hitomi Honda, the group's leader, and Terada Mei, was also cancelled.
On the same day, a third show was cancelled, this time by the band Hi-Fi Un!corn, a group that includes Japanese artists, and which was scheduled for December 21st, at a third hotel-casino, Galaxy Macau.
Asked by Lusa whether there were instructions from the Government not to hold cultural events with artists from Japan, Leong Wai Man assured that “this is a matter for the commercial sector, it is the organizer's decision”. “I have nothing more to add”, stressed the leader.
Even so, Leong defended that the wave of cancellations “will not have a major impact” on the Executive's plan to position Macau as an international city of shows.
Several fronts
On November 15, Macau asked residents and tourists of the territory in Japan to raise their state of alert, after Beijing advised against traveling to the country following statements by the Japanese leader about Taiwan.
The warning from the Tourism Services Bureau came “given that since the middle of this year, the trend of attacks in Japan against Chinese citizens has been increasing”, without citing data or examples. However, the Hong Kong Government did so, citing just one incident in Tokyo, in which two Chinese citizens were attacked by locals in late July.
China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has issued a warning advising against travel to Japan due to the deteriorating security environment. The main airlines in Mainland China, Macau and Hong Kong announced full refunds for flights to Japan, following the Government's appeal. The measure was taken at a time when tensions between Beijing and Tokyo worsened again, following statements by Japanese Prime Minister, Sanae Takaichi.</description><pubDate>2025-12-15 01:29:03</pubDate></item><item><title>IC | International Civilizational Exchange Forum next week</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/12/ic-forum-internacional-de-intercambio-civilizacional-na-proxima-semana/</link><description>On the 16th and 17th of December, Macau will host the first International Civilization Exchange Forum. The two-day event is a Government initiative, organized by the Cultural Affairs Bureau (IC), with support from the Chinese Academy of History and the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
According to the IC, the objective of the event is “to promote humanistic and cultural exchange at an international level, narrate the historical paths of China and the MSAR, establishing Macau as a relevant high-level connection for the country in opening up to the outside world and an important window for exchange and mutual learning between Chinese and Western civilizations”.
Over two days, government representatives from various countries and regions, international organizations and national and foreign experts participate in around 20 thematic sessions dedicated to cultural inclusion, innovation and cooperation.
Holding the forum is part of Beijing's strategy for Macau to reinforce its role as a promoter of global exchange and “establish an academic platform with international projection, promoting mutual understanding and respect between civilizations and highlighting the value of cultural encounters as a driver of human development”.</description><pubDate>2025-12-12 01:41:34</pubDate></item><item><title>Nam Kwong | Politicians want to preserve Ke Zheng-ping's legacy</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/12/nam-kwong-politicos-querem-preservar-legado-de-ke-zheng-ping/</link><description>Kou Hoi In, former president of the hemicycle, argues that the spirit of patriotism of Ke Zheng-ping, linked to the Chinese Communist Party and founder of the Nam Kwong company in Macau, must be remembered and maintained. The idea was defended at the conference that marked the 20th anniversary of the death of this personality, who was the great-uncle of the current secretary for Social Affairs and Culture, O Lam.
According to the Chinese channel Radio Macau, more than one hundred personalities from the social, political and student sectors participated in the event. Kou Hoi In also highlighted that Ke Zheng-ping was a selfless figure, supportive of residents and a defender of the “one country, two systems” principle.
According to the new president of the TDM administrative board, Macau has promoted the integration of the territory at a regional level and it is important to train new generations with the fundamental values ​​of patriotism and love for Macau. Leonel Alves, lawyer and Macau member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, recalled that Ke Zheng-ping knew how to create a bridge of communication with the Macau community, which received attention and care from the Central Government.</description><pubDate>2025-12-12 01:38:52</pubDate></item><item><title>Culture | Two more concerts with Japanese artists canceled</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/12/cultura-mais-dois-concertos-com-artistas-japoneses-cancelados/</link><description>After the cancellation of the concert by Japanese diva Ayumi Hamasaki, a show at Studio City that was to include the girl band Say My Name, which features two Japanese women in the lineup, was also canceled due to “unforeseen circumstances”. The same reason was used to cancel Hi-Fi Un!corn no's concert, which also has Japanese members
"Due to unforeseen circumstances, we regret to announce that the 2025 iNKODE TO PLAY Christmas show scheduled for December 25th at the Studio City Event Center has been cancelled. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused by the cancellation and thank everyone for their support of this show."
It was in this way that the company promoting the concert justified that after all the South Korean Kim Jaejoong, the American of South Korean origin Nicole and the girl band Say My Name would not perform in Macau, as planned. It is important to note that the most familiar artist of the band, made up of young South Koreans and two Japanese women, is the Japanese Hitomi Honda, more famous than her compatriot and stage colleague Terada Mei.
The cancellation of the show by iNKODE Entertainment artists was announced a day after Japanese pop diva Ayumi Hamasaki's concert suffered the same fate in Macau and Shanghai. In fact, the vague justifications for not holding the Say My Name concert in Macau and Ayumi in Shanghai were the same: “unforeseen circumstances”. Another youth band from iNKODE Entertainment, with Japanese members, had a fan meeting scheduled for noon on December 6th in Shanghai. The meeting was canceled two hours before the start due to “unforeseen circumstances”
The cancellation of the iNKODE Entertainment artists' event in Macau was commented on social media as an example of the “Ayumi effect”.
Carbon paper
“Due to unforeseen circumstances, CQ (Macau) Entertainment regrets to announce that the Hi-Fi Un!corn ASIA Tour 2025 “Teenage Blue” show in Macau, originally scheduled for December 21st at Galaxy Macau's G Box, has been cancelled.” The cancellation of the concert by Hi-Fi Un!corn, who also have Japanese artists in the group, was announced on Wednesday, increasing the number of concerts in Macau that will not take place due to “unforeseen circumstances”.
The communications repeat the same formula of apologies for the inconvenience and instructions to request refunds.
It all started when the Venetian Macau announced on Tuesday afternoon that Japanese pop queen Ayumi Hamasaki's concert had been cancelled. Although no justification was given, the cancellation did not surprise fans, who were already anticipating taking a stance after the same thing happened in Shanghai on November 29th.</description><pubDate>2025-12-12 01:37:24</pubDate></item><item><title>General and surreal strike</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/15/greve-geral-e-surreal/</link><description>A couple who are members of a union belonging to CGTP-Intersindical found themselves in a dilemma on the 11th, the day of the general strike, before leaving home. The problem was wanting to go to the demonstration organized to protest against the absurd proposal of the Montenegro Government regarding a possible new Labor Law, a general strike that had not brought together the UGT and the CGTP for many years. The dilemma was precisely related to the general strike. The couple, residing in Amadora, did not have any transport to travel to the center of Lisbon. His best neighbor had also decided not to go to the demonstration because the Metropolitano was on full strike.
Thousands of workers were prevented from going to the demonstration due to lack of transport. Surrealism was in sight. The desire to protest, yes. Like, impossible. More surreal was the fact that the drivers of dozens of buses that the union centers rented to transport protesters had to work on a day of general strike, political Portugal is actually divided in half. On the one hand, conservatives and neo-fascists. On the other, the democratic and radical left.
A sad division for those who want a better country and a reduction in the number of Portuguese living on the edge of poverty. The union centrals announced that the general strike was resounding, the best ever and with an unusual turnout of around 80 percent. The strike paralyzed air, rail, road, sea and river transport, as well as schools, daycare centers, hospitals, health centers, homes for the elderly, day centers, courts, universities and museums.
The Montenegro Government came, with an air of contempt and arrogance for carrying out the general strike, to say that participation was low and that it would not have exceeded five percent. And his demagoguery prevailed when he “ordered” the television channels he controls to clearly show that at Autoeuropa there were a lot of workers not joining the general strike. The custom of numbers. For some, excellent. For others, a fiasco. The truth is that the general strike affected thousands of Portuguese people, in one way or another.
The most important thing wasn't even the general strike. What is at stake is the widespread protest, including by some former PSD and CDS leaders, against the absurd and harmful content of the government proposal for a new Labor Law. The concern that has grown the most in company surveys is the lack of workers, many areas of activity face serious difficulties with the lack of qualified personnel and limitations on the recruitment of foreign labor, putting the objectives of the PRR at risk.
In a context of labor shortages, real wages have grown in recent years above inflation, particularly in the construction sector, with appreciations above eight percent. Faced with this scenario, what did the Government decide in its ideological fury? Opening an incomprehensible social conflict around labor laws, which have already been profoundly revised several times this century.
Nothing has been noticed about the Government's negotiating openness regarding the main themes of its proposal. Obviously, after four months of the Government turning a blind eye, a general strike had to be organized. A setback in labor pacifism is that the Government intends to allow for the possibility of dismissal without due process or just cause in companies of up to 50 workers, with the exemption from reinstatement if the dismissal is considered illegal by the court, the possibility of hiring in outsourcing the day following the collective dismissal, with an individual time bank, with a fixed-term contract for life, with the possibility of professional reclassification with a salary reduction, with the obligation for the children's parents to work on the weekends or with the decriminalization of undeclared and paid work under the table.
These are some of the Government's “innovative” proposals, which at no time agreed to back down, but which in no way contribute to competitiveness, digital modernization and worker qualifications. After months of hypocrisy in dialogue and innocent lamentations about an “untimely” strike, Montenegro came to mix the threat about compliance with minimum services, and the terrible economic impact of the general strike. Simply nonsense with a wave of demagogy of promises about salaries that wouldn't even remind the unions of requests from Santa Claus...
Even Bagão Félix and Silva Peneda have already recognized the inopportunity and unbalanced nature of the reform of labor legislation. And these personalities are not trade unionists or socialists, much less attended protest demonstrations or participated in strikes.
The most surreal thing about all this is that the Government will hope that after having forgotten the general strike and after Christmas, it will be able to impose the crushing machine that will lead to Portuguese workers losing rights like they never dreamed of. All that remains is for the PSD/Chega alliance to announce that the democratic regime will also be the target of a labor reform…</description><pubDate>2025-12-15 02:10:26</pubDate></item><item><title>A tour of Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/12/um-passeio-por-macau/</link><description>Every year, following the presentation of the Lines of Government Action, the SAR Government holds debates in the Legislative Assembly on the various areas of governance, where those responsible answer questions from deputies. But to truly understand the current situation in Macau, first-hand experience and knowledge are undoubtedly essential.
It is said that an old electrical appliances store located on Rua das Estalagens will close because the owner is retiring. All branches of this store closed at the same time. They are offering 50 percent discounts, which attracts a lot of customers. Faced with strong competition from online sales websites and applications, even supermarkets are starting to adopt this system. Reducing staff is a way of maintaining the business, but what skills does an unemployed supermarket worker have that would allow him to get a job in other areas of the commercial sector?
Buying food in person is undoubtedly the best option, but the atmosphere at the Taipa municipal market on Sunday is very different from that on Rua do Cunha, which is packed with people. Some municipal market stall owners even chose to close temporarily. Tourists will certainly not buy products at the market and then go and cook. And the inhabitants of Macau, where did they go? A resident of Taipa told me that since the Macau authorities granted motor vehicle access from Macau to Hengqin Island, people have stopped going to the local market and started shopping in Hengqin, then refueling their cars and having dinner there, simply because everything is cheaper.
Given the strong competitiveness of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, going shopping and dining in Zhuhai or Hengqin has become an irreversible trend. In addition to reducing taxes or reducing property rental fees, what effective measures has the SAR Government taken to reduce other operating costs, break monopolies and open the market?
The busy atmosphere of Macau's tourist areas during the day makes quiet nights in Zone A of the New Urban Landfills seem somewhat lonely. Public housing projects are being completed one after another, but the various infrastructures around the housing complex are still under construction. To survive, humanity needs a roof, but also a quality of life. The recent improvement measures taken by the Land and Urban Construction Services Bureau can be considered a response to the needs of residents, but “closing” the gaps and improving traffic conditions in Macau is the responsibility of the competent authorities.
With the closure of the satellite casinos, the situation of surrounding businesses and the reintegration of affected employees has once again become a topic of debate in the Legislative Assembly. Due to the change in the type of tourists in recent years, nowadays we mostly have those who take selfies and photographs of tourist attractions. The increase in the number of tourists is not proportional to the increase in tax revenue. The question is this, besides the landmarks, the food and the casinos, what else is there in Macau that could entice tourists to spend their money?
The grass at the Taipa Jockey Club has grown, the development of the “Parque Oceanis” theme park is still in the planning phase, and construction projects on the land of the Macau Greyhound Racing Company (Yat Yuen) are expected to begin soon. But with a lot of unused land, how will Macau be able to manage its overall development, and furthermore, actively integrate itself into the national development framework? After the debates on the various areas of governance in the Legislative Assembly are concluded, it would be a good time for the main government officials to take a walk through the various areas of Macau without prior arrangements and without an entourage.</description><pubDate>2025-12-12 01:18:42</pubDate></item><item><title>Lessons from 2025 for the decade</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/11/licoes-de-2025-para-a-decada/</link><description>“In a year of converging crises and recalibrated ambitions, 2025 taught the world that resilience is not merely endurance, but the capacity to adapt, reimagine, and act with foresight across economic, political, environmental, and technological frontiers.”
Margaret Atwood
The year 2025 will go down in contemporary history as a period of intense transformation, marked by events that crossed multiple dimensions of international life and that required an unprecedented capacity for adaptation from States, institutions and societies. On the economic front, there was a global slowdown that reflected the accumulated effects of restrictive monetary policies, trade tensions and geopolitical instability. World growth was around modest values, insufficient to meet the needs for social inclusion and reduction of inequalities. The transition from the cycle of rising interest rates to gradual cuts brought some relief to financial conditions, but also revealed structural weaknesses, with emerging markets facing fiscal and exchange rate restrictions that limited their room for maneuver. Latin America experienced insufficient expansion to generate sustainable employment, while Africa continued to struggle to diversify its economies, which were excessively dependent on commodities. Asia maintained industrial and technological dynamism, but China faced the challenge of stimulating domestic consumption and correcting structural imbalances that had become more evident.
No plano político, o regresso de Donald Trump à presidência dos Estados Unidos em Janeiro constituiu um dos acontecimentos mais marcantes do ano. A sua agenda voltou a ser dominada pelo lema “America First”, com medidas proteccionistas, expulsões em massa de imigrantes irregulares e o desmantelamento de sectores do governo federal. Estas acções geraram contestação judicial e acentuaram a polarização política interna, com a utilização da Guarda Nacional em cidades governadas por democratas e ataques aos meios de comunicação a reforçarem a percepção de erosão institucional. No plano internacional, Trump intensificou a actividade diplomática, com resultados variáveis, mas conseguiu protagonizar um papel central na trégua precária alcançada em Gaza, após dois anos de guerra entre Israel e o Hamas. Este cessar-fogo permitiu a libertação de reféns e prisioneiros, bem como o aumento da ajuda humanitária, embora insuficiente segundo a ONU, e deixou em aberto a questão delicada do desarmamento do Hamas.
Instability in the Middle East was worsened by Israeli attacks on Iranian nuclear installations, which triggered a twelve-day war between the two countries, with American bombings in Iran. In September, Israel carried out unprecedented operations against senior Hamas leaders in Doha, Qatar, increasing regional tension. At the same time, the United States intensified military actions in the Caribbean and the Pacific, justified as combating drug trafficking, but criticized by the UN as extrajudicial executions. These operations, which resulted in dozens of deaths, highlighted the American willingness to project military power beyond the Middle East, reinforcing the perception of unilateralism and international contestation.
On a geopolitical level, Russia's invasion of Ukraine continued to have repercussions, with sanctions and energy tensions affecting Europe. The prolonged conflict maintained instability in the region and reinforced the need for energy diversification, accelerating the transition to renewable sources. In Sudan and other African regions, internal wars have worsened humanitarian crises, with millions displaced and state systems collapsing. International cooperation revealed weaknesses, with difficulties in revitalizing multilateral mechanisms and ensuring predictability in trade flows.
On an environmental level, the impacts of climate change have become increasingly evident. Heat waves devastated Asia, floods hit Brazil, Indonesia and parts of Europe, wildfires devastated Canada and hurricanes like Helene and Milton wreaked havoc in the United States. These phenomena exposed the urgency of the energy transition and reducing dependence on fossil fuels. The decarbonization of the economy was recognized not only as an environmental requirement, but as an economic opportunity, with investments in clean energy, sustainable mobility and energy efficiency generating jobs and positioning countries as leaders in the new green economy. The World Economic Forum identified armed conflicts, extreme weather events and geo-economic clashes as the main risks for 2025. The combination of these factors revealed the need for coordinated and strategic action. The regulation of emerging technologies has become a central topic, with debates on data protection, responsible innovation and systemic risks. The absence of clear global standards has increased asymmetries and digital insecurity, especially in areas such as cryptocurrencies, artificial intelligence and digital platforms.
Regional comparisons reveal significant disparities. In the United States, growth was around 2.1%, reflecting gradual cuts in interest rates and protectionist policies. Inflation fell to values ​​close to 3%, but domestic consumption remained fragile. In the European Union, average growth was 1.3%, with Germany investing around 40 billion euros in energy transition programs and France reinforcing its commitment to nuclear energy. Portugal recorded growth of 2.1%, supported by tourism, which recovered to record levels, with more than 30 million visitors and revenues exceeding 62 billion euros, representing around 21.5% of GDP, although it faced persistent inflation in food products. In Latin America, Brazil grew 2.4%, but faced severe floods that affected more than 3 million people and caused economic losses estimated at 15 billion dollars, despite inflation remaining at around 5%. Argentina recorded growth of 5.5%, with inflation close to 30%, well below levels above 100% in previous years, reflecting fiscal and monetary stabilization policies.
In Africa, average growth was 3.5%, but uneven, with Nigeria and Angola vulnerable to volatile oil prices and Sahel countries experiencing humanitarian crises worsened by desertification and armed conflicts. In Asia, China grew around 5%, below official targets, reflecting the need to stimulate domestic consumption. India recorded robust growth of between 7.5% and 8%, driven by investments in digitalization, renewable energy and tax reforms, remaining the fastest growing economy globally. Thus, the economic outlook for 2025 confirms strong regional disparities. The economies of the United States and European Union grew modestly, while India and China led global expansion. Argentina stood out for stabilizing after years of hyperinflation, and Brazil faced severe climate shocks. Africa maintained positive average growth, but marked by structural inequalities and humanitarian crises.
The social impacts were profound. In the United States, immigrant expulsion policies have affected hundreds of thousands of families. In Europe, the increase in energy costs sparked demonstrations in countries such as France and Italy. In Brazil, floods destroyed entire communities, forcing the relocation of more than 500,000 people. In Africa, water scarcity has intensified internal migration. The domestic consumption crisis in Macau reflected the decline in purchasing power of Chinese tourists and the retraction in local demand, directly affecting sectors such as restaurants and commerce.
Environmental policies gained prominence. The European Union reinforced the European Green Deal, investing more than 100 billion euros in renewable energy and sustainable mobility. Canada launched reforestation programs that covered 1 million hectares. Brazil sought to implement flood management policies with investments of 10 billion dollars. China has invested in energy storage technologies, with projects valued at US$50 billion. India has expanded solar programs in rural areas, providing electricity to millions of people.
In the technological field, artificial intelligence and digitalization have transformed economies and societies. Between 2026 and 2030, more than 50% of administrative tasks could be automated, creating new employment challenges and requiring retraining policies. The use of cryptocurrencies and digital financial technologies could reach more than 500 million active users. Global regulation of artificial intelligence and digital platforms will be essential to prevent market abuse and systemic risks. Countries like Japan and South Korea will move forward with strict legislation, while Europe will seek to lead the way in creating global standards.
In the education sector, digitalization and inclusion will be priorities. By 2030, more than 70% of schools in developed countries will be able to use digital platforms for hybrid teaching. Artificial intelligence will be used to personalize learning, adapting content to students' individual needs. However, inequalities will persist in Africa and parts of Latin America. Technical education and continuing training will be essential to prepare workers for new market demands.

At the time of writing this article, there were 159 fatalities and 79 injuries, with 31 people still missing. Before we continue, let us once again mourn these deaths and hope that the injured make a speedy recovery.
Hong Kong Government data indicates that 79 people were injured in the fire. However, in reality, there may be another type of injured person who is not hospitalized, but who is among us. They deserve our concern and care in the same way.
Recently, a story circulated online about a woman who had overheard the conversation of one of the firefighters who fought the fire at Hung Fuk Court. The firefighter was very young and spoke informally, but his description of the fire was terrifying. He said they had to run from the ground floor to the 22nd floor in 10 minutes, transporting injured people across six floors which required excellent physical fitness. Meanwhile, he saw burning corpses and people who had lost legs and arms. Recalling the rescue efforts, he told how he used a crowbar to open doors, to save people who were trapped. However, it was impossible to open some doors with a crowbar. In a race against time and the fury of the fire, he had to give up trying to open those doors and move on to the next ones, fighting to save the survivors. He didn't have time to think about whether there were survivors behind the doors that couldn't be opened. He had even less time to think about the consequences that these survivors would suffer. All these situations caused this young firefighter an enormous feeling of pity and guilt.
A mental health professional highlighted that rescue teams often face enormous pressure. If they blame themselves for not being able to help survivors, they may develop Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). They may experience intense fears, helplessness and terror. Those who work in rescue teams may have very distressing recurring memories or dreams, or experience intense psychological or physical suffering triggered by similar situations. Although the anguish they experienced while rescuing the injured is not immediately apparent, it will gradually come to light after the operations are completed. Without proper intervention, they will become another type of victim of the Hung Fook Court fire.
The Hong Kong Government provides strong psychological support to rescue teams to alleviate the pressure they are under. However, to further reduce this psychological pressure, it is necessary to improve their mental resilience and raise public awareness of the difficulties of rescue operations.
To strengthen the mental fortitude of rescue teams, it is first necessary for them to understand that their work confronts them with disasters and death. These misfortunes and the pressure to which they are subject are not the result of their personal choices and do not happen because they did something wrong. Their lives do not necessarily mean they have to face misfortune and death. Therefore, after work they cannot take them home. Only in this way can they avoid becoming overwhelmed by the pressure. They also have to understand that only by freeing themselves from the traumas they have experienced can they safeguard and share a normal family life with their loved ones. Taking home the misfortunes and pressure will not only affect them but will also unduly affect their families, ultimately generating more tragedy and turning rescuers into victims.
Secondly, there are countless jobs, but none are more meaningful than those that save lives. Rescuing victims of disasters from danger, allowing them to remain alive and unharmed, does not simply imply saving them from death; It also involves ensuring that they return home to their loved ones, thus saving the entire family. First responders earn the love and respect of victims, their families and the entire community — a recognition that transcends monetary values.
A perfect example, as seen in the news, is that of a middle-aged woman, in her fifties, who, after receiving a phone call from her husband informing her of the fire, immediately left the building. However, without hesitation, he went back and knocked on his neighbor's door to warn him that he needed to escape. The neighbor listened to him, fled and survived, while the woman ended up dying in the flames. The last message he sent to his son was, “Dinner will be ready a little later today.” Who would have thought that this would be the last message he sent to his son? In an interview, the husband said he understood and accepted his wife's actions because he knew she had acted correctly.
Why did this woman act correctly? Why is altruism a good thing? The answer is very simple. As long as a person harbors love and integrity in their heart and does their best to help others, they will feel comfort and humanity. If those who were helped reciprocate in kind, then society will be filled with love and there will no longer be conflicts. A peaceful and caring society can be established where people support each other. The love manifested by the fireman and the middle-aged woman is precisely the love that derives from altruism. Let’s express this feeling with a classic line from a Hong Kong film from the 90s “He doesn’t weigh me down, he’s my father” (新難兄難弟) “Everyone for me and I for everyone.” Only when rescuers understand this principle can they understand the deeper meaning of their rescue work and reduce the pressure they carry.
To reduce pressure on these workers, public recognition and respect are crucial. The public must understand the difficulties and hardships of rescue work and cooperate actively. A simple tribute and sincere respect are worth more than emotional support.
Hopefully this article will help reduce the psychological pressure on everyone involved in the rescue operations at Hung Fuk Court in Tai Po. The public's love, respect and recognition for rescuers is the greatest reward for the immense pressure they suffered and the sacrifices they had to make, which will thus alleviate their psychological trauma.

In this exhibition, we observe his particular look behind the lens on a territory undergoing great change, taking as a starting point the book by journalist José Pedro Castanheira, “Macau – The Last Hundred Days of the Empire”
December is always a month of memory. It was in that month that Macau changed course and came under Chinese administration from December 20, 1999, becoming the Macau Special Administrative Region (SAR). As a reminder of this historic moment, but not only that, the exhibition “Macau’s Reflections – Now and Then” will be on display until the end of the month, at Livraria Portuguesa. The initiative, organized and curated by 10 Marias – Associação Cultural, showcases the work of photographer Pedro Ramos.
According to a note, this is a project that “offers a deep and sensitive look at Macau at a decisive period in its history: from the transition from the end of Portuguese administration to integration into China, from 1999, to the present day”.
The exhibition is a “reflection and a very personal look at Macau”, capturing “the essence of a city in flux, visually preserving its unique hybrid character”.
Here, photographs “function as a portal to the past, documenting the historic architecture, vibrant markets, daily street life and cultural traditions that defined Macau in the twilight of its former status”. However, this exhibition is also “a portal to a ‘colorful’ future”, being, for the 10 Marias, an “aesthetically captivating work” and which serves “as a historical and cultural record of inestimable value, highlighting the delicate balance between tradition and modernity”.
The exhibition is born from the book
Born in 1976, Pedro Ramos lived in Macau, where he completed primary and secondary education. After graduating in photography in Portugal, Pedro Ramos was looking for work in the field, until he came across the opportunity to collaborate on the book “Macau – The Last Hundred Days of the Empire”, written by journalist José Pedro Castanheira, who was in the territory to write a report on the passage of testimony from Portugal to China.
"Some were published in the book, others were not. I kept this photographic archive of the last days of the Portuguese presence in Macau. Since the beginning of 2000, I only returned to Macau in 2024, I went on vacation, and as I always carry the camera I decided to cover what I like about Macau, but in more modern times", he confessed to HM.
A contact with Mónica Coteriano, founder of 10 Marias, was enough to bring this project out, reflected “in the desire to show a little of the before and after” of the territory. Even so, Pedro Ramos explains that this is not “a comparative exhibition of the before and after of a certain area, or building, it is not a comparative work in which people see a photograph of the before and after”.
"The exhibition is organized with a large set of images from the time of the transition, in 1999. On the opening day I felt that these were the photographs that most touched most of the people who were present, because they were able to see a Macau that no longer exists in the same way. There is then a part with photographs taken on my return", he highlighted.
Pedro Ramos says he always returns to the places where he was happy, and here there are “many visual parallels”, particularly with more iconic places such as Hotel Lisboa and Ruínas de São Paulo.
Reviewing images, looking again at some moments and organizing this exhibition constituted “one of the great challenges”. “I had all the work from 1999 printed, and it was difficult to look at some of the images and, on the one hand, there was a very sentimental act, but it was good to be able to travel back in time a little.”
Pedro Ramos highlights a “very strong and striking” photograph, from when the old Macau High School had been transformed into a military base. "Even today, when I look at the image, I feel strange. I'm not saying it was difficult, but it was strange, and it's an image that tells me a lot."
Link with Macau
Despite having lived part of his childhood and adolescence in Macau, Pedro Ramos has maintained an emotional bond with the territory since those years. "I always feel like I'm back home and I can say that I feel Macau, because I grew up in Macau and lived there for an important period. When people ask me how I see the changes, I say that for those who have known Macau for 30 or 40 years like me, the center of Macau hasn't changed that much. The red market, the Ruins of São Paulo, the Lou Lim Ieoc garden, are places that continue to be very familiar and remain similar. I think that, in that sense, Macau continues to be very just like the city I knew, although it’s bigger and more modern.”
Pedro Ramos also said that the exhibition could last a little longer in Macau, with plans to extend it to Portugal. "I'm trying to present this work in Portugal, but I haven't started the necessary contacts yet. I was encouraged to do this because the Macanese community living in Portugal is large and many people, who heard about the exhibition, felt sorry for not being able to see it." Also noteworthy is the fact that the images are available for sale.</description><pubDate>2025-12-15 01:57:59</pubDate></item><item><title>IN SITU | Six installations to think about the use of public spaces</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/12/in-situ-seis-instalacoes-para-pensar-o-uso-de-espacos-publicos/</link><description>It’s called “IN SITU Placemaking Biennale” and, until Sunday, it brings different perspectives on the use of public spaces in Macau, in places such as Pátio da Claridade or Praça Ponte e Horta. The CURB – Center for Architecture and Urbanism initiative presents, starting today, workshops and six installations: “Letters to Macau”, “UnPlan”, “Multi-Place”, “Resonatorium”, “Furniture Where Life Begins” and “Where Time Crystalizes”
In a small territory like Macau, where tourists and the local population wander between history and the daily glare, it is not always possible to imagine other uses of the public space common to all. But this is precisely what CURB – Center for Architecture and Urbanism – proposes, with a new biennial. The “IN SITU Placemaking Biennale” takes place between today and Sunday, featuring six installations developed by local architects or artists, as well as workshops aimed at connecting the public with these projects.
The program is varied, but the six installations focus on the oldest area of ​​the Macau peninsula. After a period of submitting projects, not only from Macau, but also from abroad, the IN SITU curator decided on “Letters to Macau”, presented at Travessa do Aterro; “UnPlan”, in Largo de Santo Agostinho; “Multi-Place”, which can be seen in Largo do Lilau; “Resonatorium”, near Ponte e Horta square; “Furniture Where Life Begins”, in Largo do Aquino; and “Where Time Crystalizes”, in the old Pátio da Claridade.
What this biennial proposes is to explore the concept of “placemaking”, that is, the debate around the various options for planning and managing public spaces. According to a note from CURB, this is a “pioneer project” that is not “just a festival”, but rather “a conversation that involves the entire city”.
“Placemaking” is nothing more than a theory around the ideas of improving the management of public space with a multifaceted approach, in which the idea is that everyone sits down and discusses what is best for a given place or what could be done in the face of a less good reality.
During this weekend, IN SITU aims for “Macau's iconic streets and squares to become a living canvas for design, dialogue and collective imagination”, with the six installations that “will connect and activate iconic public spaces”, transforming them into “spaces to gather, reflect and interact”.
Local projects and beyond
The biennale was officially inaugurated yesterday, but it only opens its doors today with various activities. The sessions start at 10:30 am with “Where Time Crystalizes”, in Pátio da Claridade, followed, from 11 am, by a “placemaking” activity, in the same place, entitled “Time Crystal Lab”.
In the case of this installation, it was developed by a local team, coming from the master's program in Communication Design at the Faculty of Humanities and Arts of the Macau University of Science and Technology. This is a group composed of Lei Mei Ian, Wang Shumeng, Jiang Xintong and Xu Huiyao.
“Where Time Crystalizes” is an installation “composed of nine mirrored crystalline shapes and an undulating carpet that evokes a river of time”, with each crystal containing photographs, video fragments and everyday objects, collected in Jason Lei’s documentation about the neighborhood, even before the residents left.
Furthermore, in this installation, the exterior parts “reflect the current street and passersby, while the enclosed interiors invite viewers to peek at traces of the past”. The aim of this work is to lead “viewers to feel the flow of space and the sedimentation of memory”, promoting “reflection on the transformation of Pátio da Claridade, from an inhabited community to an empty space, reconsidering the relationship between people, place and time”.
This afternoon, from 3:30 pm, “Multi-Place” will be performed at Largo do Lilau, written by Yik Sze Wong, from Hong Kong. This installation presents itself as “a spatial experience in response to urban change”.
"How can we question and renew established models of public spaces? And how can we encourage the public to participate more actively in the construction and practice of these spaces? For a long time, the planning and distribution of public spaces were predominantly led by designers. However, cities are dynamic and constantly evolving organisms", describes the biennial organization.
With “Multi-Place” it is proposed to “explore how public spaces can respond effectively to dynamic changes in urban activities and the needs of their use”, and the installation aims to serve “as an experimental ground to explore new forms of public spaces, seeking to use flexible spatial models to stimulate community interaction”.
Explore the historic center
Tomorrow, the day of the biennial also begins at 10:30 am, but this time with the presentation of “Resonatorium”, in Porto Interior, an installation by Lau Josephn On King and Lawrence Liu.
Being a local team, but with connections to Hong Kong, in “Resonatorium” the duo decided to be inspired by “the echoes and reverberations inside the churches, as well as the historical image of the wooden chapel that once stood on the site of the Church of São Lourenço”.
It is, therefore, a work that “builds a resonance belonging exclusively to the past and present of the site”, being composed of wooden sound modules, “forming a semi-open architectural space, in which the structure itself becomes a resonant body”. The sounds and structure carry symbolism linked to the Church of São Lourenço, the Porto Interior pier, the Largo de Santo Agostinho neighborhood, Avenida de Almeida Ribeiro, without forgetting “the future of Macau”.
Saturday afternoon is reserved for an installation from Portugal, “UnPlan”, by the FAHR 021.3 studio, created by Filipa Frois Almeida and Hugo Reis. From 3:30 pm onwards, this temporary installation “designed to offer a new perspective on public space” can be visited, being inserted “in a dense urban fabric, marked by circulation, surveillance and routine”.
In this way, it is a “piece that introduces a moment of pause, like an object that is simultaneously familiar and strangely out of place”, in which “instead of prescribing behavior, it proposes an open surface that invites new ways of planning, occupying and imagining”.
Sunday is the day to explore “Letters to Macau”, an international project by Chaal Chaal Agency (CCA), a design and research collective founded by architects and researchers Kruti Shah, from India, and Sebastián Trujillo-Torres, from Spain.
Here we intend to reinterpret “the city’s traditional mailbox as an urban device for reflection, correspondence and civic imagination”. Describing the organization of the biennial, “Letters to Macau” is inspired “by Macau’s stratified spatial vocabulary, with lunar doors, courtyards, alleys and garden passages, to create a structure that is simultaneously familiar and reinvented”.
In this way, “visitors are invited to write letters addressed to the city, sharing memories, wishes or proposals for renewal”, and “each letter is deposited in the structure, accumulating throughout the Biennale and gradually transforming the installation into a collective civic archive”.
This installation was built from ten CNC-cut plywood panels, with the structure manufactured using simple and reversible methods, such as fitting, clamping and stacking, which allow for quick assembly, disassembly and reuse. “Its interconnected plans generate different degrees of openness and closure, framing longitudinal and transversal views in response to the narrow verticality of the urban fabric of Porto Interior”, it is further described.
In addition to the six central installations, this biennial features several complementary events. This afternoon, between 4pm and 5pm, the “Pressed Echoes of the Inner Harbor – Urban Flora Workshop” will take place at Ponte 9, and between 6pm and 7pm, the “AAFK x Resonatorium Sound &amp; Paint” will take place at Ponte e Horta square. Tomorrow, between 4pm and 5pm, it is time for the “Three Lamps of Inclusion: Culture Experience and Dialogue Workshop”, at Largo de Santo Agostinho, followed by the event “The City Breathes”, at Largo do Lilau. At night, between 8:30 pm and 9:20 pm, it is time for music and meditation with a performance by NÁV, in Largo de Santo Agostinho.
On Sunday, a “placemaking” activity takes place between 11am and 12pm at Largo do Aquino, entitled “Love Me? Destroy Me!”, followed by a collective reading around the installation “Letters to Macau” between 4pm and 5pm, at Travessa do Aterro Novo. The biennial ends with the activity, between 6pm and 6:30pm, entitled “Furniture Adoption”, at Largo do Aquino. The program also includes several guided tours.</description><pubDate>2025-12-12 01:28:02</pubDate></item><item><title>Universities of Macau and Timor-Leste agree to exchange students and teachers</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/15/universidades-de-macau-e-timor-leste-acordam-intercambio-de-alunos-e-professores/</link><description>The Macau Polytechnic University (UPM) announced on Friday an agreement with the National University of Timor-Leste (UNTL) for the exchange of students and teachers.
In a statement, UPM indicated that the cooperation protocol also provides for the strengthening of ties in the area of ​​sharing academic resources and the training of qualified staff bilingual in Chinese and Portuguese. Both jurisdictions have Portuguese as one of their official languages, along with Chinese, in the case of the semi-autonomous region of Macau, and with Tetum, in the case of East Timor.
The agreement was signed by the vice-rector of UPM, Vivian Lei Ngan Lin, and the rector of UNTL, João Soares Martins, on the sidelines of the 15th conference of the Forum for Higher Education Management in Portuguese-Speaking Countries and Regions (Forges). The annual meeting of Portuguese-speaking universities and polytechnics took place in the capital of Timor-Leste, Díli, in a joint organization of UNTL, the Timorese Catholic University São João Paulo II and the University of Díli.
The Forges conference, which had as its theme “The Promotion of Scientific Research in the Portuguese Language in the Face of Global Challenges”, took place between the 24th and 27th of November. During the event, the deputy director of the Faculty of Languages ​​and Translation at UPM, the Portuguese Joaquim Carvalho, gave a presentation in which he invited students and teachers from Portuguese-speaking countries to invest in exchanges with Macau.
International Network
The UPM delegation also took advantage of the opportunity to discuss academic exchange and cooperation projects with the Portuguese Catholic University, the Pontifical Catholic University of Campinas (Brazil) and the University of Luanda. In November 2024, during the 14th Forges conference, in Macau, João Soares Martins told Lusa that UNTL wanted the support of the Instituto Português do Oriente (IPOR) to start certifying proficiency in the Portuguese language.
Also in the Chinese region, UNTL and the University of Macau (UM) signed a cooperation agreement on Monday that provides “more opportunities for the mobility of teachers and students”, highlighted the rector. The Timorese delegation visited the Department of Portuguese at UM, the State Reference Laboratory for Quality Research in Chinese Medicine and the Faculty of Law, where some of the current UNTL teachers were trained.
“It would be good for the University of Macau to be able to provide some vacancies for our teachers to continue their courses, both in master's and doctorate degrees”, highlighted Soares Martins.</description><pubDate>2025-12-15 01:56:29</pubDate></item><item><title>ONE | Construction of the new campus has started</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/15/um-arrancou-construcao-do-novo-campus/</link><description>The construction start ceremony was attended by Sam Hou Fai. The new campus will include UM's first medical school
Construction of the new campus of the University of Macau (UM), which will include the first public medical faculty, in collaboration with the University of Lisbon (ULisboa) began on Friday. In a statement, UM indicated that the laying of the first stone ceremony, presided over by Government leader, Sam Hou Fai, took place in the Guangdong-Macao Deep Cooperation Zone, in neighboring Hengqin (Mountain Island).
The new campus will occupy an area of ​​almost 376,000 square meters in the special economic zone and construction is expected to take around three years, with a partial inauguration scheduled for 2028 and completion of works in 2029. Four new faculties will be created in the new UM campus on Ilha da Montanha, including those of Information Sciences, Design and Engineering, as well as the first public medical faculty in Macau.
The University of Science and Technology of Macau, a private institution, has had a Faculty of Health Sciences since 2008, officially renamed the Faculty of Medicine in 2019. In June, the director of the Faculty of Medicine at Ulisboa told Lusa that doctors trained at the future Faculty of Medicine at UM will also be able to practice in Portugal.
ULisboa is collaborating with UM to create a curriculum with a layout “close to the structure” of courses at the Portuguese institution, said Luís Graça. The director explained that the courses will work in co-supervision, allowing doctors trained at UM to obtain “equivalence and recognition” by the ULisboa Faculty of Medicine.
Doctors for Portugal
Among the advantages will be “thus allowing doctors trained in the territory to also practice medicine in Portugal”, highlighted the researcher. In December, the vice-rector of UM, Rui Martins, said that the new campus will focus on "'dual degrees' [courses in co-tutelship] with foreign universities. Medicine is already with Lisbon and now we are defining it for the other faculties".
The new campus on Ilha da Montanha should allow UM to increase from the current 15 thousand to a maximum of 25 thousand students, highlighted the vice-rector for Global Affairs, in an interview with the Portuguese-language channel of the local public television TDM. Luís Graça, a specialist in transplant immunology, also expressed enthusiasm about potential collaborations between the two universities in the area of ​​scientific research.
“If we think in terms of science, strengthening the scientific potential of both institutions with close collaboration between them is something that will clearly benefit both sides of this partnership”, stated the director. Luís Graça said that the ULisboa Faculty of Medicine is organizing the first symposium to bring together researchers from the institution and UM, with a view to promoting joint research projects.</description><pubDate>2025-12-15 01:53:33</pubDate></item><item><title>Takeaway | No labor regulation plans</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/15/take-away-sem-planos-de-regulamentacao-laboral/</link><description>Chan Un Tong, director of the Department of Labor Affairs (DSAL), said there are no plans on the table to regulate the courier profession, which is intended to deliver take-away meals.

If there is a signed contract, the current labor law applies, but if there is only a service provision contract, the conditions agreed between the parties apply. The deputy stated, in the interpellation, that the take-away delivery sector already represents 48.3 percent of catering establishments, therefore suggesting improvements at a labor level.</description><pubDate>2025-12-15 01:51:59</pubDate></item><item><title>Prostitution | Considered rule relief</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/15/prostituicao-ponderado-alivio-de-regras/</link><description>The Government will ask residents for their opinion on a possible reduction in restrictions on saunas and massages, the only places in the region where prostitution is tolerated. At a press conference held on Thursday, Executive Council spokesperson Wong Sio Chak announced that the public consultation will be launched in the first half of 2026.
The Executive intends to review the administrative licensing regime for specific economic activities, which was approved in 1998. Wong Sio Chak, also secretary for Administration and Justice, gave the example of auctions, barbershops and beauty salons and said that “some of the sectors will no longer need licenses and registration”.
The change could have “great significance for the optimization of the business environment and the economic development of Macau”, namely by “giving more convenience to companies”, defended the director. However, Wong admitted that, since the review “represents a major political change”, the leader of the Government, Sam Hou Fai, “decided to listen to more opinions from the public” so as to “not harm the lives of citizens”.</description><pubDate>2025-12-15 01:51:01</pubDate></item><item><title>Justice | Jerónimo Santos at TSI and Ho Wai Neng confirmed at TUI</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/15/justica-jeronimo-santos-no-tsi-e-ho-wai-neng-confirmado-no-tui/</link><description>Despite the departure of Portuguese people from Macau's courts in recent years, the only Portuguese judge remaining in the territory was promoted to the Court of Second Instance
The only Portuguese judge working in Macau, Jerónimo Alberto Gonçalves Santos, was appointed to the Court of Second Instance (TSI), while Ho Wai Neng was confirmed as judge of the Court of Final Instance (TUI). The decisions were communicated on Friday and the appointment order was published yesterday in the Official Bulletin.
The promotion of Jerónimo Santos comes at a time when the continuity of Portuguese magistrates in Macau is being called into question by the Portuguese authorities. In October of this year, fellow Portuguese judge Rui Ribeiro brought forward the end of a service commission, which lasted until May of next year, due to the uncertainty regarding the renewal of the special license, to be in Macau, from the Superior Council of Judiciary (CSM).
Also in October, the president of the Supreme Court of Justice (STJ), João Cura Mariano, who inherently also presides over the CSM, stated that the Portuguese justice system is having “some difficulty in contributing judges”, due to the lack of qualified and experienced human resources. “Just now we removed a judge who had been here for many years and we needed him”, highlighted João Cura Mariano, in October.
In 2024, the CSM rejected the stay of Portuguese TJB judge Carlos Carvalho, who had been in Macau for 16 years and had been invited by the Independent Commission for the Nomination of Judges in the territory to continue for another two years. The council did not authorize the renewal of Carlos Carvalho's special license and promoted him to judge, with placement at the Court of Appeal.
Despite the nuances, João Cura Mariano assured that he was willing to help Macau, “despite the difficulties that currently exist in Portugal in recruiting judges”.
Ascent confirmation
The moves announced on Friday confirm Ho Wai Neng's elevation to the Court of Final Appeal, where he had been serving since Sam Hou Fai announced his candidacy for Chief Executive in April last year. Furthermore, Choi Mou Pan was appointed for a period of three years as president of the TSI, a position previously held by Ho Wai Neng.
Among the promotions to the TSI, the name of Lou Ieng Ha also stands out, the judge responsible in the first instance for some of the most publicized cases in recent years, such as the Public Works case, which resulted in the convictions of former directors Jaime Carion and Li Canfeng, and also the Suncity case, which led to the businessman of Macau's largest gambling promoter, Alvin Chao, in prison.
In terms of appointments, Io Weng San and Rong Qi were promoted to presiding judges of the Collective Court of First Instance Courts.
All appointments take effect next year, and nominations came from the Independent Commission for the Appointment of Judges. The committee is made up of Lau Cheok Va, president, Ho Teng Iat, Ieong Tou Hong, Chan Hong, Wang Yu, Song Man Lei and António José Dias Azedo.

The increase in public spending was balanced with casino revenues
Public expenditure increased by 2.7 percent in the first 11 months of 2025, compared to the same period last year, following a budget review to reinforce social support, it was announced on Friday. According to data published online by the Financial Services Directorate (DSF), the Macao SAR spent 86.1 billion patacas by the end of November.
The main reason for the increase was spending on social support and subsidies, which grew 4.1 percent compared to the first 11 months of 2024, to 49.7 billion patacas. At the beginning of July, the Legislative Assembly approved a Government proposal to increase the expenses foreseen in the budget by 2.86 billion patacas, to reinforce social support. The review includes the creation of a subsidy, worth a total of MOP54,000, for children up to three years old, in an attempt to increase the lowest birth rate in the world.
On the contrary, spending on public works, the Administration's Investment and Expense Plan, fell 2.7 percent until November, to 14.7 billion patacas.
Tax revenue
The increase in expenditure was balanced by Macau's current revenue, which rose 2.8 percent in the first 11 months of the year, to 104.6 billion patacas. The main reason for the increase was a 7 percent increase, to 86.7 billion patacas, in revenue from gambling taxes – which represent 81.3 percent of the total.
The city's six gaming operators pay a direct tax of 35 percent on gaming revenue, with 2.4 percent going to the Macau Social Security Fund and urban and tourism development, and 1.6 percent given to the Macau Foundation for cultural, educational, scientific, academic and philanthropic purposes.
Total revenue from Macau's casinos reached 226.5 billion patacas in the first 11 months of the year, 8.6 percent more than in the same period in 2024. The territory ended November with a surplus in public accounts of 20.6 billion patacas, 11.4 percent more than in the same period last year. Macau ended 2024 with a surplus of 15.8 billion patacas, more than double that recorded in the previous year.
The Government's initial forecast for the entire year 2025 pointed to a surplus of 6.83 billion patacas. But the revised budget, approved by the Legislative Assembly at the beginning of July, predicted a surplus of just 191.1 million patacas.</description><pubDate>2025-12-15 01:41:46</pubDate></item><item><title>Zone A | Ramp and pedestrian crossing will cost at least 54 million</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/12/zona-a-rampa-e-passagem-para-peoes-vai-custar-pelo-menos-54-milhoes/</link><description>An access ramp for road traffic to Zone A of the New Landfills and a pedestrian crossing will cost the public coffers between “more than 54 million patacas and more than 63 million patacas”, said the Public Works Services Department (DSOP) yesterday.
The values ​​represent the cheapest and most expensive proposals presented by companies applying for the public tender for the “Construction Contract for the Extension of the A1 Access Road Ramp and a Pedestrian Crossing for Pedestrians”. The 17 proposals, all admitted, were announced yesterday. The work will have a construction period of 285 working days.
The work seeks to improve connections between Zone A and the peninsula, through the “access ramp, in one direction, on the current A1 access road, to facilitate direct access for vehicles to Avenida da Ponte Macau, on the east side of Zone A, via Avenida da Ponte da Amizade and Avenida do Nordeste, and divert vehicles wishing to access the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge Border Post and those heading to Taipa via the Bridge Macao”. In addition, “an uneven pedestrian walkway will be built on the coast of the northern end of Zone A of the New Urban Landfills, which will connect the two east and west sides of Zone A”.</description><pubDate>2025-12-12 01:34:01</pubDate></item><item><title>ZELENSKY VS ZELENSKY</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/31/zelensky-vs-zelensky/</link><description>10/27/22
A Ukrainian pensioner, with the same name as the president, blames Zelensky for the prolongation of the conflict that destroyed his village. Zelensky, the villager, who never left his land, is now mortified because his favorite gravedigger died in the bomber.
This Zelensky, a villager, represents half the world that recriminates the other Zelensky, the villain, for not wanting to negotiate with Putin.
Negotiate what? The invader enters our house, covers his wife and daughter (cf. recent UN report on the rapes in Ukraine, in this “special operation”), an act that forced us to watch, and then we say to him: hi there, we are for peace, but we have to negotiate: you still haven't said what name you want to give the children!
A peace that is not dignified is nothing more than a cessation of rights. As serious as the Russophobia that Putin inflicts on his people.

At a lunch with several guests, I heard a friend, who declared herself a spiritualist, explaining the particularities of her belief, in a calm and balanced way, I would even say, without a hint of “irrationalism”. He spoke long and serenely, devoid of any fanatical proselytism. “Here is someone whose belief has brought thoughtfulness!” I thought, a rare alliance.
However, at a certain moment a sentence comes out that horrifies me. It says, “there is no chance, nothing happens by chance!”, and I glimpse the voracious maws of holism. Because holism has a pathological aspect, like all good things, a shadow side.
Two examples: in Hinduism there is less sensitivity to existential dramas, if that child suffers in this life this is just an expression of rigorous karmic symmetry, an effect of the acts he committed in his previous life. In Africa, it is not accepted that death could have been accidental, and many women are accused by the family of the deceased of having caused the death of their husband, in an act of manifest dementia, and, in the blatant majority of cases, a huge injustice for the wife — madness that spreads and infiltrates the social fabric.
Buddhism introduced Compassion and Christianity introduced Caritas, trying to break with this logic, but in many other beliefs and religions the cage of causalities prevails over sensitivity to experience, the need to respond to the now.
It is a tremendous logic that transforms the world into a Platonic stage, where we are nothing more than the shadows of something — an inextricable law -, in a determinism that calcifies all singularities, but that strangely fascinates many.
The conquest of modernity was anchored in the conquest of chance and randomness, removing the incidences of a life from this fierce determinism that enclosed the world in a web. When the Renaissance freed the body from the influence of the stars, at that moment sexuality was relieved of guilt and individualism and its volition were able to emerge.
There is an unequivocal moral implication in the phrase “there is no such thing as chance, nothing happens by chance!”, which should function as a key to self-knowledge and self-judgment, however, this phrase is usually used to seek a reason for things outside of us, in others. It's an alibi.
Today there is a holistic temptation in the world, just as there was a satanic temptation in the Middle Ages, without much reflection on its consequences. Because it's not enough to want to connect everything in a resonant chain of affection. Even for the most unexpected: affection itself can kill.
I realize, thanks to that cultured, balanced, intelligent woman, that “the fight” took place at the beginning of this century. One of the great mistakes of the 20th century was the false dichotomy between “rationalism and irrationalism”, a debate that extended to all fields, including art. First, rationality (the positive side of reason) was confused with rationalism (the pathological aspect of reason), and articulated in this lack of discernment, irrationalism was confused with freedom. Almost all 20th century art, with Surrealism at its head, made this mistake. The fallacy still exists despite the emergence of “irrationalism” and the consequent relativist currents that followed it having been consolidated everywhere. Essentially, much of what happened in the 20th century revolved around this clash between two paradigms: Rationalism versus Irationalism.
Now, I see, we must save indeterminacy, chance, randomness from the terrible temptation of the cage of causalities. Holism, in its pathological form, may be reductionism that sets itself up as a new “eschatological narrative”.
Is it “by chance” that holism emerges at a time when neo-liberalism and its cynical contempt for the human person is besieging everything, all freedoms, all acquired rights?
Holistic awareness has brought a positive impact to greater ecological awareness, but followed with scholastic rigor, it stifles reality under the blanket of a determinism that is much more than uncomfortable: all great authoritarian ideologies are holistic.
My friend will know how to combine her holistic and transpersonal belief with the freedom and responsibility that each moment asks of us — but how many will make the distinction, under a Law that explains and encompasses everything?
How many will abandon themselves to what is?
The awareness of the indeterminate brings tragic awareness, as the Greeks knew, but it also brings agency and the courage of decision. And we cannot give up on this.
Furthermore, as Drummond shows in the poem “Quadrilha”, by Carlos Drummond de Andrade:
«João loved Teresa who loved Raimundo/ who loved Maria who loved Joaquim who loved Lili/ who didn't love anyone./ João went to the United States, Teresa to the convent,/ Raimundo died of a disaster, Maria stayed with her aunt,/ Joaquim committed suicide and Lili married J. Pinto Fernandes/ who had not entered the story.»
Real always runs outside the track, completely outside our concepts. That's what matters to us — a J. Pinto Fernandes emerges at the exact moment when we thought we had everything under control.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>From Nobel and others</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/17/do-nobel-e-outros/</link><description>9/10/22
When reading many people's reactions when this year's Nobel Prize for Literature was announced, I couldn't help but remember this comment from Jean-Pierre Siméon, in relation to another Nobel Prize: «An editor of a large national daily newspaper wrote five lines of indignation at the fact that the Nobel Prize for Literature had been awarded to Thomas Traströmer, a complete stranger. But unknown to whom? How did it not occur to this literary columnist, patented and paid to do his job, that his apparent ignorance was a matter of professional misconduct? Tranströmer had been translated into many languages, it was available in French.»
There is always the chorus of those who wait for the Prize to be announced to complain about not having been invited to be on the jury, there is a subgroup of angry people who profess “I have never read it and I won’t even bother to read it”; It is a less than humble fauna, the one that inhabits social networks.
Eu nem sempre conheço todos os premiados – desconhecia a existência da Louise Glück, que acho uma grande poeta, ou da Olga Tokarczuk, por exemplo – mas isso só me traz o conforto de saber que o mundo não é uma telenovela onde toda a gente se conhece e a alegria de reconhecer que a bitola do mundo não se mede com a minha medida curta e que pelo contrário dá-me uma nova oportunidade para enfrentar o desconhecido e aprender com ele.
And perhaps the most stupid reaction was that of the intelligent man who wrote, But are there still people who read French?; simply confirming that today there is a new type of ignorance that is being raised with abandon: that of those who only read English.
I would also prefer that, in French, Pascal Quignard, Linda Lê or even Sollers were awarded, or, among the new ones, Mathias Énard, but that does not detract from the dignity of Annie Ernaux's work (and it would have been enough to have written “Les Années”). There are books of hers that I like less, like the vulgar “Uma Paixão Simples”, but that happens with almost all authors, they have pivotal books and others that are like breaks in their itinerary. I recommend reading a beautiful book of interviews with her, “L’écriture comme un couteau”.

Yesterday an article appeared in the morning newspaper “Notícias”, in Maputo, reporting that the Pen Club Narrative Prize had been awarded to my wife, Teresa Noronha, for her soap opera “Tornado”, which had already won the Maria Velho da Costa Prize.
The summary they made of the book does not even deserve comments, as it is pathetic, but what is important to highlight is the note of disqualification regarding its “Mozambicanness” when they call it Luso-Mozambican. It's not that it's inaccurate, but, for those who know the context, it's a touch naughty.
Because finally, following the same logic, Adelino Timóteo should be called Tsonga-Mozambican, Álvaro Taruma Ronga-Mozambican, and Macua-Mozambican for writers from the north, etc., etc. Which doesn't appear to happen.
At one point, in the novel, she writes:
«Our color was never the dominant one. In colonial times we were not white, we were dressed in monhés, mugs of washed asses, the pejorative term to speak of a son of Goan and Portuguese. In the post-colonial period, I was not black and if, in Lisbon, they took me for Brazilian or Cape Verdean, in France they were lost in thought about where I was from and were surprised when they discovered that I was African. There I had to explain the wanderings of my DNA before settling in Mozambique. It took me a long time to accept that it was like that because yes, and that it was no curse that that was the case; on the contrary, I could even discover intense patterns of fantasy and freedom in this harlequin cloak that is our genealogy…”
In modern-day Mozambique, it means being white… and that immediately takes precedence over what you do or what you are.
It's sad, but as Naipaul warned, in these parts race is everything and people live as deeply immersed in it as, in other places, in religion.

Bruno Latour, an anthropologist who studied the sciences and their procedures and legitimations, law, technology and religions and who entertained himself by turning his back on the dogmas of the “moderns”, has died. For him, the place, the role of the specialist, was defined more by the perplexity he embodied than by the supposed truth that would sustain him.
He proposed, as an alternative to the goodness of multiculturalism and its equivocal cliché “all different, all equal”, a return to “diplomacy”, given that this, precisely, does not start from the assumption that “we are unified because we share the same nature” but simply highlights that we “still do not share a common world”; It is necessary that we deal head-on with the “abyss of disagreement” that separates us, instead of trying to deceive it.
And about politics he said, boldly:
«If transparency is demanded from politicians, we kill them; if anyone demands fidelity to what the other was or what he says, kill him; If a mimetic relationship is required between what the crowd wants and what its representative says, representation is killed. These must therefore, by definition, betray, deceive, modify, distort the word. Without this ability to bend the word and betray, political language would not exist. I put forward the perfectly plausible hypothesis that political vocabulary will become as inaccessible as the religious language of the last twenty, three or fifty years.» (in “Un Monde Pluriel mais Commun”). I believe we will be needed to decipher this frantically complex world that has fallen to us.</description><pubDate>2022-10-17 02:18:03</pubDate></item><item><title>Fuxi</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/30/o-fuxi/</link><description>O my friends, companions of these disastrous journeys through countries as old as the stars and the Moon, and as strange as the deepest interior of our wretched souls, what surprises still await us, what secret magics will we still have to overcome, what horrors will arise before our pupils dilated with astonishment and terror?
Increasingly closer to our precarious existences, howls the monster of war, which threatens to merge humanity once and for all with the earth, incessantly traversed by the squalid specter of hunger and the invisible evil of ten thousand pestilences.
Oh damned human, who believes you are superior to Nature itself, but then you reveal yourself, time and time again, incapable of simply ordering your existence and do not understand that you are possessed by fickle anger and are a slave to your own ambition! You are not satisfied with white jade or resplendent gold, there is no treasure that quenches your inextinguishable thirst for command over other men, animals and things; for eternal anguish dwells in you; in you the expelled serpents crawl; for you grows, powerful and impressive, the most fertile ivy of Evil!
This is perhaps why on the Mount they call the White Deer, where one of the eight immortals on a sacred mount soared through the heavens towards Penglai, lives the fuxi, a bird whose shape resembles that of a rooster, although topped by a human head. What strange copulations, what monstrous embraces, what terrible procedures must have occurred to make the existence of this sinister animal possible? We don't know, but all it takes is for our exhausted mind to dare to come up with an answer, and then we feel our skin covered in horrendous goosebumps and our heart races in parade, like a wild horse whipped by the night whip of fear, unresponsive to reins and containment.
Let men refrain from visiting Monte do Veado, because although there are riches capable of calming the wildest ambitions, if they have the unfortunate luck of catching a glimpse of a fuxi, it is certain that a war will soon break out and the cultivated fields will perish, because of it the tame animals will be beheaded, because of it the best young men of two generations will be sacrificed and the pride of the countries will be destroyed.
The fuxi makes a sound reminiscent of its name. If you hear it, dark night or clear day, be on your way, because the path you are on is the surest path to misfortune!</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Procrastinators Club</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/29/clube-dos-procrastinadores/</link><description>While rereading Easter, because of an article I'm preparing, I come across this excerpt, taken from “The Universal Man”:
«Each man, morally, is one and absolute; but he has to live with attenuating his personality. (…) Coexistence is only possible between people reduced to a negative or hollow presence, which constantly gives way. Hence, the emptiness of society, an immense ghost made up of countless dead people. A superior man is antisocial or criminal. His destiny is prison and the desert”.
I hesitate to think whether Pascoaes reflects here on the political-social conditions that muzzle, and, worse, in a sad country like Portugal in the middle of the Estado Novo (and the book is from 1931) where any possibilities of spontaneity and frankness in human relationships were restricted, or if it merely lends to the behavior of (oppressed) men a metaphysical framework, an “essence”, declared in the presumption of each being, in isolation, “one and absolute”. Sometimes, in addition to an excess of Spirituality (or Saudade), Pascoaes lacks the world. He is a great poet, but he is a poet who takes Ampoules-of-Great-Ideas and who therefore writes often trapped by a programmatic furor, ceasing to have pores; It is not uncommon for a glass to be erected between him and reality, the same glass that made him write in O Bailado, from 1921: «Everything is a ghost. There are only clouds, clouds of voices, clouds of souls, of afflictions and tragedies! Clouds and more clouds, appearances and more appearances! And a divine lightning that pierces them, the instantaneous Apparition that appears and throws us to the ground, dazzled!»
Sometimes I felt like reminding him, as António Sérgio did, in the article “Regeneration and Tradition, Moral and Economy”, which he dedicated to Pascoaes: «Pascoais, Pascoais my dear friend: you are a pure, excellent and noble poet, but also a victim of this social environment, like us all: of this horrible isolation that you praise and I curse».
«As a child, he stole two blackbirds», says Jacinto do Prado Coelho, he stole them from a nest, and he felt remorse for that all his life. The Person, few more mischiefs are known to him. Only in Álvaro de Campos does a hint of wickedness and obscenity emerge: «Ah, and the ordinary and dirty people, who always look the same,/ Who use swear words as usual words,/ Whose sons steal from grocery store doors/ And whose daughters at the age of eight – and I think this is beautiful and I love it! –/ Decent-looking men masturbate in stairwells.” (Triumphal ode).
Both poets, driven by a certain idea of ​​sanctity, had the same inability to break the siege of their skin with the overflow of someone else's dam, the same curse of sublimating the concrete ferocity of eros with the gentleness of the verses.
Obviously, they are both “bigger than life”, but sometimes it makes me unnerved to watch, from my position as a hatter at the Procrastinators Club, the tantrums between them, just to see who occupies, in the internal organization, the place of President and Treasurer.
Although Pessoa guessed more things, for example, what he wrote in the lesser-known Ode Martial and which is reflected in the situation we live in today, in a different way, with his heart in his hands:
«MARTIAL ODE
(…)
Helahoho! helahoho!
The poor widow's sewing machine who was bayoneted...
She sewed indefinitely in the afternoon…
The table where the old people played,
Everything mixed, everything mixed with bodies, with blood,
All one river, one wave, one dragging horror.
Helahoho! helahoho!
I unearthed the child's tin train pressed into the middle of the
[road,
And I cried like all the mothers in the world about the horror of life.
My pantheistic feet tripped over the sewing machine
[widow who was killed with a bayonet
And that poor instrument of peace stuck a spear in my heart.
Yes, I was the one to blame for everything, I was the soldier for them all
Who killed, raped, burned and broke,
It was me and my shame and my remorse like a shadow
[misshapen
They travel around the world like Ashavero,
But behind my steps there are footsteps the size of infinity
And a physical fear of being accountable to God makes me close my eyes.
[eyes suddenly.
(…)
I ordered, captain, to shoot the trembling peasants,
I let the daughters of all fathers tied to trees be raped,
Now I saw that it was inside my heart that all this happened,
And everything scalds and suffocates and I can't move without it
[everything be the same.
God have mercy on me, I didn't have it from anyone!
LÀ-BAS, JE NE SAIS OÙ…”
What is clear today, at this disastrous moment in which Cristiano &amp; Companhia failed in their mission in Braga, and in which the self-sabotage of Russia's gas pipelines reminds us that Putin will indeed be willing to do anything to maintain dominance over the areas endorsed,

In a two-hour meeting, 97 percent of members voted to disband the party, once one of the biggest forces in Hong Kong's Legislative Council.
At the annual assembly, according to the South China Morning Post, a total of 117 members, 97 percent of those present, agreed to the party's dissolution, following the decision taken by the party leadership in February. Veteran member and former deputy Fred Li Wah-ming said a mainland Chinese official had urged the party to dissolve before December's Legislative Council elections.
This dissolution of the party eliminates what little remains of the city's main political opposition, following a similar decision by the League of Social Democrats in June and the closure of the Civic Party in 2023. The Hong Kong Association for Democracy and People's Welfare, which focuses on social issues and advocates for residents to vote under the revamped electoral system, is the only remaining pro-democracy force.
The patriots
Currently, with the various arrests of leaders and activists and the limitations on candidacies, the democratic party did not have any representation in the legislative council or district councils. The issue became even more complex in March 2021, when the Chinese government passed a law designed to ensure that only those it designated as 'patriots' could govern in Hong Kong.
This regulation significantly reduced democratic representation in the assembly, consolidated control over electoral processes and established a candidate selection panel aligned with Beijing's interests.
Since this legislation and electoral reforms came into force, the future of the Democratic Party has been at risk, following constant police raids and arrests of activists or family members in recent years. A few months ago, party members authorized the sale of their headquarters for 11 million Hong Kong dollars to prepare for eventual dissolution and prevent the property from being handed over to the courts. The party's remaining funds are to be donated to the Association for the Rights of Victims of Industrial Accidents.</description><pubDate>2025-12-15 02:11:55</pubDate></item><item><title>Fighting between Thailand and Cambodia continues</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/15/combates-entre-tailandia-e-camboja-prosseguem/</link><description>Thailand and Cambodia continue fighting along the border, as the conflict enters its second week, after Bangkok denied that it had said “yes” to a ceasefire, announced by the President of the United States, Donald Trump. The hostilities, which broke out on December 7, have so far caused at least 33 deaths and more than 200 injuries, in addition to around 800,000 people being displaced on both sides of the border.
The two countries accuse each other of having unleashed hostilities and attacking civilians. Last Friday, Donald Trump stated that the leaders of the two countries had agreed to a ceasefire after a phone call from him, but the Thai Government denied this commitment and the fighting continued this Saturday and continued yesterday.
According to Thai Defense Ministry spokesman Surasant Kongsiri, Cambodia shelled several border provinces on Saturday night and yesterday. The Cambodian counterpart, Maly Socheata, accused Thai forces of continuing to bomb and fire mortars in areas close to the border since midnight on Sunday.
Cambodia closed its land borders with Thailand this Saturday, leaving thousands of people stranded on both sides of the border. The decision, according to Phnom Penh, aims to protect civilians — including foreigners of various nationalities, who were unable to cross the border into Thailand — from the risks associated with military clashes, which last week included the use of fighter jets and artillery fire along the border, which is around 820 kilometers long.
Cambodia has asked its citizens living in Thailand and Thais hoping to return to their country to remain where they are “until the ceasefire is fully enforced.”
Thailand, in turn, expressed concern about this decision by Phnom Penh, especially as it expected the return on Saturday of around 7,000 Thais who had been waiting for days at the border to enter the country and who are now prohibited from crossing it by land.
"These actions violate numerous provisions of international law that, for our part, Thailand respects. I guarantee that Cambodians and other foreign citizens living in Thailand will receive assistance in accordance with international law", said deputy spokesperson for the Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Maratee Nalita Andamo, at a press conference yesterday.
An old case
Thailand and Cambodia dispute the sovereignty of territories where Khmer Empire temples are located along a border of around 820 kilometers, drawn at the beginning of the 20th century during the French colonial period. In July this year, a first episode of violence caused 43 deaths in five days and forced around 300,000 people to leave their homes in areas close to the common border, before a ceasefire under the auspices of the United States, China and Malaysia.
The two countries then signed a ceasefire agreement on October 26, under the aegis of Donald Trump, which Bangkok suspended a few weeks later, following the explosion of a mine that injured several of its soldiers, and which Thailand accuses of having been installed after the ceasefire.</description><pubDate>2025-12-15 02:08:12</pubDate></item><item><title>Diplomacy | China and India highlight “positive advances” in bilateral relations</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/15/diplomacia-china-e-india-destacam-avancos-positivos-nas-relacoes-bilaterais/</link><description>Senior diplomatic officials from China and India highlighted “recent positive progress” in the bilateral relationship in Beijing on Thursday, during a new round of consultations between the two countries' foreign ministries.
According to a statement released Friday by the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the meeting was led by Liu Jinsong, director-general of the Asia Department, and by Shri Sujit Ghosh, joint secretary of the Indian ministry for East Asia, and took place in a “timely and efficient” manner.
During the talks, both parties defended the need to relaunch institutional dialogue mechanisms, boost bilateral exchanges and adequately manage divergences and sensitive issues.
The delegations also reiterated their commitment to strengthening communication and coordination in multilateral forums, promoting multilateralism and supporting the construction of a multipolar international order. The consultations take place in a context of rapprochement between Beijing and New Delhi, after years of tension, and following measures such as the resumption of border trade, the reopening of direct air links and the relaunch of high-level diplomatic contacts.
Despite the positive signs, the relationship remains marked by fundamental differences, especially around the common border in the Himalayas, where a deadly clash in 2020 provoked the worst bilateral crisis in decades. According to the Chinese statement, the delegations agreed to “maximize the positive aspects” of the Sino-Indian relationship.</description><pubDate>2025-12-15 02:07:11</pubDate></item><item><title>Tai Po | Commission announced to investigate fire</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/15/tai-po-anunciada-comissao-que-vai-investigar-incendio/</link><description>The working group, led by judge David Lok, hopes to present results on the reasons behind the tragedy, which left at least 160 people dead, within nine months
Hong Kong authorities announced Friday the investigation committee that will be responsible for analyzing the circumstances of the November 26 fire at the Wang Fuk Court residential complex, which caused at least 160 deaths.
The commission will be led by the judge of the Court of First Instance of the High Court of Hong Kong, David Lok, “and will formally begin work at the end of this month, with the prospect of completing the work nine months after the start of the task”, according to a statement published by the executive of the Chinese special administrative region.
The commission will examine all aspects of the fire, starting with the causes that accelerated the spread of the flames, supposedly attributed to the protective materials used in the building's repairs, but will also assess the firefighters' response to the distress call and the legal status of the works.
According to the team's final conclusions, the commission will present to the territory's Chief Executive, John Lee, a series of proposals to prepare.
The president promised the population a series of “profound reforms, with the aim of preventing similar incidents from happening again”. During the commission's announcement, John Lee admitted that the investigating judge faces a “titanic task” and that perhaps nine months is an insufficient period of time.
“The fact is that I want to resolve this issue as quickly as possible and I decided to set a deadline that I consider realistic, as long as the commission has sufficient means to act,” he stated. "It's a huge responsibility and a challenge in just nine months, but they all have the passion and love for Hong Kong needed to take on this responsibility with such courage. I am deeply grateful to them," he concluded.
Managers concerned
Anti-corruption authorities are directly investigating 13 people linked to the fire under the presumption of having committed negligent homicide, including the directors and an engineering consultant of a construction company responsible for the building's renovation work. On Tuesday, the United Nations expressed concern over the arrests of people demanding explanations about the worst fire the city has suffered in decades.
“Hong Kongers rightfully demand answers and that those responsible be held accountable, so that the hundreds of victims are duly compensated and so that a tragedy like this does not happen again,” said United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Turk, in a statement.
Following the fire on November 26, authorities issued a warning against those who “exploit the tragedy”, having so far arrested four people for sedition.</description><pubDate>2025-12-15 02:04:30</pubDate></item><item><title>Diplomacy | Alerta para perigos de rearmamento nipónico</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/12/diplomacia-alerta-para-perigos-de-rearmamento-niponico/</link><description>The new Japanese Prime Minister's provocative statements about Taiwan, combined with the change in Japanese attitudes towards Defense, raised alarm bells in the Middle East country.
A spokesperson for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Wednesday that China calls on all peace-loving countries to protect themselves and thwart any dangerous moves to revive Japanese militarism and jointly defend the hard-won victorious results of the Second World War, according to the People's Daily.
Spokesperson Guo Jiakun made the remarks at a press conference in response to a question about recent comments by some foreign media that Japan is transforming from a constitutionally pacifist state into a modern military power, and that the country is trying to revive militarism, which could threaten regional and global peace and stability and deserves vigilance.
Guo noted that in recent years, Japan has been reformulating its security and defense policies, accelerating the revision of its pacifist constitution and violating the exclusively defense-oriented principle. Furthermore, the country removed the ban on the exercise of the right to collective self-defense, relaxed restrictions on arms exports, attempted to change its three non-nuclear principles and developed the so-called “capability to attack enemy bases”.
The official highlighted that senior Japanese officials even declared that Japan does not rule out the possibility of possessing nuclear submarines. “These measures have placed Japan’s neighboring countries and the international community on alert,” Guo said.
"We note that after increasing its defense budget in 13 consecutive years, Japan now has the second largest military budget among Western countries. According to a European think tank, the revenues of Japan's five largest defense companies will increase by 40 percent annually in 2024," Guo pointed out.
“For a country that calls itself constitutionally pacifist, talks about reflecting on its military past and claims to follow the principle exclusively oriented towards defense, how does Japan justify its military increase?”, asked Guo.
Distorted looks
The MNE representative went on to say that, in fact, after World War II, the Japanese government never fully reflected on its wars of aggression, many Japanese war criminals returned as active political figures and members of the Self-Defense Forces, some prime ministers and political dignitaries have insisted on visiting and paying homage to the Yasukuni Shrine, where Class A war criminals are honored. Historical facts have been minimized and covered up in distorted textbooks, Guo added.
"Japanese right-wing forces reflected on the war's past. However, they did not reflect on Japan's war crimes, but on the reason why Japan was defeated," Guo noted. The MNE spokesperson stated that the reckoning with Japanese militarism was never completed. Instead, people will see a growing trend toward the resurgence of militarism.
It is imperative for the international community to remind Japan that the Potsdam Declaration, in articles 6, 7, 9 and 11, stated that Japanese militarism and its breeding ground must be eliminated forever, as we insist that a new order of peace, security and justice will be impossible until there is convincing evidence that Japan's power to wage war has been destroyed politically and legally and that bellicose ideas have been fundamentally eliminated, Guo said.
The representative further highlighted that the Potsdam Proclamation also requires that Japan be completely disarmed and not maintain industries that would allow it to rearm for war, and that it is promised in Japan's Instrument of Surrender that the country will faithfully comply with the provisions of the Potsdam Proclamation.
These instruments with legal effect under international law and recognized by Japan have clarified its international obligations as a defeated country, constitute an important cornerstone of the post-war international order, and serve as a political and legal prerequisite for Japan's return to the international community, the spokesperson noted.
"Japan's attempt to 'remilitarize' itself through the accelerated strengthening of its armed forces will only make the world question where Japan is heading and demand another reckoning with its war crimes. China calls on all peace-loving countries to protect themselves and thwart any dangerous moves to revive Japanese militarism and to jointly defend the hard-won victorious results of the Second World War," said Guo.</description><pubDate>2025-12-12 01:23:12</pubDate></item><item><title>Timor-Leste and Brazil sign agreement to train Portuguese teachers</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/12/timor-leste-e-brasil-assinam-acordo-para-formacao-de-professores-de-portugues/</link><description>The Timorese Government and Brazil signed on Wednesday a training project for Portuguese language teachers in Timor-Leste, to reinforce teachers' linguistic, communicative and didactic-pedagogical skills.
“The Portuguese Language Teacher Training Project for the 3rd Cycle of Basic Education, which we formalized today through the signing of a complementary agreement and a project document, is born from a profound commitment: to ensure that all our teachers have the linguistic, communicative, didactic-pedagogical and methodological skills necessary to ensure the successful implementation of the new national curriculum, which came into force in the academic year 2025”, he stated Sweet Jesus.
The Timorese Minister of Education was speaking during the signing ceremony of the training program, which will last four years (2025 to 2028). The project will cover a total of 644 Portuguese language teachers from the 3rd Cycle of Basic Education, directly involved in the teaching and learning process of young Timorese.
“To improve this process, we will have the technical support of 17 Brazilian teacher-coordinators, who will work under a joint teaching regime, and 81 Timorese teachers, who will act as multiplier teachers, thus guaranteeing the sustainability and continuity of training in the future”, explained the Timorese minister.
The project also includes the production of new teaching materials for the 7th, 8th and 9th years, the creation of a Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) and the establishment, at the National Institute for the Training of Teachers and Education Professionals (INFORDEPE), of a Portuguese Teacher Training Center, which will function as a permanent technical and pedagogical support structure.
"We all understand that this is a strategic and ambitious investment. An investment that goes beyond simply training teachers and that represents the construction of a sustainable model for the future of training and education in Timor-Leste", added Dulce de Jesus.
Expanding
The Brazilian ambassador to Timor-Leste, Ricardo José Leal, stated that the Brazilian Government is committed to continuing to collaborate with Timor-Leste, especially in the promotion and dissemination of the Portuguese language. “Teacher training aims to train teachers and expand the use of the Portuguese language, especially in basic education”, declared the Brazilian diplomat.
The project has support from the Brazilian Government through the Brazilian Cooperation Agency (ABC) and the University of Campinas (UNICAMP), which have provided consistent technical and scientific support to improve the educational system in Timor-Leste.</description><pubDate>2025-12-12 01:21:21</pubDate></item><item><title>IMF | Highly revised China growth to 5% by 2025</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/11/fmi-revisto-em-alta-crescimento-da-china-para-5-em-2025/</link><description>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) yesterday revised upwards the growth forecast for the Chinese economy for 2025, from 4.8 percent to 5 percent, citing the economic stimuli launched by Beijing and the trade truce with the United States.
The update is contained in the annual assessment of the Chinese economy, released yesterday, which also raises the growth projection for 2026, from 4.2 percent to 4.5 percent. The IMF mission, led by Sonali Jain-Chandra, highlighted the “remarkable resilience” of the Chinese economy despite “multiple disruptions in recent years”.
Still, he warned of persistent imbalances, such as the prolonged adjustment of the real estate sector, the impact on local finances and weak consumer confidence, which resulted in low domestic demand and deflationary pressures. For 2025, the IMF forecasts average inflation of 0 percent, with a moderate recovery to 0.8 percent next year.
The mission also warned of medium-term risks, such as the aging of the population, the slowdown in productivity and high levels of debt.
Despite the external competitiveness benefited by the real devaluation of the yuan, the IMF considers that exports can no longer sustain growth alone. The IMF recommends a faster transition to a consumption-based growth model, by reducing the high rate of household savings, greater exchange rate flexibility, strengthening social protection systems and responding to the housing crisis.
Reforms in the labor market to reduce youth unemployment and restructuring local government debt through insolvency mechanisms are other proposals put forward.</description><pubDate>2025-12-11 04:39:13</pubDate></item><item><title>East Timor | Agreements with Asian Development Bank canceled</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/11/timor-leste-cancelados-acordos-com-banco-asiatico-de-desenvolvimento/</link><description>The Timorese Government decided yesterday to cancel three financing agreements with the Asian Development Bank, including the one relating to the Nicolau Lobato airport expansion project, signed in 2021.
The Timorese executive justified the decision “following an in-depth analysis of the various projects financed by loans, which again highlighted the existence of initiatives that have yet to start or with very low levels of execution”, can be read in the statement from the Council of Ministers.
In addition to the financing agreement for the expansion of the airport, worth US$85 million, the Government also decided to cancel financing for the “Power Distribution Modernization” projects, signed in December 2021, worth US$35 million, and for “Dili West Water Supply”, signed in 2022, worth US$50 million.
In this context, certain financing agreements currently in force are no longer necessary”, highlighted the Timorese Government. At the meeting, the Government also approved the signing of a loan agreement, with a subsidy component, with the Asian Development Bank to finance the “Improvement of National Roads” project, phase 1.
“This project aims to modernize around 42 kilometers of important roads in the national road network, introducing small-scale climate adaptation infrastructure in six juices [groups of villages] prone to floods and droughts”, explained the Government. The project also includes the rehabilitation of three bridges located between Baucau and Lautém, in the east of the country.</description><pubDate>2025-12-11 04:33:22</pubDate></item><item><title>Seoul | Protest after incursion of military planes from Beijing and Moscow</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/11/seul-protesto-apos-incursao-de-avioes-militares-de-pequim-e-moscovo/</link><description>Seoul announced yesterday that it had lodged a “strong diplomatic protest” with Russian and Chinese authorities after military planes from Beijing and Moscow passed through the South Korean air defense identification zone.

“Our armed forces will continue to actively respond to the activities of aircraft from neighboring countries within [the South Korean air defense identification zone], in accordance with international law”, highlighted the head of international affairs at that ministry, Lee Kwang-suk.
South Korea said on Tuesday it sent fighter jets in response to the entry of seven Russian and two Chinese military aircraft into the country's air defense zone. This zone is an area larger than airspace that a country controls for security reasons, although this concept is not defined by any international treaty.
None of the Russian and Chinese military aircraft violated South Korean airspace, according to the Joint Chiefs of Staff in Seoul.

Luís Bernardino, co-author linked to the Autonomous University of Lisbon, highlights positive developments since the creation of the Community of Portuguese Speaking Countries, despite inaction and controversies with Equatorial Guinea
“25 Years of Defense Cooperation in the CPLP [Community of Portuguese Speaking Countries]” was released as an e-book and is now available in print. Why edit this book?
This book talks about the 25 years of cooperation in the CPLP defense area and is written by me, together with a colleague from Brazil, Camila Rizzi. It results from a research project developed at the CPLP Strategic Analysis Center, based in Mozambique. It has the CPLP defense component and makes strategic reflection on this topic. Due to the fact that 25 years of cooperation have passed in this area, we wanted to carry out an evaluation and the book so that it would remain in the history of the organization. In 2023, there were no financial conditions to publish the book on paper as we wanted, and it was now launched on November 18th, in Maputo.
There is criticism regarding the effective action of the CPLP. Do you consider that this organism has grown sustainably?
The assessment I make is in the area of ​​defense. When the CPLP was created, cooperation in the area of ​​defense was not included in the initial six areas. This area only emerged in 1998. The CPLP was born with six main areas – culture, language, political-diplomatic concentration – and currently has 26 areas of cooperation, which is proof that it has grown in a sustained manner. Obviously, with ups and downs, situations have become easier over these almost 30 years. But what stands out in this book, in the area of ​​defense, is that there was a very consolidated and participated growth. In these 25 years, a lot of interesting things have been done and the evaluation is positive.
And the future?
We need to define a defense cooperation strategy and what we want for the CPLP in this area over the next 25 years. This is the challenge we face, of greater activity and initiative, so that cooperation and defense can be strategic in what is cooperation within States. So that it can be more visible and effectively allow for growth, participation and development, or even greater commitment, in regional contexts.
But looking at the past, present and future, what has the dynamic been like in the defense area?
The book shows a certain dynamic of substantial constitutional growth in the first phase. Then there were very interesting developments, with some protocols and cooperation at the level of the Armed Forces, but there is still a lot to do, namely looking at the area of ​​defense cooperation as a strategic area.
The global geopolitical system appears to be changing very quickly, following a multipolar path. Should the CPLP have another role in this context, with actors such as China, Russia or the United States?
The CPLP is not a multilateral instrument, it is not an organization of that level. We have to place the CPLP at the level of the Commonwealth, for example, of organizations at a cultural, linguistic level, of partnership between countries, of concern for development. What I usually say is that the CPLP is a good diplomatic communication instrument, a soft power in areas related to conflict management and prevention. Let us not expect there to be armed forces, or an army, from the CPLP. This body is one of dialogue and cooperation. What we do, in terms of defense, is exactly that, create partnerships so that there are mechanisms for responding to disasters, to provide training capacity for the armed forces. There are even those who ask the question: why did the CPLP not intervene in Cabo Delgado, in Mozambique, on the issue of terrorism?
And why?
Because the CPLP is not a hard power mechanism, it has no capacity, doctrine, logistics, mandate or viability to be used in combat operations. And CPLP Member States are very aware that we are a very good mechanism for cooperation, partnership and development, with contributions to culture and language. Therefore, the CPLP will not intervene in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, because that is not its area, nor does it have mechanisms for this dynamic.
Is the existence of the CPLP justified?
I think so, obviously, because, as I said, the CPLP is a very good instrument in terms of cooperation, the dissemination of the Portuguese language, of history. The fact is that we have around 350 million people who speak Portuguese. We have 30 countries that are associated observers, such as Ukraine, Chile, and Portuguese culture is represented in this organization. Each country has what it wants from the CPLP and gives it the importance it thinks it should give, and this depends on the foreign policy of each State. But I think the CPLP makes a lot of sense in the world we live in, and does so as a multilateral representative of language, culture, cooperation between Portuguese-speaking states, and those that ultimately have some affinity [with the Portuguese-speaking world]. The Macau issue is very specific to this organization.
Macau has the role of a commercial platform between China and Portuguese-speaking countries, and China has an agenda for Lusophony.
Before 1999 Macau had its own status within the CPLP, as it was administered by Portuguese. There was a Joint Declaration that allowed Macau, not being a Member State, to have, in a certain way, a protocol [with the CPLP]. When it became a Macao SAR, things changed and it lost that connection status, and Macau is not a member of the CPLP, and obviously cannot be. Neither does China, and it cannot be. Therefore, there is an associated observer status here that arises for countries, international and regional organizations, and even territorial entities with their own administration, which is also not quite the case in Macau. The territory is in limbo, between having a very strong history linked to Lusofonia, and having an administration very linked to China, which gives it, in my perspective, two dynamics.
In what sense?
Macau is a fundamental element in the connection between the CPLP countries and China. For all reasons, but due to the issue of language, history, and its representation, it is a fundamental actor in this cooperation. Macau must effectively be seen as a partner and as a gateway for China to Portuguese-speaking countries. This is what, in a way, is already happening, and this is what the CPLP will be paying attention to, in this relationship in which Macau has a special status. Whether we like it or not, it has an impact. Macau is an attractive factor in facilitating relations between China and Angola, Portugal or Brazil.
Does Equatorial Guinea's stay in the CPLP raise questions of credibility?
I agree with you. In these 30 years, it has been one of the main difficult moments in creating consensus. I remember that Equatorial Guinea was admitted in 2014, but there was already a process in the previous analysis phase. There was always an extension, year after year, and it was difficult to reach a consensus within the CPLP countries. In 2014, there was a summit in Timor-Leste and, through the action of Brazil and Angola, there was, in a way, a lot of pressure for Equatorial Guinea to join. But there are two principles, for better and for worse, that justify Equatorial Guinea's presence in the CPLP.
What are…
The first argument is that, in fact, Equatorial Guinea has Portuguese as its official language in its Constitution, despite us knowing that the Portuguese language, for example, covers four or five percent of society as a whole, and I am already being quite generous. But there is a commitment from the Equatorial Guinea authorities to develop Portuguese as a working language and there is a historical connection to Portuguese culture and Lusophony. Another criterion is the promise that, in the next constitutional review, a commitment will be made to abolish the death penalty. As for Portuguese, it's something that takes generations, it's not done from one year to the next. Not even in the next 10 or 15 years will we have Portuguese perfectly implemented. There is some shyness, a commitment, in a way. As for the death penalty, the fact is that, it seems, some change has been achieved. There has never been a death penalty action again [since accession]. And there is hope that, in the next constitutional review, this fact will be abolished from the Constitution and that it may, effectively, cease to exist. As a member of the CPLP, these changes will be easier and more visible and, in the future, Equatorial Guinea can effectively assume CPLP status taking these premises into account. I don't know if it will happen, I leave here a reluctance, and this is a challenging moment for the CPLP itself. Work needs to be done from within, so that Equatorial Guinea can be at the same level as other countries, especially in these two areas.
What is certain is that there remains a certain lack of transparency regarding what is happening in the country.
We are aware that Equatorial Guinea has major problems with issues of democratic legitimacy and elections. There are a series of situations that we recognize are not perfectly adequate given the status of CPLP countries. I think there is hope that things can change, an attempt to create space for Portuguese to grow within Equatorial Guinea, and also a commitment to greater openness and participation. What is a fact is that Equatorial Guinea has participated in CPLP meetings, and I have participated in some. In international situations we have to be pragmatic, and we hope that, just because Equatorial Guinea is in the CPLP, this can help Guinea itself to develop some mechanical gestures.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Timor-Leste / Independence – Mari Alkatiri: Proclamation was anticipated by the Indonesian military presence</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/11/24/timor-leste-independencia-mari-alkatiri-proclamacao-foi-antecipada-pela-presenca-militar-indonesia/</link><description>Interview by Isabel Marisa Serafim, from the Lusa agency
The leader of the Revolutionary Front of Independent Timor-Leste (Fretilin), Mari Alkatiri, said that the unilateral proclamation of independence was scheduled for December 1, 1975, but was brought forward because Indonesian troops were already in the territory.
“It was initially scheduled for December 1st,” said Mari Alkatiri, in an interview with Lusa on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the unilateral declaration of independence, which is marked on Friday, and of the Indonesian occupation, nine days later, on December 7th.
In November, Mari Alkatiri went on a “safari” through several African countries, mainly the Portuguese-speaking African Countries (PALOP), which involved participating in the declaration of Angola’s independence on November 11, 1975.
"After this 'tour', this African 'safari', I returned to the country. At the time I was in Maputo to prepare my return and I received a call from Nicolau Lobato not to return, because we needed to have someone outside the country", he recalled, highlighting that he did not follow the order from the then vice-president of Fretilin.
“So I returned to Dili on the 22nd or 23rd of November and the central committee and military political committee were meeting at the current headquarters of the National Police of Timor-Leste, which was the provisional headquarters of Fretilin, and the proclamation for December 1st was being discussed”, he explained. On November 28, Mari Alkatiri, then 25 years old, recalled that Nicolau Lobato came to her house and said that it was necessary to proclaim independence that day.
"We both left in his car for Lahane where Xavier do Amaral [former president of Fretilin] was and we conveyed this to Xavier Amaral, who clearly said to wait another three or four days. We said there was no time to wait and we decided to make the proclamation that day in the afternoon", he said.
"Fortunately, not only was the Constitution ready, but also the flag was ready. It was my mother who sewed the flag. There were minimum conditions for the proclamation of independence", stated the current secretary general of Fretilin, who also wrote the text of the proclamation.
“When I start talking about these days it’s not just memory, I actively participated in the unilateral proclamation of independence, although people try to cut out my photo, politics, but the truth is that there is only one person still alive who actively participated in the proclamation 50 years ago, that’s me”, he highlighted.
In the first Timorese Government, led by Nicolau Lobato and which only lasted nine days, Mari Alkatiri was appointed Minister of State for Political Affairs. Nocolau Lobato led the fight against the Indonesian occupation and was assassinated in December 1978. The restoration of independence took place on May 20, 2002, after a referendum for self-determination on August 30, 1999 and 24 years of resistance against Indonesia.
A question of egos
Mari Alkatiri also stated, in the same interview, that “egos” are preventing Timor-Leste from overcoming the challenges and that a more democratic, inclusive and comprehensive leadership culture is needed.
"If we managed it at the time, with all the difficulties, with all the challenges to overcome, at almost the speed of light, why can't we today? That's the question, the question of the cause. When the cause unites, the journey can go on, with many setbacks here and there, but we will succeed and we will win", said Mari Alkatiri in an interview with Lusa on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the unilateral declaration of independence, which marks this Friday.
Asked about the reason for no union, the leader of the Revolutionary Front of Independent Timor-Leste (Fretilin) ​​said it was “egos”.
“I am following the budget debate, when we continue to think about State matters in a 'cantin' way, we are not going anywhere”, criticized the former East Timorese Prime Minister, whose party chose to abstain in the final global vote on the State Budget.
Regarding criticism of the current government's options, Mari Alkatiri said she did not know if there was ever an option. "I don't see a strategy. There are some successes here and there, tries here and there, but there is no strategy, but there is a lot of support for strategic planning, strategic investment, but I don't see it", he stated.
“There is a need for a much more democratic, much more inclusive, very comprehensive leadership culture, with a sense of mission and vision for the future”, highlighted the secretary general of Fretilin. The party leader also warned not to wait for the “bomb to explode”.
“The delay bomb is there, the time bomb is there, I hope we don’t have to, after that, apologize for the truth, after the bomb goes off”, he highlighted. Asked if the “bomb” is dissatisfaction, the former prime minister said: “complete”.
"A country that after 24 years of restoring independence, with the means it had to work, why did it fail? Lack of sense of inclusion. We are building a State, we talk about the Democratic Rule of Law, is that true? Or oligarchic", he asked.
The new generations
Still in relation to young people, who represent the majority of the approximately 1.4 million inhabitants of Timor-Leste, Mari Alkatiri said that they feel lost. "Young people are naturally more generous when they are more considered, or more rebellious, when they are revolted. There are two facets here in youth, one of generosity when they embrace a cause, the other is a much more violent reaction of confrontation", he said.
Pointing out that more than 70% of the population is under 35 years old, Mari Alkatiri warned that those “two generations have already been sacrificed” due to “poor quality” education and “increasingly worse health” and “no prospects”. “Now, we all say that oil money will run out, I see that for the Government, the alternative to oil is oil”, he said.
In September, the capital of the Timor-Leste Petroleum Fund was US$18.95 billion (€16.4 billion). “We kept dreaming about Sunrise and as I usually say while we dream about Sunrise, we will have the ‘sunset’, because there is no politics, there are no plans, there are no programs”, he added.
Mari Alkatiri was referring to the Greater Sunrise gas field, located 150 kilometers from Timor-Leste and 450 kilometers from Darwin, whose project has been mired in an impasse, with Dili defending the construction of a gas pipeline to the south of the country, and Woodside, the consortium's second largest partner, leaning towards a connection to the existing unit in Darwin.
The consortium is made up of the Timorese company Timor Gap (56.56%), the operator Woodside Energy (33.44%) and Osaca Gás (10.00%). The Government of Timor-Leste announced on Saturday the signing of a cooperation agreement with the Australian Woodside Energy for studies to process and export gas to the country.
Missing discussions
The secretary general of the Revolutionary Front of Independent Timor-Leste (Fretilin), Mari Alkatiri, defended the need for “all together” to discuss what failed in the last 24 years, after the restoration of independence in May 2002.
"There is a lot of talk about new paradigms and the old paradigm, we are ready to sit down together to discuss the old paradigm, why did it fail? No", said the former Timorese prime minister, in an interview with Lusa on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the unilateral declaration of independence, which marks this Friday.
For Mari Alkatiri, everyone contributed with “their positive part, with their negative part”, but it is necessary to understand the failures in “individual terms”, in “collective terms” and there be “responsibility”. Asked by Lusa about the reasons why there is no such discussion, the leader of the Timorese opposition replied that a “leader who cannot sit at the table is not a leader”.
"The leader must know that there is a time to sit at the table. I made proposals. When I returned in 2018, I said 'my vote is so that the people can win', I didn't say for Fretilin to win. The message was clear, it was time for us all to think together. I ran the campaign saying Fretilin wins, Xanana wins", stated Mari Alkatiri.
The Fretilin leader said the response has been “revenge, hate”. "In such a way that to take revenge on me, it affects hundreds of people, families. If it's me, come and talk to me, you don't have to harm others, but this is a specific issue", he stated, referring to the Timorese Prime Minister, XAnana Gusmão. The fundamental issue, continued Maria Alkatiri, is “to have a sense of mission, a vision of the future and to have a common cause”.
"What is crucial is knowing all the money that was spent, what was done. A balance of collective and individual performance. When we were waging war, we knew what we wanted, to restore independence, 24 years after the restoration of independence we don't know where we are going", lamented the leader.
Mari Alkatiri also said he was “very concerned” about the report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), which warned on September 11 of the proliferation of criminal networks in Oecussi, a Timorese enclave on the Indonesian side of the island of Timor, highlighting that recent investigations show contamination of the region.
"It is already being absorbed by the mafia cartel, who are coming here in all their strength. We have closed kiosks and we think we are fighting the mafia. I am very worried," he said. For the future, Mari Alkatiri stated that he will continue to fight, but to “create critical mass”.
"My fight now is not the concern with electoral cycles, but how I can actually create a true critical mass in Timor-Leste. Let's end blindness, many of our academic intellectuals get pregnant through their ears, but they don't get pregnant", he highlighted.
The Fretilin leader also told everyone in his generation that it is time to put “egos” aside and start “thinking together”, highlighting that they have another five years to do so. “The next term of governance must be the product of understanding if we really want this country to move forward”, stated Mari Alkatiri, highlighting that the Timorese people deserve “much more and much better” than what has been given to date.</description><pubDate>2025-11-24 17:33:31</pubDate></item><item><title>Independence | Ramos-Horta: It is “thanks to Xanana” that Timor-Leste is here</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/11/23/independencia-ramos-horta-e-gracas-ao-xanana-que-timor-leste-esta-aqui/</link><description>The Timorese President, José Ramos-Horta, highlighted, in an interview with Lusa, the journey of the current prime minister and former leader of the residence, highlighting that it is “thanks to Xanana [Gusmão]” that Timor-Leste is here today.
“Xanana survived and with an impressive willpower, which few human beings can have, reorganizes the resistance, new attacks against the Indonesians”, said Ramos-Horta, in an interview with Lusa on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the declaration of independence, on November 28, 1975, remembering the attacks that the prime minister was the target of.
The Timorese leader lost men and suffered setbacks, but organized the clandestine network and resistance in the occupied cities. Xanana Gusmão was elected leader of the resistance and commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces for the National Liberation of Timor-Leste (FALINTL) in 1981, having launched the National Unity Policy, developed the Clandestine Front and established the National Council of Maubere Resistance, later named the National Council of Timorese Resistance.
"We reached the referendum in 1999 thanks to Xanana, not thanks to anyone else, obviously, the church got involved, because Xanana had the lucidity to talk to D. Martinho da Costa Lopes, abandon Marxism-Leninism. Thanks to Xanana that we are here today", stated the head of state.
Martinho da Costa Lopes was one of the most important figures in the Catholic Church in East Timor during the Indonesian occupation and played a central role in defending the human rights of the Timorese.
José Ramos-Horta also regretted that they now say that Xanana Gusmão is no longer the great man he was during the fight. "I say: gentlemen, now he was also the one who won the maritime border for us. I don't know who would win", he said, referring to the negotiation of maritime borders with Australia, concluded in 2018 and led by the current prime minister.
The President also highlighted that Xanana Gusmão was the one who took the historic decision to diversify from the Petroleum Fund in 2009, which “brought 11 billion dollars in return to Timor” and carried out the reconciliation, without persecution or judgment from anyone.
José Ramos-Horta also highlighted that it is Xanana Gusmão who “continues to have the technical competence” to discuss maritime borders with Indonesia, whose negotiation process began this year, as well as to resolve the Greater Sunrise issue, with the agreement expected to be signed at the beginning of next year.
"He wants to resolve all these issues before leaving power. He does not want to leave these very complex dossiers to the new generation", added the President.
Ideas and defenses
José Ramos-Horta stated that he was not in favor of the unilateral declaration of independence, on November 28, 1975, considering that it was made “hastily” given the imminent occupation by Indonesia.
"I was not in favor of the unilateral declaration of independence, I was, but it wasn't on November 28th. More preparation time was needed, because when you make a unilateral declaration of independence without any preparations, the result was what it was. There was no one. No one reacted", said Ramos-Horta, in an interview with Lusa on the occasion of the 50th anniversary.
On November 28, 1975, the current head of state recalls a ceremony without the presence of a “single global personality” and a dark night. "The unilateral declaration of independence was made hastily for reasons determined by the circumstances of the time. The fall of Atabae [municipio de Bobonaro]", said Ramos-Horta.
"The base fell with a large onslaught of regular Indonesian forces, already deep inside Timor-Leste. First Batugadé fell, that was in October, Balibó and Maliana fell, in October and Atabai, fell in the twenties of November. Soon after, Fretilin declared unilateral independence", explained the President.
The occupation by Indonesia took place on December 7, 1975. “Indonesian forces were already in the national territory before December 7 and the decision in Jakarta had been made in 1974 either Timor-Leste integrates into Indonesia peacefully through some pseudo-democratic act, or Timor-Leste would pass to Indonesian domination by force”, said the Timorese head of state.
The invasion is supported by the United States, Australia and some countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
"Obviously, in that context of 1975, the United States would not support Portugal on the issue of Timor-Leste. On the issue of Timor-Leste, Indonesia weighed more, especially in the post-Vietnam war context, in which the United States was discredited and fled. For the United States and for the countries in the region, the communist threat was real and Timor-Leste was isolated, abandoned", highlighted the Nobel Peace Prize winner.
The liberation of Timor-Leste took place on August 30, 1999, when the referendum for self-determination took place, which gave victory to independence, which would eventually take place on May 20, 2002, after a transitional administration by the United Nations.
“Twenty-four years later the country is freed against all the prophets of defeat, all those who preached realism to us, to me, some said atrocious unrealism, others said a lost cause, we heard a lot, including in Portugal”, added Ramos-Horta, highlighting that Timor-Leste managed to prevail.
Defense of the constitutional amendment
José Ramos-Horta defended, in the same interview, a constitutional amendment to adopt the presidential system in the country, because there is a need for “clear authority” and “without duality” and ruled out a re-candidacy for the position.
"I believe that we should make a constitutional amendment and move to the presidential system. The President is the executive, the so-called semi-presidentialism is over", said José Ramos-Horta, in an interview with Lusa as part of the 50th anniversary of the unilateral declaration of independence, on November 28, 1975.
Currently, Timor-Leste has a semi-presidential system with a parliamentary bias, with the Government emanating from parliament. According to the head of state, the system chosen in the Constitution, drawn up in 2001 and 2002, “has not been bad at all”, but it has been seen that instead of “instead of being a balancing factor”, it can be a “factor of instability”.
Ramos-Horta exemplified what happened in the eighth Government, after the coalition led by Xanana Gusmão won the legislative elections with an absolute majority. “Xanana is invited to form a Government, they presented the list of rulers and President Lu Olo decides to veto, he did not want to inaugurate nine members”, said the Nobel Peace Prize winner.
"It is necessary to have a clear authority and without this duality, to share power with the President. It doesn't work. It works well in Portugal", highlighted Ramos-Horta. For the Timorese President, “there is no reason” for Timor-Leste to have adopted that model, because “balance is the parliament, the judiciary”.
"These three bodies are the constitution of the State. I think everyone will agree", he said. José Ramos-Horta considered that “it is time”, after around 25 years of the current Constitution, to make “some amendments” and move to the presidential system.
"For me, Xanana Gusmão should continue. We reach 2027, my term ends, new elections in 2028. Between the period of 2027, in which I leave, and 2028, we actively work on a constitutional amendment so that the 2028 election is already based on the new Constitution, that is what I defend", he explained.
When asked by Lusa whether he did not intend to run for a new term, the President stated that he was not “at least motivated”. “I, in 2027, will go to the transition ceremony of the portfolio for the new President at midnight on May 19, 2027 and I won't even attend the ceremony on the 20th. I'm already in AeroDili on my way to Singapore”, he stated.
Problems of the new generation
In the same conversation, José Ramos-Horta also highlighted some of the country's current problems, namely the fact that the generation after 1975 has not yet found a leader with national affirmation. He highlighted that since 2002, members of this generation have held seats in the Government and parliament.
"The new generation has been there since 2002. The problem is that the new generation has not yet found a single person to assert themselves as a national leader. They have not yet appeared. That is the problem. They are in the Government, in the courts, in parliament, all new generations", said the President in an interview with Lusa on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the unilateral declaration of independence.
José Ramos-Horta also questioned who is the leader of the new generation that “has a national dimension”. “There is none, not one, because in a democracy you have to win the electorate”, he said, highlighting that a party is created and that party competes in the elections.
The head of state highlighted, however, that today Timor-Leste already has 210 doctorates and 1,700 masters, graduated from “good universities” and “there are people who know”. Timorese civil society has accused the current Timorese leadership, which continues to focus on figures from the resistance era, of creating obstacles to the emergence of new leaders with the capacity to respond to contemporary challenges.
Asked whether, after 50 years of the unilateral declaration of independence, the Timorese are reconciled, Ramos-Horta stated that among the “factions of [19]75 more than reconciled”. "Some have even died, the majority have died. There is no problem at all. When I see some brilliant being saying 'they are still the divisions of 75', you don't know that the majority have already died, only if they are the souls in the cemetery", said José Ramos-Horta.
According to the President, the divisions result from the democratic struggle. “I find it ridiculous, interesting, sometimes frustrating when I hear that the Timorese are divided,” said the President.
"Very well, let's all unite like it is done in North Korea, or rather, single party, single candidate, it is already known who wins the elections in North Korea, so there is not much headache, everything is simple, 97% votes for Kim Jong-un, then they do the recount and after all it was not 97%, but it was 101%. It's an option, then we are all united", joked Ramos-Horta.
But, he added, the Timorese chose democracy. "A democracy that is praised today and survives the wave of setbacks against democracy in Asia, Latin America, Africa and Europe. We are doing very well with democracy", he concluded.</description><pubDate>2025-11-23 18:59:26</pubDate></item><item><title>Cuca Roseta, fado singer: “Fado is samba-poetry sung from the heart”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/06/cuca-roseta-fadista-o-fado-e-um-samba-poesia-cantado-vindo-do-coracao/</link><description>During the pandemic, she sang for the Macau public through a video concert, but now, the fado singer gives her heart and soul to a concert with the Macau Chinese Orchestra, part of the lineup for the Macau International Music Festival, next Saturday, 11th. In an interview with HM, Cuca Roseta talks about the show's lineup, her 15-year career and the truth found in her compositions.
Performs in Macau on October 11th with the Macau Chinese Orchestra (OCM). Tell me a little about what we can expect from this show.
Yes, we are finally going to Macau. It will be the first time because we previously did a video concert for Macau during the pandemic, and we were unable to be there physically. We now work with OCM, which is very good, and I am happy with this partnership, for being able to unite, in some way, two cultures. We are a little anxious about that fact.
The concert will have songs such as “Meu”, “Preto e Branco”, “Canção do Mar”, “Não Sei de Onde” and “Finalmente”. What does this alignment bring us?
We already had arrangements made for orchestra by Marinho de Freitas, which are extraordinary arrangements, and which will be adapted to the traditional OCM instruments. These songs are practically all written by me, lyrics and music, and tell different stories, some that I have lived myself or stories that, in some way, I have experienced someone living very closely. They are original fados. “Canção do Mar” is very old and became known in the voices of Dulce Pontes and Amália Rodrigues, and has a new arrangement. We thought it would look beautiful with OCM. Of course, there are songs that we always sing and that never leave the repertoire, linked to traditional phases of my career. There are some songs that people like and request, but we bring a completely different repertoire to what we presented at the time [in Macau, with the video concert], which was very well received. It was a concert that went very well, even though it was via video, and we received wonderful messages.
This year he released the album “Até a Fé Se Esqueceu”, which has an exclusively Brazilian repertoire, with several names in Brazilian music, such as Seu Jorge or Zeca Pagodinho. Why explore this universe, mixing it with the language of Fado?
Yes, but this year I will also release a French album with Amália Rodrigues' agent, who invited me. But “Até a Fé Se Esqueceu” came from an invitation from a great Brazilian producer to record old sambas, which have a lot to do with Fado. Even though it's a Brazilian album, all sambas, it's my saddest album of all, the most melancholic. That's why we went looking for this root of samba to find great poets and great composers that Brazil has, and who have this weight that Fado also has.
As?
Fado has a lot to do with words and composition, in fact, Fado is samba-poetry sung from the heart, because there has to be this truth in the interpretation, the idea of ​​truth coming from life's experiences, in transforming the story it tells. This melancholy is in the veins of Portuguese blood and is mixed with art and music. This invitation wanted to put a fado singer to sing seriously and with the weight that Fado brings, and be able to interpret the great poets and sambas. The album [Até a Fé Se Esqueceu] has very old sambas, one of them from 1937. It is, therefore, a very strong and even very beautiful album, with great poems and composers, such as Tom Jobim, Vinicius de Morais, and wonderful partnerships with Seu Jorge and Zeca Pagodinho, who came to Fado. It's an album that made me really proud.

Therefore, it is possible to marry Fado with the joy of samba, which also has a melancholic side, right? Like the melancholy of our Fado.
In fact, when we hear the word samba we think of joy, but in fact the basis of samba is not joy. There is that phrase by Vinicius de Morais, “To make a samba beautifully you need a bit of sadness, otherwise you won’t make a samba”. So that's where the beauty of this work lies, which goes to the roots of samba and shows that there aren't that many differences between the melancholy at the root of samba and the melancholy of Fado. It's a nostalgic and melancholic album, it doesn't bring that joy. It can bring hope, and we can say that some themes bring with them this hope, which we find in Brazilian culture and drums. Because they literally put their sadness on the skirt wheel and on the drums, right? They transform sadness into dance and music, but in this work we don't see that type of samba.
Cuca also has a previous album, “Cabo Verde Nha Cretcheu”, so it can be said that she has explored, in her career, the different Portuguese-speaking sounds, going beyond Fado, mixing sounds?
This album didn't come from my will, and I think [it's a sign] that life takes me, deep down. This album was born from a tour I took across the nine islands of Cape Verde with a live recording of the mornas I sang on each island, as I sang the traditional mornas of each island. Between one island and another there are very different moraines. What I did was, after my Fado concerts, I sang two mornas and then we compiled all the songs in Creole in celebration of the fact that I was the first international artist to do the nine islands in a row. But I was also in Goa and did my concert in Concanim. I find it easy and enjoy learning the traditional songs of the countries where I am going to sing. I already sang in Moscow and learned a Russian song; I learned the songs of Goa, and in Georgia, in Tblisi, I also learned a song. It's a treat I make when I travel around the world taking Fado. But morna is wonderful and there really are similarities between this musical genre, and I wanted to bring this encounter between Fado and morna to Cape Verdeans, and this album came about, which is beautiful.
Once it goes to Macau, can we expect a song in Cantonese, or Mandarin?
Yes. By chance, I had already spoken to my manager to contact someone in this regard, so that we could discover a traditional song that I could learn.
Last year, he celebrated 15 years of career. How do you review your career, which began with the albums “Cuca Roseta” and “Raiz”?
In fact, it was great to celebrate 15 years at MEO Arena [the concert hall in Lisbon], and be able to revisit all the albums since the first. “Raiz” opened something that is rarer, which is the fado singer composing and writing her lyrics. This was a record that went wonderfully well and, from then on, it was good, because in this search for the truth that Fado has, being able to compose and write your own lyrics always means giving a little more of yourself. Each person composes and writes in their own way, and when they can do it, it is always a bit like the lines on the palm of their hand, that is, it is something unique. In this search that people make to follow standards to achieve success, I believe that success exists when we are not afraid to follow our voice and our instinct, what comes from our heart, tell our stories and sing our melodies without fear. In this way we end up becoming unique. Although it is not usual in Fado for a fado singer to compose and write, it was nice to see that my songs became important to many fans. Sometimes I have great composers and poets [to collaborate with me], but I think [writing and composing] brings out this side of the person being more truthful. My poems can never be compared to those of the great poets I have sung, but I think people feel that I am more in my own skin. In a way, this touches and moves them. Celebrating 15 years of career was the closing of a cycle and the beginning of another, and it was great to return to the “roots”, and realize that that was where the “gunpowder” lay, in the sense of not being afraid of ourselves.</description><pubDate>2025-10-06 05:24:32</pubDate></item><item><title>Piménio Ferreira: “Anti-gypsy rhetoric has always worked in Portugal”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2021/04/26/pimenio-ferreira-a-retorica-anti-cigana-sempre-funcionou-em-portugal/</link><description>Piménio Ferreira, better known as Gitelles Ferreira, anti-racist activist, 34 years old, physical engineer, Romani national. He is a man with a provocative speech, a corrosive, gentle humor and a smile that leaves no one indifferent.
Gitelles, we live in an intercultural land and gypsies – in particular – have lived in Portugal for around five centuries. What happens so that gypsy communities continue to be “on the margins” of so-called society? 
We need to change the model of society. This is extremely stratified, placing people in subordinate positions to privilege a violent minority. The white social structure is patriarchal and racist. What is called the ‘margin’ of society is in fact an intrinsic place within it, which belongs to it. In other words, gypsy people have been included in this model of society since they discovered Europe and its kingdoms. The problem is the model of society that is maintained and the place to which they were relegated and how they were relegated: with violence, in a status of inferiority compared to white people, without the right to human dignity, to found a family, to choose their own language and religion, expropriated of any and all cultural and material rights. A place built and maintained to this day by genocidal and ethnocidal violence and persecution. In 1463, Vasco Gitano was granted an estate. In 1521, the gitanos, or gypsies, were already used as a reference for everything that is considered bad in the model of society. The “counter-example” compared to white that would stand out in a positive way. The ‘angel’ and the ‘demon’; the ‘other’, the enemy; the one against whom any attack and persecution is legitimate. Including the prohibition of defending oneself, having weapons, any type of property, and the right to stay.
And is it because they are denied the right to stay that we still have nomadic gypsy communities within the country today?
Yes, without a doubt. There are many ways to force nomadism: directly, by prohibiting permanence and expelling with police or military force; indirectly, refusing public or private housing to Roma people, because they are Roma; and also through the gentrification process.
I read the results of a survey by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, where it is said that approximately 80% of Roma respondents live below the risk of poverty threshold in their country; one in three gypsies lives in a house without running water; one in three Roma belongs to a family in which someone went to bed hungry at least once in the previous month; and 50% of Roma aged between 6 and 24 do not attend school. Why does this happen like this? 
It is the historic persecution that continues. There is no impoverishment that does not have an external cause. In this case, a political system of total expropriation is imposed on the basis of violence. As early as 1648, D João IV, the Restorer, prohibited ‘giving or renting houses to gypsies’. The same D João IV who achieved the kingdom of Portugal thanks to D. Jerónimo da Costa and his 250 Knights. The same D. Jerónimo da Costa who died defending Portugal's independence from Castile. Gypsy, like his wife and children. Among prohibitions on permanence, “that gypsies do not enter the kingdom and those who are in it leave” (D João III, 1526), ​​with expulsions, banishment to the galleys, expropriation of goods and properties, imposed with penalties of flogging, mutilation and death, systematically carried out to this day (even in 2011 the Municipal Council of Faro wanted to ban gypsies in the municipality).
The prohibition of working for others (no one employs gypsy workers, and those who do do so in complete precariousness, for poorly paid positions and without rights and dignified conditions). They are unable to remain dependent on self-employment, they are unable to invest, due to extreme expropriation. They become dependent on precariousness. If you want to know what it's like to live in pure neoliberalism, get to know the lives of gypsies. The reality of these is paradigmatic of the aggression and lack of protection that the “lords” are willing to go to, for their own benefit.
The gentlemen we are talking about, is it economic and political power?
The group of political, social, cultural and economic power. The owner, the colonizer. This group has been in power since it instituted the current system of domination. And that only makes sense within the hierarchically stratified sociopolitical model in which we live. Hence the need to put an end to ‘lords’ and establish a new model of society, healthy, free, without hierarchies or strata, whether of race, class or gender.
The model in which we live leads the gypsy community (and beyond) to economic exclusion, removing them from access to the consumption of products or excluding them from their production process; political exclusion associated with lack of access to information; to education and consequently the social exclusion seen in the inequality of access to quality community areas such as restaurants, libraries, theater, cinema, concerts, healthcare, etc. How does a gypsy child feel when they realize they are not part of the whole? Children who never see themselves represented, not in films, not in books, not in cartoons, not even in an advertisement eating cereal, for example? Is this a disaster for self-esteem, is it a priori condemnation?
That's really the question. Gypsy people are not “excluded from society”, on the contrary, they are included in it. The problem is the existence of what is cynically called 'social exclusion', an Orwellian term, and people are under duress. Which concentration and extermination camp. In fact, the Nazi concentration camps are a more visual embodiment of what is called 'social exclusion' and, as here, they were not an 'excluded' part of Nazi society, but rather its fundamental and characterizing structure. It is a place of violence, where people are kept by violence, dedicated to their extermination, and designed so that few people can leave. And yet they resist. Just like in the Nazi concentration camps.
And what you listed as an example of the ‘consequence’ of this ‘exclusion’, is in fact the means by which this exclusion also happens and is maintained. Gypsy people are outside the cinemas, either as consumers or producers (but they go to the cinema). They are outside of school, education and the Academy. Either as ‘users’ or as producers (but they go to school and are at the basis of the construction of knowledge and academic and scientific debates).
Even in the attack on the gypsy child's self-confidence, we speak of a mechanism for maintaining this situation. But gypsy people respond very well: with gypsy pride. Another resistance, another aggression. Gypsy people are thus included in society. In a place that belongs to this modern model of society. And they resist and counter the power of domination and insist on being in the city, in the cinema, in the theater, in the Academy, in all spaces. With a lot of struggle and always resisting, but they are there. Social exclusion, more than a “place outside of society”, is part of its social structure.
Do you mean to say there is collective resistance?
At work, already in a context of absolute precariousness, during the pandemic, gypsy people rolled up their sleeves and once again showed proactivity and creativity in adversity. They learned by watching and doing. And here, it is again women who jump to the front line, show their face, learn how to use digital tools with their daughters or sons, and launch themselves into the network. And so they explore online sales as well as app-based work (transport or couriers). In housing, in a pandemic context in which evictions were not stopped – as the law itself should and dictates – residents did not stop organizing and fighting against unfair evictions and demanding dignity in housing; residents associations allied in their action with other housing and anti-racist organizations.
It is also worth noting how they reinvented themselves and intensified to collect and distribute food items and mask/alcohol gel kits to the most expropriated people. Gypsies and non-gypsies. In the anti-racist fight, new movements emerged and their actions intensified through social media. People who had never organized or become active before began their first steps in activism, joining this path of gypsy and anti-racist organization and popular action. People forget, or don't want to appreciate, but gypsy action has helped to determine results in the political dispute. Gypsy citizens mobilized in large numbers and determined electoral results in the 2017 local councils, both in Alentejo and in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area, even causing electoral earthquakes.
And even in the Presidential elections, second place was decided by an amount equivalent to the estimated number of gypsy voters. Apart from the non-gypsy votes that were mobilized by the action of gypsy voters. Gypsy people are even co-building power in opinion spaces, in local media, on social networks and in party and institutional political disputes. And most importantly, in popular action and in alliances with other social movements. We never stopped fighting by all means and we continued to resist.
On the other hand, there is more and more hate speech, from the far right in particular. What do you have to say about that?
To begin with, these speeches are historical and European. They are neither current nor “extreme right-wing”. These speeches have been adopted and delivered for a long time, even in 'democracy and freedom', by various representatives of the center-right, conservatives, center-left, liberals, liberal left, even representatives of the PCP. Anti-gypsy rhetoric has always worked in Portugal, as it is the most white-natured rhetoric. That is, it allows the creation and recognition of “white” as the superior of all. And thus please the white electorate who, when they feel good, compensate with their vote. Even if the policies implemented by your elected officials harm you even more.
Finally, I would like you to talk a little about your personal experience and how you became an activist?
I studied, fought for my studies, made alliances, graduated, and entered the “formal precarious” job market. I started my militant action and here I am today. We can transform this society into a better one. This certainty, combined with the fact that the current one has so much suffering, makes anyone want to have a transformative attitude. I wanted to be an ‘inventor’ (physical engineer) and an anti-racist activist. And through study (not necessarily schooling) and organization with other people, in turn, with other studies, training and visions, I learned how the world works and how it can be changed. But before transforming, we need to survive.
This gives rise to two types of actions: transformative and survival. The fight against hate speech appears as survival, but its defeat will be a transformative victory. There is a lot that – as people who want a better world – we have to do, namely work to criminalize hate speech; condemn and ban organizations with racist speeches and practices; denounce the racist institutional structure and logic that organizes Power and manages community resources. And in this sense, there have been various types of actions, from petitions to demonstrations. And we need more.
In addition to being a member of the SOS RACISMO movement, I participate in the Podcast “Viemos Para Ficar”, with Mamadou Ba and Joseph da Silva. And if everything goes well, we will soon start a new project. With friendly people, we also have the “Cigana Initiative” project, dedicated to reflecting and promoting transformative movements. Essentially focused on educating against anti-gypsyism, denouncing historical and ongoing genocide and working towards a new societal project. Also with new projects in the pipeline. And finally, there are always voluntary actions, without an organization, where I try to share what I discovered about Anti-Gypsyism and Romani history in schools and with interested people. In addition, there is still the struggle for housing, because evictions did not stop during the pandemic. Due to housing and employment precariousness, racialized individuals, especially Roma nationals, are the most vulnerable to Covid-19. It is essential to have actions in this area; Of all the struggles, this is the most structural, as it goes against one of the main enemies of a healthy society: the real estate speculation of this capitalist system, which puts profit and goods above people and their humanization.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>GP | Unanimity regarding “Super Pole” in GT</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/05/gp-unanimidade-quanto-a-super-pole-nos-gt/</link><description>The International Automobile Federation (FIA) should continue to focus on the “Super Pole” system for the ninth FIA GT World Cup, if this race is once again included in the program of the 73rd Macau Grand Prix next year
For the first time, in last November's edition, the ten fastest in Qualifying 1 had 20 minutes to prepare for the first “Super Pole” in the history of the FIA ​​GT World Cup, in which, in reverse order of times, each driver entered the track alone for one out lap, two timed laps and one return lap, with one-minute intervals between competitors and the possibility of using a new set of tires. The best time obtained between the two timed laps determined Qualification 2 “Super Pole”, which defined the starting grid for the Classified Race.
Following the success of this initiative, the international federation intends to continue applying it in the Macau GT Cup – FIA GT World Cup, having even produced a promotional video to confirm this. Lutz Leif Linden, President of the GT Commission and the FIA ​​Constructors' Commission, admits that this is something “very exciting for the spectators as well as the drivers”.
Present in Macau during the Grand Prix, the influential Stéphane Ratel, CEO of SRO Motorsports Group, co-organizer of the Macau GT Cup – FIA GT World Cup, also agrees with the measure, highlighting that it represents "an additional challenge and one that works. At SRO we do this on a global level. In the biggest events, like the 24 Hours of Spa, we have a 'Super Pole', and it is something we like."
Riders and brands agree
Drivers and brands were equally impressed with this first experience on the territory's streets. “Macau is already special and I think that, with this format, we had something even more special”, recalled Antonio Fuoco, the driver who gave Ferrari its first in Macau since 1995.
Ferdinando Cannizzo, head of Ferrari's Competizioni GT, reinforces the idea, highlighting the technical advantage when the challenge comes down to the driver and the circuit, without external interference. “Without cars, without traffic, you can really focus on your strengths and try to maximize the car’s performance”, said the Cavallino Rampante brand representative.
This qualification system, an important moment of the weekend given the difficulty of overtaking on the Guia Circuit, also adds an element of uncertainty and elevates the spectacle. Stefan Gugger, responsible for the development of Lamborghini's competition cars, said that, in his opinion, "it's an improvement for our fans. We can really see the performance of the driver and the car, which also represents a good challenge for the team."
Porsche, one of the brands that most advocated the mandatory introduction of expensive torque sensors in this race, was also one of the main drivers of the “Super Pole”. “I believe the new format is a real step forward,” said Thomas Laudenbach, Vice President of Porsche Motorsport. "It allows the drivers to have clean laps. It's a great step in the right direction, maybe with some tuning, but overall for me it's positive. I hope they maintain this format because it's fantastic."
Meanwhile, the date of the 2026 edition of the Macau Grand Prix is ​​expected to be confirmed next week, during the FIA ​​World Council, which will take place before the FIA ​​awards ceremony for 2025, in the city of Tashkent, Uzbekistan.</description><pubDate>2025-12-05 01:52:45</pubDate></item><item><title>GP | FIA will continue to invest in Formula Regional in Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/11/24/gp-fia-vai-continuar-a-apostar-na-formula-regional-em-macau/</link><description>The fact that the FIA ​​switched from Formula 3 to Formula Regional (FR) continues to be a recurring theme when the topic is the Macau Grand Prix. Although the show's premier race did not disappoint in this year's edition, somewhat erasing the bad image left last year, there is still a widespread feeling that the international federation deprived the Grand Prix of its favorite race.
At the end of the 72nd edition, the Coordinator of the Organizing Committee of the Macau Grand Prix, Lei Si Leng, when questioned again by the local press about a possible return of Formula 3, stated that the organization will continue to cooperate with the FIA ​​to choose the races that best suit Macau. At the same time, the director of the Macau Sports Institute left the guarantee that the plan involves continuing to receive drivers of training age and who assert themselves as the future of motorsport.
“We have been communicating closely with the FIA ​​to find out which races can be held in Macau and the FIA ​​has selected the best drivers to come and compete here”, he said, adding that he hopes “that the best drivers can come to Macau and that we continue to collaborate with the FIA ​​to organize the most suitable races for Macau”.
On the FIA ​​side, there is the conviction that FR is the discipline that best adapts to the characteristics of the Guia Circuit, a layout that remains practically unchanged after seven decades of existence. The discontent that still exists is considered natural. “Motor sport is traditional, and I don't remember any change that was well received at the beginning, even good changes” admitted Emanuele Pirro, the current president of the FIA ​​Single Seater Commission, in conversation with journalists in Macau.
The former Italian driver, a connoisseur of the Guia Circuit and winner of the Guia Race with BMW, took advantage of his time in the Macao SAR to remember that “if we look at the history of Macau, it started with Formula 2, or Formula Pacific, and then moved on to Formula 3. In 1984, a journalist could have asked: 'why don't we race in Formula 2 anymore?' I think it's inevitable. Everything has a price. For us to have the privilege of having a circuit that has remained unchanged since Throughout its history, the price to pay is to use cars that continue to be reasonably safe. And I think Formula Regional offers a good balance in terms of speed.”
In a rare interview with the specialized magazine INSIDE, the former coordinator of the Grand Prix, José Manuel Costa Antunes, warned against letting the level of the race drop. "Today, with the transition to Formula Regional and Formula 4, which is not a problem, they are just different cars, we see more inexperienced drivers", said the man who was at the helm of the event for the longest time, touching on a sensitive topic: "Some people can simply buy a seat. That is worrying. As fans, we want real races, not red flags. We owe it to the history of the Grand Prix to recover that selection process, to ensure that only the best compete here."
Numbers support the decision
Looking at the time sheets, it can be concluded that the records for the main FR race were around 2m16s, around ten seconds slower than the times recorded in the last year of the FIA F3 single-seaters, in 2023. In historical terms, these times place the FR cars on a level similar to that of the Formula 3 cars of the late 1990s. However, from a safety point of view, the speeds reached in the “Sprint” for Curva Lisboa continues to be the main concern since Sophia Flörsch’s accident in 2018. With the suction cone, speeds above 290 km/h were common in 2023 with the Dallara F3, but the change to FR cars reduced these values to around 260 km/h.
In 2026, the new Formula Regional car, the Tatuus T-326, is expected to arrive in Macau, which is equipped with a three-cylinder, 1.6-liter Toyota ATM163T engine, prepared by Autotecnica Motori, which is more powerful and efficient. The chassis was designed according to the latest FIA specifications, in order to provide improvements in terms of performance, safety and aerodynamics, facilitating overtaking and promoting more lively racing. However, although lap times are expected to drop again, top speeds will probably not be dramatically higher.
It should be noted that the change to FR was not motivated solely by security concerns. When the FIA ​​granted Formula One Management (FOM) the commercial and promotional rights for Formula 3, the territory's race became a non-championship race of an international competition, limited to the participation of the same teams that competed in the championship. This change was received unfavorably by the promoter himself, as he never played a truly intervening role within the Grand Prix. Furthermore, holding the race in Macau, in November, involved particularly demanding logistics, with a negative impact on the planning and execution of pre-season tests.</description><pubDate>2025-11-24 05:37:32</pubDate></item><item><title>GP | Date and two competitions confirmed</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/12/gp-data-e-duas-competicoes-confirmadas/</link><description>The final meeting of the 2025 FIA World Motor Sport Council took place last Wednesday, during FIA General Assembly Week, in Tashkent, Uzbekistan. The session was attended by delegates from the various National Sports Authorities (ASNs), from which important decisions were taken, some of which concern Macau
The date of the 73rd Macau Grand Prix has been officially revealed, confirming that the Macao SAR's biggest annual sporting event will take place from 19 to 22 November next year. The international federation also took the opportunity to announce that the date and location of the ninth edition of the FIA ​​GT World Cup, which has been contested at the Guia Circuit since its creation, as part of the Grand Prix program, have been approved by the GT Commission. The same entity did not reveal the guidelines for next year's race, which in this year's edition only featured sixteen competitors, but this is the first time it has confirmed it so early.
For its part, the Touring Car Commission confirmed the calendar for the next season of the Kumho TCR World Tour, which will once again conclude at the Guia Circuit, as in previous years. China's strong presence on the calendar stands out: the Macau and Zhuzhou races are joined by an absolute debut, the new Chengdu Tianfu International Circuit. With eight events – one in Mexico and three in Europe, including the visit to the Vila Real International Circuit -, Asia gains new weight with a total of four rounds.
Four of the 2026 Kumho TCR World Tour events will maintain the traditional two-race format, including Macau, while the remaining four – Mexico, Spain (Valencia), South Korea (Inje) and China (Chengdu) – will adopt the three-race-per-weekend format introduced last year, reaching a total of twenty races in the season.
The FIA ​​World Motor Sport Council has not publicly commented on the continuation, or not, of the Formula Regional (FR) and Formula 4 World Cups in the Macau Grand Prix program, even though the latter's project, which also involves the Chinese promoter Mintime and the Fédération Française du Sport Automobile (FFSA), was designed for three years.
Also bet on karting
The World Council also approved the regulations that support the expansion of Karting under the supervision of the FIA, at a time when the next phase of implementation of the “Global Karting Plan” begins, which, next year, will integrate new “Arrive &amp; Drive” championships, included in one of the most extensive calendars ever.
Following the auspicious start of the FIA ​​“Arrive &amp; Drive” Karting World Cup, held in Malaysia last month, the innovative format will be expanded with new continental championships, bringing these accessible and affordable events closer to communities around the world. The 2026 calendar, already approved, will feature a European Championship and an Asia-Pacific Championship, each consisting of three rounds, the winners of which will secure a place on the 2026 FIA “Arrive &amp; Drive” Karting World Cup grid, to be contested at the end of the season.
The Coloane Kart Track, still one of the most modern in Southeast Asia, will be part of this first edition of the “Arrive &amp; Drive” Asia-Pacific Championship, hosting the inaugural race on the weekend of June 20th and 21st. The calendar of this low-cost competition also includes two other stages: one in Zhuzhou, in Hunan Province, and another in Madras, India.</description><pubDate>2025-12-12 01:19:59</pubDate></item><item><title>Macau | Rosa Mota in second place in the minimarathon</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/09/macau-rosa-mota-em-segundo-lugar-na-minimaratona/</link><description>The Portuguese Rosa Mota came second on Sunday in the Macau mini-marathon, a 4.5-kilometer race that is part of the International Marathon in the Chinese region. The 67-year-old former Olympic champion finished the race in 17 minutes and 10 seconds, 54 seconds more than the first, local athlete Kin I Chao.
In February, the Portuguese woman was discharged from hospital, following a planned surgical intervention, after overcoming a “serious problem”, a “dissecting aortic aneurysm”. Rosa Mota, born in Porto, was Olympic marathon champion at the Seoul Olympic Games in 1988, after having won bronze in Los Angeles in 1984. Her achievements also include three European titles (1982, 1986 and 1990) and one world title (1987).
She is still the national marathon record holder, with a time of 02.23.29 hours, a mark achieved in Chicago in 1985. In recent years, Rosa Mota had reappeared at the highest level and won several veteran races, having set in Barcelona, ​​in 2024, the world half-marathon record (1:24.27 hours), for the 65 to 69 age group.
Also last year, the Portuguese won the Macau mini-marathon, repeating the triumphs in 2018, 2019 and 2023. This year, the organization invited several athletes, nominated by the Association of Portuguese Language Olympic Committees (ACOLOP), from Portugal, Angola, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, São Tomé and Príncipe, Sri Lanka and the state of Goa (India).
Lusophony highlighted
Lusophones were in the spotlight in the half-marathon, with Cape Verdean Samuel Freire, from Sporting Clube de Portugal, finishing third in the men's race, behind winner Martin Ndungu and David Kipkorir Rono, both Kenyans.
In fourth place came the Portuguese Fábio Oliveira, 30th in the marathon of the first edition of the European Road Championships, in April, and part of the Portugal team that finished in fourth place. Soon after came the young Mozambican Pinto Victor Jequecene, aged 22, while Angolan David Jundo Elias finished in seventh place.
In the women's race, Angolan Lúcia Kawele Capingala came in third place, behind the winner, Kenyan Lucy Ndambuki, and Chinese Na Zhao. Already off the podium, in fourth position, finished the young Portuguese Joana Ferreira, who won the silver medal in the under-23 race of the national athletics championships in 10 thousand meters, in May.
Mozambican Domingas Ernesto Checane came in sixth place. Around 12 thousand participants signed up for the three races of the Macau International Marathon, with the title of the premier race going to Kenyan Victor Kipchirchir and Ethiopian Senay Mastewal Birhanu.
In addition to his triumph, Kipchirchir broke the Macau marathon record, finishing in two hours, nine minutes and 27 seconds, 34 seconds less than the previous record, set in 2017 by Ethiopian Felix Kiptoo Kirwa.</description><pubDate>2025-12-09 03:18:38</pubDate></item><item><title>Motorsport | GP will continue on the TCR World Tour in 2026</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/11/19/automobilismo-gp-continuara-no-tcr-world-tour-em-2026/</link><description>The Macau Grand Prix will once again be part of the Kumho FIA TCR World Tour calendar next season and, once again, as the season-ending event of a competition that will increase its presence in Asia in 2026
Marcelo Lotti, president of the WSC Group, confirmed to the press, during the weekend of the 72nd Macau Grand Prix, that next year's calendar should include a race in South Korea – home country of the tire brand and championship sponsor, Kumho, as well as Hyundai, the brand with the most cars on the starting grids of the world competition -, a second race in the People's Republic of China and the traditional end-of-season round at the Guia Circuit.
To increase the presence on the Asian continent, without affecting the teams' budgets, Australia will be left out of the calendar. The championship promoter will also not move forward with the possibility of organizing a second race on the American continent, with a visit to Mexico being a certainty. Already on the “old continent”, the Kumho FIA TCR World Tour will maintain its three events, with the Portuguese city circuit of Vila Real hosting one of these events in July.
For Marcello Lotti, “the Macau Grand Prix is ​​our equivalent to Monaco”, and for the Italian businessman, “all championships need an event like this”. Despite the smaller number of entrants that this year's event gathered in the territory, “leaving Macau is obviously out of the question”.
The 2026 Kumho FIA TCR World Tour season calendar is expected to be revealed to the public on December 13, when the FIA ​​World Council meets in Tashkent, Republic of Uzbekistan, at the same time as the FIA's annual awards ceremony.
Number questions
The list of participants for the Guia Race Macau – Kumho FIA TCR World Tour Event of Macau had only seventeen of the twenty-four cars initially registered. This would have been one of the smallest starting grids ever for the highly popular Guia Race, whose first edition took place in 1972. In part, this number below expectations was due to the absence, for unknown reasons, of teams and drivers from TCR China, one of the strongest national tourism championships in the world.
Meanwhile, Marcello Lotti said during the Grand Prix weekend that TCR is preparing to welcome a new brand to the championship. However, this announcement, scheduled for next Friday, is not expected to have an impact on the starting grids of the Kumho FIA TCR World Tour, as it will be a car group that already has a presence in the championship and will replace one of its brands with another. The Italian businessman also said he was in negotiations with a second brand.
Asia's influence on today's biggest Touring Car championship is not just limited to the Koreans from Kumho and Hyundai, as the competition also features the Chinese brand Link &amp; Co, at an official level, and the Japanese counterpart Honda. At a time when electric cars, SUVs and city cars are the focus of big brands, Asian manufacturers are still among the few that invest in cars, with fuel engines, with dimensions suitable for Touring events.</description><pubDate>2025-11-19 01:34:35</pubDate></item><item><title>Roadsport | Badaraco took the podium on his birthday, but ended up penalized</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/11/17/roadsport-badaraco-subiu-ao-podio-em-dia-de-aniversario-mas-acabou-penalizado/</link><description>On his birthday, Badaraco recovered from 17th to reach second place on the podium. Hours after the party, the bad news arrived, with a penalty relegating him to 15th. Rui Valente was placed off the track, after recovering several positions
On his birthday, Jerónimo Badaraco climbed to second place on the podium of the Roadsport Challenge race, after starting from 17th. However, the worst came later, when the top three, all local drivers, were penalized and relegated in the general classification, for overtaking other cars that had lost their way before the starting line, after the safety car had left.
The Macanese driver had a setback when he was relegated to 15th, after an almost perfect race: “It was very unfair and I think the stewards don't know what they are doing”, said Jerónimo. "I think the decision was not transparent. After the safety car came out, several drivers hit the barriers... of course we thought they weren't going to continue in the race after those crashes and we had to overtake them", he explained. “And even if we had stopped or slowed down in the face of these drivers' missteps, we would have created a much more dangerous situation for everyone, because the cars behind us would have been surprised by our braking, meaning there would have been more accidents”, he explained.
Even so, the Macanese assured HM that the penalty would not ruin his day: “I will continue to enjoy the day, I went up to the podium, drank the champagne, took the photos… More cup, less cup, I will continue to celebrate”, he guaranteed with a laugh.
Hours earlier, Badaraco had already explained that reaching the podium in Guia “is a different feeling” that justifies “80 percent” his choice to drive 26 years ago.
The driver was also satisfied with the race, considering that no one can take away the merit of what he achieved on the track, as he rose from 17th to 2nd: "Before the race I thought a lot about how I was going to approach the start, to recover positions, and I was confident of a good result. The most important thing was not to have given up, after qualifying, and not to have stopped believing that it was possible to reach the podium", explained the Macanese driver. “I know that the Guia Circuit always has a lot of changes throughout the race, there are a lot of safety cars and yellow flags, and I knew I had the experience, and also the calm, to be able to take advantage of the opportunities”, he highlighted.
“They ruined my race”
In turn, Rui Valente gave up and appeared disappointed, due to what he considered to be an excess on the part of the driver who tried to overtake him on the inside, on the curve leading to the São Francisco road. "I don't know what was going through the driver's head who tried to overtake me. I can't understand how he saw a space that simply didn't exist!", said Valente. "I was put out of the race. When I tried to make the turn, he touched me and that was it, my rear end was damaged and I had to go back to the pits to retire", he reported.
When the crash occurred that ended the race, Valente was circulating in the top 10, even after a less successful start, following the exit of the first Safety Car. Despite this aspect, the Macanese came to believe that it was possible to achieve a result in the top five: “I had a good pace, I was confident and I think I would achieve a result in the top five... It's the races...”, he lamented.
The Macanese also took stock of a “complicated” weekend in which he was also involved in another accident during the free practice session. "To be honest, it wasn't one of the weekends I had the most fun in Macau. I had that first touch, which conditioned my qualifying. In the race I actually did well, gaining positions, but they put me off the track...", he highlighted.
At 64 years old, Rui Valente now admits that he may be left out of the next edition of the Grand Prix: “With such a difficult qualifying model for Macau and then with races with so many accidents, I will consider what to do in the future”, he confessed. “I don't want to sit still, I want to stay active and involved in different activities, so if I find an activity that occupies me and makes me feel good, maybe I'll stay out of racing next year”, he said.
