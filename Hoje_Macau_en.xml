Alongside Rita Santos, she also leader of ATFPM, the deputy asked the chief executive to pay more attention to the employment issue in Macau, noting that the lack of opportunities is general, not just for the Portuguese.
“It is becoming harder and harder for people who do not dominate the Chinese language to find a job. It seems to me a transverse issue that affects all people from Macao, especially the younger ones. We have [at ATFPM], curricula of people who have not been able to find a job for over two years, ”said Coutinho.
The deputy and associative manager highlighted the lack of employment in the area of ​​law for Portuguese citizens. “It is not easy for Portuguese citizens who want to come to Macao to find a job. We have cases of residents who came back after studying right, could not find work and then were forced to return to Portugal to do the internship. The economic and employment situation in Macau is serious and must be resolved with concrete and effective measures in order to reactivate the economy. ”
Moreover, Rita Santos and José Pereira Coutinho confirmed that they did not address the Portuguese's difficulty in obtaining the resident identity card (BIR), because "this is a very complex question and the chief executive knows what to do, this issue is not forgotten."
Increase to 97 patacas
Moreover, the meeting served to request wage increases in the civil service, so that this year, the value of each point of the Indian table is high from 94 patacas to 97 patacas. “Sam Hou Fai said to wait. We will see what arises in the LAG report, because other associations will be heard that may even be against salary update. You never know what others think, but from our part we insist that the chief executive do something about the updating of salaries, ”explained Coutinho.
ATFPM submitted a written document with all the suggestions that was the result of the participation of 19,300 members and “about 50,000 residents”, explains in a note. In this statement, it is described that "the prices of essential goods in Macau have recorded a constant increase, resulting in a significant decrease in resident purchasing power."
The two ATFPM officials also addressed the meeting the need for greater and better use of the Portuguese language by the Executive, regarding the reception of a letter, only in Chinese, the Directorate of Services for Labor Affairs (DSAL), about the departure of teachers from the Portuguese School of Macao.
“I insisted that the Portuguese language should have a high level of use, as there is a lack of language dissemination on several government websites and in the press release, as they are first sent in Chinese. Some signs also do not respect the Portuguese language well. We proposed to subsidize workers who dominate the two languages ​​so that they can play a better role, ”said Rita Santos.</description><pubDate>2025-02-27 02:08:22</pubDate></item><item><title>Transmac | “Deepseek” introduced in company functions</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/27/transmac-deepseek-introduzida-em-funcoes-da-empresa/</link><description>Transmac bus operator will use the “Deepseek” platform, Chinese Artificial Intelligence (AI) tool to improve help in various company management and maintenance operations.

This time, it is up to sculptor Cristina Leiria, author of the project of the Kun Iam Ecumenical Center, to organize the visit
 
Saturday is the day of another edition of the initiative “Tours with History”, organized by the Rui Cunha Foundation (FRC), which promotes guided tours, in Portuguese and English, to Macao places with historical and cultural interest. This time the tour starts at 3 pm to the Kun Iam Ecumenical Center, and is led by Portuguese architect and sculptor Cristina Leiria, author of the original project inaugurated on March 21, 1999, recently renewed and reopened on December 11, 2024.
The Kun Iam Ecumenical Center was a project designed by the author, with the support of UNESCO, “aiming to perpetuate mutual respect and friendship between all peoples and civilizations,” according to the IC official page. The public art complex measures 32 meters high in total, 20 of which refer to the bronze statue of the goddess Kun Iam, which weighs 50 tons.
“The base of the statue, in the form of lotus flower, consists of the contemplation room where one can rest, listen to music and read. In the decoration of the summit the artists of Macau, Kwok Woon and Joana Ling painted, on rice paper, figures, symbols and texts related to Lao Tse, Confucius, Mence and Buddha, ”says IC information.
The lower floor offers a multipurpose room, with a capacity of 50 people, dedicated to concerts, conferences, movie viewing and other multicultural activities, such as art exhibitions.
Active exposure
Currently, there is the individual exhibition of Cristina Leiria, “moments of light with kun iam”, at the invitation of the IC to mark the conclusion of the restoration and conversion work in a multipurpose cultural tourism space, 25 years after the author's presence at its inauguration. The show, which extends until March 13, displays statues of the goddess Kun Iam and other associated works, in materials such as Jade, Crystal, Wood or Brushed Steel, and is complemented by images and videos that portray the process of design and construction of the ecumenical center, making known to the public behind the scenes of your planning and building.
Born in Lisbon on April 25, 1946, Cristina Rocha Leiria lived in Mozambique between both and 17, when he returned to study architecture at the Higher School of Fine Arts, and later took a specialization course at University College in London. He deepened studies on Feng Shui, in Macao, China and Japan, and electromagnetism in France, having exercised in such different places as the United Kingdom, Mozambique, Rhodesia, South Africa, Portugal and Macao.
The construction of the Kun Iam Ecumenical Center was a challenge launched by the then governor of Macao, Vasco Rocha Vieira (recently deceased), which is a space where silence has a place to exist in a specific place. The statue dedicated to the goddess Kun Iam is 20 meters high and is made of bronze, having plenty of spiritual meaning for most Orientals.</description><pubDate>2025-02-27 01:57:11</pubDate></item><item><title>Firefighters | Investigated for falsifying attendance records</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/27/bombeiros-investigado-por-falsificar-registos-de-assiduidade/</link><description>A head of an operational station is being investigated for leaving Macao at the same time as it sting the point and said it was working
 
The Public Prosecution Service (MP) is investigating a head of an Operational Post of the Fire Department (CB) for the crime of “falsification committed by an employee”, which may entail a five -year imprisonment. The information was released yesterday by the Commissioner Against Corruption (CCAC), who conducted a preliminary investigation.
According to CCAC, the investigation took place due to a complaint, received last year about the attendance of the head of the operational post, who despite chopping the point was absent from work.
Following the investigations, the CCAC concluded that "the chief in question was absent from the region twice, between December 2023 and May 2024, during the time of service or during the complementary work period." In addition, on three other occasions "he was absent from the operational post for more than an hour," then returning only to "chop up the point, falsely claiming that during the periods concerned, he was providing complementary work."
From the perspective of CCAC, this conduct of the Firefighter had the “intention to hide false situations of comparison to the service”. The head of the post risks responding criminal for the crime of forgery committed by an employee, who has a penalty expected from one year to five years in prison. If the final penalty applied is less than three years may be suspended.
In addition to criminal investigation, the CCAC has reported that succeeded to the Fire Department “for proper follow -up”, which should mean the existence of an internal disciplinary proceedings. In the statement, the CCAC also warned “the civil service workers” to be “aware and comply with the law”, having requested more rigor in the self -discipline of the “agents of authority”.
General concerns
In turn, the CB issued a statement to declare it to be "very concerned about the incident" and revealed that it "immediately instituted a disciplinary proceedings against the offender."
In addition to accompanying the case of the firefighter, the internal supervision instructions were also updated and there will be an “exhaustive review of the procedures and advisory control guidelines” to avoid similar cases.
This is not the first case of falsification of attendance in recent years by security workers. In 2023, another CCAC investigation concluded that the chief of a customs post and six subordinates had falsified the attendance records to avoid penalties for early delays or exits from work.
The case, which also began from a complaint, was more elaborate than presented yesterday, since it involved the duplication of the presence cards, so that the point could be bitten by other employees.</description><pubDate>2025-02-27 01:30:02</pubDate></item><item><title>IC | Suspended filming that caused 12 people running over</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/27/ic-suspensas-filmagens-que-causaram-atropelamento-de-12-pessoas/</link><description>The Cultural Institute considers that the conduct of the producers has undergone public order, safety and tranquility, after being ignored by the authorities not to record a scene with a car circulating at high speed
 
The Cultural Institute (IC) announced the suspension of the license attributed to the recording of a film in the territory that resulted in the run over 12 people. The case happened on Monday, when a scene with a car at high speed was being filmed on the seminary street. The production team responsible for the film was accused of not following guidelines from the Public Security Police Corps (CPSP).

And in a meeting prior to filming, such as different services, it will have informed producers who could not record scenes with high speed cars at that place: “At the meeting [authorization approval], the competent services have expressly expressed that this place is unable to filming the vehicle to the drift. Representatives of the filming entity learned of opinion of approval services, ”was reported.

The financial reserve earned 22.2 billion patacas in 2023, after losing this value almost four times the previous year.
The value of the reserve was 616.2 billion patacas at the end of December, according to data published in the Macao Official Bulletin. Still, the value remains away from the record of 663.6 billion patacas reached in February 2021, in the middle of the pandemic.

In the book “The Legal Status of the Financial Action Task Force in the International Legal System”, the jurist discusses the undefined legal status of the body that got great power worldwide
 
What are the main reasons for the creation of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF)?
The FATF emerges within the scope of the G7 in July 1989, largely at the United States of America (US), to respond to the crime of laundering of capital trafficking and the United Nations Convention against illicit trafficking and psychotropic substances of 1988. Common guidelines and the coordination of preventive measures, especially in the financial scope and international cooperation. 40 international recommendations were elaborated against the laundering of capital ”. Today FAFT has 40 members, 38 jurisdictions, the European Commission and the Gulf Cooperation Council. The last member, Indonesia, entered 2023. These members represent industrialized countries, large financial squares and emerging economies.
How to evaluate, over the years, the performance of the FATF?
He played a very important role of leadership after September 11, 2001. Suddenly, the fight against terrorism (FT) became an international obligation and priority on the agenda of all countries. In the international level, the states were urged to be part of the International Convention to suppress terrorism financing, as well as regional or international agreements and actions to combat terrorism and their financing. Internally, countries have been instituted to criminalize the FT, to adopt FLS, prevention and detection measures of the FT in financial entities, such as banks and insurers, and non-finances, such as casinos, real estate agencies or pledge stores. To adopt new international instruments that harmonize or even standardize the practices of various states, and agree on their content, it may take years. But Faft was in the right place and moment. Given its informal nature and flexibility to adjust your mandate due to the threats that could exist in the financial system and its technical know-how, the FATF incorporated in its mandate the fight against FT and produced recommendations, at a time when this matter was new to most jurisdictions. The FATF acted quickly, useful and efficiently to the international community. It had experienced experts in the financial area and the ability to assist in the application [of the recommendations] and supervise its execution. The same happened in 2009, following the 2008 financial crisis and the G20 request to reinforce measures intended for transparency and combat corruption. Therefore, it has been a positive way.
Argues that the Faft occurred in Faft an “institutional metamorphosis” in this body. As?
The FAFT was created as an informal group of technical and temporary, renewable every eight years, but over 30 years has become an increasingly complex organization, governing 206 jurisdictions today. The extension of the mandate also implied the evolution of its powers and responsibilities, and today the FATF is worldwide recognized as the international authority on this matter. It is endowed with a public power of world governance whose recognition is translated into several resolutions of the UN Security Council.
The study clarifies FAFT's legal statute. What status is this and what is the connection with other entities also linked to the fight against FT and money laundering?
FAFT is the world authority responsible for setting international standards, rules and policies on these subjects and there is no duplication of functions with other international organizations and entities, including International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank and the European Union. This study argues that the gradual evolution of the mandate, the FATF's institutional structure and 'modus operandi' has changed its 'modus constiti'. That is, an organization can evolve into an international organization of full right, regardless of the initial intention of the members and not being created by a treaty.
How do you explain that, to date, it is lacking clarification of the FAFT legal statute?
I think there was never a real interest in analyzing this issue in depth. This theme was addressed between 2016 and 2018, during the Spanish and Argentine FATF Presidencies, but was “Marinar”, with the argument that there would be a advantage of maintaining a flexible entity to more easily be able to respond to emerging challenges and risks against safety, transparency and integrity of the international financial system. But the fact is that the FATF began to stop and exercise enormous power, as it evaluates and identifies non-compliant jurisdictions, naming them in lists ('Blacklisting'). It may also install measures to members and non -members, a power detained by very few international organizations.
To what extent does your recommendations impact and put into practice?
FATF recommendations have impact because countries are regularly evaluated on their application, called the “Technical Compliance”, and the effectiveness of their practical application, with the designation of “immediate outcomes”. This assessment is made according to strict criteria, being given a classification. If the result is disabled, the jurisdiction has to make a high level of resolution political commitment to these deficiencies, becoming part of the 'gray list', subject to an action plan and a term [compliance]. In the absence of political commitment or lack of sufficient progress in the execution of the plan, jurisdiction can be appointed to the 'blacklist', and the FATF may appeal to all FATF network jurisdictions to advise their financial institutions to reinforce diligence measures regarding the risks associated with such a jurisdiction. This is what has been happening to Myanmar since October 2022. If jurisdiction has serious deficiencies or does not comply with the action plan or is not a member of a regional group, it can be appointed to the 'blacklist'. In this case, the FATF may appeal to apply the 'Recommendation 19' measures, ranging from reinforcing the diligence and systematic communication of transactions and operations involving jurisdiction to the limitation or prohibition of financial transactions with jurisdiction.

Are there some concrete examples?
This happens with Iran and North Korea two decades ago. The international reputation [from this measure to a country] is real, has a political and economic cost. A 2021 International Monetary Fund (IMF) study reveals that the estimated negative effects of 7.6 percent of gross domestic product in capital flows and a significant reduction in foreign direct investment in the jurisdictions in the 'gray list' and may even have consequences on IMF loan conditions.
It raises, in the book, the question of the importance of FAFT in the global institutional landscape. What importance is this?
FAFT serves as an institutional, operational and regime model for other international organizations. This study develops a theoretical model that can be used in any organization that acts on the international scene, gathers the same objective elements and whose legal status is uncommon. In the background, the FATF is a practical case. International law is not static and one has to analyze reality and adjust the models, and they must reflect the objective reality of the international legal order.
China and Hong Kong are members of FAFT. What is the relationship of MSAR and local policies to combat FT and money laundering with this entity?
MSAR is a member of one of the FATF regional groups-the Asia-Pacific Group to combat capital bleaching (APG), and obeys the recommendations and mechanisms of FATF supervision, exercised by APG. Macau has had a good performance, obviously fulfilling his recommendations. This happened, for example, with the adoption of the property freezing regime and the law of transmitting control control of cash and negotiable instruments to the bearer. Incidentally, the MSAR was the world's first jurisdiction to obtain the best technical compliance note compared to the 40 FATF recommendations when it was evaluated in 2017.
What are the main challenges that FAFT currently faces in combating this type of crimes?
The use of new technologies, virtual currency and limited access to formal financial services leading to the use of unregulated channels, increasing the risks of capital bleaching and FT. In the book also speak of the economic pit and response or action capacity between FATF's member jurisdictions regarding the member jurisdictions of regional groups. Many of them are fragile or low -income economies, so it is not surprising that they have more disabilities or difficulties in complying with FATF international standards. In APG, by way of example, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Nepal, Timor-Leste and Tuvalu are on the World Bank list of 2023 of the least developed countries, which makes the uniform and global application of FATF standards and policies difficult. In addition, the standards, policies, evaluation procedures and recommendations or FATF action plans are poorly flexible or adjustable to the local reality and internal and regional conditionalisms of non -FATF member jurisdictions. A more equitable participation or representation of these jurisdictions in the final decision -making process of the FATF should also be ensured in order to increase its legitimacy and transparency.</description><pubDate>2025-02-27 01:06:10</pubDate></item><item><title>China | EN, SHIPS MAKES TWO DEAD AND 14 MISSING</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/27/china-embate-entre-navios-faz-dois-mortos-e-14-desaparecidos/</link><description>At least two people have died and 14 are missing after a clash between a passenger boat and a petroleum waste recovery vessel in downtown China, Chinese press said yesterday.

This time, it is up to sculptor Cristina Leiria, author of the project of the Kun Iam Ecumenical Center, to organize the visit
 
Saturday is the day of another edition of the initiative “Tours with History”, organized by the Rui Cunha Foundation (FRC), which promotes guided tours, in Portuguese and English, to Macao places with historical and cultural interest. This time the tour starts at 3 pm to the Kun Iam Ecumenical Center, and is led by Portuguese architect and sculptor Cristina Leiria, author of the original project inaugurated on March 21, 1999, recently renewed and reopened on December 11, 2024.
The Kun Iam Ecumenical Center was a project designed by the author, with the support of UNESCO, “aiming to perpetuate mutual respect and friendship between all peoples and civilizations,” according to the IC official page. The public art complex measures 32 meters high in total, 20 of which refer to the bronze statue of the goddess Kun Iam, which weighs 50 tons.
“The base of the statue, in the form of lotus flower, consists of the contemplation room where one can rest, listen to music and read. In the decoration of the summit the artists of Macau, Kwok Woon and Joana Ling painted, on rice paper, figures, symbols and texts related to Lao Tse, Confucius, Mence and Buddha, ”says IC information.
The lower floor offers a multipurpose room, with a capacity of 50 people, dedicated to concerts, conferences, movie viewing and other multicultural activities, such as art exhibitions.
Active exposure
Currently, there is the individual exhibition of Cristina Leiria, “moments of light with kun iam”, at the invitation of the IC to mark the conclusion of the restoration and conversion work in a multipurpose cultural tourism space, 25 years after the author's presence at its inauguration. The show, which extends until March 13, displays statues of the goddess Kun Iam and other associated works, in materials such as Jade, Crystal, Wood or Brushed Steel, and is complemented by images and videos that portray the process of design and construction of the ecumenical center, making known to the public behind the scenes of your planning and building.
Born in Lisbon on April 25, 1946, Cristina Rocha Leiria lived in Mozambique between both and 17, when he returned to study architecture at the Higher School of Fine Arts, and later took a specialization course at University College in London. He deepened studies on Feng Shui, in Macao, China and Japan, and electromagnetism in France, having exercised in such different places as the United Kingdom, Mozambique, Rhodesia, South Africa, Portugal and Macao.
The construction of the Kun Iam Ecumenical Center was a challenge launched by the then governor of Macao, Vasco Rocha Vieira (recently deceased), which is a space where silence has a place to exist in a specific place. The statue dedicated to the goddess Kun Iam is 20 meters high and is made of bronze, having plenty of spiritual meaning for most Orientals.</description><pubDate>2025-02-27 01:57:11</pubDate></item><item><title>Cinema | Selected 13 documentaries and shorts in contest</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/26/cinema-seleccionados-13-documentarios-e-curtas-em-concurso/</link><description>The Cultural Institute (IC) has chosen 13 documentary and short film projects in the genres fiction and animation, for the third phase of the “Macau-The Power of Image 2024” program, a contest that aims to financially support young local filmmakers.

State Council's Taiwan Cabinet spokesman Zhu Fenglian described the incident at a press conference as a “common maritime accident” and accused Progressive Democratic Party authorities (DPP), “exaggerating and deliberately politicizing” the incident without clarifying “the facts and responsibilities”.
The ship allegedly involved in the incident, identified as Hong Tai, of Togo Flag, with eight Chinese crew members on board, was associated with China by the Taiwan Coast Guard, which fed the tensions between the two governments.
However, the spokeswoman stressed that “more than a hundred similar incidents happen every year around the world”, minimizing the importance of the incident.
"This kind of political manipulation is unpopular and will not gain public support," said Zhu, referring to the position of the Taiwanese authorities. The deputy accused the DPP of trying to take "political advantage" from the case, a strategy that, according to Beijing, will not be successful.
Taiwan currently has 14 international and ten domestic submarine cables, according to the Taiwan National Security Office, which estimated that the island is an average of seven to eight cable cutters per year.
The incident occurred around 3:00 am on Tuesday, when CGA received a report from Chungwha Telecom, Taiwan's largest telecommunications company, indicating that the third submarine line that connects Taiwan to fishermen if he had left about six nautical miles northwest of the southern Jiangjun port. Chungwha Telecom stated that there was no "any impact" on communications services after rupture.</description><pubDate>2025-02-27 02:09:31</pubDate></item><item><title>Noise | Requested amendment to the Prevention and Control Law</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/27/ruido-pedida-alteracao-a-lei-de-prevencao-e-controlo/</link><description>The Environmental Noise Prevention and Control Law has entered into force for more than 10 years and is inadequate to the current reality, considers Deputy Nick Lei.
The legislator linked to the community of Fujian said yesterday that it is time to update penalties for those who violate the law, accepted methods of proof collection and settle the periods in which it is forbidden to make noise.
Speaking to the Macau Forum of Macao's Forum of Macau channel, the deputy cited data from the Directorate of Environmental Protection Services (DSPA) that reveal the presentation of 10,554 complaints for noise in 2024. Although the number of complaints came down to 2021 and 2022, Nick Lei points out that 99 percent of the complaints filed.
The fact that the DSPA does not indicate reasons for the filing, whether they were resolved or what kind of follow -up was given, raises doubts to the deputy, who theorizes that perhaps some of these filments should simply be due to the owners of fractions from which the noise does not open the door.
Another situation that can result in archiving is the suspension of noise during the visit of the DSPA agents, and the return of noise as soon as they go. In the optics of Nick Law, these situations can reveal gaps in the law that need to be collapse.</description><pubDate>2025-02-27 01:31:24</pubDate></item><item><title>Today Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/autor/hoje-macau/</link><description>At least two people have died and 14 are missing after a clash between a passenger boat and a petroleum waste recovery vessel in downtown China, Chinese press said yesterday.

February 2025
The Chinese tradition says that the classical works of culture were not just four books: The Analects (《論語/1 论语》 lunyǔ), the book of Mâncio (《孟子》 mèngzǐ), The Great Study (《大學/大学》 dàxué) and the middle doctrine (《中庸》 zhōngyōng)], and five classics: The Classic of Mutations (《易經易经》 Yì Jīng) (《詩經诗经》 Shījīng), The History (《史記/太史公記 // 史记/太史公记》 SHǐJì/Tàishǐ Gōngjì), The Rites (《禮記礼记》 Lǐjì), the Annals of Spring and Autumn (《春秋》 Chūnqiū)), but four books and six classic, because there was one more relative to music (樂經/乐经) Yuè Jīng, in the meantime.
However, “music” (樂/乐 yuè) is so important to the Chinese that their synogram is confused in the written form with that of “joy” (樂/乐 lè).  From an etymological point of view, it is the pictogram of a musical instrument, whose base represents the wood part and the top the strings of it.  This, for the satisfaction that raises when it is touched, will serve by extension of meaning to figure the synogram of joy.
Music before belonging to humanity, depends on the deities of the Chinese popular animist religion and natural forces such as wind or biological beings such as birds, or mythological like fenices.  It is known that the yellow emperor (黄帝 Huángdì) ruled in a mythical antiquity that dates back to organized Chinese civilization. But this, according to one of the great Taoist philosophers of Chinese antiquity, Lie Yukou (列御寇 Liè Yùkòu ”) in the homonymous work Liezi (列子“ Lièzǐ ·) puts the emperor to make spiritual trips in which he finds feminine deities of matriarchal times, such as Huaxu (華胥/华胥 huáxū), mother of the first emperor Chinese Fuxi (伏羲 Fuxī) and, therefore, ancestral matriarch of all the Chinese or even the mysterious mother and/or woman of the ninth sky (九天聖 (圣) 母/九天玄女 jiiǔtān shèngmǔ/jiiǔtān xuanǚ), who will have taught him a lot, including the latter to appreciate music, poetry, who had human and Phoenix Body, in the Arts of Love.
As for Phoenix is ​​the bird that symbolizes eternal life and peace; When the gray itself is reborn, it transports the hope of whole, renewed and peaceful beings, as it only arises in the world in times of tranquility and harmony. But it is also in close relationship with music, because it is a mythological bird that sings, like the wind, whose sound is composed for the Chinese by the melodious beating of the wings of the birds, when it comes to breeze, or the storm of them in storm.
Linglun (伶倫/伶伦 Ling Lun) created the twelve shades following a yellow emperor request, which after being properly polite and trained his musical ear for the mysterious woman of ninth sky, was bored in the trips of inspection by the earth with the monotony of melodies. This great musician rushed to fulfill orders and surrendered with soul and heart to listen to all the sounds of nature to obtain the inspiration required to the mission. But it was in the Kunlun Sacred Mountain (崑崙山/昆仑山 Kūnlún Shān) that he obtained the lighting necessary for the creation of twelve shades by resorting to twelve bamboo tubes. How did he verify the right tones? “Loading the twelve bamboo tubes, Linglun reached the foot of the Kunlun mountain to hear the song of the Phoenix. When the birds sang, the male gave six shouts and the female answered them with six others. Linglun compared the twelve screams with his sounds and found that there was a perfect match between them. ” (Wang and Alves, 2009, 48)
He had reached his goal. The shades followed the model of the Phenicices, when it presented its creation to the yellow emperor, having been precisely rewarded with the title of God of music [乐 (乐) 之神 yīnyuè zhī shén] and the world has since filled the most beautiful melodies.
Going now to philosophy, the cosmos faced as a mysterious musical instrument is one of the favorite metaphors of one of the great Taoist philosophers, the prince of Huainan, Liu an [劉 (刘) 安 Liú'ān, 179? (《淮南子》 Huáinánzǐ). The work is known in the Chinese tradition also with the title of (《淮南子鴻烈》 Huáinánzǐ Hóngliè), whose meaning is “the radiant light of Master Huainan”, having been the sixth chapter translated by Canadian synologist Charles Le Blanc, under the title Huainanzi 淮南子 Philosophical Synthesis Han though Subtitle The Idea of ​​Resonance (Kan-Ying 感應) with a Translation and Analysis of Chapter Six.
Suppose that the whole universe is linked, in the manner of the ropes of an instrument, spreading the sound, echoing and resonating when it is touched by the strings, will have its western counterpart in the mysticism of the Pythagorean pre-Socratic philosopher and its presupposition of the “music of spheres”, that is, the melody produced by the stars in their heavenly trajectories.
Returning to the Master of Huainan, he is informed in Section II of the IX of the sixth chapter, that “the mutual response of things belonging to the same category is deeply mysterious and extremely subtle” (BLANC, 1985, 116), which corresponds to the original text is found in Appendix 1 (Blanc, 1985, 221-215): “夫物類之相應玄妙深微知不能論” (6/ 3a.5) 2. These lines can be explained by resorting to another postulate, “the mutual influence of spiritual Qì 3 (天神氣 shén qì)” “” (6/4a. 1), whose visible action manifests itself in the similarity of the outside forms of things, but also in the complementary game of the female and masculine forces that make them creative and transforming, as the superior action believes, is based on the invisible response and Silent (相應 Xiāngyìng), that is, not discursive, which does not preclude what is intuitive and melodious.
The mutual resonance is sustained by a complementary game of the energies yin (陰/阴 yīn) and yang (陽/阳 yáng) at the most varied levels, guided by the principle of causality, which acts as much as similar, because it comes to viable and unite what is distinct, in a perfect resonance, so as to figure the cosmos as taiji or "last" or "last" (太极/太極 tàijí). Thus, section IV of Chapter VI is achieved, where musical resonance (6/6b.9-11) is exposed, which works metaphorically to introduce universal resonance, implying a “great immersion” in the “supreme harmony”, impossible to explain (Blanc, 1985, 138). We are told that an tuner of Sè (瑟), an instrument of Chinese strings with 25 strings (vaguely recalling an Arabil), when touching a rope, will obtain the mutual harmony of the same rope in another instrument. But "if someone changes the tuning of a rope so that they do not respond to any of the five notes, but when touching it get a resonance with the 25 strings, then there is a difference with regard to sound, succeeding that the one was evoked to govern all others." (Ibidem) “改調一弦其於無音無所比鼓之而二十五弦皆應此未始” (6/6a.11).
The sage, holy, or supreme musician will be one who can put himself in a direct intuitive connection with Tao (道 道), without herself being able to provide the reasons for it. Dip in the numenal world, play and mix essences, becomes what you want and lives in mutual resonance, absolute and total musical, with all that exists, not just relative to your "similar."
There is a music story for Guqin (古琴 Gǔqín), another instrument of Chinese strings, with seven strings, told by the philosopher Taoist Liezi in the chapter of the previously mentioned homonymous work, yellow emperor, 11th section, (《列子 黄帝》第十一部分 黄帝》第十一部分 lièzǐ · huángdì ”dÌyī bùfèn), which illustrates this universal resonance, easier, easier resonance To obtain to those who have a spontaneous mind, as it succeeds children, and as the founder recalls Taoism Laozi (老子 lǎozǐ), the perfect heart (心 xīn) is that of a newborn. In the story that I present my translation, the protagonist is a boy with whom birds play naturally, but when his father asks him to capture one of them, in order to entertain himself, the birds distance themselves, so the score for Guqin is entitled “the distancing of water owls” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgte7wzut1y
原文 Original text (classic Chinese)
海上之人有好漚鳥者 ， 每旦之海上 ， 從漚鳥遊 ， 漚鳥之至者百住而不止。其父曰：「吾聞漚鳥皆從汝遊 ， 汝取來 汝取來 ， 漚鳥舞而不下也。故曰：至言去言 漚鳥舞而不下也。故曰：至言去言 至為無為。齊智之所知 ，5

海边有个喜欢鸥鸟的人 ， 每天早上到海上去 ， ， ， 鸥鸟来玩的有成百只以上。他父亲说： 我听说鸥鸟都爱跟你游玩 我听说鸥鸟都爱跟你游玩 ， ， 你抓一只来 ”我玩玩。 ， 鸥鸟都在空中飞翔而不下来。所以说： ， 最高的作为是没有作为。同别人比试智慧的想法 ， ， 那是很浅陋的。
There was a boy near the sea that liked a lot of water owls. Every day, he used to stroll by the sea where he played with the birds, more than one hundred.  Once, the father commented: “I heard that the water owls often play with you, grabs one for me so that I can also entertain me with them. “The next morning, by the sea, the birds danced over his head, but they didn't approach. For this reason it is said: “The best speech is speechless, the best action is not acting. If wisdom can be compared, then it is superficial! ”

The rate of disease reduction is about 40 percent
 
The study “Effectiveness of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Based on insomnia for insomnia in the prevention of Major depressive disorder in insomnia and subclinical depression: a random clinical trial” [Effectiveness of App-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia on Preventing Major Depressive Desorder Inorder Whit Insomnia and Subclinical Depression: Randomized clinical trial] promises answers to the treatment of cases of depression in the younger ones.
The work, published by PLOS MEDICINE magazine and developed by academics from various universities in Hong Kong and China, included the University of Hong Kong, Chinese Hong Kong University or the University of Beijing, concludes that it is possible to reduce, by about 40 percent, cases of depression in young people using a mobile phone application that monitors insoponials, a habitual symptoms, a symptom in the one who suffers from the sufferers illness. The data were presented at the end of last week in Hong Kong.
To reach the results, a random sample of more than 700 young Chinese from the interior of China and Hong Kong with insomnia disturbance and depressive symptoms, aged 15 to 25 years, who underwent testing with application for six weeks, was chosen.
Thus, “this controlled and random study evaluated the efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy for application based on application (TCC-I) in preventing the future appearance of Major Depressive Disturbance (MDD) in young people” can be read. This at a time when "more and more evidence suggests that insomnia plays an important role in the development of depression," in this investigation "intervention in insomnia as a promising approach to prevent depression in young people."
Thus, “applications based TCC-I is effective in preventing the future appearance of major depression and improving the results of insomnia among young people with insomnia and subclinical depression”. The study also concludes that "these results underline the importance of aiming at insomnia to prevent the appearance of DMG [a type of depression] and enhance the need for greater dissemination of digital TCC-I to promote sleep and mental health in the young population."
It is also concluded that the TCC-I based on applications "not only improved nightly symptoms, but also reduced daytime fatigue and led to greater change to maturity."
More than 700 young people analyzed
After testing the application of TCC-I, base clinical interviews were conducted over a period of six to 12 months to understand the results in participants and monitor symptoms. We spoke, in the period between September 9, 2019 and November 25, 2022, of 708 participants, of which 407 was women (57 percent), with an average ages of 22 years. The study also points out that “37 participants, 10 percent, in the intervention group and 62 participants, 18 percent, in the control group developed new mood disturbances over the 12 months of follow -up”.
In turn, the group that was subject to CBT-I based on mobile phone application, ie cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, presented “rates of remission of insomnia disturbance higher than post-intervention control groups” within one year. In addition, the same group "reported a greater decrease in depressive symptoms than post-intervention controls and over six months of follow-up." The authors of the study understand that "insomnia was a mediator of the effects of intervention on depression", and no adverse events related to interventions were reported. "
The authors left for this study with some proven ideas that insomnia is one of the main causes for depression. "Emerging data on insomnia intervention, especially cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (TCC-I), have shown promising results in insomnia relief and depressive symptoms in patients with insomnia," he reads.
Existing investigations focus on adults and elderly, so it was important to analyze this matter among the younger ones.
"In addition, there are few studies with suitable statistical power to demonstrate the preventive effect of TCC-I on depression, both at the level of symptoms and disturbances," explains the study authors, stressing that "little is known about whether the digital insomnia intervention can potentially prevent youthful depression."
Important meanings
The study also points out that cognitive behavioral therapy for applications based on insomnia is a viable and effective intervention to prevent future depression at both symptoms and disturbances in young people. ” However, further studies are recommended to explore “the integration of application-based TCC-I in clinical practice to improve accessibility and prevent depression among the young population”.
It is also referred to the need for more clinical trials “to explore the potential benefits of adapting digital interventions on sleep in relief and depression prevention”, in order to “move toward personalized and staggered care approaches to the community”.
Limitations are referred to in this study published in “PLOS Medicine”, namely “the inclusion of a mixture of individuals with and without prior depression, and a limited sample of adolescents, although there was an adequate global sample”.
To the Hong Kong press, the study authors spoke of the importance of these results and how they can constitute new tools in future treatments of the disease. Quoted by The Standard HK, Chen Si-Jing, the first author of the Postdoctoral Research and Psychiatry Department of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said the study "shows that Digital TCC-I is effective in preventing the future appearance of severe depression, with satisfactory effectiveness." Wing Yun-Kwok, director of the Li Chiu Kong family sleep evaluation unit, indicated that future studies will focus on digital intervention on insomnia in clinical practice.
The unprecedented character of this study in Asia still gives him greater importance. According to Lu Lin, an academic at the Chinese Academy of Sciences and president of the PKU Sixth Hospital, to date "no investigation in Asia had been carried out on the effectiveness of this therapy."</description><pubDate>2025-02-24 02:07:54</pubDate></item><item><title>Diplomacy | Macao Platform seen in the context of Chinese foreign policy</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/19/diplomacia-plataforma-de-macau-vista-no-contexto-da-politica-externa-chinesa/</link><description>In "Paradiplomacy in China: Macao's role in relations between sino-Portuguese countries," Xu Heng Wang concludes that the role of platform with Lusophony "can be seen with extension of China's foreign policy." However, the MSar presents its own ideas, without “complete obedience to the central government”, indicates the academic
 
Macao's diplomatic role in the relationship with China and Portuguese -speaking countries was the focus of Xu Heng Wang's doctoral thesis defended in January at the University of Coimbra (UC) Faculty of Economics. In “Paradiplomacy in China: Macao's role in relations between sino-Portuguese countries”, the author argues that, regarding the role of Economic and Commercial Platform of MSA in the connection of Beijing and Portuguese-speaking countries, there is a certain extent of Chinese foreign policy, but at the same time, ideas proper to local authorities.
"Although the role of Macao as an economic and commercial platform can be seen as an extension of China's foreign policy, this does not mean that Macau is in a state of complete obedience to the central government," is referred to in research work.
Although it is stressed that “it is difficult to discern Macao's desire to develop, it must be mentioned that Macau has his own ideas about the course of his development”, namely in relation to the game and the entire economic structure.
“Macao has long foresaw that the structure of his economy would be unbalanced and that the game would be dominant. Authorities and academics have also made many debates on the issue of unsustainable development based on the game industry. At the same time, Macau is also very aware of its advantages in terms of cultural integration, having carried out the construction of a historic and cultural city, becoming a tourist attraction. ”
Between the own ideas and what is defined in the field of foreign policy by Beijing, there is "a direction of the development of Macao which, basically, is consistent with the role that the central government has conceived to Macao."
In this context, the author concludes that “the interests of Macao and the Central Government are basically the same”, being “a special case of paradiplomacy in China”, due to the implementation of politics “a country, two systems” in the territory and the high degree of autonomy it provides in various areas.
THE ROLE OF THE MACAU FORUM
Xu Heng Wang took a different approach on this issue, not resorting to traditional international relations theories, because “Macao interactions involve both state and non-state actors,” so these theories “do not provide an accurate explanation of Macao's role”. Thus, and to understand the role of Macau in the relations between China and the Portuguese -speaking countries, the idea of ​​paradiplomacy with Guanxi theory, a term used to describe social, economic or political relationships that can enhance business or other benefits, was combined.
Thus, it is said that "the creation of the Macau Forum can be considered one of the prominent paradiplomatic activities," with "Macao playing a role that mixes its development with the strategic objectives of the Chinese central government, especially with regard to Portuguese -speaking countries."
Macao has performed some relevant activities in the relations between China and Portuguese-speaking countries, ”although it is assumed that“ the results have been limited so far ”.
The academic states that these activities are "mainly concentrated in the fields of economics, education, tourism, culture and technology, with political effects that are not yet so evident." In addition, it is pointed out that "the influence of Macau on the relations between China and the different Portuguese -speaking countries has varied in intensity." Still, "much of the interaction and cooperation between Macao, China and the Portuguese -speaking countries occurred through the Macao Forum."
Help with objectives
In general terms, the “paradiplomacy of Macao is a complex and fluid process”, and the territory “shows its identity as a world tourism and leisure center and a characteristic financial center with international activities”, with the aim of “improving economic structure” and making diversification beyond game.
The author highlights fundamental areas such as services for small and medium enterprises, exchange-cultural and formation of bilingual talents. In addition, it is explained that “the central government provides political support to Macau based on its foreign policy needs, with the reinforcement of cooperation” with Portuguese -speaking countries. In these actions, include the Great Bay project, as well as the idea of ​​Macao's establishment as the Renminbi Compensation Center (RMB).
“On the one hand, the central government provides conveniences to Macau and helps [the territory] to establish its identity, 'supported by the mainland China market'. On the other hand, it helps Macau to develop the activity of RMB compensation center for transactions that occur on the Macao negotiation platform. ”
Thus, it denotes the author, "the role of Macao in paradiplomacy, but as an assistant to the implementation of central foreign policy, is also evident." However, "the paradiplomacy of Macao does not only reflect the diplomatic objective of helping the Chinese government to establish relations with Portuguese -speaking countries, but also the improvement of Macau's own international influence."
The doctoral thesis also presents a practical case analysis of Macau's relationship with the most striking Portuguese -speaking countries in the economic relationship with China, namely Angola and Brazil. "For Angola, Macao has played an approach role to China," as the African country needs "foreign investment for the hydroelectric power, infrastructure and agriculture sector." Thus, the binding axis is made at the Macao Forum, where "Angola can establish relations with the Chinese central government and cooperate on investment, in addition to the oil sector."
In addition, "most of China's investment in Angola comes from large companies, while small and medium -sized companies still depend mainly on Macau for commercial cooperation."
In the case of Brazil the situation is slightly different, because “in sino-Brazilian relations, the role of Macao is not obvious”, more “centered around the BRICS”, a group of emerging economies initially founded by Brazil, Russia, India and China, which today has ten member countries.
“Although the first ministerial meeting of the Macao Forum (2003) preceded the first meeting of the BRICS (2009) leaders, the impact of the Macao Forum on Sino-Brazilian Relations is not obviously as good as the influence established through direct meetings. Therefore, in the early days of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Brazil, relations between the two countries developed more at national level. ”
It is also highlighted that "although the role that Macao has in the opening of a door to the mainland China market has been established in Brazil's eyes, the impact of Macao on sino-Brazilian relations has not yet become obvious."
It is certain, however, that in recent years "the continuous development of the Macao Forum and the continuous improvement of organizational activities, its attraction to Brazil has become increasingly evident." “As Brazil tries to expand trade, commercial cooperation and investment with China will no longer be concentrated only in national business giants and will be increasingly targeted at private companies,” is still completed.
Regarding Portugal, the “attitude is very positive”, to the existing historical connection. “In many memos and statements signed with China, Macau has been stated to play an increasingly important role as a link between China and Portugal. Portugal and China have great technical cooperation in the domains of new energies, aerospace industry and other technological innovations. There is also a profound relationship of cooperation in the field of education. ”
It is also noteworthy that Portugal “not only signed cooperation agreements in the field of teaching with universities in the interior of China, but also signed several cooperation and exchange agreements with the main universities of Macao”.</description><pubDate>2025-02-19 00:24:24</pubDate></item><item><title>Vocational Education | Alert Study for Human Resources Failures in China</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/18/ensino-profissional-estudo-alerta-para-falhas-em-recursos-humanos-na-china/</link><description>A study published in The China Quarterly concludes that there are still many questions to resolve so that technical-professional education in China can respond to human resources needs. The work warns of the “rapid massification” of this type of education, with priority for “number of enrollment over quality”
 
Technical-professional education in China has been popularized, but a recently published study in Cambridge University Press's “The China Quarterly” magazine, concludes that there are still gaps to find that courses can actually respond to the country's needs in the industrial sector.
“More Graduates, Fewer Skills? Vocational Education Expansion and Skilled Labar Shortages in China ”[More graduates, less skills? The expansion of vocational education and qualified labor faults in China] is the name of the study developed by Xinmiao Song of the University of Lingnan, and Duudo XU of the University of Hong Kong Department of Sociology.
Academic work draws attention to the “disturbing tendency” of “rapid massification of vocational education, which gives priority to the number of enrollment over the quality of education” and “does not respond to the search for skills and qualified labor”.
In addition, the authors add to the “adverse consequences for both administrative management and teaching, caused by this scenario. “The development of competences often is up to post-school professional associations and an exclusive group of elite students. However, reform initiatives, such as the Manual Arts Campaign and competency contests, benefit only a few, without improving the prospects of employment of the student population in general. ”
Thus, the two academics argue that “more attention to the tensions inherent to China's teaching and vocational training system”, because “only when there is a deeper understanding of the underlying causes to the ineffective training of competences in professional schools can China achieve its national objective of industrial modernization”.
The study was developed in two vocational schools, and interviews were conducted to 104 students. In addition, ethnographic data of four doctoral projects were used in the area of ​​vocational education, developed between October 2017 and December 2020.
It is also noted that the country needs “increasingly urgent” of qualified workers “due to world economic competition”. However, "despite the massive expansion of the teaching and vocational training system in the last two decades, there is still a significant deficit of qualified labor," there is "debates about the ineffectiveness of vocational education." These focus above all on, “in the absence of institutional synergies between teaching and industry, but they often ignore the conflicts inherent to the vocational education system and the processes of competency training at the micro level”.
Practical difficulties
To the “micro level”, that is, in schools, the authors denote the existence of several difficulties in the effective functioning of these courses in line with the intended results.
In secondary education there is “a delicate balance between the promotion of social equality and the development of skills”. However, "analysis indicates that, in the context of the rapid expansion of secondary education, schools have difficulty effectively harmonizing these objectives."
“In order to maintain a proper student body, schools and teachers are often obliged to compromise the quality of candidates and teaching standards in the classroom. This situation generates a change in daily pedagogy and school administration to preserve discipline and stability, thus attributing the development of competences and the selection of talents-ideally a mission from the whole school-to extra-curricular professional associations, pursued by a few, ”he is added.
It is also concluded that “the acquisition of competences is a multifaceted process, shaped by the dynamic interaction between educators and students”, because “the academic preparation of students and their motivations to learn are equally pertinent for the formation of microcompetence, as are the resources of schools and the capabilities of teachers”.
Thus, “the resolution of the ineffective formation of competencies requires more than top initiatives to the base”, “a approach that recognizes the obstacles that students face in the acquisition of skills, as well as their seizures and uncertainties in the search for employment, is necessary.
The authors also talk about “elitism” in some formations related to handicraft courses and “competency contests”. "These initiatives may inadvertently suggest that handicrafts are reserved for a restricted number of people, as competencies contests often remain inaccessible to most vocational education students, both objective and psychologically."
Thus, the authors emphasize that "there is a significant undoing between this elitist approach to the acquisition of competences and the real conditions faced by vocational education students."
“The superficial promotion of manual labor spirit and the exclusivity of skills failed to truly resolve the challenges associated with the acquisition of skills, the search for employment and the commitment to follow technical professions among vocational education students,” is also mentioned.
Still, limitations in the study are referred to, namely the fact that it focuses only on public schools in higher secondary education, and the results may not completely represent other levels of vocational education, such as the higher institutes of vocational training ”.

Numbers from the “Factory of the World”
In the study is the intense industrial development that China has achieved in the last 40 years, emerging as the "factory of the world," as the authors describe, "taking advantage of their demographic dividends."
“However, the intensive model of labor growth has proved unsustainable due to population aging and intense global competition. To escape the 'medium income trap', the Chinese government has launched a series of industrial modernization actions in the transforming industry and services sectors, ”but“ despite the ambitious agendas for the next decade, the persistent scarcity of qualified workers continues to make these efforts difficult, ”he is mentioned.
By 2020, there were more than 23 million vocational students, so "this scarcity of skilled labor is a surprise," is referred to in the study, which highlights "the substantial efforts and resources that the Chinese government has dedicated to improving vocational education in recent years."
For example, “Free Secondary Professional Education, the expansion of higher vocational facilities in one million students from 2019 to 2021 and the creation of universities of applied technology” emerged. In addition, the vocational education system watched an unprecedented trajectory, with enrollment in secondary professional schools higher than increasing from 4.56 million in 2004 to 7.11 million in 2009 ″.
In terms of the need for human resources, the study cites data from China's Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security for 80 cities in the country. "The ministry's quarterly reports have revealed that the work between work/person looking for qualified labor reached a historical peak of 2.0 in early 2020", and "higher level qualified workers, technicians and higher technicians had a particularly high demand."
It is also noted that the Ministry of Education predicts that the country continues to confront this year “with a deficit of 30 million qualified workers, which represents a 48 percent break in domains such as materials, energy savings and vehicles powered by new energies”.</description><pubDate>2025-02-18 00:25:20</pubDate></item><item><title>Teaching | Chinese universities rise in ranking by disciplines</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/25/ensino-universidades-chinesas-sobem-em-ranking-por-disciplinas/</link><description>Chinese universities have risen at the “World University Rankings by Subject 2025” in various areas, although in arts and humanities Asia remains short of other continents. In 11 disciplines analyzed, such as Law, Management and Economics, China and Singapore are in the 50 best, while Hong Kong stands out in Education Studies
 
The latest world ranking of higher education by areas of knowledge of Times Higher Education, the “World University Rankings by Subject 2025”, concludes that universities in the interior of China have climbed to top positions, although Asia continues to position themselves in the areas of arts and humanities.
In total, 11 academic areas were analyzed. “Arts and Humanities”, “Business and Economics”, “Computer Science”, “Education Studies”, “Engineering”, “Law”, “Life Sciences”, “Medicine and Health”, “Physical Sciences”, “Psychology” and “Social Sciences”.
It is concluded, according to an official note from Times Higher Education (The), that “China and Singapore appear among the 50 best in all 11 subjects”, especially the University of Beijing and Tsinghua University, respectively, for fourth and sex places in “business and economy” disciplines. In fact, “Asia's best performance is registered in the areas of management and economics”, with “its main universities to continue to have difficulty competing worldwide in the field of arts and humanities”. "Concerns about the 'crisis' in humanities seem to be designed to continue this year, but the analysis of The reveals the continuous importance to elite institutions."
Given the analysis of 11 academic areas, the neighboring region of Hong Kong stands out in nine, especially in the area of ​​education, where the University of Beijing and Tsinghua also achieved good results. “The National University of Singapore again occupies the ninth position in Engineering, entering the top 10 of the physical sciences-the first institution in Asia to achieve it-in 10th place,” is also read.
Quoted by the same grade, Simon Marginson, professor at Oxford University, an institution that usually leads rankings worldwide, said that Asia's performance in this classification shows “the multipolar world of higher education” existing today, with greater amplification “national academic capacity”.
"In this context, over time, the relative position of Anglosfera countries and Western Europe must decrease, not because its absolute quality is decreasing, but because the field of comparison is more filled with other countries to emerge," he said.
The same responsible also pointed out that "East Asia and Southeast Asian higher education systems have improved over the past two decades due to the growth in the number of students, increased public funding, more performance -oriented organization and management and selective internationalization policies."
One of the areas where there is a better position of Asian universities is in education studies, showing “a remarkable force, with three universities in the top 10, with the University of Hong Kong in sixth place, the University of Tsinghua in seventh place and the university of Beijing in eighth place”. In addition, The Show that the Chinese University of Hong Kong has made “significant progress” from 19th to 11th position. On the other hand, the Taiwan National University of Science and Technology (Taiwan Tech) obtained "the highest score in terms of research quality."
However, global leadership goes to Stanford University, "surpassing the University of California, Berkeley, demonstrating exceptional performance in both teaching and research environment."
China rises in law
Looking at the area of ​​law, there is currently, according to the ranking of The, the best place to study than Stanford University, which has achieved “excellence in teaching and research environment”, followed by Harvard University, with “exceptional performance” and, thirdly, the University of New York, “with the highest score in terms of research environment”.
Highlight, in this area, for the entrance of the University of Beijing in 14th position, in part due to the good classification “in teaching and the research environment”. It should be noted that, as regards the law, 389 institutions from 48 countries and territories were classified, using 18 “strict performance indicators”.
In the area of ​​law, specialties are analyzed such as constitutional and administrative law and examination to structures and frameworks of governance, or international law, which includes global legal systems and treaties.
Capital Knowledge
China also stands out in business and economy, led by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The University of Beijing rose to fourth place, accompanied by 20 other Chinese universities that improved their positions in the table. In this area were analyzed 990 institutions from 85 countries and territories, with the attention focusing on the quality of teaching and research in disciplines such as strategic leadership, international business and organizational development, as well as business finances or economic.
With regard to the social sciences, China actually comes below the list of the top 20, again with the University of Beijing in 16th and the University of Tsinghua in 20th. Here, the lead is up to MIT, passing Stanford University for the third to call Oxford, with "exceptional performance in teaching and research environment." The London School of Economics and Political Science remains an integral institution of the top 10, now occupying ninth place.
1,093 institutions from 100 countries and territories were analyzed in disciplines such as media communication and studies, politics and international studies, including development studies, sociology, geography and anthropology.
China also rose in the discipline of Computer Science with the University of Beijing to move from 16th to 12th place. In this area, leads the University of Oxford, reaching its highest score ever.
MIT Leads in Arts
The MIT has been at the head of Stanford University, assuming “first place in arts and humanities, as well as business, economy and social sciences”, even if it is first recognized “by specialization in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics”. According to the ranking, it is now “the best place to study arts - with high scores in each of the five pillars underlying the methodology, especially the quality of the investigation and the international perspective”.
In the 11 disciplines of the ranking, "Stanford ranked first in education, law and psychology studies, Harvard University ranked first in engineering and life sciences."
The only local institution in the ranking of The Disciplines is the University of Macao (one), but in places far below top 10: in the area of ​​computational sciences, it is in the 126-150 best in the world, a similar position occupied in the area of ​​education and engineering. In the area of ​​law, for example, one is in the best group of 176-200, while in life sciences is among the 151-175 best.</description><pubDate>2025-02-25 04:59:01</pubDate></item><item><title>Work | Future Ready Talent Program released in Macau and Hong Kong</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/17/108890/</link><description>Wynn and insurer Aia are two of the 14 companies that are part of the “Future Ready” project, launched by LinkedIn on Thursday in Hong Kong. The program bets on vocational training in the two special administrative regions, with special focus on artificial intelligence
 
The LinkedIn social network, facing the world of work, launched last week in Hong Kong, a talent formation program that has the collaboration of 14 companies from the territory and Macao, namely the Aia insurer and the Wynn game operator. The program, titled “LinkedIn Future Ready”, aims to “equip professionals from Hong Kong and Macau with the skills needed to thrive in a rapidly evolving job market,” is referred to in a note of the organization.
The other participating companies or entities are the Cathay Pacific airline, the Chow Tai Fook jewelry group, the PLC group, the English Schools Foundation, the FWD group, the Hop Lun, the Link Asset Management, the MTR Corporation, the company that manages the hong Kong meter, and the PCCW consultant, without forgetting Prudential, Swire Properties, which operates in the real estate market, and the Hong Kong Jockey Club.
The program includes "initiatives for updating skills, knowledge exchange and [sharing] of data based information." Essentially, “Future Ready” intends to “equip companies with tools and resources needed to navigate a workforce transformation scenario and promote a culture of innovation”.
Given the latest projections of the social network, which published, in January, the report "Work Change Report - Ai Is Coming to Work" [Labor Change Report - Artificial Intelligence (IA) is coming to work], the program "Future Ready" aims to make more training in this area in both territories.
"The" LinkedIn Future Ready "program is a bold initiative that aims to support the work force in Hong Kong and to collect gaps in terms of competences, as well as unlocking new opportunities in growing economy," said Mei NG, director-general of LinkedIn social network in Hong Kong.
The official also added that the social network will work closely with the 14 participating companies, to build “a more resilient workforce” by providing “companies that develop and implement innovative talent strategies and ensure that their employees are equipped with the skills needed to succeed in the future”.
Skills below
According to the same statement, before advancing to this training program, an assessment of markets was made in both territories. It is concluded that “Hong Kong and Macao perform well in cross-cutting skills and innovation-both essential to navigating the dynamic current business landscape”, and by transversal skills, “communication, teamwork and leadership” is understood.
In terms of innovation, another factor analyzed, "Hong Kong exceeds the APAC average [Asia-Pacific countries] in innovation skills, reinforcing its role as a future vision business center that also promotes industry transformation." However, the neighboring region “is behind APAC average in AI proficiency”, so the “Future Ready” program consider that there is “an urgent need for initiatives to improve skills to help enable the workforce to adapt without problems to technological advancement”.
There is, in this domain, a "growing demand for AI -related skills", as "77 percent of Hong Kong business leaders said they would hire a less experienced AI competencies rather than a more experienced candidate without these skills."
In addition, "although transverse skills remain the strongest area of ​​Hong Kong, the region continues to be below APAC average and is late in four of the five domains of critical skills evaluated."
One of the objectives of the program announced on Thursday is to “improve and requalify the labor” of both territories “for a future fueled with AI”, so that there is “a certain combination of technical and human skills”, constituting “a competitive advantage for professionals and organizations”.
The 14 partner companies will have access to more than 23,000 courses available on the “LinkedIn Learning” platform that are based on 41,000 skills sets, namely “curated learning pathways, technology training, AI training and state -of -the -art learning resources”, it is explained.
The future accelerates
According to the same report released by LinkedIn in January, AI's growing adoption worldwide will lead to a "search for new jobs and skills." The social network data show that "more than 10 percent of hired workers currently have positions that did not exist in 2000, including functions such as data scientist, social networking manager, sustainability manager, customer success manager and AI engineer."
In the concrete case of Hong Kong, by 2030, “60 percent of all skills used to do a job will have changed, with the innovations of accelerating this transformation to 80 percent”, is mentioned. Thus, it is concluded that "this rapid pace of change has created a gap of competencies that is difficult to conform in the short term."
In addition to betting on professionals, the “Future Ready” program also wants to promote ideas and debates, promising, for example, “quarterly round tables for executives” and “with sector leaders to discuss the evolution of jobs, skills and learning requirements”. “The program will also provide a platform for the sharing of best practices, influencing the widest development of the workforce in all sectors,” is still added.
Also noteworthy is that the LinkedIn report on changes in work structures describe the most usual forms of AI use, namely communication in human resources or marketing. Thus, "recruiters who use LinkedIn's AI -assisted messages to involve candidates are registering an acceptance rate 44 percent higher compared to the AI ​​-free messages." In addition, “marketers who use LinkedIn's ad campaign creation tool, Accelerate, are presenting a cost per 42 percent lower compared to the classic campaigns” of this social network.
For this report were held several inquiries, namely more than 2,500 entrepreneurs from five countries (United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany and India). The questionnaire focused on executives from various business areas (human resources, operations or marketing) was made in nine country and had 19,991 participants from companies with over 1000 employees. This inquiry was held from 26 November and December 13 last year.
In worldwide terms, in 2030 about 70 percent of each worker's tools and skills will change, with “emerging as a catalyst”, and “IMA investments [by companies] are starting to compensate: in the last two years, 51 percent of businesses that have adopted the general AI reported an increase in revenues of 10 percent or more”. “Unsurprisingly, 88 percent of top executives with top management positions said AI adoption to help accelerate business is something important to develop next year,” one reads.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Corruption | Report Alert for gaps in Hong Kong and Singapore</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/14/corrupcao-relatorio-alerta-para-lacunas-em-hong-kong-e-singapura/</link><description>The 2024 Corruption Perception Index presents Singapore as the third cleaner jurisdiction of corruption worldwide, out of 180 countries and regions. Hong Kong is in 17th place in the ranking, but the report leaves a warning: world financial centers remain vulnerable to corruption
 
This Tuesday was released the perception rate of corruption (CPI, in the English acronym), which analyzes corruption in the public sector of 180 countries and regions, the responsibility of the non-governmental organization international transparency.
In the case of China, the CPI reveals that there was no significant change. If 100 points means a country virtually corruption, and 0 points a highly corrupt country, China registered last year 43 points in 100, rising a position compared to 2023, occupying 76th ranking position.
The CPI also looks at Hong Kong's situation, which got 67 points in 100, occupying 17th position in 180 countries and regions around the world. Taiwan, is currently 25th in the ranking of 180 countries, and no change of positioning compared to the CPI of 2023.
To register the presence of an Asian country on the list of the four less corrupt. This is the case of Singapore, third with 84 points in 100, following Finland (2nd) and Denmark (1st). The list of the top four ends with New Zealand.
According to official CPI data, countries and regions that are considered “full democracies” have an average of 73 points, while those who have political systems in which “faults” have 47 points. According to the index, non-democratic regimes receive only on average 33 points.
The CPI analyzes corruption in 180 countries based on sources such as studies or specialists, measuring corruption only in the public sector. However, it is assumed limitations in this count, as the ranking does not include "corruption of private companies, financial secrecy or transnational corruption."
If the score represents "the level of perception of public sector corruption on a scale of 0-100," the country's position in the ranking is only comparison with other countries, and these lists "can change merely if the number of countries changes."
Looking at the global scenario, the report points out that "once again that developed economies dominate the top of the 2024 CPI ranking," it is countries that "have long benefited a state of strong law, the functioning of government institutions and political stability-factors that contribute to a perception of low corruption levels at the inside." However, "these attributes make these countries main targets of corrupt actors for money laundering and protection of illicit gains."
The Money Trail
According to the report, the fact that developed economies dominate the CPI can give a false idea that these countries "are making corruption effectively and remains untouched." “This idea could not be further from the truth. In particular, the nations that constitute large financial centers are more vulnerable to the financial flows of corruption. While their strong institutions convey an idea of ​​integrity, financial sectors and regulatory staff often provide opportunities to explore gaps, reducing anti-corruption global efforts, ”is still described.
In this regard, the examples of Hong Kong and other territories associated with offshore jurisdictions are presented, where it is not always possible to determine the trail of money. “Western financial centers such as Switzerland, Luxembourg, or the United Kingdom have a history of scrutiny of facilitating money laundering movements. However, non -Western centers such as Hong Kong, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates progressively have played similar papers and require similar analysis. ”
“Like Western homologists, they boast the existence of a strong rule of law and institutions with a proper functioning, even though bank laws, corporate structures and secret provisions allow cases of funds washing and deviation from regulations, avoiding detection” of less legal cases, is still described.
It refers to the case of the transfer of African funds to financial centers, such as Carlos São Vicente, former CEO of an Angolan state company that transferred about $ 1.2 billion to companies registered in shorts, and later transferred money to accounts in Singapore and Switzerland. Only for a Singapore reported account, 558 million US dollars were transferred.
Opacity here
With regard to Hong Kong, it is revealed that by 2023 the territory "fines for four banks in a total of $ 3.2 million, negligent 0.0085 percent of the profits reported by these same banks this year."
Still regarding Raehk, it is revealed that "there is no central registration system on the possession of beneficiaries - it is simply required for companies that maintain this information for themselves." “Some types of investment funds are still exempt from maintaining records from their owners. With more than 1.4 million companies registered in 2023, maintaining compliance with monitoring these rules is a huge challenge, creating gaps in shadow actors can easily explore ”, it is also described.
It also states that "opacity is even worse with regard to investment funds," with Hong Kong, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates "not having any form of registration of funds beneficiaries." “As a result, even the authorities have no way to know how many funds there are and how they operate in their countries, leaving the active adjacent to these funds alone. In cases where illegalities are suspected, the authorities trust the beneficiaries to provide information: a process that consumes a lot of time and is not efficient, ”he adds.
Money and climate
In general terms, the CPI report points out that, in the Asia Pacific region, "leaders have failed to wage corruption in the middle of climbing a climate crisis." In a note signed by Ilham Mohamed, Yuambari Haihuie and UrantsetSeg Ulziikhuu, regional counselors of international transparency, they consider that “governments throughout the Asia-Pacific region continue to fail in anti-corruption promises”, drawing attention to the fact that the region faces many natural disasters and being a “home of a third of the world, with the second largest number with the second largest number of young people ”from the world.
“With no concerted efforts to combat corruption now, the first generation that is facing the extreme climate change will face disastrous consequences,” is described.
"Corruption obstructs environmental policies, wages climatic financing and prevents advancement in regulations and policies, making those who have less resources more vulnerable," the report, which points out that corruption waging "the effective use of money" in combating climate change.
Pakistan is mentioned, “which has suffered unprecedented climate vulnerabilities in recent years, with systemic governance failures and barriers in the implementation of policies - including delays in the implementation of regulations and establishment of institutions in the climate Change Act 2017 - have left the context of financing far below the US $ 348 billion projected for the end of 2030”.
Also noteworthy is the case of Vietname, which had 32 projects of solar and wind energy under investigation due to “abuse of power”. The report describes "that the lack of civic space for effective inspection, as well as a limited number of mechanisms for effective complaint systems support - such as informators protection - has threatened these fundamental programs."</description><pubDate>2025-02-14 00:11:38</pubDate></item><item><title>Defense | World expense increased by 7.4% in 2024</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/13/defesa-despesa-mundial-aumentou-74-em-2024/</link><description>The world's expense with the defense sector increased by 7.4 percent in 2024, but European countries can be unlikely to keep their pace due to internal budget pressures, according to a study published yesterday.
According to the Military Balance 2025, produced by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), public expense with defense reached $ 2.46 billion last year, increasing in all regions of the world, except in sub -Saharan Africa.
European investment has grown in particular, especially the 23.2 percent increase of Germany, which would have surpassed the United Kingdom in military spending in second place in NATO behind the US.
IISS estimates that, as a whole, NATO European members spent $ 442 billion from the defense sector in 2024, less than a third of the total Atlantic alliance expense, which rises to $ 1.44 billion.
“With the persistence of budgetary pressures in most European countries, it is likely that it is difficult to maintain the increase in expenses. The burden is not widely shared, with some NATO countries to spend more than 3 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), while others remain below the base line of 2 percent, ”says IISS, in a statement.
In real terms, the European defense expense has grown 50 percent in nominal terms in the last decade, according to the Military Balance 2025, which every year makes an assessment of military capacities and the world -level defense economy.
The study includes updated data on military structures, equipment inventories and defense budgets from more than 170 countries.
IISS estimates that an increase to 3 percent of GDP from all European NATO members would grow the amount to grow more than $ 250 billion and nearly $ 750 billion if the 5 percent value was reached, as US President Donald Trump was suggested.
"However, these values ​​are unattainable at this time, with some countries resorting to extra-organizational instruments to reinforce budgets," the British Study Center acknowledges. As for the US, although this country spends in defense 3.39 percent of GDP, “limitations are evident in its industrial defense base” due to the need for investment and modernization, he says.
Complicated accounts
IISS estimates that Russia's military expenses increased 41.9 percent by 2024, overloading the budget for the equivalent of 6.7 percent of GDP, which is higher than the total of the European expense with the defense in terms of parity of purchasing power.
However, it states that the Russian economy remains resilient thanks to revenues from non -energetic sources, which allow you to maintain a reduced budget deficit and central bank measures.
According to the military balance, it is increasingly difficult to quantify the Russian expense with the defense due to financing by regional entities, private companies and even families, which pay equipment and basic provisions. About China, IISS accounts for internal reorganization and reforms to make the military structure more efficient, namely through the fight against corruption, investigation and increased capacities, namely equipment.
The Chinese budget in 2024 was estimated at about $ 235 billion, an increase of 7 percent compared to 2023 and an amount equivalent to 44 percent of total expenditure in Asia.</description><pubDate>2025-02-13 01:42:42</pubDate></item><item><title>Employment | Coutinho Alert Sam Hou Fai for Difficulties</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/27/emprego-coutinho-alerta-sam-hou-fai-para-dificuldades/</link><description>Deputy José Pereira Coutinho, as president of the Macao Public Function Association (ATFPM), gathered yesterday with the chief executive, Sam Hou Fai, regarding the preparation of the report of the Governing Action Lines (LAG) for this year.
Alongside Rita Santos, she also leader of ATFPM, the deputy asked the chief executive to pay more attention to the employment issue in Macau, noting that the lack of opportunities is general, not just for the Portuguese.
“It is becoming harder and harder for people who do not dominate the Chinese language to find a job. It seems to me a transverse issue that affects all people from Macao, especially the younger ones. We have [at ATFPM], curricula of people who have not been able to find a job for over two years, ”said Coutinho.
The deputy and associative manager highlighted the lack of employment in the area of ​​law for Portuguese citizens. “It is not easy for Portuguese citizens who want to come to Macao to find a job. We have cases of residents who came back after studying right, could not find work and then were forced to return to Portugal to do the internship. The economic and employment situation in Macau is serious and must be resolved with concrete and effective measures in order to reactivate the economy. ”
Moreover, Rita Santos and José Pereira Coutinho confirmed that they did not address the Portuguese's difficulty in obtaining the resident identity card (BIR), because "this is a very complex question and the chief executive knows what to do, this issue is not forgotten."
Increase to 97 patacas
Moreover, the meeting served to request wage increases in the civil service, so that this year, the value of each point of the Indian table is high from 94 patacas to 97 patacas. “Sam Hou Fai said to wait. We will see what arises in the LAG report, because other associations will be heard that may even be against salary update. You never know what others think, but from our part we insist that the chief executive do something about the updating of salaries, ”explained Coutinho.
ATFPM submitted a written document with all the suggestions that was the result of the participation of 19,300 members and “about 50,000 residents”, explains in a note. In this statement, it is described that "the prices of essential goods in Macau have recorded a constant increase, resulting in a significant decrease in resident purchasing power."
The two ATFPM officials also addressed the meeting the need for greater and better use of the Portuguese language by the Executive, regarding the reception of a letter, only in Chinese, the Directorate of Services for Labor Affairs (DSAL), about the departure of teachers from the Portuguese School of Macao.
“I insisted that the Portuguese language should have a high level of use, as there is a lack of language dissemination on several government websites and in the press release, as they are first sent in Chinese. Some signs also do not respect the Portuguese language well. We proposed to subsidize workers who dominate the two languages ​​so that they can play a better role, ”said Rita Santos.</description><pubDate>2025-02-27 02:08:22</pubDate></item><item><title>Security | Wong Sio Chak with new chief of staff</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/27/seguranca-wong-sio-chak-com-novo-chefe-de-gabinete/</link><description>Security Secretary Wong Sio Chak appointed Chang Cheong for the position of Chief of Staff.

The main areas of employers are hospitality, restoration and commerce, for table employees and retail sales.

Between 2022 and 2024, the Directorate of Services for Labor Affairs (DSAL) reported 667 cases of hiring minors, involving 1,333 young people. The director of the public organism that manages the labor questions, Wong Chi Hong, revealed in response to a written interpellation of Deputy Lei Chan U that the hires of young people, between 16 and 18 years old, were mainly for the sectors of hotel, restoration and trade by thick and retail.

Kitchen chiefs are increasingly experiencing melting dishes that incorporate international flavors, remaining faithful to Portuguese roots. The emergence of new gastronomic trends, such as “farm-to-table” and sustainable cuisine, reflects the growing awareness of the origin and quality of food. Social networks have also transformed the way culinary experiences are shared and perceived. Platforms like Instagram have made it easier for bosses to show their dishes to a global audience, attracting food enthusiasts and contributing to the promotion of macanese cuisine.
Through visually appealing presentations, bosses may involve customers and encourage the appreciation of intricate flavors of Luso-Macaense cuisine. Several academic analyzes of Macau's geogostronomic landscape reveal the complex interaction between culture and food. Scholars emphasize the concept of identity, illustrating how culinary practices reflect the cultural heritage and values ​​of the community. The mix of Portuguese and Chinese culinary traditions creates a distinct identity for Macao, reinforcing its position as a cultural cauldron.
The investigation suggests that gastronomic experiences are vital to fostering a sense of belonging among residents and promoting community ties. The culinary events and festivals that celebrate Luso-Macaense gastronomy further reinforce the community's involvement and promote a shared cultural identity, encouraging pride in local traditions and values. The role of Portuguese cuisine in Macau is ready for continuous evolution. The growing awareness of consumers for sustainability and health will probably shape culinary trends. Kitchen heads may prioritize the use of local and organic ingredients, while exploring innovative cooking techniques that honor traditional practices.
Promoting educational programs that emphasize the importance of culinary heritage can help ensure that future generations enjoy and continue the tradition of Portuguese gastronomy. By promoting connections between chefs and consumers, Macau can maintain his unique cuisine in a constantly changing global landscape. The role of Portuguese gastronomy in Macau serves as a rich example of how cultural and geographical factors intertwine to shape culinary practices. As Macau sails for contemporary influences and anticipates future developments, the essence of Portuguese cuisine continues to prosper and evolve, promising a vibrant and dynamic culinary future.
The evolution of macanese culinary culture is also influenced by the change in consumer habits and globalization. The increase in gastronomic tourism in Macao led to a greater interest in traditional dishes, as visitors eager for experiencing local flavors exploit the gastronomic landscape. Restaurants can respond by raising traditional recipes to exquisite gastronomic experiences. Events such as the “International Festival of Cities of Gastronomy, Macao” also promotes the appreciation for local cuisine, drawing attention to the skills of local bosses and the importance of culinary heritage.
In recent years, conscious effort has been assisted to preserve traditional methods, simultaneously integrating modern techniques and global influences. The introduction of elements such as molecular gastronomy begins to be a practice in various luxury restaurants in Macao, creating a new dialogue between traditional dishes and contemporary food science. These innovative approaches challenge the notion of authenticity, suggesting that tradition is not static but dynamic. While there are purists who advocate the preservation of original revenues, others advocate a reinterpretation that reflects contemporary food and preferences.
The sustainability of Macanese cuisine in the modern context is another critical area to examine. Environmental awareness began to influence culinary practices, with an increasing emphasis on the use of local ingredients. This change improves the freshness of foods served in Macanese restaurants. Establishments are increasingly highlighting their commitment to ecological practices and can integrate in their sustainable seafood menus and organic vegetables. These practices ensure that although the kitchen remains rooted in its historical context, it continues to evolve in a sustainable way.
In addition, the intersection of global trends had an impact on Macao's traditional culinary landscape. The global fascination with the melting kitchen encouraged bosses to experience unconventional combinations. This mixture of culinary traditions can be seen in the popularity of dishes such as the Macaense-Taieman lobster curry or almond cookies influenced by Portuguese and Chinese pastry techniques. These developments reflect the evolution of the taste of both local inhabitants and tourists, reflecting a broader culinary narrative that challenges traditional concepts of what constitutes macanese food.
The future of Macanese cuisine seems promising, characterized by continuous exploration of identity, innovation and cultural exchange. As the culinary scene evolves, it is crucial that chiefs and gastronomy enthusiasts find a balance between respect for traditional methods and the adoption of new techniques. The potential for greater international recognition remains strong, particularly in the field of exquisite restoration, where macanese flavors can be presented with modern interpretations.
However, challenges persist, namely as regards the preservation of authentic culinary practices. Discussions may arise around cultural appropriation as macanese dishes gain popularity and are adapted to various culinary contexts. The challenge lies in ensuring the maintenance of the integrity of traditional dishes and at the same time interacting effectively with a global audience. This dialogue enhances the delicate balance between adaptation and authenticity in culinary heritage.
Macau's Portuguese cuisine represents a rich tapestry of flavors formed through centuries of cultural exchange, innovation and adaptation. The historical context provides a basis for understanding how these diverse influences intertwined, leading to a distinct culinary identity.
Influential heads have defended this kitchen, ensuring its relevance in modern gastronomy, while sustainability efforts aim to keep it linked to local traditions. The interaction between tradition and modernity, authenticity and innovation will continue to shape the future of Macanese cuisine. The enthusiasm surrounding this culinary landscape promises to attract global interest, immortalizing the flavors and narratives that define this unique gastronomic heritage.</description><pubDate>2025-02-27 02:00:39</pubDate></item><item><title>Improve the economy of Macau (i)</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/26/aperfeicoar-a-economia-de-macau-i/</link><description>After Sam Hou Fai took office as the Chief Executive of Macao, he repeatedly expressed the desire to improve the region's economy, promoting moderate sector diversification and correcting the situation that leads to the game industry to master the city's economy.
Macao has positioned itself as a leisure city, but its tourist model is changing 'traditional sightseeing' to 'immersive tourism' and there are many closed stores on the city streets. According to data from the Directorate of Statistics and Census Services, there were 42,996 industrial and commercial spaces closed in June 2020. In December 2024, this number rose to 43,343. These data show that the economy has not yet completely recovered after the pandemic and that the work of the Macao government at the level of economic development has become difficult.
To stimulate the vitality of Macao's economy and benefit more residents of the city, several people argue that tourism should focus on the community rather than forwarding visitors to tourist attractions. Thus, the sales of stores in community areas can be increased, allowing more people to have access to tourism revenues and reducing the number of closed commercial spaces. Already part of this plan is the increase in the number of check-in points on Fulong Street and the appearance of many stalls in Coloane who sell top of gamma products.
But how can we lead tourists to consume in the community? Some say that this objective can be achieved through concerts. The process would organize free transportation to take people who visit community tourist locations to the concert room.
One of the reasons why Macau can successfully host these events is the fact that Hong Kong concert halls are always full. Macau can take the opportunity and provide alternative places. The concerts attract crowds so they are a great way to bring many tourists to Macau.
Currently, some travel platforms, in collaboration with concert organizers, sell tickets, in packages that include stay at the hotel, meals, transportation and other items. The package is cheaper than if purchases were made individually. This model reduces the cost of travel to Macau and can increase tourists the desire to consume in the city. If the project is enriched with tourist bus services to allow visitors to access directly to tourist sites in the community areas, naturally the possibility of consuming local commerce will increase and this will be a way to stimulate Macao's economy.
To achieve this goal, first it is necessary to ensure the success of the concert. Organizers have to sign a contract with the artists. But if there is more than an artist acting, you need to be very careful. The case that occurred with Messi, which was supposed to have played in Hong Kong, but ended up not playing, made the Raehk government have noticed that besides making a contract with a team, if they do not make individual contracts with all participants, the coming of some of them can be endangered.
Messi's episode inspired Macau. When a concert is organized, in order to be sure that the fears that call the most public will be present, it is necessary to sign separate contracts to ensure the presence of them all. Without this provisions, there is a possibility that some of these stars fail the concert.
After ensuring the presence of the star, the next step is the transportation organization for viewers. Should this bus be a traditional tourist bus? Due to the current tendency of immersive travels, tourists apparently prefer normal buses to experience the city's daily life. Perhaps the society of Macao may have this innovative idea, that is, to use the macao public transport buses to perform this tourist service. These vehicles would take visitors to community tourist sites and could transport local tourists and residents. In this way, tourists would not only have the feeling of traveling in a vulgar bus, but the number of tourists who expect in transportation and congested local buses would also be reduced. And this should be taken into account because tourists carry luggage that takes up a lot of space. Tour buses would only travel between concert sites and community tourist areas. The number of passengers would be relatively low and each would have enough space, which increases comfort. The decision that these trips are paid or free must fit the carrier company.
What will be the next step after guaranteeing concerts and tourist buses? Will tourists consume in community areas? We will give the answer next week.

We lost your blue gaze, framed by dark hair, and the sometimes innocent beauty of your convictions. We have lost its good mood, your belief in humanity, law and in a fairer society. We lost the good man, balanced and excellent companion. I personally lost my friend with whom, from 14 to 17 years old, I shared my life almost daily on the Camões High School, on the beaches of Costa da Caparica, in the first parties, in the shy experience of the first loves.
Already at that time Nuno Fernando Correia Neves Pereira was a lover of sport, a passion that accompanied him to the end. And it was the best of us when I played playing basketball or soccer. A predestined, it was said. Then came Full-Contact. I still went to see him, at the Coliseu dos Recreios in Lisbon, to hold a display combat in the first part of a display show of the famous Tarzan Taborda. On the way out, he confessed to me: “After 15 seconds it was already all sweaty. After 30 I was already tired. I can't imagine how difficult this is. ” And it was, but the difficulties didn't make him give up.
However, fate did not want him to completely surrender to the sports passion that inhabited him, perhaps because at 18 he brought him to Macau. Here he graduated in law, here was employed in the civil service as a lawyer, having arrived the head of department, here he taught at university, here fell in love, married and had two children: Nuno and Tatiana. Here I met him again when, years later, I also landed in the city of the name of God.
Regarding the law, Nuno was a burning scholar, connoisseur and defender of the right of Macao and its specificities. It fascinated the identity of this unique legislation, built on Portuguese law and local customs, especially because it understood that local law was an expression of the difference of this land and that difference is a synonym for cultural wealth. In this line he worked, taught and a very rare thing is certain: throughout Macao, from no one I heard a bad word about Nuno, which also does not amazed because he has never heard of his part a bad word about someone. This was Nuno: his criticism was never personal, but about ideas, facts or arguments. That is, as it should be and so scarce today is.
Nuno was not just someone interested in his profession, because he had an old love for literature and the arts. I read a lot and read a little of everything, the right chicken to José Saramago, passing by Jorge Amado and Fernando Pessoa. His interest in painting was also born early. At 16, knowing my devotion to The Doors, he offered me a beautiful portrait of Jim Morrison, painted by him the paint, which I hung in my room. He recently told me that he would now renovate he would devote himself to painting, after all the passion that he had never abandoned him either.
But fate didn't want to do so either, because fate is blind and stupid. How could we another way we could classify who stole us so, suddenly and gross, without a warning, without a note, a threat or a preface?
Yeah, Nuno: You could not leave without giving us a last lesson about our precarity, about the vacuum of our plans to laughable luck, about the need to live our lives today, in the face of tomorrow's uncertainty.
It was deleted, Nuno, but thanks. You didn't have to have left that suddenly, so unexpectedly, but thank you. And thank you for sharing with me part of your way and for all memories (O my God, how they robbed me this week!) Let me. For all: Thank you, Nuno, thank you very much.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Sam Hou Fai and Wu Sui</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/21/sam-hou-fai-e-wu-sui/</link><description>Everyone knows who Sam Hou Fai is, but Wu Sui, does anyone know who it is? I believe not only most Portuguese, but also many Chinese have never heard this name. However, in Chinese society, especially in Macao where popular beliefs are preserved, Wu Sui is an important figure because it is an “guardian deity” of the year of the serpent, responsible for supervising the happiness and misfortune of the human world.
Wu Sui was born in China 800 years ago during the Song Dynasty and served as a magistrate in Xuning County. During his mandate, Wu Sui exposed many hidden crimes and the neighboring neighbors often sought their help and advice to solve difficult cases. One year, there was a great drought and Wu Sui prayed in the temple for three days and three nights and ended up raining. To relieve the drought's impact on the people, Wu decreed the tax reduction and the rental of the land, providing help to 48,000 victims of this disaster. At that time, more than 400,000 refugees from other affected areas crossed the river to Xiuning and Wu Sui did all possible to help them. While other cities were immersed in chaos due to incidents of agitation, set fire, and withdrawals motivated by drought, the areas governed by Wu Sui remained peaceful and orderly, without anyone creating any problem. Therefore, it is not without reason that popular tradition elected Wu as the guardian divinity in the year of the serpent.
Due to the current complex and constantly changing international developments, it is believed that 2025 will be a year that happens once in every century and will have to face great challenges. Although crises and opportunities are hand in hand, not all leaders know how to “recognize change”, “respond to change” and “seek change”. Recently, Xia Baolong, the director of Hong Kong and Macau's work office and the Hong Kong and Macau Staff Office with the Council of State, visited the deepened cooperation zone between Guangdong and Macau in Hengqin, the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong (Hetao Innovation Zone) Zone), Modern Service Industry Zone between Qianhai district in Shenzhen and Hong Kong and the port of Yantian, where he was deeply involved in talks with employees responsible to strengthen cooperation between Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau and to promote the best of these cities in the Great Guangdong-Macau Bay area.
Hong Kong and Macao, in conjunction with Guangzhou and Shenzhen, were once seen as the four engines of the development of the Great Guangdong-Macau Bay. However, due to several factors, Hong Kong is still in the “transition from stability to prosperity” while “1+4” diversification in Macau is, for now, in an embryonic phase. If the Government of the MSAR cannot deal with cautious diversification, it will not be able to produce synergies in the Greater Guangdong-Macau Bay, but, on the contrary, the status of Macao will be at risk as a potential international financial center and as a world center of tourism and leisure. Therefore, director Xia is very concerned about the future development of Hong Kong and Macao.
Since Sam Hou Fai took office as chief executive, it is believed that his habit of “walking on the streets” has been changed, becoming more complicated for him to learn about the difficulties that the local population faces every day, related to the lack of employment and the closure of stores due to the breach of consumption. In addition to the fall in property prices, the cost of living is constantly increasing and radio programs are often heard from people asking the social risk value and old age pension to be increased. The beautiful idea of ​​“integration of Macao and Hengqin” cannot improve the current living level of short -term Macao residents. In the next lines of governing governing for the financial year of 2025, I sincerely hope that the government is actually concerned with the issues with which citizens have to deal with daily.
Sam Hou Fai passed from the judge of the last court, the Chief Executive, while Wu Sui moved as a magistrate to be a guardian deity of the popular tradition. However, both were confronted with the challenge of finding solutions to relieve the difficulties that people have to face.</description><pubDate>2025-02-21 01:31:21</pubDate></item><item><title>FRC | Saturday is “Tours with History” at Centro Kun Iam</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/27/frc-sabado-e-dia-de-passeios-com-historia-no-centro-kun-iam/</link><description>The Rui Cunha Foundation promotes this Saturday, from 15h, another edition of the initiative “Tours with History”, which are more than guided tours of places of historical or cultural interest of Macao with accompanying some expert. This time, it is up to sculptor Cristina Leiria, author of the project of the Kun Iam Ecumenical Center, to organize the visit
 
Saturday is the day of another edition of the initiative “Tours with History”, organized by the Rui Cunha Foundation (FRC), which promotes guided tours, in Portuguese and English, to Macao places with historical and cultural interest. This time the tour starts at 3 pm to the Kun Iam Ecumenical Center, and is led by Portuguese architect and sculptor Cristina Leiria, author of the original project inaugurated on March 21, 1999, recently renewed and reopened on December 11, 2024.
The Kun Iam Ecumenical Center was a project designed by the author, with the support of UNESCO, “aiming to perpetuate mutual respect and friendship between all peoples and civilizations,” according to the IC official page. The public art complex measures 32 meters high in total, 20 of which refer to the bronze statue of the goddess Kun Iam, which weighs 50 tons.
“The base of the statue, in the form of lotus flower, consists of the contemplation room where one can rest, listen to music and read. In the decoration of the summit the artists of Macau, Kwok Woon and Joana Ling painted, on rice paper, figures, symbols and texts related to Lao Tse, Confucius, Mence and Buddha, ”says IC information.
The lower floor offers a multipurpose room, with a capacity of 50 people, dedicated to concerts, conferences, movie viewing and other multicultural activities, such as art exhibitions.
Active exposure
Currently, there is the individual exhibition of Cristina Leiria, “moments of light with kun iam”, at the invitation of the IC to mark the conclusion of the restoration and conversion work in a multipurpose cultural tourism space, 25 years after the author's presence at its inauguration. The show, which extends until March 13, displays statues of the goddess Kun Iam and other associated works, in materials such as Jade, Crystal, Wood or Brushed Steel, and is complemented by images and videos that portray the process of design and construction of the ecumenical center, making known to the public behind the scenes of your planning and building.
Born in Lisbon on April 25, 1946, Cristina Rocha Leiria lived in Mozambique between both and 17, when she returned to study architecture at the Higher School of Fine Arts, and later took a specialization course at University College in London. He deepened studies on Feng Shui, in Macao, China and Japan, and electromagnetism in France, having exercised in such different places as the United Kingdom, Mozambique, Rhodesia, South Africa, Portugal and Macao.
The construction of the Kun Iam Ecumenical Center was a challenge launched by the then governor of Macao, Vasco Rocha Vieira (recently deceased), which is a space where silence has a place to exist in a specific place. The statue dedicated to the goddess Kun Iam is 20 meters high and is made of bronze, having plenty of spiritual meaning for most Orientals.</description><pubDate>2025-02-27 01:57:11</pubDate></item><item><title>Cinema | Selected 13 documentaries and shorts in contest</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/26/cinema-seleccionados-13-documentarios-e-curtas-em-concurso/</link><description>The Cultural Institute (IC) has chosen 13 documentary and short film projects in the genres fiction and animation, for the third phase of the “Macau-The Power of Image 2024” program, a contest that aims to financially support young local filmmakers.

The poster, promoted by the Consulate General of India in Hong Kong and Macau, features titles such as “Dangal”, with the great star of Indian cinema Aamir Khan, “Hellaro”, and “Zindagi at Milegi Dobara” and “RRR”
 
Bollywood movie lovers, based on romantic stories, with adventure and a lot of dance, will have two days to see some films of this industry, starring the big stars of Indian cinema.
In an unprecedented initiative in the territory, the first Indian film festival takes place at the Passion Cinematheque on the weekend of March 1 and 2, with the organization of the Consulate General of India in Hong Kong and Macao and support from the Association of Indian Culture in Macao, chaired by Vitor Kumar.
The festival starts with the movie “Dangal”, starring Aamir Khan, which will be screened between 10am and 1 pm March 1. The film mixes sports and action, telling the story of the former wrestling fighter Mahavir Singh Phogat, who passes the teachings of this sport to his daughters, Babita and Geeta. The young women won the 2010 Commonwealthy games, becoming two well-known fighters throughout India, winning the silver and gold medals in this mode respectively. "Dangal" debuted in 2016.
Also on March 1, between 15h and 17h, "Hellaro" will be aired, a "story that tells the journey of a woman to freedom through dance", describes the organization. Dating from 2019, the film portrays the story of a woman who is trying to overcome herself, facing the most diverse challenges to get what she wants.
The second day
The Indian Film Festival continues on March 2, this time with the screening of “Zindagi at Milegi Dobara”, a film centered on the story of three childhood friends who make a three -week trip in Spain. The tour ends up changing the perceptions and ideas they had from life to date, gaining new ideas about friendship and love. The screening of the film runs between 10:30 and 13h.
The festival is closed with “RRR - revolt, rebellion and revolution”, aired from 2:30 pm to 6:00 pm on the same day. This film was known for the best soundtrack award awarded in the Oscars with “Naatu Naatu”, leading India to win a prize of this category for the first time. The song eventually became viral on social networks.
The 2022 film focuses on the story of a brave warrior who embarks on a dangerous mission where he meets a police that serves the British army. The film is thus an epic saga passed in India from the period prior to the independence of the United Kingdom.</description><pubDate>2025-02-26 01:31:10</pubDate></item><item><title>Exhibition | “Show-off 3.0” shows works by three local personalities</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/25/exposicao-show-off-3-0-mostra-obras-de-tres-personalidades-locais/</link><description>This Wednesday is inaugurated the exhibition “Show-off 3.0”, promoted by the Vila da Taipa Cultural Association, which presents a new concept of show: instead of exhibiting works of an artist, art pieces acquired by local personalities are revealed. This time the choice falls on the pieces of Lúcia Lemos, Carlos Morais José and Rita Machado
 
The Vila da Taipa Cultural Association presents, from this Wednesday, a new exhibition. This is “Show-off 3.0”, which as the name implies is the third edition of a show of local collectors, that is, what is presented to the public are works of art of Macao personalities or residing in the territory, rather than exposing the work of an artist.
Thus, “Show-off 3.0” has pieces acquired by Lúcia Lemos, founder of the Creative Macau Gallery; Carlos Morais José, director of HM and author; and Rita Machado, architect. This project is born after verifying a “cultural influence brought to the community by the first exhibition of the series”.
According to a statement from the organization, this trio of personalities "shares the impressive collections that have accumulated over the years, both local and international, including works of art that adorn the most intimate spaces of their homes."
In this show, “ideas related to art collecting, aiming to promote collecting as a cultural good that starts from an individual initiative, but can also widen the sense of community, foster its vitality and add diversity to local economies”. The organization of this exhibition considers that collecting art also enhances the commerce itself in this segment, besides “fostering local and international talent”, and in “Show-off 3.0”, as in the other editions, “aspects of the collector's personality” are revealed.
Frames so I want you
Lúcia Lemos, who for years has been at the head of Creative Macau, presents “a collection composed mainly by vibrant and colorful paintings of local and foreign artists”. “Lúcia Lemos has been involved in promoting local artists for over two decades, through the interpretation of various means, including painting, graphic design, 3D art, photography and cinema. She is also a director of the International Short Festival Shortages Sound &amp; Image Challenge since 2010. Being a plastic artist herself, who has developed her abilities in black and white photography and video, her special relationship with the images results from the many years of exposure to the artistic environment of the Portuguese city of Porto, ”says the organization.
Following is Carlos Morais José, a degree in Anthropology, but always dedicated himself to journalism, being director of HM for several years. In addition, he founded several publishers, namely Cod and Books do Meio, and the latest literary edition project is the publisher “Grão-Fala”, based in Lisbon, with the focus of editing works on Chinese and Asian culture in Portuguese. He is also a poet and author.
“Carlos Morais José's collection refers to a subtle and complex relationship between a scholar and a gongshi who sees stones-rocks with a particular aesthetic beauty-which at the uncooked look seem to be just decorative stones, but that leads the sneelful to look into issues that transcend his appearance,” he describes.
Rita Machado, architect linked to the Atelier Impromptu Projects, presents works of art that are based on "in relationships she has maintained with many local and international artists, and with some of which has established lasting friendships."
Rita Machado “is interested in the intersections between Western and Eastern culture, urban design and architectural design”, having graduated in architecture at the University of Porto with the thesis “Macau, City (In) Finite”.
João Ó, architect and president of the Vila da Taipa Cultural Association, described that it is “an honor to invite three art collectors to show its various art collections in Vila da Taipa, after the success of our experimental exhibitions in the last two years”.
"This rare and special exposure aims to explore the nature of collecting and raise visually stimulating conversations about the cultural possessions of individuals with very specific and highly personal interests," he said. The show can be seen until April 30, intending to “further reinforce the position of Taipa village as one of the main cultural and artistic destinations of Macao, underlining its invaluable contribution to the promotion of the cultural and creative industries of the territory”.</description><pubDate>2025-02-25 05:31:08</pubDate></item><item><title>Transmac | “Deepseek” introduced in company functions</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/27/transmac-deepseek-introduzida-em-funcoes-da-empresa/</link><description>Transmac bus operator will use the “Deepseek” platform, Chinese Artificial Intelligence (AI) tool to improve aid in various company management and maintenance operations.

The legislator linked to the community of Fujian said yesterday that it is time to update penalties for those who violate the law, accepted methods of proof collection and settle the periods in which it is forbidden to make noise.
Speaking to the Macau Forum of Macao's Forum of Macau channel, the deputy cited data from the Directorate of Environmental Protection Services (DSPA) that reveal the presentation of 10,554 complaints for noise in 2024. Although the number of complaints came down to 2021 and 2022, Nick Lei points out that 99 percent of the complaints filed.
The fact that the DSPA does not indicate reasons for the filing, whether they were resolved or what kind of follow -up was given, raises doubts to the deputy, who theorizes that perhaps some of these filments should simply be due to the owners of fractions from which the noise does not open the door.
Another situation that can result in archiving is the suspension of noise during the visit of the DSPA agents, and the return of noise as soon as they go. In the optics of Nick Law, these situations can reveal gaps in the law that need to be collapse.</description><pubDate>2025-02-27 01:31:24</pubDate></item><item><title>Firefighters | Investigated for falsifying attendance records</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/27/bombeiros-investigado-por-falsificar-registos-de-assiduidade/</link><description>A head of an operational station is being investigated for leaving Macao at the same time as it sting the point and said it was working
 
The Public Prosecution Service (MP) is investigating a head of an Operational Post of the Fire Department (CB) for the crime of “falsification committed by an employee”, which may entail a five -year imprisonment. The information was released yesterday by the Commissioner Against Corruption (CCAC), who conducted a preliminary investigation.
According to CCAC, the investigation took place due to a complaint, received last year about the attendance of the head of the operational post, who despite chopping the point was absent from work.
Following the investigations, the CCAC concluded that "the chief in question was absent from the region twice, between December 2023 and May 2024, during the time of service or during the complementary work period." In addition, on three other occasions "he was absent from the operational post for more than an hour," then returning only to "chop up the point, falsely claiming that during the periods concerned, he was providing complementary work."
From the perspective of CCAC, this conduct of the Firefighter had the “intention to hide false situations of comparison to the service”. The head of the post risks responding criminal for the crime of forgery committed by an employee, who has a penalty expected from one year to five years in prison. If the final penalty applied is less than three years may be suspended.
In addition to criminal investigation, the CCAC has reported that succeeded to the Fire Department “for proper follow -up”, which should mean the existence of an internal disciplinary proceedings. In the statement, the CCAC also warned “the civil service workers” to be “aware and comply with the law”, having requested more rigor in the self -discipline of the “agents of authority”.
General concerns
In turn, the CB issued a statement to declare it to be "very concerned about the incident" and revealed that it "immediately instituted a disciplinary process against the offender."
In addition to accompanying the case of the firefighter, the internal supervision instructions were also updated and there will be an “exhaustive review of the procedures and advisory control guidelines” to avoid similar cases.
This is not the first case of falsification of attendance in recent years by security workers. In 2023, another CCAC investigation concluded that the chief of a customs post and six subordinates had falsified the attendance records to avoid penalties for early delays or exits from work.
The case, which also began from a complaint, was more elaborate than presented yesterday, since it involved the duplication of the presence cards, so that the point could be bitten by other employees.</description><pubDate>2025-02-27 01:30:02</pubDate></item><item><title>DSEC | Foreign trade in goods fell 11.2% in January</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/27/dsec-comercio-externo-de-mercadorias-caiu-112-em-janeiro/</link><description>In January there was an annual drop of 11.2 percent in the total amount of foreign trade, which was 11.90 billion patacas.

The Cultural Institute (IC) announced the suspension of the license attributed to the recording of a film in the territory that resulted in the run over 12 people. The case happened on Monday, when a scene with a car at high speed was being filmed on the seminary street. The production team responsible for the film was accused of not following guidelines from the Public Security Police Corps (CPSP).
"The Cultural Institute summoned an interdepartal meeting and, based on the opinions of various services, issued a notice of suspension of the project license to the filming entity, as the filming team did not fulfill the relevant requirements during filming," was informed, through a statement issued on Tuesday at the end of the night. "At this time, the filming entity cannot perform the project filming activities in Macao and later, the IC will require the filming entity to deliver a report, not excluding the revocation of the filming authorization warning," he was added.
The IC acknowledged that before approving the authorization for the recordings had access to the script and classified the "content of filming" as "complex". And in a meeting prior to filming, such as different services, it will have informed producers who could not record scenes with high speed cars in that place: “At the meeting [approval of the authorization], the competent services have expressly expressed that this place is unable to shoot the vehicle to the drift. Representatives of the filming entity learned of opinion of approval services, ”was reported.

At the Tuesday meeting that resulted in the suspension of the license also participated CPSP, the Directorate of Services for Traffic Affairs (DSAT), the Institute for Municipal Affairs (AMI) and the Directorate of Services for Labor Affairs (DSAL). "Based on the opinions of various services, the IC immediately issued a warning of the project's filming license because this project is suspected of causing obvious disorders to public order, safety or tranquility, and the filming entity may not at this time make the project's filming activities in Macao," he was justified.
Regarding the damage caused to public facilities, the IC pointed out that "the competent services will follow the case."
Prior to the statement, also on Tuesday, CPSP organized a press conference and announcing that the instructions issued had not been followed by the producers, as it had been established that the site was not suitable for high speed road circulation.

A renovated Ukrainian, with the same name of the president, guilty Zelensky about the extension of the conflict that destroyed his village. Zelensky, the village, who has never left his land, now lives mortified because his favorite gravedigger died in the bomber.
This Zelensky, the village, represents half the world that reproves the other Zelensky, the villain, for not wanting to negotiate with Putin.
Negotiate what? The invader enters us through the house, pies us the wife and daughter (cf. recent UN report on Ukraine violations in this “special operation”), an act that forced us to watch, and then we say: Alto there, we are for peace, but we have to negotiate: You have not said the name you want to give to children!
A peace that is not worthy is but a cessation of rights. As severe as Russophobia that Putin inflicts his people.

In a lunch with several guests I hear a friend, who declares himself a spiritist, explaining about the particularities of his belief, in a serene and balanced way, would even say, without "irrationalism". He discussed long and serenely, devoid of any fanatical proselytizing. “Here is someone to whom belief brought weighting!” I thought, a rare alliance.
However, at one point a phrase that horrify me. He says, “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!” And I enter the voracious fauces of holism. Because holismo has a pathological aspect like all good things, a side of shadow.
Two examples: In Hinduism there is less sensitivity to existential dramas, if that child suffers in this life this is only an expression of the strict karmic symmetry, an effect of the acts she committed in her previous life. In Africa it is not accepted that death may have been accidental, and many women are accused by the dead family of having caused her husband's death, in an act of manifest dementia, and, in the blatant majority of cases, in a huge injustice to his wife - madness that spreads and infiltrates the social fabric.
Buddhism has introduced compassion and Christianity to Caritas, trying to break with this logic, but in many other beliefs and religions the cage of causalities prevails over sensitivity to experience, the need to respond to the now.
It is a tremendous logic that transforms the world into a platonic stage, where we are just the shadows of something -an inextricable law -in a determinism that calcines all singularities, but strangely fascinates many.
The conquest of modernity has anchored in the conquest of chance and random, subtracting the incidences of a life to this fierce determinism that closed the world in a web. When the Renaissance freed the body from the influence of the stars, at this moment sexuality was relieved of guilt and individualism and their volition could emerge.
There is an unequivocal moral implication in the phrase “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!”, Which should work as a key to self-knowledge and self-judgment, but usually this phrase is managed to seek a reason for things abroad from us in the other. It is an alibi.
There is a holistic temptation in the world today, as in the Middle Ages there was a satanic temptation, without great reflection on its consequences. Because it is not enough we want to connect everything in a resonant chain of affection. Even the most unexpected: affection itself can kill.
I realize, thanks to this cultured, balanced, intelligent woman, that “the combat” moved at the beginning of this century. One of the great misconceptions of the twentieth century was the false dichotomy between "rationalism and irrationalism", a debate that extended to all fields, including art. First, rationality was confused (the positive side of reason) with rationalism (the pathological feature of reason), and articulated in this lack of discernment was confused irrationalism with freedom. Almost all the art of the twentieth century, with surrealism to the head, worked in this error. The fallacy still exists despite having consolidated the emergence of 'irrationalism' and the consequent relativist currents that followed it. Essentially much of what happened in the twentieth century, it turned around this shock between two paradigms: rationalism versus irrationalism.
Now, I see, the indetermination, chance, the random of the terrible temptation of the causal cage. Holism, in its pathological feature, can be the reductionism that is the way it puts the way as a new 'eschatological narrative'.
Is it "by chance" that the holism emerges at the moment when neo-liberalism and its cynical contempt for the human person besides all freedoms, all acquired rights?
Holistic consciousness has brought positively a greater ecological awareness but followed by scholastic rigor drifting reality under the blanket of a determinism that is much more than inconvenience: all great authoritarian ideologies are holistic.
My friend will know how to combine her holistic and transpersonal belief with the freedom and responsibility that every moment asks us - but how many will make the destruction, under a law that explains and encompasses everything?
How many will not be abandoned to what it is?
The awareness of the indeterminate brings tragic conscience, as the Greeks knew, but also brings the will and the courage of the decision. And of this we cannot abdicate.
In addition, as Drummond shows in Carlos Drummond de Andrade's poem “Quadrilha”:
"John loved Teresa who loved Raimundo/ who loved Maria who loved Joaquim who loved Lili/ who did not love anyone./ John went to the United States, Teresa to the convent,/ Raimundo died of disaster, Maria stayed to aunt,/ Joaquim suicide himself and Lili married J. Pinto Fernandes/ who had not entered the story."
Real always runs outside the track, in full exteriority to our concepts. This is what is worth a J. Pinto Fernandes at the exact moment we thought we had everything under control.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Nobel and others</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/17/do-nobel-e-outros/</link><description>9/10/22
Reading many people's reactions when the Nobel Prize in this year's literature was announced, I couldn't help but remind me of this repair of Jean-Pierre Siméon, in relation to another Nobel Prize: “An editor of a large national newspaper wrote five lines of indignation because the Nobel Prize for Literature, a complete stranger. But unknown to whom? How did not occur to this patented and paid literary columnist to do his work, that his apparent ignorance was a matter of incorrect professional conduct? Tranströmer was translated into many languages, it was available in French. »
There is always the choir of those who wait for the announcement of the prize to complain about not being invited to the jury of the prize, there is a subgroup of Irados that professes “never read and I will not bother to read”; It is an uncommon fauna, which inhabits social networks.
I don't always know all the winners-I was unaware of the existence of Louise Glück, who I find a great poet, or the Olga Tokarczuk, for example-but it only brings me the comfort of knowing that the world is not a soap opera where everyone knows each other and the joy of recognizing that the gauge of the world is not measured with my short measure and that on the contrary it gives me a new opportunity to face the unknown.
And perhaps the most cretin of reactions was the smart one who wrote, but there are still those who read French? Confirming only that today there is a new kind of ignorance that fires with a displeasure: the one who only read English.
I would also prefer that, in French, Pascal Quignard, Linda reads, or even Sollers, or, among the new ones, Mathias is awarded, but that does not take dignity to the work of Annie Ernaux (and it would be enough to have written the “Les Années”). There are books of her that I like less, like the vulgar "a simple passion," but this happens with almost every authors, they have a channel books and others that are like intervals in their itinerary. I advise reading a beautiful book of interviews with her, "L'Ecriture Comme un couteau".

Yesterday came an article in Maputo's morning “News”, realizing that the Pen Club narrative prize was assigned to my wife, Teresa Noronha, for her soap opera “Tornado”, which had already had the Maria Velho da Costa award.
The summary they made of the book does not even deserve comments, by pathetic, but what matters to highlight is the note of disqualification about their "Mozambicanity" by calling it Luso-Mozambican. It is not inaccurate, but for those who know the context, it is a dirty touch.
Because finally, following the same logic, Adelino Timóteo should be called Tsonga-Mozambican, to Álvaro Taruma-Mozambican, and Macua-Mozambican to the writers who are from the north, etc., etc. Which is not reported to happen.
At the beyond moment, in the soap opera, she writes:
«Our color has never been dominant. In colonial time we were not white, we were ripped from monories, gone mugs, the pejorative term to speak of a son of Goes and Portuguese. In the postcolonial period, I was not black and if, in Lisbon, they took me by Brazilian or Cape Verdean, already in France were lost in cogitations of where they would be and amazed when they found out it was African. There I had to explain my DNA's wanderings before relying on moorms. It took me a long time to accept that it was so because yes, and that it was no curse that were so; On the contrary, I could even discover intense patterns of fantasy and freedom in this shrewd cloak that is our genealogy… »
In the current Mozambique it is white… and this is overlapping it soon to what it does or what it is.
It is sad, but as Naipaul warned, through these stops the race is everything and is soaked in it as deeply as, elsewhere, in religion.

Bruno Latour, an anthropologist who studied the sciences and their procedures and legitimations, law, technique and religions died and entertained themselves to turn the guts to the dogmas of the “modern”. For him the place, the expert's function, was more defined by the perplexity he embodied than for the supposed truth he would support him.
He proposed, as an alternative to the kinds of multiculturalism and his mistaken password "all different all the same", the return to "diplomacy", given precisely, not from the presupposition that "we are unified because participants of the same nature" but simply reveal that we "do not yet share an ordinary world"; It is necessary to deal frontally with the "abyss of disagreement" that separates us, rather than wanting to delude it.
And about politics said, disassessedly:
«If transparency is required from the politician, we kill him; If one requires fidelity to what the other was or he says, kills him; If a mimetic relationship is required between what the crowd wants and what its representative says, the representation is killed. These must, therefore, by definition, betray, deceive, modify, distort the word. Without this ability to double the word and betray, political language would not exist. I put the perfectly plausible hypothesis that political vocabulary will become as inaccessible as the religious language of the last twenty, three or fifty years. (in “UN Monde Pluriel plus Commun”). I believe it will be missed to decipher this frantically complex world that fit us.</description><pubDate>2022-10-17 02:18:03</pubDate></item><item><title>The yo -yo</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/30/o-fuxi/</link><description>O my friends, companions of these funerals trips to countries as old as the stars and the moon, and as strange as the profound interior of our disgraceful souls, - that startle still awaits us, what secret spells we will have to overcome, what horrors will rise to our dilated pupils of amazement and terror?
Increasingly close to our precarious existences, howling the war monster, which threatens to merge humanity with the earth, incessantly traveled by the squalid spectrum of hunger and the invisible evil of ten thousand pests.
O human human, who cries superior to his own nature, but then reveals to you, once and again, unable to simply order your existence and do not understand that you are possessed by the fickle wrath and are slave to your own ambition! Do not be content with the white jade or the light gold, there is no treasure that gives you your inextinguishable thirst for other men, animals and things; for in you an eternal anguish in you; in you crawl the expelled snakes; For you grows, powerful and impossible, the very fertile ivy of evil!
This is perhaps why on the mound they call the white deer, where one of the eight immortals in sacred mount was evolved through the skies to Penglai, inhabits the fuxa, a bird whose form resembles that of the rooster, although topped by a human head. What strange copulas, what monstrous amplexes, what terrible procedures will have occurred to make the existence of this animal sinister possible? We do not know, but it is enough for our exhausted mind to dare to raise an answer, so we soon feel the skin traveled by horrendous goose bumps and the heart trigger in paraded, which wild horse beaten by the night whip of fear, oblivious to reins and containment.
May men refrain from going through the Mount of the deer, because although there are riches capable of calming the most misunderstanding ambitions, if they have the disgraced fortunate to glimpse a fuxa, it will be immediately triggered the cultivated fields, because it will be beheaded the soft animals, for it will be sacrificed the best young man and destroyed superb from countries.
Fuxi emits a sound that resembles its name. If you hear it, dark night or clear day, goose way, for the path where you find you is the most right of the ways for misfortune!</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Procrastinators Club</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/29/clube-dos-procrastinadores/</link><description>Walking in rereading of Easter, because of an article I prepare, I give this excerpt, extracted from “the universal man”:
«Every man morally is one and absolute; But you have to live with your personality to mitigate. (…) Coexistence is only possible among people reduced to a negative or hollow presence, which is constantly giving in. Hence, the emptiness of society, a huge ghost composed of numerous deceased. An upper man is antisocial or criminal. Its destination is jail and desert.
He is in thinking about whether she reflects here about the political-social conditioning that gagging, and worse, in a sad country as Portugal was in the middle of the Estado Novo (and the book is from 1931) where any possibilities of spontaneity and frankness in human relations were coarcet, or only lends the behavior of men (oppressed) a metaphysical frame, a “essence”, from a presumption of each one in the presumption of each one be in isolation “one and absolute”. Sometimes, to an excess of spirituality (or longing), it adds to Pascoaes to lack the world. He is a great poet, but he is a poet who takes gray-Jewish ampoules and is therefore written amiiude on a programmatic furor, ceasing to have pores; There is often a glass between him and the real, the same one who made him wring the Ballet, 1921: “Everything is ghost. There are only clouds, clouds of voices, clouds of souls, afflictions and tragedies! Clouds and more clouds, appearances and more appearances! It is a divine lightning that pierces them, the instant appearance that arises and throws us to the ground, dazzled! »
Sometimes I would like to remind him, as Antonio Sérgio did in the article “Regeneration and Tradition, Moral and Economy”, which dedicated to Easter: “Easter, Easter my dear friend: You are a pure, excellent and noble poet, but also a victim of this social environment, like us all: this horrible isolation that you praise and I”.
"As a child, he stole two melos," says Jacinto do Prado Coelho, stole him from a nest, and throb his lifetime remorse for it. The person, few more mischief is known to him. Only in Álvaro de Campos sprouts a twinge of evil and obscenity: “Oh, and ordinary and dirty people who always seem the same,/ who employs profanity as usual words,/ whose children steal at the grocery door/ and whose daughters at eight years-and I think this is beautiful and I love him! -/ masturbate decent -looking men on the stairs. » (Ode triumphal).
Both poets beaten by a certain idea of ​​holiness, they were identical to the inability of breaking the siege of the skin with the overflow of the dike, the same curse of sublimating Eros's concrete ferocity with the mansuity of the verses.
Of course, they are the two "Bigger Than Life", but sometimes unnerves to watch, from my hostor's post at the Procrastinators Club, to the tantrums between them, just to see who occupies, in the internal organization, the place of president and treasurer.
Although a person has guessed more, for example, this he wrote in the least known martial ode and that is declining in the situation we live today, differently, with the heart in his hands:
«Ode martial

State Council's Taiwan Cabinet spokesman Zhu Fenglian described the incident at a press conference as a “common maritime accident” and accused Progressive Democratic Party authorities (DPP), “exaggerating and deliberately politicizing” the incident without clarifying “the facts and responsibilities”.
The ship allegedly involved in the incident, identified as Hong Tai, of Togo Flag, with eight Chinese crew members on board, was associated with China by the Taiwan Coast Guard, which fed the tensions between the two governments.
However, the spokeswoman stressed that “more than a hundred similar incidents happen every year around the world”, minimizing the importance of the incident.
"This kind of political manipulation is unpopular and will not gain public support," said Zhu, referring to the position of the Taiwanese authorities. The deputy accused the DPP of trying to take "political advantage" from the case, a strategy that, according to Beijing, will not be successful.
Taiwan currently has 14 international and ten domestic submarine cables, according to the Taiwan National Security Office, which estimated that the island is an average of seven to eight cable cutters per year.
The incident occurred around 3:00 am on Tuesday, when CGA received a report from Chungwha Telecom, Taiwan's largest telecommunications company, indicating that the third submarine line that connects Taiwan to fishermen if he had left about six nautical miles northwest of the southern Jiangjun port.

“Hong Kong Disneyland Resorts has achieved the best commercial performance ever in the history of the complex (…). It remains one of the main engines of tourism, ”said the company's executive director Michael Moriarty in a statement.
The Hong Kong theme park is the smallest Disneyland in the world and fought for years to establish itself before reaching profitability in the early 2010 decade. The company then faced fierce competition after Shanghai opened a Disneyland in 2016. The losses worsened when the park was closed for months during the Covid-19 pandemic.
The entry of local visitors, Chinese from the interior of the country and international tourists exceeded last year the levels of 2018, said the company.
The local inhabitants represented about 40 percent of visitors, a slice similar to that of tourists from the interior of China being, the remaining from Taiwan, Philippines and Thailand.

Peters' visit to China occurs after Beijing has reached an agreement with the Cook islands, criticized by New Zealand, and the NeoZelaland Defense Minister claimed that Chinese war ships have sailed in waters near New Zealand and Australia over the past two weeks with "extremely capable" weapons.
"The comprehensive strategic partnership between China and New Zealand is entering its second decade," said Han, quoted by the official news agency Xinhua. The official added that China attributes "great importance to the development of relations with New Zealand."
According to Han, Beijing is willing to work to “implement the important consensus achieved by the leaders of both countries, improve mutual understanding and promote sustained, solid and stable development” of ties.

The amount will be spent on “New Type Infrastructure” to allow the city to “fully compete” on emerging sectors such as Artificial Intelligence (IA), said Mayor of Shenzhen, Qin Weizhong, at the local government's annual summit, which began on Tuesday.
The report presented by the mayor puts the economic growth target for this year at 5.5 percent, along with other objectives, such as the creation of 200,000 new jobs. Shenzhen is part of the Great Bay area project - a world metropolis, built from Hong Kong and Macau, and nine cities in Guangdong Province, through the creation of a single market and growing connectivity between roads, rail and sea roads.
Guangdong has stipulated as a goal to grow 5 percent this year, although in the last three years it has not achieved its objectives in the context of a slowdown of the Chinese economy, and despite being the most exported Chinese province.
The city of Shenzhen faces growing competition from other major Chinese technology centers, including Hangzhou, which is based on emerging companies such as the DeepSek AI platform and the UNITEE Robotics company.
Once a fishing village located on the Hong Kong border, Shenzhen has become a global base for the manufacture of electronic products and headquarters of the country's main technological firms, such as the Huawei telecommunications group, the BYD electric automobile manufacturer or the Tencent Internet giant after China opened the market economy in the 1980s.</description><pubDate>2025-02-27 01:53:38</pubDate></item><item><title>Beijing criticizes US arms sales to Taiwan</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/27/pequim-critica-venda-de-armas-dos-eua-a-taiwan/</link><description>China yesterday criticized the sale of weapons from the United States to Taiwan, while one of its leading leaders promised more efforts to meet, coinciding with Beijing military maneuvers off the southern coast of the island.

Hands in the pockets
In January, Beijing responded to the rates imposed by US President Donald Trump-10 percent on imports from all Chinese products-at a rate of 10 percent to 15 percent over certain US products, as well as new export controls of essential minerals and an investigation against the Google American technology giant.
China has also protested against the latest US rates of 25 percent on steel and aluminum imports, as it exports these materials to other countries, such as Canada and Mexico, which in turn sell them to the US.</description><pubDate>2025-02-27 01:51:23</pubDate></item><item><title>South Korea | Central Bank reduces interest rates due to poor growth</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/26/coreia-do-sul-banco-central-reduz-taxas-de-juro-devido-ao-fraco-crescimento/</link><description>South Korea Central Bank yesterday reduced interest rates by 0.25 percentage points to 2.75 percent a month after reviewing the forecast for economic growth.
The cut takes place after the Korea Bank (Bok) had kept the reference rates unchanged in December and was the third reduction since October. This after the Central Bank had kept the interest rate on the rise for four years and five months, for fear of the high levels of inflation left by the Covid-19 pandemic.
In the monetary policy report for 2025, the South Korean Central Bank said new rate cuts aim to "maintain the moderate pace of inflation growth," as well as "mitigating risks to the economy." In the document, Bok promised to be more attentive to avoid any volatility in the financial markets, in the midst of the uncertainty caused by the return to power in the United States of Donald Trump.
The prospects for South Korea exports are more modest after Trump's reelection, which promised to impose tariffs on imports, including the automotive industry, one of the key sectors for the South Korean economy.
Yesterday's decision stressed Bok's policy focus on economic growth, as on January 20, the institution had reviewed the forecast for growth in 2025 of Asia's fourth largest economy from 1.9 to 1.5 percent.
"The unexpected statement of martial law in early December, along with the continuous political instability and disaster of the Jeju Air passenger plane, significantly affected economic sentiment," the Central Bank underlined.
The accident and the political crisis "led to contractions in domestic consumption and investment in construction, which probably pushed the fourth quarter growth rate well below the November projection," said the Central Bank.</description><pubDate>2025-02-26 01:53:22</pubDate></item><item><title>North Korea Delegation arrives in the Russian capital for an official visit</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/26/delegacao-da-coreia-do-norte-chega-a-capital-russa-para-visita-oficial/</link><description>A high-level delegation from the North Korean single party arrived in Moscow for an official visit to the party's party invitation in Russia, the North Korean state press said yesterday.
The delegation of the North Korean Workers Party, led by Ri Hi-Yong, a member of the North Central Committee Politburo, landed in the Russian capital on Monday after an invitation from the United Russian Party, the official North Korean news agency KCNA said.
Andrey Klimov, a member of the United Russian Party Supreme Committee and deputy chief of the party's foreign activities, received the North Korean delegation to his arrival at the airport, KCNA said without further details.
The visit occurs at a time when the United States began negotiations to end Russia's Ukraine invasion, which has been supported by thousands of North Korea troops on the ground. New US President Donald Trump said on Monday that the priority was to reach an agreement to end the war in Ukraine, although he was open to a ceasefire as a preliminary step for deeper negotiations.
Since signed a mutual defense treaty last year, Pyongyang and Moscow have reinforced bilateral cooperation in defense, economy, sports and various other fields.
Historical moment
Relations between North Korea and Russia, which share only 20 kilometers of border, were intensified in mid-2024, with Russian President Vladimir Putin's first visit to Pyongyang since 2000.
According to South Korean, Ukrainian and Western sources, Pyongyang provided Moscow large amounts of ammunition in exchange for the transfer of civil, spatial and military technology.
In addition, both countries have signed a strategic treaty that provides for mutual military assistance in case of aggression and more than 10,000 North Korean soldiers will have been sent to Russian territory to combat Ukrainian troops in the Russian border regions.</description><pubDate>2025-02-26 01:52:08</pubDate></item><item><title>Cristina Ferreira, jurist and professor at the University of Macau: “Faft was in the right place and moment”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/27/cristina-ferreira-jurista-e-docente-da-universidade-de-macau-o-faft-estava-no-lugar-e-momento-certos/</link><description>Cristina Ferreira, an expert in international law, investigated the legal status of the “International Financial Action Group”, which fights money laundering and terrorism financing. In the book “The Legal Status of the Financial Action Task Force in the International Legal System”, the jurist discusses the undefined legal status of the body that got great power worldwide
 
What are the main reasons for the creation of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF)?
The FATF emerges within the scope of the G7 in July 1989, largely at the United States of America (US), to respond to the crime of laundering of capital trafficking and the United Nations Convention against illicit trafficking and psychotropic substances of 1988. Common guidelines and the coordination of preventive measures, especially in the financial level and international cooperation. 40 international recommendations were elaborated against the laundering of capital ”. Today FAFT has 40 members, 38 jurisdictions, the European Commission and the Gulf Cooperation Council. The last member, Indonesia, entered 2023. These members represent industrialized countries, large financial squares and emerging economies.
How to evaluate, over the years, the performance of the FATF?
He played a very important role of leadership after September 11, 2001. Suddenly, the fight against terrorism (FT) became an international obligation and priority on the agenda of all countries. In the international level, the states were urged to be part of the International Convention to suppress terrorism financing, as well as regional or international agreements and actions to combat terrorism and their financing. Internally, countries have been instituted to criminalize the FT, to adopt FLS, prevention and detection measures of the FT in financial entities, such as banks and insurers, and non-finances, such as casinos, real estate agencies or pledge stores. To adopt new international instruments that harmonize or even standardize the practices of various states, and agree on their content, it may take years. But Faft was in the right place and moment. Given its informal nature and flexibility to adjust your mandate due to the threats that could exist in the financial system and its technical know-how, the FATF incorporated in its mandate the fight against FT and produced recommendations, at a time when this matter was new to most jurisdictions. The FATF acted quickly, useful and efficiently to the international community. It had experienced experts in the financial area and the ability to assist in the application [of the recommendations] and supervise its execution. The same happened in 2009, following the 2008 financial crisis and the G20 request to reinforce measures intended for transparency and combat corruption. Therefore, it has been a positive way.
Argues that the Faft occurred in Faft an “institutional metamorphosis” in this body. As?
The FAFT was created as an informal group of technical and temporary, renewable every eight years, but over 30 years has become an increasingly complex organization, governing 206 jurisdictions today. The extension of the mandate also implied the evolution of its powers and responsibilities, and today the FATF is worldwide recognized as the international authority on this matter. It is endowed with a public power of world governance whose recognition is translated into several resolutions of the UN Security Council.
The study clarifies FAFT's legal statute. What status is this and what is the connection with other entities also linked to the fight against FT and money laundering?
FAFT is the world authority responsible for setting international standards, rules and policies on these subjects and there is no duplication of functions with other international organizations and entities, including International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank and the European Union. This study argues that the gradual evolution of the mandate, the FATF's institutional structure and 'modus operandi' has changed its 'modus constiti'. That is, an organization can evolve into an international organization of full right, regardless of the initial intention of the members and not being created by a treaty.
How do you explain that, to date, it is lacking clarification of the FAFT legal statute?
I think there was never a real interest in analyzing this issue in depth. This theme was addressed between 2016 and 2018, during the Spanish and Argentine FATF Presidencies, but was “Marinar”, with the argument that there would be a advantage of maintaining a flexible entity to more easily be able to respond to emerging challenges and risks against safety, transparency and integrity of the international financial system. But the fact is that the FATF began to stop and exercise enormous power, as it evaluates and identifies non-compliant jurisdictions, naming them in lists ('Blacklisting'). It may also install measures to members and non -members, a power detained by very few international organizations.
To what extent does your recommendations impact and put into practice?
FATF recommendations have impact because countries are regularly evaluated on their application, called the “Technical Compliance”, and the effectiveness of their practical application, with the designation of “immediate outcomes”. This assessment is made according to strict criteria, being given a classification. If the result is disabled, the jurisdiction has to make a high level of resolution political commitment to these deficiencies, becoming part of the 'gray list', subject to an action plan and a term [compliance]. In the absence of political commitment or lack of sufficient progress in the execution of the plan, jurisdiction can be appointed to the 'blacklist', and the FATF may appeal to all FATF network jurisdictions to advise their financial institutions to reinforce diligence measures regarding the risks associated with such a jurisdiction. This is what has been happening to Myanmar since October 2022. If jurisdiction has serious deficiencies or does not comply with the action plan or is not a member of a regional group, it can be appointed to the 'blacklist'. In this case, the FATF may appeal to apply the 'Recommendation 19' measures, ranging from reinforcing the diligence and systematic communication of transactions and operations involving jurisdiction to the limitation or prohibition of financial transactions with jurisdiction.

Are there some concrete examples?
This happens with Iran and North Korea two decades ago. The international reputation [from this measure to a country] is real, has a political and economic cost. A 2021 International Monetary Fund (IMF) study reveals that the estimated negative effects of 7.6 percent of gross domestic product in capital flows and a significant reduction in foreign direct investment in the jurisdictions in the 'gray list' and may even have consequences on IMF loan conditions.
It raises, in the book, the question of the importance of FAFT in the global institutional landscape. What importance is this?
FAFT serves as an institutional, operational and regime model for other international organizations. This study develops a theoretical model that can be used in any organization that acts on the international scene, gathers the same objective elements and whose legal status is uncommon. In the background, the FATF is a practical case. International law is not static and one has to analyze reality and adjust the models, and they must reflect the objective reality of the international legal order.
China and Hong Kong are members of FAFT. What is the relationship of MSAR and local policies to combat FT and money laundering with this entity?
MSAR is a member of one of the FATF regional groups-the Asia-Pacific Group to combat capital bleaching (APG), and obeys the recommendations and mechanisms of FATF supervision, exercised by APG. Macau has had a good performance, obviously fulfilling his recommendations. This happened, for example, with the adoption of the property freezing regime and the law of transmitting control control of cash and negotiable instruments to the bearer. Incidentally, the MSAR was the world's first jurisdiction to obtain the best technical compliance note compared to the 40 FATF recommendations when it was evaluated in 2017.
What are the main challenges that FAFT currently faces in combating this type of crimes?
The use of new technologies, virtual currency and limited access to formal financial services leading to the use of unregulated channels, increasing the risks of capital bleaching and FT. In the book also speak of the economic pit and response or action capacity between FATF's member jurisdictions regarding the member jurisdictions of regional groups. Many of them are fragile or low -income economies, so it is not surprising that they have more disabilities or difficulties in complying with FATF international standards. In APG, by way of example, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Nepal, Timor-Leste and Tuvalu are on the World Bank list of 2023 of the least developed countries, which makes the uniform and global application of FATF standards and policies difficult. In addition, the standards, policies, evaluation procedures and recommendations or FATF action plans are poorly flexible or adjustable to the local reality and internal and regional conditionalisms of non -FATF member jurisdictions. A more equitable participation or representation of these jurisdictions in the final decision -making process of the FATF should also be ensured in order to increase its legitimacy and transparency.</description><pubDate>2025-02-27 01:06:10</pubDate></item><item><title>Interview | Shan Hai Jing, a museum and the appetite of the old</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/24/entrevista-escrever-uma-nova-versao-da-historia-mundial-parte-ii/</link><description>An interview with the duo of authors of the next English language publication Shan Hai Jing Code 《上古文明密码》, which today Macau has already presented, but now becomes a museum. Michael Du &amp; Julie Oyang, the authors are currently organizing a breathless textual race through the most important piece of Chinese literature and the heaviest treasure of Chinese culture and… beyond. Julie Oyang is an art and culture critique based on Europe, commentator of Chinese culture and visual philosopher. He is a guest professor at the University of São José in Macau, China. Michael Du is a knowledgeable of the Ancient Chinese Canadian culture, holding the largest collection of Hongshan civilization in the world. He is the founder of Haikou Kiwen International Art &amp; Culture Co. Ltd. (海口啓運國際文化藝術品有限公司) and Kiwen International Cultural Exchange (Yantai) Co.ltd (国际文化交流（烟台）有限公司). Both authors are closely involved in the operation of the China Museum of Art for Pre-Dinastic Civilizations (华夏上古文明艺术馆), which will soon open in Yantai, China.
Q: In part I of the interview, we talked about the historical meaning of the former Chinese manuscript Shan Hai Jing 《山海经》, also known as the Book of Mountains and Seas, especially its universality. What follows?
Michael: We have talked about how a deeper study of Shan Hai Jing can help us understand the origin of the first human civilizations on Earth. But we are makers. We are not for the written pages: we want to ensure that Shan Hai Jing is relevant and alive and making it part of the current culture. With this objective, I found a new company. Kiwen International Cultural Exchange (Yantai) Co.ltd (启运国际文化交流（烟台）有限公司) was created after Haikou Kiwen International Art &amp; Culture Co. Ltd. (海口啓運國際文化藝術品有限公司) is the place where global investigation will take place and the global exchange of knowledge will be encouraged and stimulated in the form of international delegations and high level visitors. We know so little about the old ones, there are so many questions to ask…
Julie: In fact, there is so much to do. There is so much we can do. In collaboration with the Chinese government, we are both involved in the operation of the China Museum of Art for Pre-Dinastic Civilizations (华夏上古文明艺术馆), where Michael cures his own collection of artifacts, as well as privately renowned private collections, including all pre-doinestic civilizations such as Hongshan, Liangzhu, Shanxingui, HongShuihe, Shijiahe, etc. These art objects have never been exposed and were never explained by traditional historians. We understand that it is extremely important for us to provide private collectors a place where they can show their journey dedicated to seeking answers to questions about humanity. In this sense, the China Museum of Art for Pre-Dinastic Civilizations (华夏上古文明艺术馆), which should open in Yantai in April, is a unique and brilliant view. We even have the architecture to correspond to this vision. Our goal is to educate the global public in general, as well as establish a connection with the young audience in a fun way and with high quality standards.
Beyond the exhibition, which will do more to make the mysterious old “alive and active” to the global audience?
Julie: At this time, Michael and I are planning a parallel exhibition and a workshop in collaboration with French artist chef Gil Gonzalez-Foerster (Chinese name: 晓松). In a way, the Yantai museum is a time capsule where an old and faded memory is stored. And Gil's kitchen deals with memory, this time from these pre-Dinastic civilizations, starting from Shan Hai Jing. Being the imaginative guardian of memory, the Chinese classic contains the oldest memory in China, or even in the world. Shan Hai Jing records ancient memories in the form of mythology meditations and the most interesting facts about flora and fauna known for their magical power and powerful force that live from one extreme to the other. This seems to be the reputation of this ancient and inexhaustible text. But Shan Hai Jing is also an extraordinary recipe book!
But why food?
Michael: You are what you eat. Food is an essential part of everyday human life that can tell us more about the past. When a dish is no longer remembered, part of us cease to exist. Food is perhaps the most intimate and sensual memory. Perhaps this is one of the reasons why Shan Hai Jing was written: remember through food? Our curated exhibition will become more complete, more 3D, more realistic, exploring the taste of the ancients!
Julie: Shan Hai Jing documents diverse gastronomic experiences, mixing natural history and food knowledge. His humanist approach makes Shan Hai Jing unique in his genre. The word Shi (食), “eat”, appears more than 160 times in the book, of the ancients. There are, however, many cases about exotic food that heals medical conditions quite familiar to modern men, but Shan Hai Jing also offers cure for conditions such as arrogance, confusion/lack of wisdom, ward off physical dangers. This is a unique culinary philosophy! Food involves the mind, not just the taste. To provoke the intellect. This deep idea is still deeply rooted in modern Chinese food. Through our exhibition, we also understand why Confucius taught his disciples that food is a virtuous gift and why the great Chinese scholarly poets were famous food lovers.
We currently do not know who was the author of the mysterious Chinese classic whose imagination exceeds a thousand and one nights…
Michael: The ancients were "men of appetite." Appetite can explain humanity's historical and economic landscapes more clearly than academic jargon.
Speaking of economics, how is the museum economy managed?
Michael: The museum is an educational organism. It is also a business. We focused on five volumes of business. The investigation mainly involves cooperation with various institutions and training programs in China. We organize courses, events and publications. This part will generate 7.6 million RMB/year. Ticket sales will generate 7.2 million RMB/year. Authenticity certification will generate 3.5 million RMB/year. We will also form art and antique auctions agents, whose program will generate 4.9 million RMB/year. In spring and fall, a large scale auction will be held, with a conservative estimate of 50 million RMB of auction volume. This amount does not include revenues from the commission of 15% of sellers and buyers. In addition, four more themed auction games will be held annually, with a conservative estimate of 5 million RMB of business volume and 6 million RMB of auctioning commission.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>António Queirós, philosopher and academic: “the West there is great ignorance” about China</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/21/antonio-queiros-filosofo-e-academico-a-ocidente-ha-uma-grande-ignorancia-sobre-a-china/</link><description>Doctorate in Philosophy of Sciences, Environmental and Environmental Ethics, António Queirós, linked to the Faculty of Letters of the University of Lisbon, regrets that the West continues to face China in the wrong way, especially in environmental issues.

Will talk about the theme “The Environmental Crisis and the China Eco-Civilization Project”. What project is this?
This is China's great project for the New Age. It is a concept that began to be elaborated from 2013. This idea began to be realized with different projects. Since the “New Democracy” regime, which resulted from the Chinese resistance to the occupation of Japan and the geopolitical confrontation of the countries of the axis of different democracies. This is when the Popular Republic of China is proclaimed, such as the proclamation of the “new democracy” and comes the awareness of the world's environmental crisis by China, with the regime to evolve into the so-called “ecological socialism” from 2003. It was necessary for the country to experience a model of industrialization common to the early experiences of socialism, and above all capitalist countries. China's fundamental thesis is that all regimes can collaborate in building a new civilization, but this implies outdoor democratic reforms that are consigned in global civilization proposals, guaranteeing peace according to the principle of indivisibility of security. But I would like to point out the moment when the United Nations (UN), representing the whole world, became aware of the existence of an environmental crisis, from the Stockholm Conference, which took place in 1972. In China this process of awareness of the socialist state organs, citizens and parties, began in 2003. It is strange that issues like this will never be debated. The ideological confrontation that comes from the Cold War did not cease with Helsinquia's agreements, and therefore there are themes that are unknown to the West because of this harmful tradition of the Cold War, which has extended, and because the media have no openness to discuss and present the proposals that China makes.
China is present and is an important actor in world meetings on environment and climate. Why do you understand that there is no discussion the West about the concept of eco-civilization?
It is not discussed why the West there is great ignorance about China and the reality of the country. The only advantage I have about most people who write and talk about China is that my relationship with the country is over 50 years old. I know how China was presented to the West 50 years ago. We lived [in Portugal], a fascist regime where information came to people with great difficulty. I have seen these years to all kinds of visions about China that lacked concrete information, because the country, until reform and openness, was a closed society. But this lack of information was general in the West. I also had visions that were not reality and I began to question whether China's historical experience is unique, without parallel in the history of society, democracy and socialism, for its historical characteristics, hermeneutics, in the sense of method, the analysis of concepts and starting points, which predominates the West, does not serve. But then let's go to the concrete issue, which is the responsibilities that China has in environmental matters.
Which, specifically, are…
One thing is the contribution that give China, India and other countries to global warming, because they are populations that represent most of humanity. There are technologies that are themselves polluting. But if we look at this angle we ended up falsifying reality, because greenhouse gases that exist in the atmosphere have been at least 150 years ago due to European and American industrialization. In terms of historical responsibility, the US is largely responsible [for global warming], and I cite official European Union data, for example. I speak of tons of carbon dioxide and greenhouse gases emitted to the atmosphere in all these years.
Because they industrialized much earlier than China.
Yes, and presented an industry without this kind of environmental concerns. Therefore, this reality is hidden, which greenhouse gases have begun to pollute for 150 years and that it is not only today's contributions [which are the major causes of global warming].
Therefore, the idea that China is the main polluting country finds it wrong.
In current terms China and India can be the most polluting. But they are neither in “per capita” nor historically. What is really [in the Western discourse] is that they currently contribute [to global warming]. But then we have to see the trends where we are going to walk. But if we deepen this topic we have come to even less favorable conclusions to Western policies. China's environmental history can be summed up at four periods. The first period is in the years of reform and openness, from 1978, and the fourth period is when China launches the pilot projects of ecological civilization. The process is global. Still in relation to China's responsibilities, in the first phase the West and the industrialized east carried to China the most polluting industries, because China's appeal was to industrialize and create more employment. The UN resolution that adds an article beyond the 30 articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, finally recognizes as an inalienable right of the human being to a healthy environment. This statement, the West, completely truncated, reduced to no thing, has a preamble with 30 articles in which the environmental issue is not posed. Since this statement is no longer in line with current political and social reality, it has been moving, mutilated and reduced to formal freedoms. Also ignored by the set of citizens who do not know their origin either. China is co-founder of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, a fact that is also concealed. But I also wanted to talk about the largest fallacy of the Western environmental policy.
What is it?
The idea that, from now on, one will protect nature. So what is done to what was destroyed? Especially in developing countries, because it was there that we sent these residues from the polluting industries and exploited all resources. No one wanted to know that, and what did China did? He assumed the leadership of the process and through his diplomacy to "act without acting," Tao's way, without violating nature, respecting the laws and dignity of things, approving the Kunming-Montreal agreement [on biodiversity]. We then have a commitment that the US probably will lie down to the rubbish crate to recover the biotypes that are destroyed, because much of the world is in environmental crisis and has so far been whistling to the side. China has a gradual view that risk factors in the environmental crisis tend to decrease with China's effort, both nationally and international. But the most remarkable issue in the idea of ​​building an ecological state in the country was the fact that, at the initiative of President XI Jinping, principles of environmental philosophy were included in the Statutes of the Chinese Communist Party, an unprecedented fact in another Communist Party and even some ecologists.
Global reformulation
According to the study “Ecological Civilization in the People’s Republic of China: VALUES, Action, and Future Needs”, by Arthur Hanson, published in 2019 by Asian Development Bank, the concept of ecological civilization “is being used by the Popular Republic of China (RPC) to provide a coherent conceptual framework for adjustments to development that responds to the century. XXI.
It differs from sustainable development in the emphasis placed in political and cultural factors, as well as in the definition of new relationships between people and nature that allow you to live well and within the eco-environmental boundaries of planet Earth. ”
In addition to reducing pollution and promoting circular economy, for example, they are also considered “domain of finance, law, institutional reinforcement and technological innovation”, having already been defined some ideas in five-year five-term agents, especially until 2035, when it is expected that ecological civilization, in its basic form, is fully implemented for the modernization of the RPC ”.</description><pubDate>2025-02-21 00:36:40</pubDate></item><item><title>Mark O'Neil launches biographical work on Liang Sicheng and contribution to Chinese architecture</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/20/mark-oneil-lanca-obra-biografica-sobre-liang-sicheng-e-contributo-para-a-arquitectura-chinesa/</link><description>Mark O'Neill, a journalist and author to reside in Hong Kong, published a biography of Liang Sicheng, responsible for documenting ancient Chinese architecture, which during the cultural revolution was the target of political persecution. The book written by the author of English origin, released by the publisher Joint, calls itself “Liang Sicheng: Guardian of the architectural history of China”
 
When did you contact Liang Sicheng's figure?
When I lived in Beijing I was interested in the old part of the city, for it was like no other in the world. Liang Sicheng said the following about this old part of Beijing: “The general layout shows the traditional system of the historic cities of China, being the result of geography, political and economic conditions of Yuan, Ming and Qing dynasties. It also expresses artistic management that led to a high level of success. It served the feudal era well and also serves life very well in the new age. It may be the capital of the New Age. This in no way prevents good development. All this creativity over a long time makes us proud. ” In the 1950s, Liang and a collaborator prepared a proposal of 25,000 characters for the construction of a new administrative center in the western part of the city, to house all the ministries and official buildings and leave the old city as it was. But the new government rejected this proposal and demolished most of the old city. Built its new capital in the center of the ancient city. This broke the heart of Liang and his wife Lin Huiyin. In Beijing, I met Liang's second wife, Lin Zhu. She explained all these dramatic events. It was a stimulus to write the book. Both she and her daughter, Liang Zaibing, wrote excellent books that describe all this. They were a fundamental research material for the book.
What do you consider most fascinating in Liang Sicheng's career?
I greatly admire Liang's aesthetic values ​​and his meticulous work in the documentation of China's old buildings, 2,738 in total. In 1944, in the midst of the worst horrors of the Japan war against China, which killed many of his friends and family, he wrote a letter to the US military representative in Chongqing. He made a list of historic places in Nara, Kyoto and Osaka, and proposed that they be spared to destroy the American bombers. What generosity and meaning of extraordinary humanity. In 2009, Nara raised a statue in her honor. He lived during the anti-Japanese war and the terrible campaigns of the beginning of the communist period. But it maintained its meaning of mission: preserving the treasures of Chinese architecture and forming a new generation of architects and the University of Tsinghua.
What are the main architectural currents, or specific buildings, which Liang helped preserve or draw attention?
He and his wife [Lin Huiyin] documented 2,738 old buildings with precious, Chinese and English measurements, and caught the national and international attention to them. Without it, many could have been destroyed or dropped into the degradation process. He defined the characteristics of traditional Chinese architecture and described the architects and artisans who built it.
It can be said that as intellectual, Liang Sicheng suffered persecution during the Cultural Revolution. In concrete terms, how was this period for Liang?
In chapter 10, we describe the Cultural Revolution as the Liang Calvary, as was for thousands of intellectuals and party officials [Chinese Communist Party]. Liang lived and worked at the University of Tsinghua campus. The government handed the campus control to frivolous red guards. Liang was an obvious target for them because he had studied in the United States, spoke English and had many foreign friends. The persecution he suffered was so severe that he eventually led him to death. In 1966, his health was already fragile; I was 65 years old. He was forced to write “self-confessions” and to attend mass critic sessions. The red guards looted their apartment. But he did not commit any crime, he was simply an architect and teacher. The criticism was absurd.
After the years of the Mao regime, two of his works were published. What do we tell us about the country's architecture?
After Mao's death and the end of the cultural revolution, he was rehabilitated and his works were published in Chinese and English. Its greatest legacy is the explanation of the history of Chinese architecture, the analysis of the old buildings and the techniques used to build them. One of the most famous is the Fo Guang Si Buddhist Temple, located in the Wutai mountains in Shanxi. Liang Sicheng caught the attention of the Chinese and foreign world to this legacy.
Liang Sicheng was one of the few architects of the time with foreign formation. What were the main influences revealed in the main architectural projects of the time?
Liang and his wife, as well as a small number of Chinese colleagues formed abroad, brought back to China the modern architecture. He taught her at the University of Northeast in Shenyang from 1928 to 1931, and at the University of Tsinghua, from 1945 to his death, and during the Cultural Revolution, these classes became impossible. This is another important legacy - the hundreds of architects who formed and the textbooks he wrote to them. In the global memory of ancient Chinese architecture, his work was fundamental. He launched the foundations for it. Since then, many have followed their example in the investigation, both Chinese and foreigners.
Liang Sicheng, an “extraordinary life” devotes to architecture
According to an official note about the work, released by the publisher Joint Publishing, Liang Sicheng had "an extraordinary life." Son of Liang Qi-Chao, one of China's most famous intellectuals, Liang Sicheng grew up in Japan. Educated at the University of Pennsylvania, Liang also studied at Harvard and was greatly influenced by American architects and architecture.
One of the few Chinese of his time with deep knowledge about modern architecture, Liang Sicheng returned to China in 1928 and spent more than 12 years to investigate ancient China's architecture, continuing his work even during World War II, when China was partially occupied by the Japanese.
He published his discoveries in Chinese and English newspapers, revealing to the world for the first time the history, knowledge and beauty of Chinese architecture. After World War II, he taught at Yale University and was the representative of China in the conception of the new United Nations (UN) headquarters in New York.
Post-1949 Life
After 1949, he remained in Beijing as head of the Architecture Department of the University of Tsinghua. He designed the main buildings of the new communist regime, but failed to persuade President Mao Zedong to preserve the ancient city of Beijing. In the 1950s, and in the years of the Cultural Revolution, it was severely criticized.
In January 1972 eventually died in the Chinese capital. With the end of the cultural revolution, his figure and reputation were rehabilitated and his own posthumously published. In 1984, his “pictorial history of Chinese architecture” was published in English by Wilma Fairbank, a friend of the architect and his wife, and married to the synologist John Fairbank.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Piménio Ferreira: “Anti-igan rhetoric has always worked in Portugal”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2021/04/26/pimenio-ferreira-a-retorica-anti-cigana-sempre-funcionou-em-portugal/</link><description>Piménio Ferreira, better known as Gitelles Ferreira, anti-racist militant, 34, physical engineer, national Romani. He is a man with a provocative speech, a corrosive, kind mood and a smile that leaves no one indifferent
Gitelles, we live in an intercultural land and the Gypsies - in particular - have lived about five centuries in Portugal. What is going on for Gypsy communities to remain “on the fringes” of the so -called society? 
The model of society remains to be changed. This is extremely stratified by placing people in subordinate places to privilege a violent minority. The white social structure is patriarchal and racist. What is called the "margin" of society is actually an intrinsic place to it, which belongs to it. In other words, Gypsy people have been included in this model of society since they discovered Europe and its kingdoms. The problem is the model of society that is maintained and the place to which they were relegated and how they were relegated: with violence, in inferior status against whites, without the right to human dignity, to constitute a family, to choose one's own language and religion, expropriated from any and all cultural and material law. A place built and maintained to this day by violence and genocidal and ethnicidal persecution. In 1463, a Gitano Vasco was drowned to an estate. In 1521, Gitans, or Gypsies, were already used as a reference for all that is considered bad in the model of society. The "counter-exemple" in the face of the white that would stand out for the positive. The 'angel' and the 'devil'; the 'other', the enemy; That against whom any attack and persecution is legitimate. Including the prohibition of defending, having weapons, any kind of goods, and the right of permanence.
And is this right to permanence that we still have nomadic gypsy communities within the country is denied?
Yes, no doubt. There are many ways to force nomadism: directly, prohibiting permanence and expelling with police or military force; indirectly, refusing public or private housing to Gypsy people, as they are Gypsy; and even through the gentrification process.
I read the result of an inquiry from the European Union Fundamental Rights Agency, which is said to be approximately 80% of the Gypsies responded to the risk threshold of poverty in their country; One in three Gypsies lives in a housing without channeled water; One in three Gypsies belongs to a family where someone hungry at least once the previous month; and 50% of Gypsies aged 6 to 24 do not attend school. Why does this happen like this? 
It is the historical persecution, which continues. There is no impoverishment that has no external cause. In this case, a political system of total expropriation and imposed on the basis of violence. Already in 1648, D John IV, the restorer, prohibited ‘Giving or Rent houses to Gypsies’. The same D John IV who got the kingdom of Portugal thanks to D. Jerónimo da Costa and his 250 knights. The same D. Jerónimo da Costa who had died to defend Portugal's independence from Castile. Gypsy, like his wife and children. Between prohibitions of permanence, “that do not enter Gypsies in the Kingdom and leave those who are” (D John III, 1526), ​​with expulsions, degred to the galleys, expropriation of goods and properties, imposed with stripping, mutilation and death, systematically performed to this day (still in 2011 Faro City Council wanted to ban Gypsies in the municipality).
The prohibition of working on others (no one employs Gypsy workers, and those who accept they do it in total precariousness, for poorly paid positions and without decent rights and conditions). They cannot be dependent on their own work, they cannot get investment means due to extreme expropriation. Are dependent on precariousness. If you want to know what it is like to live in pure neoliberalism, know the lives of Gypsies. Their reality is paradigmatic of the aggression and depletion to which the "gentlemen" are willing to go to their benefit.
Are you talking about economic and political power?
The group of political, social, cultural and economic power. The owner, the colonizer. This group that has been in power since it established the system of current domination. And that only makes sense within the hierarchically stratified sociopolitical model in which we live. Hence the need to end 'gentlemen' and institute a new model of society, healthy, free, without hierarchies or strata, whether of race, class or gender.
The model we live in leads to the Gypsy (and not only) community to economic exclusion, removing it from access to product consumption or excluding them from its production process; political exclusion associated with lack of access to information; To education and consequently the social exclusion that is seen in inequality of access to quality community areas such as restaurants, libraries, theater, cinema, concerts, health care, etc. How do you feel a gypsy child when you realize that it is not part of a whole? Children who are never represented, neither in movies, nor in books, nor in cartoons, nor in an announcement to eat cereals, for example? Is this a disaster for self-esteem, is a priori condemnation?
The question is that. Gypsy people are not “excluded from society”, by contrast, they are included in it. The problem is the existence of what is cynically called 'social exclusion', which term Orwellian, and there be under coercion, people. Which field of concentration and extermination. Incidentally, Nazi concentration camps are a more visual realization than called 'social exclusion' and, as here, were not a 'excluded' part of Nazi society, but rather its fundamental and characterizing structure. It is a place of violence, where people are maintained by violence, dedicated to their extermination, and designed so that few people can leave. And yet they resist. As in Nazi concentration camps.
And what you have listed as an example of 'consequence' of this 'exclusion', is actually the means by which this exclusion also happens and remains. Gypsy people are out of theaters, both as consumers and producers (but go to the cinema). They are out of school, education and the gym. Either as 'users' or as producers (but go to school and are on the basis of knowledge construction and academic and scientific debates).
Even in attacking Gypsy children's self -confidence, we talk about a maintenance mechanism of this situation. But Gypsy people respond very well: with Gypsy pride. Another resistance, another aggression. Gypsy people are thus included in society. In a place that belongs to this model of modern society. And they resist and contradict the power of domination and make a point of being in the city, in the cinema, in the theater, in the gym, in all spaces. With a lot of struggle and always resisting, but they are there. Social exclusion, more than a “place outside of society”, is part of its social structure.
Do you want to say that there is a collective resistance?
At work, already in a context of absolute precariousness, during the pandemic, Gypsy people rolled up sleeves and showed once again proactivity and creativity in adversity. They learned seeing and doing. And here, it is again the women who jump to the front line, face, learn to use digital tools with their daughters or children, and throw themselves into the network. And so they explore online sales as well as application by application (transportation or rehabs). In housing, in a context of pandemic in which the evictions were not locked - as they owed and dictated the law itself - residents did not fail to organize and fight unjust evictions and claim dignity in housing; associations of allied residents in their action with other housing and anti-racist struggle organizations.
It should also be noted how they reinvented and intensified to raise and distribute dietary goods and kits of masks/alcohol gel to the most expropriated people. Gypsies and non -Gypsies. In the anti-racist struggle, new movements emerged and their actions intensified by social networks. People who had never been organized or militated before began their first steps in activism, thickening this way of the organization and popular gypsy and anti-racist action. People forget, or do not want to value, but Gypsy action has helped determine results in the political dispute. Gypsy citizens mobilized in large and determined electoral results in the municipalities of 2017, both in Alentejo and in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area, even causing electoral earthquakes.
And even in the presidential, second place was resolved by a value equivalent to the estimated number of Gypsy voters. Apart from the non -Gypsy votes that were mobilized by the action of Gypsy voters. Gypsy people are even co-considering power in the spaces of opinion, local media, social networks and party and institutional political dispute. And most importantly, in the popular Ação and alliances with other social movements. We have never stopped fighting for all means and continuing to resist.
In contrast there are more and more hate speeches, from the far right in particular. What do you have to say about it?
To start these speeches are historical and European. Not even current and even less “of the far right”. These speeches have been adopted and rendered for a long time, even in 'democracy and freedom', by several representatives of the center right, conservatives, left center, liberal, liberal left, even representatives of the PCP. Anti-egana rhetoric has always worked in Portugal as it is the whiter rhetoric [white genesis]. That is, it allows you to create and give the "white" as the superior of all. And so please the white electorate who, when feeling well, pays off with his vote. Even if the policies implemented by their elected harm him even more.
Finally, did you like them to talk a little about your personal experience and how did you get to the activist?
I studied, fought for studies, made alliances, graduated, went in the labor market of the “formal precariousness”. I started my militant action and here I am today. We can transform this society a better. This certainty combined with the fact that the current one has so much suffering makes anyone want to have a transformist attitude. I wanted to be 'inventor' (physical engineer) and anti -racist militant. And through study (not necessarily schooling) and organization with others, in turn, with other studies, formations and visions, I learned how the world works and how it can be changed. But before transforming, we need to survive.
Hence two types of actions arise: transformative and survival. The struggle against hate discourse arises as survival, but his defeat will be a transformative victory. There is a lot that - like people who want a better world - we have to do, namely working to criminalize hatred speech; condemn and prohibit organizations with racist discourses and practices; denounce the racist institutional structure and logics that organize power and generate community resources. And in this sense, there have been various types of actions, of petitions, to manifestations. And we need more.
I, besides being a military man in the SOS Racism movement, participate in the “We came to stay” podcast, with Mamadou BA and Joseph da Silva. And if all goes well, we will soon start a new project. With friendly people, we also have the project “Gypsy Initiative”, dedicated to reflecting and promoting transformative movements. Essentially focused on educating against anti-agigarism, denouncing historical and continued genocide and working for a new society project. Also with new projects on the gutter. And finally, there are always voluntary actions without an organization, where I try to share what I found out about anti-egism and Roman history in schools and with interested people. In addition, there is still the struggle for housing, because the evictions did not stop during the pandemic. Due to housing and work precariousness, the subjects racialized especially the Roma nationals are the most vulnerable to COVID-19. There is essential to have actions in this area; Of all the struggles, this is the most structural, as it goes against one of the main enemies of a healthy society: the real estate speculation of this capitalist system, which places profit and goods above people and their humanization.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Motorcycling | FHO RACING WITH NEW FOCUS IN 2025</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/13/motociclismo-fho-racing-com-novo-foco-em-2025/</link><description>Doubts dissipated this week. Macau's businesswoman Foye Ho's FHO Racing will continue to active in the 2025 season, but without the initially announced riders. Peter Hickman and Davey Todd are leaving and goes to a new team called 8ten Racing
 
According to a statement sent by FHO Racing, BMW Motorrad UK has restructured its training for the 2025 British Superbike Championship, and FHO Racing BMW will compete with a single pilot aboard a BMW M 1000 RR. German 2024 Superbike Champion and Resistance World Cup driver, Ilya Mikhalchik, will make his debut in the British competition, at a time when team owner Faye Ho, realinhas the objectives of his team “to explore new activities in motorized new markets, with the support of BMW Motorrad Motorsport”.
Currently in his fifth year at the British Superbike Championship Paddock, Faye Ho has been a strong presence in the British competition, as well as in the popular road races, such as the Macao Grand Prix, as well as supporting several young female riders, helping them progress in their careers since the lower classes. Faye Ho, Stanley Ho's granddaughter and Clementina Leitão, has supported Kate Walker and Jamie Hanks-Bliott on BMW F 900 R Cup and, it seems, which will continue to support.
To be
Contrary to the rumors that put her from Paddock's departure, Faye Ho made it clear that she is a “great advocate of the British Superbike Championship, one of the world's most exciting and competitive competitions” and will keep her commitment to discipline. However, the territory entrepreneur now has new objectives for herself and its structure. The future will be in Asia and support for young female talents.
"Given my long -term objectives, which include expanding motor sport activities in Asia and continuing to support young women in motorcycling, I realized that I cannot dedicate the same time, to the British Superbike Championship and the road races, which I gave them since I became the owner of the team in 2021, due to additional commitments I have in Macao," Faye Ho said.
Another chapter
This announcement put an end to a successful partnership, particularly on the island of Man TT, between Peter Hickman, four times winner of the Macao Motorcycle Grand Prix, and Fho Racing. Hickman left some words of thanks to his now former boss.
“I want to leave a huge thanks to Faye [Ho] and Fho Racing for all they have done for me over the past four years,” Hickman wrote in a Facebook social network post. “As it is normal in motorized sport, we had amazing moments and others more difficult, but Fho has always been and always will be a fundamental part of my career. I will be eternally grateful for this opportunity. ”
The new 8Ten Racing team, which will be officially presented on February 26, will be mostly composed of former FHO Racing elements. Hickman and Todd will maintain the important support of BMW Motorrad UK and are expected on the big prize starting grid in November.</description><pubDate>2025-02-13 01:30:05</pubDate></item><item><title>FHO RACING | Peter Hickman denies closing</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/07/fho-racing-peter-hickman-nega-encerramento/</link><description>Peter Hickman, four times winner of the Macao Motorcycle Grand Prix, denied the rumors that claimed that the team Racing, from Macau Faye Ho businesswoman, would have closed the doors and would be absent on the British Superbike Championship (BSB) and the Macao Grand Prix in 2025
 
Peter Hickman goes to the fifth season in the British Championship with Fho Racing, however, before the season's start, some rumors came to circulate in Paddock about the team's future. In recent years, FHO Racing has become one of the top teams in the British Superbike Championship and road events, such as the MAN's island TT or the Macao Grand Prix.
Last November, the team announced that they featured Peter Hickman and Davey Todd, winner of the troubled last edition of the Macao Grand Motor Prize in the British Superbike Championship. Faye Ho said at the time that “for 2025 and also for this year's Macao Grand Prix, we have a very strong team, with Davey joining Pete and Michael aboard the BMW. We have two super talented drivers on the roads for next season, and with Davey jumping to the Superbike class, after winning the Superstock Championship for the second time, I think we'll have a strong season. I can't expect my team to return to Macau, I love to share my hometown with the team and show all points of interest, it's such a special place for me. ”
Although Hickman and Todd have been present at the BMW Motorrad Motorsport season in Berlin in mid -January, since November that Fho Racing has no news, which has generated some discomfort and doubts among fans. Hickman was testing his BMW M1000RR from his Phr Performance in Spain, when he responded with a striking "no" to a fan of a fan on Instagram social network about the rumor of FHO Racing activity ceasing, a "no" that had wide repercussion in the specialized British press.
It's not the first time
After a difficult season of his team in 2024 in the British Superbike Championship, Faye Ho, Stanley Ho's granddaughter, had to face similar rumors last September. In Oulton Park, before the opening race of the 2024 showdown, Faye Ho confirmed to journalists that FHO Racing would continue to participate in the 2025 British Superbike Championship, “which is good news, but anything will be announced in time. But I'm happy to be back here and to stay here, it's a big championship and I love to be in this racing environment. ”
To increase speculation between fans, Hickman suggested on social networks a change of direction this year, leaving an announcement about his plans for the North West 200 and TT of the island of Man. In Spain, the British will have tested with his motorcycle without any reference and FHO Racing spectals, while Todd changed his profile photo on social networks, for a photo with a motorcycle from Milwaukee BMW by Tas Racing.
Sources of the world of motorcycling tell us that the future of FHO Racing is expected to be known in the coming days, but one thing is that Hickman, regardless of the team, has in his sports program to the trip to masters in November, to try to win the fifth victory in the guide circuit.</description><pubDate>2025-02-07 02:20:15</pubDate></item><item><title>GP | Célio Alves Dias will continue to run this season</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/24/gp-celio-alves-dias-vai-continuar-a-correr-esta-temporada/</link><description>Macaense pilot Célio Alves Dias was one of the long -term returns of the 2024 car.
 
The Macao Cup winner of Macau in 2021 was removed from motorsport at the time of 2023 for personal reasons, but last year made his debut in the competition that joins the Toyota Gr86 (ZN8) and the Subaru BRZ (ZD8). Despite the vast experience in tests of the specialty, having conducted several generations of tourism cars, Célio Alves Dias had never managed the new bobbinns that the Macao-China General Association (AAMC) introduced in its competition in 2023. Last time turned out to be of learning, with some difficulties in the tuning and behavior of the Japanese car.
Participation in races at the Zhuzhou International Circuit and the Macau Grand Prix made Célio Alves Dias realize that his Toyota GR86 was not at the strongest competition level. Based on the conclusions drawn from these experiences, he decided to start preparing for the new season.
“The car had to be all dismantled. My car was bought on Monday, and the chassis and the security arc, for me, were not well done, ”explained Fu Lei Racing Team pilot to HM. “This, made the car too hard and very difficult to bow. I tried a car from China, which was well assembled, and there is a difference. I had a good time in January, in China, with this car. Our cars, made in the same workshop, were very hard, which made it difficult to make turns fast. ”
If in the Macao Grand Prix, the house riders, excellent guide circuit, managed to equate the progress to their hong Kong opponents and the interior of China, in the initial races on the Zhuzhou track in Hunan province, it wasn't quite like that. “There are many differences between cars, but especially in chassis, because engines, in terms of power and horses, are almost all at the same level. Our opponents also experienced many pieces, many engines, even gearboxes, and chassis. Competition cars are always the same. You have to have engine power, but also chassis. Having only power is not enough. Having better a good chassis is the most important. ”
Silver Jubilee in November
Being a usual Portuguese name in the Macao Grand Prix in recent decades, Célio Alves Dias debuted at the Guide Circuit in 2000 and from then was a frequent presence and no faults in the race until 2023. This year, its objective is to account for its twenty-fifth participation in the biggest sports event of RAEM, but will have to align in the findings.
While awaiting the announcement of the 2025 calendar by AAMC, Célio Alves Dias details details to start his test program, because his Toyota, after being reviewed, "is ready to test" in the interior of China, something that will happen "very soon," says the pilot.
In the last edition of the Grand Prix, Célio Alves Dias qualified in 12th place for the Macau Roadsport Challenge race. However, his participation was short and unhappy: at the wheel of Toyota with dorsal No. 11, was forced to give up after being immobilized on the climb of San Francisco. The Macanese pilot was out of the race on the first lap, in an incident that caused the Safety Car.</description><pubDate>2025-02-24 02:50:53</pubDate></item><item><title>GP TCR | Australia confirms presence in Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/19/gp-tcr-australia-confirma-presenca-em-macau/</link><description>The 2025 season of TCR Australia will end largely when joining the TCR World Tour in the race of the 72nd Macao Grand Prix, which will take place from 13 to 16 November
 
After welcoming TCR China by 2024, the FIA ​​TCR World Tour “worldwide” will have the company of the Australian competitors in the most demanding race of the season, as HM had already foreseen at the end of last year.
This announcement is the second news in the calendar of one of the largest national TCR competitions in the world, after the announcement of a new promoter for the championship.
One pilot who was certainly pleased with the news was Australian Ben Bargwanna, who ran on the streets of Macao in 2023. TCR Australia's first international participation was made possible by the global rights holder, the WSC Group, which will ensure full transportation costs for Australian teams traveling to Macau.
"TCR Australia has always been one of TCR's most important and exciting competitions, rooted in the long tradition of tourism motorsport in the country," said WSC Group president Marcello Lotti. The Italian businessman made it clear that “when logistical issues forced us to cancel the Australian rounds of Kumho Fia TCR World Tour last year, we immediately started working to return in 2025. It is fantastic to extend cooperation for a second event and offer Australian competitors the unique opportunity to finish the season in Macau.”
Other applause
TCR Australia Prosecutor David Sonenscher, an old acquaintance of Macao, highlighted the importance of the moment for the category.
"I am very happy to bring TCR Australia to one of the most iconic circuits in the world and certainly one of the biggest challenges for a pilot," said former Malaysian-based English driver and entrepreneur and co-founder of TCR Asia. “The opportunity to expand our cooperation with the TCR World Tour FIA and to show the talented Australian riders on the highest international stage in Macau demonstrates the unique opportunity that TCR Australia and the TCR Global Platform provide all participants.”
Confirmation of the presence of TCR Australia in the Guide Race should not be impeded to the participation of local pilots and the interior of China in the most celebrated tourist car race on the Asian continent.</description><pubDate>2025-02-19 01:54:58</pubDate></item><item><title>GT Cup | Great Bay Race gains impulse from the interior</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/27/taca-gt-corrida-da-grande-baia-ganha-impulso-do-interior/</link><description>The GT Cup-Great Bay Race will join this year, the newly created Sro GT Cup, the latest GT competition launched in the interior of China, inspired by the GT4 class vehicles of the Macau Grand Prix
 
On the eve of last Christmas, Sro Motorsport Group, the entity responsible for organizing numerous races and championships, including the GT World Challenge Asia and, as the official partner of the FIA, the coordination of the FIA ​​GT World Cup in Macau, announced the creation of a competition for GT4 vehicles, made up of four events in China. At the time of the announcement, only the inaugural event in Shanghai and the end in Beijing had been confirmed as part of the calendar.
Almost 30 cars, representing an impressive total of ten car builders, participated in the GT Cup - Great Bay Race of 2024, a race that has become an important milestone over the weekend of the Macao Grand Prix in recent years. Indeed, no other GT4 event in Asia brings together such quantity and diversity of cars. The Balance of Performance (BOP), responsible for balancing the performance of the various participating cars, was, at the time, managed by SRO.
In a statement, Benjamin Frannasovici, managing director of Sro Motorsports Asia, said:
“We are enchanted, proud and privileged for adding the GT Cup - Great Bay Race to the inaugural calendar of Sro GT Cup, which begins and ends with the two largest motorized sports events in China. We already have a strong working relationship with the GT Cup - Great Bay Race, which has become the most significant race for GT4 cars in Asia. Its inclusion in the 2025 calendar of the SRO underlines the size of our ambition for this new national series. ”
High interest
The SRO GT Cup debut season begins in March at China's Formula 1 Grand Prix in Shanghai, before moving to the Zhuhai International Circuit - a place previously visited by SRO in BPR times and the FIA ​​GT Championship - where two 30 -minute races are planned. This is followed by the new Citadine Circuit of Beijing, which will host the GT World Challenge Asia on the same weekend, before the big end of the Sro GT Cup season, scheduled for a month later at the Guide Circuit in Macao.
The enthusiasm surrounding this competition is evident. As Benjamin Franassovici said, “This is reflected in the number of consultations and registration for the full season we have received since the release of the championship, just before Christmas. The demand has exceeded our expectations. ”
Up to 28 cars will be able to compete in the season end event on the streets of Macau, with places to be assigned based on the classification after the second round of the championship, which is scheduled for the Zhuhai Permanent Circuit. All pilots with “bronze” or “silver” classifications attributed by the FIA ​​are eligible to compete in this competition, as long as they use approved cars from the GT4 class.
To attract brands, the results of SRO GT Cup races will tell the SRO GT4 builders ranking, a title attributed to the brand with better performance in the GT4 category at the end of each season. SRO GT CUP joins its Asian equivalent, Japan Cup, in a list that also includes continental and national competitions in Europe, America and Australia.</description><pubDate>2025-01-27 11:13:41</pubDate></item><item><title>MOTOR EMBALISM | Rui Valente is not due</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/21/automobilismo-rui-valente-nao-se-da-por-vencido/</link><description>Rui Valente will return this year for another season in motorsport in the region. The Macao driver has been in the active for the same time and will play the Macau Roadsport Challenge, the tourist cars competition organized by the Macau-China General Automotive Association (AAMC), as well as the 72nd edition of the Macao Grand Prix in November
 
With the same enthusiasm recognized for decades, Rui Valente will again drive, in the 2025 season, a Subaru BRZ, the same car with which he competed in the Guide Circuit last November in the Macao Roadsport Challenge race. In the event held at the event of the territory, the Portuguese pilot finished sixth place, after losing some positions in the start, where he descended to tenth. The result was not even better because the rain -played race ended prematurely due to an opponent's accident.
In the competition for local pilots, which currently combines starting grids with more than half a hundred cars, all of them Toyota Gr86 (ZN8) or Subaru BRZ (ZD8), Rui Valente admitted to HM that “not being overcome”, revealing that he is “missing the podium, both in China and Macau…”.
Premium Racing Team driver had, in the last Macao Grand Prix, one of the fastest in terms of tip speed in the platoon of his race. Therefore, the bet for this year will be in other technical aspects of the car that go beyond the engine.
"At this moment, I just wanted to increase the diameter of the front wheels and widen the gauge to improve the car's behavior," he confided to HM, also referring that he intends to "optimize weight transmission during the curve and their output." These improvements, along with updates in the brake system, should increase the competitiveness of the Japanese machine in a fierce grid, consisting of Macau, Hong Kong pilots and China interior, with constantly evolving cars.
Undefined calendar
The AAMC -organized car competition calendar has not yet been revealed. In 2024, Macao Roadsport Challenge debuted at the Zhuzhou International Circuit in East of Hunan Province, but Rui Valente would rather the competition returned to the Guangdong International Circuit (GIC) in Zhaoqing.
“I was very fond of returning to Gic, because I have everything there,” says the Portuguese pilot, defender of the track located in the neighboring province. “When you go to a qualification test, for those who make four races and then Macau, if you are in a track you already know, such as GIC, where you are seven or more years, each time you get on the track and try to do better than last time you are improving and improving your driving. So you know you soon that you are stronger that year to Macau. ”
On the other hand, for the experienced pilot of the territory, “if you go to a new track, such as the Zhuzhou circuit, besides floors there to learn the new layout and to improve your time, you will never know if you are really stronger for Macao, as you know when you run in GIC.”
Like what happened in past seasons, the Macao Roadsport Challenge calendar is expected to be composed of two weekends, with two races each, which also serve as an determination for the Grand Prix.</description><pubDate>2025-01-21 23:47:48</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
