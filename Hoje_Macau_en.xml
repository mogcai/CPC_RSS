According to the spokeswoman for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, Zhu Fenglian, the event aims to “remember the history of the war of resistance against Japan, pay tribute to the martyrs and preserve the results” of this transfer. The ceremony will be attended by representatives from various sectors, including guests from Taiwan, and will be accompanied by exchange activities before and after the event, Zhu said.
The spokeswoman stated that the return of Taiwan to China was “a victory achieved with the sacrifice of all Chinese, including Taiwanese compatriots”, adding that the objective of the event is “to reinforce the feeling of a common nation and the objective of ‘reunification’ under Beijing’s leadership”.
On October 25, 1945, after the surrender of Japan – which had colonized Taiwan since 1895 – the Republic of China took over the administration of the island under Japanese terms of capitulation.
At the same press conference, Zhu stated that Beijing will continue to promote contacts with all political parties on the island, including the opposition party Kuomintang (KMT), based on the so-called “1992 Consensus”, according to which both parties recognize the existence of “one China”.
Zhu also recalled that Chinese President Xi Jinping sent a message of congratulations to Cheng Li-wun on October 19, on her election as the new leader of the KMT, a gesture that, according to Beijing, “plots the way forward” in relations between the two parties.</description><pubDate>2025-10-22 23:14:17</pubDate></item><item><title>Social Workers | Paul Pun remains as leader of the board</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/22/assistentes-sociais-paul-pun-mantem-se-na-lideranca-do-conselho/</link><description>Paul Pun Chi Meng will remain president of the Professional Council of Social Workers for the next three years, according to information published yesterday in the Official Bulletin.

The Directorate of Land and Urban Construction Services (DSSCU) warns the population not to resort to installing metal cages, as they constitute an illegal practice. The alert was left yesterday, through a statement, following advertisements offering the service.
According to the DSSCU “in recent days, advertisements promoting the provision of metal cage installation services” have been published on various social networks and online audiovisual platforms, considered “manifestly illegal acts”.
For this reason, DSSCU “expresses its high concern and rejection of such practices, reiterating that the Government has been continuously combating illegal works, including metal cages”.
The press release from the organization led by Lai Weng Leong also promises to combat, as a matter of priority, illegal works to install cages, illegal renovations, buildings in a dilapidated state, as well as illegal works in buildings with a use license. “DSSCU appeals to citizens not to commit legal infractions and to refrain from resorting to such metal cage installation services,” it was requested.
At the same time, DSSCU is concerned about the “proliferation, on various audiovisual platforms and online social networks, of advertisements that, through short videos, actively promote the provision of metal cage installation services, with the aim of attracting customers and inducing citizens to carry out illegal works, putting public safety at risk”. The organization therefore asks citizens to actively contribute to the elimination of illegal constructions in order to help guarantee public safety.
Fines of 240 thousand patacas
Regarding the punishment for installing metal cages, DSSCU warns that it can lead to fines of MOP240,000, and that there has been at least one previous case in which a fine of this amount was imposed.
“Among the cases dealt with by DSSCU in recent years, illegal works deserve special attention, namely metal cages commonly known as ‘overhanging balconies’, with fines reaching the amounts of 180,000 patacas in one case and 240,000 patacas in another, relating to the installation of several metal cages in a single unit”, it was reported.
The Government also points out that it will investigate the advertisements and that if the installation of cages in local buildings is confirmed, it will take the legally required measures. “Regarding the illegal works identified in the aforementioned advertisements, the DSSCU will carry out inspection and investigation actions, if the veracity of the facts is confirmed, a process will be opened for immediate monitoring”, it was pointed out.
In yesterday's statement, DSSCU also indicates that the latest changes to the legal regime for urban construction allow for the adoption of additional penalties for offenders, mainly in the case of refusal to demolish illegal works, such as the possibility of suspending the supply of water and electricity.</description><pubDate>2025-10-22 23:34:24</pubDate></item><item><title>MIF / Portugal | Difficulties in selling agricultural products to China</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/22/mif-portugal-dificuldades-na-venda-de-produtos-agricolas-a-china/</link><description>João Moura, Secretary of State for Agriculture of Portugal, speaks of “many” difficulties when Portugal sells agricultural products in China. Conversely, he recognizes that there is a lot of interest from Chinese businesspeople in investing in the Portuguese agricultural sector
The Secretary of State for Agriculture indicated yesterday, in Macau, that Portugal has excellent products and a “very significant interest” in the Chinese market, although it faces adversities that limit entry into the Asian country.
“The difficulties are many, many times, in terms of diplomatic relations, exports, imports – some adjustments that need to be made”, admitted to journalists João Moura, who is in Macau representing the Government at the 30th Macau International Fair (MIF) and the 2nd China–Portuguese Speaking Countries Economic and Commercial Exhibition (C-PLPEX), which are taking place simultaneously.
In parallel, the China-Portuguese-Speaking Countries International Agricultural Expo is organized for the first time.
These events, the person responsible highlighted, are “a great window of opportunity” to smooth out “some rough edges”. “We are in an interpretation that is often differentiated between markets as different as Portugal and China, in which food analysis and control have their differences, have their valences and, therefore, there is nothing better than talking, sitting at the table to try to overcome some of these difficulties and adversities”, he added.
Portugal, said the Secretary of State, has “several ideas” and “several products with great potential”, namely dried fruits, pork, olive oil and wine. “We have a lot of opportunity for Portuguese products that are widely accepted in China,” he said. “We have products with great export capacity, with great worldwide acceptance and, therefore, the Chinese market is a market that is of very significant interest to us, he stated.
Sinic interest
In the opposite direction, he declared that he felt in Macau “a great interest from China” in Portugal, not only in terms of exports, but also with regard to the “internationalization of some Chinese companies”. Companies in the field of technology, machinery or equipment in the area of ​​agriculture, said João Moura, without providing additional details about these companies.
“They are very interested in the development of some sectors of our agriculture and we are open to welcome them”, he concluded. In a speech given during the Round Table of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises in China and Portuguese-Speaking Countries, the Portuguese representative highlighted the “crucial role” of Macau as a connection platform, noting that the geographical and cultural position of the territory makes it “a point of convergence between East and West”, facilitating trade and investment.
"In turn, Portugal has, in the global context, a strategic position that connects the Eastern world and the American continent, without forgetting the African continent. These more agile and integrative platforms encourage and provide commercial exchanges and the growth of new companies", he said.</description><pubDate>2025-10-22 23:29:48</pubDate></item><item><title>Lam Lon Wai calls for more support after warning from TUI president</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/22/lam-lon-wai-pede-mais-apoios-depois-de-alerta-da-presidente-do-tui/</link><description>Deputy Lam Lon Wai considered that support for families should be reinforced so that they can deal with behavioral and deviant problems among young people. The deputy reacted thus to the newspaper Ou Mun, after the speech by Song Man Lei, president of the Court of Final Instance (TUI), presented this Tuesday at the opening of the 2025/2026 judicial year.
Lam Lon Wai, recently re-elected and linked to the Federation of Workers' Associations of Macau (FAOM), highlighted that the increase in crime associated with minors involves several factors, such as social changes or technological development, making it increasingly easier for young people to have access to information that could cause complications or lead to deviant behavior.
The deputy director of the Secondary School for Sons and Brothers of Workers also spoke about the fact that the family has little capacity to supervise the behavior of young people, while schools have a lack of legal education and there is no wide range of measures in the area of ​​mental health. Lam Lon Wai believes that there must be reinforcement in all these areas, suggesting a reform of the educational guardianship regime for young offenders, in order to respond to the current situation.
Collective effort
In his speech this Tuesday, Song Man Lei recalled that “for the second consecutive year there was an increase in the number of civil cases filed in the Civil Courts of the Base Judicial Court (TJB)”, with “the problems of deviant behavior of minors and offenses being increasingly serious”.
“In the last judicial year, cases relating to the general social protection regime and the educational guardianship regime, filed with the TJB's Family and Minors Court, increased from 45 and 54 to 72 and 85, respectively, registering increases of 60 and 57 percent”, he recalled.
Song Man Lei described that these data “highlight the upward trend of situations in which minors are at risk or in unfavorable environments for their growth and the situation of juvenile delinquency”. These are processes “intimately related to the family environment, and the simultaneous increase in numbers demonstrates that some families present dysfunctions in terms of education, communication and emotional support”, where “parents are unable to effectively exercise their parental responsibilities because they are busy with work, because they do not have knowledge in the area of ​​education or because they face emotional and economic pressures”.</description><pubDate>2025-10-22 23:28:27</pubDate></item><item><title>CPPCC | Visit to Portugal with request from overseas Chinese</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/22/ccppc-visita-a-portugal-com-pedido-a-chineses-ultramarinos/</link><description>A visit to Portugal by the Liaison Committee with Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan and Overseas Chinese of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference began on October 14th. In a colloquium, Liu Cigui, director of the Committee, defended greater work by Chinese people living outside the country in defense of the country's unification
The Liaison Committee with Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan and Overseas Chinese of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) is in Portugal on an official visit, which began on October 14th. According to the newspaper Ou Mun, Liu Cigui, director of the aforementioned Committee, defended, in a colloquium, that the Chinese residing in Portugal must firmly defend the unification of the country, opposing all ideas of independence.
Liu Cigui, also head of the delegation, participated in the colloquium together with representatives of Portuguese companies with Chinese capital invested, the Luso-Chinese Association of Traders and Industrialists and overseas Chinese.
The official also said at the colloquium that unity and an expanded connection with Chinese people living abroad are essential work of the CPPCC Committee, with the expectation that these Chinese people will come together to build a harmonious community outside the country, promoting the growth of new generations of Chinese.
Cultural bridge
The director also hoped that overseas Chinese would use culture as a bridge to connect them to the country, promoting positive voices from China. Liu Cigui recalled that this year marks the 20th anniversary of the establishment, between China and Portugal, of a comprehensive strategic partnership, and over this time both countries have strengthened mutual political trust. For Liu Cigui, there are fruitful results from this cooperation in several areas.
Regarding the future of the bilateral relationship, the official said he hopes that China and Portugal will continue to maintain traditional ties of friendship and can reinforce the alignment of development strategies, expanding cooperation in areas such as innovation, green economy, oceans and medicine, among others.
Liu Cigui also spoke about Macau's role in this relationship. According to Ou Mun, it considered that the Macao SAR could have a unique role as a connecting bridge between the two countries, and should make good use of the Forum Macau mechanism and encourage cultural, educational, tourist and scientific research exchanges.
Liu Cigui also left the hope that companies with Chinese capital in Portugal and the Chinese community take advantage of the advantages they have and make a stronger contribution to cooperation and friendship between the two countries. As part of this visit to Portugal, the delegation also traveled to Quinta da Marmeleira, located in Alenquer, a wine production project with investment from the now deceased Macau businessman, Wu Zhiwei. Liu Cigui praised the project and recalled that, in recent years, it has played a role as a bridge between Macau, China and Portugal, actively participating in projects in the Greater Bay Area and the development of Hengqin. For the person responsible, this is a good example of a Macau company that is integrated into national development and reaches abroad through the Macao SAR.</description><pubDate>2025-10-22 23:23:14</pubDate></item><item><title>Ephemeris | Celebration of the 80th anniversary of the end of Japanese rule in Taiwan</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/22/efemeride-celebracao-dos-80-anos-do-fim-do-dominio-japones-em-taiwan/</link><description>China will organize a ceremony this weekend to mark 80 years of the “retrocession” of Taiwan, the name given by Beijing to the return of the island after the Japanese surrender in 1945, official sources announced yesterday.

This is the work of Portuguese artist Pedro Pascoinho, included in the “Common Vision” exhibition. There are 20 charcoal drawings made on “artistic fabrianno” paper, which reveal very unique compositions and visions.
It all started in the beauty of the Lou Lim Ieoc garden, an iconic place in Macau that Pedro Pascoinho, a Portuguese artist, visited for the first time in 2019. This was also the first time that the artist set foot in the territory and now he does so again with the exhibition “Common Vision”, organized by D’Entranhas – Associação Cultural and curated by Vera Paz.
“Common Vision” therefore began to be imagined in the Chinese-inspired garden, but it aims to show a certain common vision of how apparently different things can have points in common. "I really like Chinese painting, although Chinese painting is quite vast, but I especially like ancient painting from the 13th and 14th centuries. It was there [during the visit to Lou Lim Ieoc] that I thought about establishing some parallel", he told HM.
And according to a note from As Entranhas, what will be presented from this Saturday, at 6:30 pm, at the Lotus Art Space gallery, are 20 charcoal works on “fabrianno artistic” paper, consisting of “drawings of variable dimensions, in which Pascoinho shows us intimate, sober and refined compositions, which he himself considers universal”.
There is in “Common Vision” an “intentional choice of elements in the narrative construction”, as is the case of “fragments, objects, figures and represented landscapes that evoke enigmatic, almost ghostly spaces that take us back to the passage of time”.
These drawings are designed individually, but “are born from the desire to create a space of common memory”, in an “attempt to find new paths and references, in any time or place”. This is an “essential condition” of the artist’s work: an “inner observation and critical thinking”, mirrored in this exhibition.
In an interview with HM, the artist highlighted that this exhibition “brings a somewhat common vision, in the sense that our Western aesthetic is different from the Eastern one, but there is still a proximity”.
Always the drawing
Pedro Pascoinho's vision always translates into the desire to make drawings, not photographs. "What I do is start from fragments with an almost photographic base, although my intention is not to produce photography, but rather drawings. Basically, it is as if these works had a code, but a code that is quite universal, in which we can understand the image well, in a certain way. Hence this logic of 'common vision', of a common vision about things."
Pedro Pascoinho talks about how “the images and fragments were common, with a somewhat universal approach”, in which “you manage to capture the object, which ends up being figurative”.
"There is not a way of seeing here, but rather of observing. Things are in front of us, but then the observation depends on each one. There are several messages and readings that can be made. It is a figurative work, but it doesn't just go in one direction and I like to have things open like that, because then it depends on each one how to observe things."
Regarding his passion for Chinese painting, Pedro Pascoinho speaks of a “very advanced painting for the time”, being “aesthetically different” from Portuguese painting of those years, and even European painting. “Despite this, you can learn a lot, even through the themes themselves, both in terms of the landscape and the contemplative side of the pieces.”
In 2019, Pedro Pascoinho took “Establishment” to Macau, namely to Casa Garden. Since then, “significant changes” have taken place in his work. That year there were changes in the “very composition” of the works and in the choice of colors, or lack thereof.
"I think about the work before executing it, and for me it is as if it were a painting without colors, a black and white drawing. And in this exhibition “Common Vision” there is only one work with color. There was then this change, since 2020, in which I have only dedicated myself to drawing on a large scale and in which there is an absence of color. I had a debate about white, because it is a color that I don't deal with very well, it isn't even a color at all."
Pedro Pascoinho always approached color and “worked in series”, but at the end of 2019 it was already “difficult to think at the level of color, and then, even due to the way the world changed, from then on it became more difficult to think about colors”. "It's difficult to see things and produce in color, and I started to see the world in black and white. I'm not saying that I don't do things in color, but, for me, the preference and the way I think, the absence of color is part of that. It's difficult to think about color", he stressed.
About Macau, he says he was surprised. “It’s having contact with a completely different culture, it seems that we are always looking for what is Portuguese”, analyzing a kind of relationship with a territory “that is different from China”. “There is always this interesting side, where I was able to see points that, for me, ended up being fascinating, from the markets to the food,” he said.  The exhibition will be on view at the Lotus Art Space gallery until November 19th, from Tuesday to Sunday, from 1pm to 7pm.</description><pubDate>2025-10-22 23:42:48</pubDate></item><item><title>Aviation | China accuses Australia of provocation and denies dangerous maneuvers</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/22/aviacao-china-acusa-a-australia-de-provocacao-e-nega-manobras-perigosas/</link><description>Beijing yesterday accused Australia of “illegal intrusion” into its airspace over the Paracel Islands and of “distorting the facts”, after Canberra reported “unsafe” maneuvers by Chinese fighters against an Australian military plane.
“Australia’s allegations confuse right with wrong and seek to cover up a serious violation of Chinese sovereignty,” Defense Ministry spokesman Jiang Bin said in a statement. Jiang indicated that the People's Liberation Army's Southern Theater Command "organized forces to legitimately, legally, professionally and restrainedly intercept and expel" the Australian aircraft.
The Ministry also called on Australia to “immediately cease all provocations and sensationalism”, “restrict air and naval operations” and “avoid damage to bilateral relations and ties between the Armed Forces of both countries”.
On Monday, Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles revealed that an Australian Air Force P-8 maritime patrol plane was intercepted on Sunday by two Chinese Su-35 fighter jets, which dropped flares “very close” to the aircraft, describing the incident as “unsafe and unprofessional”. According to Marles, the plane was carrying out a routine surveillance mission over the South China Sea when it was intercepted.
Beijing maintains that the Australian aircraft entered the airspace of the Xisha – Chinese name for the Paracel Islands – without authorization, an archipelago whose sovereignty China claims almost in its entirety and where it maintains military installations. The South China Sea is one of the most persistent flashpoints in Asia.</description><pubDate>2025-10-22 23:12:18</pubDate></item><item><title>C-PLPEX with a record number of Portuguese-speaking exhibitors and Pelé’s “iconic shirt”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/22/c-plpex-com-recorde-de-expositores-lusofonos-e-iconica-camisola-de-pele/</link><description>The China-Portuguese-Speaking Countries Economic and Commercial Exhibition (C-PLPEX) kicks off today in Macau, with 320 Portuguese-speaking exhibitors and, in a “sporting touch”, the exhibition of the iconic shirt worn by Pelé in the 1962 World Cup.
In the second edition of C-PLPEX, Deep Robotics, a Chinese innovation company founded in 2017, will present two robot dogs. These are “very mature products”, which can, for example, be sent to assess the situation in a fire scenario, a representative of the BPS Global Group, Deep Robotics agent in Australia, Hong Kong and Macau, explained to journalists.
With its participation in C-PLPEX, highlighted Wong, the company has “Macau as a priority”, but doors can open to other latitudes.
“We need to know if Portuguese-speaking countries are interested and if the parent company has any plans to expand and to which Portuguese-speaking countries”, added the person in charge, during a visit by journalists to the fair site, which runs until Saturday.
Deep Robotics will occupy one of the almost 500 exhibitors from China and Portuguese-speaking countries present this year at C-PLPEX. There were 320 exhibitors in the Portuguese-speaking world alone, which represents “an increase of 23 percent compared to the first edition”, announced, at a press conference, the president of the Macau Trade and Investment Promotion Institute (IPIM). “A third are from Brazil, a third from Portugal and the rest are from [other] Portuguese-speaking countries”, added Che Weng Keong.
Years of debuts
In parallel, this year, for the first time, the China-Portuguese Speaking Countries International Agricultural Expo will take place. Brazil, considered the person responsible for IPIM, weighed in on the decision to launch this new exhibition.
"Brazil is a very large country, linked to food production, agricultural production and, taking this into consideration, we decided to hold this exhibition. In the interior of China, this [agricultural] area is very advanced and can have a good relationship with Portuguese-speaking countries", explained the president of IPIM.
Alan Ho, coordinator of C-PLPEX, also noted that bringing “many people” from the Portuguese-speaking world and the interior of China to Macau is “crucial to promoting the Macau platform”. In a “sporting and cultural touch” of this fair, continued Alan Ho, this year “the yellow number 10 jersey worn by Pelé in 1962” will be displayed “for the first time in Macau” during the World Cup.</description><pubDate>2025-10-22 00:24:15</pubDate></item><item><title>Paulo Maia and Carmo</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/autor/paulomaiaecarmo/</link><description>Yelu Abaoji (872-926), the head of the nomadic Khitan people, a word translated as Qidan, contrary to tradition, decided to establish in his vast territory in 916 a dynasty in the style of the disintegrated Tang dynasty (618-907) and all the others that preceded it, with the succession of the maximum leader becoming hereditary and not a choice by a council tribal.
He even went so far as, once again going against nomadic tradition, to build a «Supreme capital», Shangjing, Linhuangfu, designed in a grid pattern with streets aligned in the style of Chang’an, the capital of the Tang. And although it was the tribal military who made the decisions, Han civilians were chosen for state administration. He called this State Da Qidan and was posthumously given the title of Taizu Tian Huangdi, “Heavenly Emperor Taizu”. His successor would change the name of the dynasty to Liao and despite subsequent setbacks, this would be the name that would prevail.
Abaoji had a son, Yelu Bei (899-937), whom he named Crown Prince and gave the title Renhuang Wang, «Imperial King of Men», handing him over the governance of the kingdom of Dongdan. And when the time for succession arrived, Yelu Bei naturally expected to inherit his father's title, but his mother, the ruthless Empress Dowager Shulu Ping (879-953), had other plans and with cold blood and cunning made the succession fall to another of her sons.
What was improbable followed in Yelu Bei's life would be remembered years later by the poet, calligrapher and painter of the Yuan dynasty, Zhu Derun (1294-1365). Next to the figure of a horseman on a swift ride in the Deer Hunt on a horizontal scroll that was attributed to Yelu Bei (ink and color on paper, 24.6 x 79.9 cm, in the Metmuseum) he wrote: «To escape the persecution of Yelu Deguang (r. as Liao Taizong, 927-947) he crossed the sea and arrived at Dengzhou (in Shandong) and there he paid allegiance to Emperor Mingzong (r.925-933) of the Late Tang (923-936) and in return was granted the name Li and the commandership of Huaihai.”
Li Zanhua would therefore be the name that Yelu Bei would use from then on. A name – Li – of enormous prestige because this was the name of the ruling family during the Tang dynasty, offered by Emperor Xianzong (r.805-820) to the founders of that second of the Five Dynasties period as a reward for their loyalty and which they carried, like the name Tang, with pride. Li Zanhua, wrote Zhu Derun, “used to take paintings and books with him when he traveled. He liked to paint knights with bows, on hunts or excursions. His clothes and accessories followed the rustic conventions of the barbarians because that was what he was used to and felt comfortable with. The way he used the brush was soft and fine while the dynamism of the men and horses corresponds to the spirit of the 8th century Tang. A painting that deserves to be appreciated.”</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Today Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/autor/hoje-macau/</link><description>The “Exhibition of Illustrated Books in Chinese and Portuguese” opens to the public this Friday, which will be on view at the Carmo Auditorium until the 2nd of November, as part of the seventh edition of the “Encounter in Macau – Festival of Arts and Culture between China and Portuguese-speaking Countries”, which also includes the Lusofonia Festival.

The UN agency said that six of its operations – in Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Haiti, Somalia, South Sudan and Sudan – are “facing major disruptions, which will only worsen”. WFP warned that its financing “has never been so challenging”, anticipating “a 40 percent drop” in 2025, “which will translate into a projected budget of US$6.4 billion, compared to US$10 billion in 2024”.
The report does not name any countries, but points to a study published in the medical journal The Lancet, which found that 14 million additional deaths worldwide from disease, nutritional deficiencies and maternal and perinatal conditions could occur by 2030 as a result of cuts in US humanitarian aid alone.
Returns and records
Since US President Donald Trump's return to the White House, Washington has announced massive cuts in its foreign aid, dealing a huge blow to humanitarian operations around the world. "Program coverage has been significantly reduced and rations cut. Vital assistance to families in food disaster situations [Phase 5 of the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification/IPC] is threatened, while preparedness for future impacts has significantly decreased," warns WFP.
Globally, “WFP estimates that its funding gaps could push 10.5 to 13.7 million people currently in acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3) into a humanitarian emergency (IPC Phase 4),” the organization added. The UN agency said global hunger has now reached record levels, with 319 million people facing acute food insecurity — including 44 million at emergency levels.</description><pubDate>2025-10-16 02:52:23</pubDate></item><item><title>Death | António Coelho dies aged 77, but leaves a legacy in Portuguese gastronomy</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/14/obito-antonio-coelho-morre-com-77-anos-mas-deixa-legado-na-gastronomia-portuguesa/</link><description>The founder of Restaurante António died on Sunday in Macau, due to heart problems. Behind him, he leaves a mark and an innovative concept for promoting Portuguese food in Asia
A father, a friend and one of the great ambassadors of Portuguese gastronomy in Asia. Chef António Coelho died on Sunday, aged 77, due to heart problems, but leaves behind a professional career spanning almost 40 years and an influence that can be felt in several restaurants and Portuguese food chefs in Macau.
Born in Portugal in 1948, António Coelho's first contact with Macau took place in 1970, when he had to complete his four-year mandatory military service. After two years, the land remained in his memory, but the future chef chose to return to Europe.
In Portugal, he started working at Social Security, later moving to a clinical analysis laboratory. It was in this area that he developed his taste for gastronomy, not through work, but through various lunches and dinners in different restaurants. Increasingly interested in cooking, António decided to take a job, in 1984, in a restaurant, where he admitted to having learned to cook, according to an interview with the South China Morning Post newspaper, in 2018.
The first years of António Coelho's new career were spent in Portugal, where he performed different roles as manager-administrator of the Botequim do Rei restaurant or director of the catering department at the Grande Hotel da Curia. In 1996, he had his first international experience, as director of the restaurant department at the Hotel Trópico, in Cape Verde. The experience lasts one year.
Creating a legacy
Returning to Macau in 1997, António worked for 10 years in different spaces, such as the restaurants Frol de la Mar, Lusitano, Lisbon, and also had a brief stay in Hong Kong, in 2002, at Restaurante Inn. However, the decisive step towards his affirmation as one of the most influential chefs of Portuguese gastronomy in Asia came in 2007, with the opening of Restaurante António.
And the success that followed was not the result of chance, as said by Edgar Rodrigues, a chef who came to Macau to work on the launch of the project: “The success was based on the recipes, the quality of the food, but also the very professionalism”, says Edgar Rodrigues, to HM. "He was very attentive to his customers. If there was an order for clams à bolhão pato, he would have different recipes adapted to the nationality. For example, Koreans don't like coriander, the recipe for them didn't have coriander. Chinese customers like little salt, they were served with little salt, and locals like the more traditional recipe. In a single dish there were several ways of cooking, just to satisfy different customers", he recalls.
Cristiano Tavares, currently chef at the Macalhau restaurant, also came to Macau to work at the António Restaurant. He believes that the chef found a position for Portuguese food that still influences other restaurants today. “I think his success was due to his way of being, he was a politically correct person, he had a way of working that pleased both Chinese, Korean and Japanese tourists”, explained Cristiano Tavares, to HM. "We were a street restaurant with four or five cooks. He managed to do what many large restaurants still cannot do today. Nowadays there are many restaurants with Portuguese food that open in Macau, but follow the example of what he did", he considered.
Quality and spectacle
In addition to the food, Restaurante António customers were seduced by the “show”. This is the vision of Marcelino Marques, António's friend and musician who for several years livened up the space's nights, with traditional Portuguese music.
"The quality of the food made the space popular. He took great care in choosing the food and drinks served. He went to Portugal to choose wines from various regions, such as Douro or Alentejo, all of high quality, which were bottled under the António brand. People knew they weren't going to pay little, not that it was a space with luxury prices, it wasn't, but the quantity served wasn't small", recalled Marcelino Marques.
However, the musician believes that the success was also due to a concept in which the meal was also a spectacle: "People liked listening to Portuguese music, but also being with António. He was an affable, big person and appeared in that white jacket with the flags of Portugal, China and Macau and people liked his presence and asked him to take photographs", he says. "He also opened a bottle of champagne with a sword. He did a whole ceremony and people really liked it. It was a spectacle and a party to see the cork flying out of the bottle. It worked well", he recalled.
Marcelino Marques recalls that the food and the show made the restaurant very famous, especially among Japanese, Korean and Hong Kong tourists. The musician reveals that Japanese tourists booked days in advance. And this factor also contributed to the fact that António offered a glass of port wine at the end of the meal, which also led to the recognition of the Port Wine Confraternity.
The success of Restaurante António led the chef to sell the space to an investment fund, becoming an ambassador for the space. The break with the fund happened in 2020, when he was fired without just cause. The case ended up in court, with António winning the case. In recent years, António took on the position of executive chef at Angela’s Café and Lounge, at the Hotel Lisboeta.
A father, a friend
Due to his work in Macau, António was distinguished, in 2013, by the Macao SAR Government with the MSAR Tourist Merit Medal. Also in 2015, he received the merit medal for Portuguese communities from the Portuguese Government. However, for those who worked with him the most important thing was the relationship that went beyond the strictly professional field.
"He had a big impact on Macau and for me he was like a second father. When I came to Macau I didn't have an easy life and he always held my hand", confessed Rodrigues. "He was always a person who was there for me. And I always saw him as a man of iron. In everything he did, there was a great will", he pointed out.
This is a feeling shared by Cristiano Tavares. "António is my father in Macau. He worked until the last day, always with seriousness, honesty and integrity. He is an example for all the chefs in this area", he said.
For Marcelino Marques, António's death is the loss of a friend. "António was the person who welcomed me to Macau and was capable of doing the same to everyone. He was strict and demanding, but he was an excellent person", he described. "Everyone knew him. He was an affable person and received people like no one else", he added.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Chemistry | Nobel Prize for the development of metal-organic structures</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/09/quimica-nobel-para-o-desenvolvimento-de-estruturas-metalorganicas/</link><description>The Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Susumu Kitagawa, from Kyoto University, Richard Robson, from the University of Melbourne, and Omar M. Yaghi, from the University of California, “for the development of metal-organic structures”, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced yesterday.
Susumu Kitagawa, Richard Robson and Omar Yaghi have developed a new form of molecular architecture – metal-organic frameworks – that can be used to collect water from desert air, capture carbon dioxide, store toxic gases or catalyze chemical reactions.
The three laureates created molecular constructs with large spaces through which gases and other chemicals could flow. The president of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry, Heiner Linque, highlighted precisely the fact that these “metal-organic structures have enormous potential, bringing previously unforeseen opportunities for personalized materials with new functions”.
The research that led to the discovery of this new form of molecular architecture began nearly four decades ago, in 1989, when Richard Robson tested the use of the inherent properties of atoms by combining positively charged copper ions with a four-armed molecule.
When combined, they bonded "to form a spacious, well-ordered crystal. It was like a diamond filled with countless cavities," the academy explains. Robson immediately realized the potential of his molecular construction, but it was still unstable and crumbled easily. It was chemists Susumu Kitagawa and Omar Yaghi who managed to provide a solid foundation for this construction method.
Notable applications
Following the discoveries of the three laureates, chemists built tens of thousands of different MOFs. Some of them could contribute to solving some of humanity's biggest challenges, with applications including breaking down traces of pharmaceuticals in the environment, capturing carbon dioxide or collecting water from desert air.
The discovery also allows the separation of perfluoroalkylated and polyfluoroalkylated substances (PFAS) from water. PFAS are a group of synthetic chemical compounds known as “forever chemicals” due to their extreme persistence in the environment and in the human body.
PFAS are used in a wide range of industrial and household products, such as stain- and water-resistant textiles, food packaging, non-stick cookware and firefighting foams. Its accumulation in the environment and potential health risks, including liver damage and other problems, have led to concerns and a search for safer alternatives.</description><pubDate>2025-10-09 00:41:14</pubDate></item><item><title>Louvre | France to reinforce security at cultural sites after theft</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/21/louvre-franca-vai-reforcar-seguranca-de-locais-culturais-apos-roubo/</link><description>The French Minister of Internal Affairs, Laurent Nuñez, will reinforce security measures in all cultural establishments, the press office announced yesterday, following a jewelry theft at the Louvre Museum in Paris. The decision was taken after a meeting with his government colleague in charge of Culture, Rachida Dati, said the same ministerial source, cited by the French news agency AFP.
The institution, in the center of the French capital, remained closed yesterday, one day after a group, still at large, managed to steal multiple works of jewelry art. "The Louvre Museum will remain closed today (yesterday) for exceptional reasons. We apologize for the inconvenience", read a message published on the museum's official website.
A group of four men stole jewelry on Sunday morning, in just a few minutes and when the museum was already open and with visitors inside, using a forklift machine, parked on the respective bank of the River Seine, and raising it to the height of a window on the first floor of the building.
The group took eight pieces “of inestimable heritage value”, including the tiara of Empress Eugenie (wife of Napoleon III, emperor from 1852 to 1870) and two necklaces, the French Ministry of Culture reported on Sunday. That jewel alone has 212 pearls and 1,998 diamonds, according to the Louvre's description, while the pieces belonging to Queen Maria Amélia have multiple sapphires and hundreds of diamonds.
This Parisian museum is the largest and most visited in the world, with nine million people enjoying part of the 35,000 works that the institution houses, in its 73 thousand square meters of space.</description><pubDate>2025-10-21 01:53:26</pubDate></item><item><title>Study | Trump was the main disseminator of disinformation in the USA in 2024</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/09/estudo-trump-foi-principal-disseminador-de-desinformacao-nos-eua-em-2024/</link><description>North American President Donald Trump was the main disseminator of disinformation in the United States of America (USA) in 2024, concluded a study by the International Center for Journalists (ICFJ). “US President Donald Trump was the dominant source and distributor of disinformation” in 2024, say the authors of the study “Disarming Disinformation: United States”.
The study highlights that Trump has drawn on the functions of domestic political forces, rather than foreign state actors, as the main source of disinformation narratives in US political discourse. Furthermore, the existence of WhatsApp groups and other closed digital spaces often act as “information cocoons” that encourage rumors and other forms of misinformation.
In this way, "the viral spread of misinformation and the strategic attack on journalists have emerged as interconnected threats to democracy. In an era of increasing authoritarianism and democratic backsliding, falsehoods are often used as a weapon by state actors to influence public opinion, undermine journalism and intimidate journalists."
The study authors state that these factors are increasingly the North American reality, with Donald Trump “promulgating manifestly false narratives” in recent years.
“The American media faces a profound information crisis, at a time of repression of freedom of expression”, the study reads. In this sense, trust in the mainstream press continues to decline in a climate of increasing attacks on the media by the Trump Government.
The study published by the International Center for Journalists (ICFJ) was based on the analysis of 10,000 news and media publications during 2024, as well as a survey of 1,020 Americans.</description><pubDate>2025-10-09 00:38:02</pubDate></item><item><title>Scientists ‘reduce’ the age of the Egyptian temple of Karnak, in Egypt</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/08/cientistas-reduzem-idade-do-templo-egipcio-de-karnak-no-egipto/</link><description>Researchers have carried out the most comprehensive geoarchaeological study of the Karnak temple, near Luxor, and revealed suggestive links to ancient Egyptian mythology and new data about the interaction between the complex's riverine landscape and the people who occupied the site during its almost 3,000 years of use.
The results of the investigation were published on Monday in Antiquity magazine, reported the Efe news agency. Researchers from the University of Southampton, in the United Kingdom, and Uppsala University, in Sweden, participated in the study. Up to 61 sediment samples from the interior and surroundings of the temple and thousands of ceramic fragments found in the Karnak complex, located 500 meters east of the current Nile River, near Luxor, in the ancient Egyptian religious capital of Thebes, were analyzed.
The researchers mapped how the landscape around the site changed throughout its history and found that, before 2520 BC, the site could not have been suitable for permanent occupation due to periodic flooding caused by the Nile's strong currents. Therefore, they placed the earliest occupation at Karnak during the Old Kingdom (between 2591 and 2152 BC).
Pottery fragments found at the site corroborate this discovery, with the oldest dating between 2305 and 1980 BC. Therefore, the conclusions of this international team of researchers provide new evidence about the age of Karnak, which has been hotly debated in archaeological circles for decades.
The origin of everything
The ground on which the temple was founded was formed when river channels advanced west and east, creating an island of high ground in what is now the east-southeast region of the site. This emerging island laid the foundation for the occupation and initial construction of Karnak.
Over the following centuries and millennia, the river channels on both sides of the site diverged further, creating more space for the development of the temple complex, as researchers have now confirmed. This new understanding of the temple's landscape bears striking similarities to an ancient Egyptian creation myth, leading the team to believe that the decision to locate the temple there may have been related to the religious views of its inhabitants.
Ancient Egyptian texts from the Old Kingdom indicate that the 'Creator God' manifested himself as high ground emerging from the lake, and researchers have found that the island where Karnak was founded is the only known area of ​​high ground surrounded by water in the region.
Thus, archaeologists have suggested that the Theban elites chose the location of Karnak to be the abode of a new form of 'Creator God', alluding to Amun-Ra, the supreme god of ancient Egypt, since the location fit perfectly into the mythological setting of the highlands that emerged from the surrounding waters as the origin of the formation of the Universe.</description><pubDate>2025-10-08 17:22:05</pubDate></item><item><title>Physics | Nobel Prize for Macroscopic Quantum Mechanical Tunneling</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/07/fisica-nobel-para-tunelamento-mecanico-quantico-macroscopico/</link><description>The Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to John Clarke, Michel H. Devoret and John M. Martinis “for the discovery of macroscopic quantum mechanical tunneling and the quantization of energy in an electrical circuit”, announced yesterday the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.
"An important question in physics is the maximum size of a system capable of demonstrating the effects of quantum mechanics. This year's Nobel Prize laureates carried out experiments with an electrical circuit in which they demonstrated both quantum tunneling and quantized energy levels in a system large enough to be held in the hand", explains the Swedish Academy of Sciences in a statement published on its website.
The British John Clarke carried out his research at the University of California, Berkeley, USA; the American John Martinis at the University of California, Santa Barbara; and the Frenchman Michel Devoret at Yale University and also in California, Santa Barbara.
According to academia, quantum mechanics allows a particle to directly cross a barrier, through a process called tunneling. When a large number of particles are involved, quantum effects usually become negligible. The experiments of the now distinguished scientists demonstrated that quantum properties can be made concrete on a macroscopic scale.
"It is wonderful to be able to celebrate the way in which quantum mechanics, more than a century old, continues to offer new surprises. It is also extremely useful, as it is the basis of all digital technology", said the president of the Nobel Committee for Physics, Olle Eriksson, quoted in the statement.
The Swedish academy says that transistors in computer microchips are an example of consolidated quantum technology.

Conversely, he recognizes that there is a lot of interest from Chinese businesspeople in investing in the Portuguese agricultural sector
The Secretary of State for Agriculture indicated yesterday, in Macau, that Portugal has excellent products and a “very significant interest” in the Chinese market, although it faces adversities that limit entry into the Asian country.
“The difficulties are many, many times, in terms of diplomatic relations, exports, imports – some adjustments that need to be made”, admitted to journalists João Moura, who is in Macau representing the Government at the 30th Macau International Fair (MIF) and the 2nd China–Portuguese Speaking Countries Economic and Commercial Exhibition (C-PLPEX), which are taking place simultaneously.
In parallel, the China-Portuguese Speaking Countries International Agricultural Expo is organized for the first time.
These events, the person responsible highlighted, are “a great window of opportunity” to smooth out “some rough edges”. “We are in an interpretation that is often differentiated between markets as different as Portugal and China, in which food analysis and control have their differences, have their valences and, therefore, there is nothing better than talking, sitting at the table to try to overcome some of these difficulties and adversities”, he added.
Portugal, said the Secretary of State, has “several ideas” and “several products with great potential”, namely dried fruits, pork, olive oil and wine. “We have a lot of opportunity for Portuguese products that are widely accepted in China,” he said. “We have products with great export capacity, with great worldwide acceptance and, therefore, the Chinese market is a market that is of very significant interest to us, he stated.
Sinic interest
In the opposite direction, he declared that he felt in Macau “a great interest from China” in Portugal, not only in terms of exports, but also with regard to the “internationalization of some Chinese companies”. Companies in the field of technology, machinery or equipment in the area of ​​agriculture, said João Moura, without providing additional details about these companies.
“They are very interested in the development of some sectors of our agriculture and we are open to welcome them”, he concluded. In a speech given during the Round Table of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises in China and Portuguese-Speaking Countries, the Portuguese representative highlighted the “crucial role” of Macau as a connection platform, noting that the geographical and cultural position of the territory makes it “a point of convergence between East and West”, facilitating trade and investment.
"In turn, Portugal has, in the global context, a strategic position that connects the Eastern world and the American continent, without forgetting the African continent. These more agile and integrative platforms encourage and provide commercial exchanges and the growth of new companies", he said.</description><pubDate>2025-10-22 23:29:48</pubDate></item><item><title>Lam Lon Wai calls for more support after warning from TUI president</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/22/lam-lon-wai-pede-mais-apoios-depois-de-alerta-da-presidente-do-tui/</link><description>Deputy Lam Lon Wai considered that support for families should be reinforced so that they can deal with behavioral and deviant problems among young people. The deputy reacted thus to the newspaper Ou Mun, after the speech by Song Man Lei, president of the Court of Final Instance (TUI), presented this Tuesday at the opening of the 2025/2026 judicial year.
Lam Lon Wai, recently re-elected and linked to the Federation of Workers' Associations of Macau (FAOM), highlighted that the increase in crime associated with minors involves several factors, such as social changes or technological development, making it increasingly easier for young people to have access to information that could cause complications or lead to deviant behavior.
The deputy director of the Secondary School for Sons and Brothers of Workers also spoke about the fact that the family has little capacity to supervise the behavior of young people, while schools have a lack of legal education and there is no wide range of measures in the area of ​​mental health. Lam Lon Wai believes that there must be reinforcement in all these areas, suggesting a reform of the educational guardianship regime for young offenders, in order to respond to the current situation.
Collective effort
In his speech this Tuesday, Song Man Lei recalled that “for the second consecutive year there was an increase in the number of civil cases filed in the Civil Courts of the Base Judicial Court (TJB)”, with “the problems of deviant behavior of minors and offenses being increasingly serious”.
“In the last judicial year, cases relating to the general social protection regime and the educational guardianship regime, filed with the TJB's Family and Minors Court, increased from 45 and 54 to 72 and 85, respectively, registering increases of 60 and 57 percent”, he recalled.
Song Man Lei described that these data “highlight the upward trend of situations in which minors are at risk or in unfavorable environments for their growth and the situation of juvenile delinquency”. These are processes “intimately related to the family environment, and the simultaneous increase in numbers demonstrates that some families present dysfunctions in terms of education, communication and emotional support”, where “parents are unable to effectively exercise their parental responsibilities because they are busy with work, because they do not have knowledge in the area of ​​education or because they face emotional and economic pressures”.</description><pubDate>2025-10-22 23:28:27</pubDate></item><item><title>Social Workers | Paul Pun remains as leader of the board</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/22/assistentes-sociais-paul-pun-mantem-se-na-lideranca-do-conselho/</link><description>Paul Pun Chi Meng will remain president of the Professional Council of Social Workers for the next three years, according to information published yesterday in the Official Bulletin.

In a colloquium, Liu Cigui, director of the Committee, defended greater work by Chinese people living outside the country in defense of the country's unification
The Liaison Committee with Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan and Overseas Chinese of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) is in Portugal on an official visit, which began on October 14th. According to the newspaper Ou Mun, Liu Cigui, director of the aforementioned Committee, defended, in a colloquium, that the Chinese residing in Portugal must firmly defend the unification of the country, opposing all ideas of independence.
Liu Cigui, also head of the delegation, participated in the colloquium together with representatives of Portuguese companies with Chinese capital invested, the Luso-Chinese Association of Traders and Industrialists and overseas Chinese.
The official also said at the colloquium that unity and an expanded connection with Chinese people living abroad are essential work of the CPPCC Committee, with the expectation that these Chinese people will come together to build a harmonious community outside the country, promoting the growth of new generations of Chinese.
Cultural bridge
The director also hoped that overseas Chinese would use culture as a bridge to connect them to the country, promoting positive voices from China. Liu Cigui recalled that this year marks the 20th anniversary of the establishment, between China and Portugal, of a comprehensive strategic partnership, and over this time both countries have strengthened mutual political trust. For Liu Cigui, there are fruitful results from this cooperation in several areas.
Regarding the future of the bilateral relationship, the official said he hopes that China and Portugal will continue to maintain traditional ties of friendship and can reinforce the alignment of development strategies, expanding cooperation in areas such as innovation, green economy, oceans and medicine, among others.
Liu Cigui also spoke about Macau's role in this relationship. According to Ou Mun, it considered that the Macao SAR could have a unique role as a connecting bridge between the two countries, and should make good use of the Forum Macau mechanism and encourage cultural, educational, tourist and scientific research exchanges.
Liu Cigui also left the hope that companies with Chinese capital in Portugal and the Chinese community take advantage of the advantages they have and make a stronger contribution to cooperation and friendship between the two countries. As part of this visit to Portugal, the delegation also traveled to Quinta da Marmeleira, located in Alenquer, a wine production project with investment from the now deceased Macau businessman, Wu Zhiwei. Liu Cigui praised the project and recalled that, in recent years, it has played a role as a bridge between Macau, China and Portugal, actively participating in projects in the Greater Bay Area and the development of Hengqin. For the person responsible, this is a good example of a Macau company that is integrated into national development and reaches abroad through the Macao SAR.</description><pubDate>2025-10-22 23:23:14</pubDate></item><item><title>AAM | Limited publication of rulings is not very transparent</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/22/aam-parca-publicacao-de-acordaos-e-pouco-transparente/</link><description>At the opening of another Judicial Year, Vong Hin Fai, president of the Macau Lawyers Association, lamented that there is a “partial and limited publication” of court rulings, which poses problems regarding “judicial transparency”. As for law, the outlook is one of stability
The president of the Macau Lawyers Association (AAM), Vong Hin Fai, warned about the limited publication of some court rulings, which, in his opinion, raises questions of lack of transparency. This idea was left in the speech given at another opening of the Judicial Year.
In his opinion, there is “a partial publication limited to a few instances, far from public expectations regarding judicial transparency”. The person responsible gives the example of “the decisions of the Base Judicial Court, namely those decisions of the first instance that cannot be appealed, which are not published in a systematic and regular manner, which could lead to a lack of uniformity in legal opinions in different cases”. This also results in “limitations to legal research and education due to a lack of sufficient practical material”.
Publishing more rulings would increase “the transparency of final judicial decisions” and allow “greater disclosure of judicial justice”, in addition to allowing “the public to better understand the legal consequences for each type of act”.
“Stable development”
With regard to law, Sam Hou Fai mentioned numbers that show a sign of stability: currently, the AAM has increased the number of registered lawyers sixfold compared to “the 74 lawyers registered in 1991”. There is, therefore, “stable development”, with 449 registered lawyers, which, even so, “represents a decrease of 15 registered lawyers, around 3.2 percent, compared to the 464 registered lawyers in the same period of the previous year”. There are also 142 trainee lawyers.
In his speech, Vong Hin Fai did not fail to highlight that “AAM faces some challenges”, taking into account the “continuous development of our work”, namely the lack of space. “The Association's current space is very limited and insufficient for the installation of arbitration court rooms, mediation rooms, related equipment and facilities, which makes it difficult to fulfill its assigned functions”.
The director also highlighted the existence of 602 more cases pending in relation to the previous Judicial Year (2024/2025), an increase of 4.9 percent, taking into account that last year there were 12,379 cases pending. “This demonstrates that the number of legal cases continues to grow and that the burden on the judicial system continues to increase”, he warned.</description><pubDate>2025-10-22 00:16:20</pubDate></item><item><title>Judicial Year | EC highlights “solid progress in defending material justice”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/22/ano-judiciario-ce-destaca-progressos-solidos-na-defesa-da-justica-material/</link><description>Sam Hou Fai, Chief Executive, spoke yesterday, for the first time, at the opening ceremony of another judicial year as the Macao SAR's highest ruler.
The former president of the Court of Final Instance (TUI) highlighted that, “over the last year, Macau's judicial bodies have made solid progress in defending material justice, increasing judicial efficiency and improving the judicial system”.
Sam Hou Fai also recalled that “in the judicial history of Macau there have never been so many magistrates and bailiffs and so much importance has never been given” to the infrastructure “of judicial bodies by the Government”.
The Chief Executive explained that “the judiciary must accurately understand the essence of the principle of ‘one country, two systems'”, and that, “through judicial practices, it must decisively defend national sovereignty, security and development interests”, as well as “firmly support and cooperate with the Macao SAR Government in governing in accordance with the law”.</description><pubDate>2025-10-22 00:15:15</pubDate></item><item><title>MP | Tong Hio Fong believes in recovering the organization's reputation</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/22/mp-tong-hio-fong-acredita-no-recuperar-da-reputacao-do-organismo/</link><description>Tong Hio Fong, Macao SAR Prosecutor, said yesterday, at the solemn opening session of the judicial year, that he believes that the reputation of this judicial body will be restored. The “revelation and punishment of corruption cases in the past” caused a “very negative impact on the reputation of the Public Prosecutor's Office”, admitted Tong Hio Fong, in a speech at the opening session of the judicial year.
Recognizing the “commitment and dedication of the entire team in the face of the illicit and immoral acts carried out by some in the past”, Tong Hio Fong said he was convinced that, “with persistent and concerted effort” by MP employees, “the public trust placed in the institution will be restored”.
Tong Hio Fong also highlighted in his speech the “increase in the number of investigations into sexual crimes against minors”. In his speech, the Public Prosecutor (MP) stated that 61 investigations of sexual crimes against minors were booked last year, “which represents an increase of 27.08 percent when compared to the previous judicial year”. In general terms, and with regard to crimes against sexual freedom and self-determination, “in the last judicial year, a total of 235 investigations were prosecuted, representing a slight increase of 2.17 percent compared to the 230 investigations prosecuted in the previous judicial year”.
30 investigations relating to the crime of rape were registered, “which represents a decrease of 47.37 percent compared to the previous judicial year”, but Tong Hio Fong also highlighted that, of the 61 investigations assessed in the area of ​​sexual crimes against minors, 26 investigations concern the sexual abuse of children.
The Prosecutor also highlighted the “significant increase in gambling-related crimes”, especially with regard to crimes related to illicit gambling, with 760 investigations filed in the 2024/2025 judicial year, an increase of 435 cases, 133.85 percent more, compared to the previous year. This is due to the entry into force of the Law to combat illegal gambling crimes, he explained.
Tong Hio Fong also spoke of the change from a “continuous downward trend to a gradual increase in drug-related investigations”.</description><pubDate>2025-10-22 00:14:11</pubDate></item><item><title>Global Strategic Triangle (I)</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/22/triangulo-estrategico-global-i/</link><description>“The divergence between American and European strategic analysis is more instrumental than sincere.”
José Milhazes
The war in Ukraine is not just a regional tragedy. It is the reflection of a systemic transition that crosses the world, where the balance between powers, alliances and civilizations is being reconfigured. The conflict, although localized, contains three interconnected dimensions that make it one of the most significant events of the post-Cold War era. The first dimension, visceral and immediate, is the bloodiest. It is a confrontation between what remains of the Russian empire, driven by a drive for historical greatness, and the Ukrainian nation, which seeks to assert itself as a sovereign and independent state, free from Moscow influence. This struggle, which mixes elements of civil war with post-Soviet succession disputes, is marked by imperial memories, historical resentments and national ambitions.
Ukraine, in trying to consolidate its political and cultural identity, directly challenges the Russian narrative of Slavic unity and imperial continuity. The second dimension, more structural and continental in scope, involves the Euro-Atlantic space in a process of transformation. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the expansion of Western influence eastward has been constant. The integration of the former East Germany, the accession of the Baltic countries, Poland, Romania and, more recently, Finland and Sweden to NATO, outline a path towards approaching the Russian border. Moscow's military offensive against Kiev appears as a reaction to this eastern march, trying to prevent Ukraine from becoming an advanced platform for American influence. From this perspective, Ukrainian fighters become pieces on a larger board, where Washington projects power through alliances and indirect support.
The rhetoric of the “collective West”, although used as an instrument of internal mobilization by Russia, proves to be useful in giving the intervention the status of a patriotic war. The third dimension, quieter but decisive, is part of the systemic challenge between global powers. Ukraine has become a testing ground for the resilience of alliances, the effectiveness of containment strategies, and the ability of great powers to adapt. The conflict draws a geometry of pairs with Ukraine and the United States on one side; Russia and its strategic partners on the other. China, although not directly involved, observes with attention and prudence, calibrating its movements on a board where regional stability and strategic autonomy are priorities.
Its stance, marked by moderation and pragmatism, helps to avoid an uncontrolled escalation and preserves channels of dialogue that could be crucial for an eventual resolution. In this scenario, the war in Ukraine contains the ingredients for a global escalation, if one of the vertices of the geopolitical triangle Washington, Moscow or Beijing decides to break the tacit balance. The only sustainable solution seems to lie in an understanding between these three powers, capable of preventing Kiev from becoming the stage for a new global war, similar to those that marked the last century. Europe, for its part, is watching the tragedy unfold with increasing apathy. Its eastern border burns, but the European public, tired and divided, hesitates between involvement and distancing. Ukraine, technically bankrupt and dependent on foreign aid, sees half of its population living in the diaspora.
Those who remain face a war of survival, aware that total victory is unlikely. The tacit aim appears to be to weaken Russia, even if this means eroding European stability. NATO's northeastern front, centered in Poland and extending from the Arctic to the Black Sea, emerges as a possible flashpoint. Germany, with its historical memory and geopolitical responsibility, will be decisive in the reconstruction of post-conflict Ukraine. Its influence, discreet but profound, contrasts with Polish assertiveness, marked by regional rivalries. On the horizon, a Korean-style ceasefire scenario can be seen, with a new steel curtain dividing the country. The reconstruction will be shared among the Western allies, with demarcated fiefdoms and crossed interests.
Russia, in turn, will be able to consolidate a New Russia, extending from Transnistria to the Baltic, paying homage to the tsars who projected the empire towards Europe. The logic of military capabilities, more than declared intentions, fuels the possibility of preventive confrontations.
Tactical nuclear escalation, although unwanted, becomes an almost automatic consequence in an environment of mutual distrust. The cautious United States prefers to shift its focus to the Indo-Pacific, while the Europeans, torn between ambitions and resentment, face the dilemma of rearming without the American nuclear umbrella. The strategic divergence between Americans and Europeans is more functional than ideological. In Washington, the partial withdrawal from Europe is seen as an opportunity to redistribute resources and test the autonomy of allies. In Europe, this withdrawal is interpreted as an opportunity to reconfigure ambitions and settle historical accounts.

Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China in the Macau Special Administrative Region
The Global Leaders' Meeting on Women, with the theme “A Shared Future: New and Accelerated Process for the Integral Development of Women”, took place in Beijing, from 13 to 14 October, in commemoration of the 30th anniversary of the IV World Conference on Women and with a view to discussing the development of the global cause of women.
President Xi Jinping attended the opening ceremony of the Meeting and delivered the keynote speech entitled “Carrying Forward the Spirit of the Beijing World Conference on Women and Promoting the New and Accelerated Process for Women's All-Round Development”, in which he comprehensively and systematically demonstrated the achievements of Chinese modernization and the cause of women in New Era China, presented China's proposals for accelerating the new process of women's all-round development in light of global trends and announced China's solutions to further support the development of women's global cause. With successful practices and fruitful achievements, China has contributed to the whole world yet another vivid example of “Chinese governance”.
In China, the cause of women has always constituted an important part of the Chinese modernization process. Since its founding in 1921, the Communist Party of China has been committed to women's liberation and gender equality. After the establishment of the People's Republic of China, a series of laws and regulations were enacted that protected women's rights and interests, achieving historic improvements in women's status in terms of education, employment, political participation and marital autonomy.
Entering the new era, the CPC Central Committee, with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, has emphasized safeguarding women's legitimate rights and interests, promoting gender equality and women's all-round development as integral components of Chinese modernization. A series of pioneering, general and long-term decisions and plans have been made, and the cause of China's women has made historic achievements and changes. We won the greatest battle against poverty in human history and thus brought moderate prosperity to 690 million women.
We have reduced the maternal mortality rate by nearly 80% since 1995 and have joined leading upper-middle-income countries in key maternal and child health indicators. Currently, women represent more than 40% of China's total workforce and more than half of the country's internet startup entrepreneurs. In the new era, Chinese women, more confident and vibrant, participate in the entire governance process of the country and society. The cause of women in China has enjoyed wider development spaces and more promising prospects than ever before.
After his return to his homeland, Macau experienced a golden age in the development of women's causes. The educational level, labor market participation, industrial coverage, professional level and income of women in Macau have improved significantly. With great courage and enthusiasm, Women have made significant contributions in all spheres of life, supporting half the sky for the development of Macau.
Since 2008, the Macau General Women's Association obtained special consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council, thus being officially qualified by the United Nations to assist in international affairs and, since then, it has participated in the sessions of the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) for 15 consecutive years. Macau has already become an indispensable force in telling the stories of China and Macau's successful practice of “one country, two systems” among the international community.
China has given firm support and active contribution to the development of the global cause of women. As President Xi Jinping has highlighted, women play an important role in the creation, promotion and development of human civilization, and the international community has a shared responsibility to advance the cause of women.
China upholds the vision of building a community with a shared future for humanity and has transformed the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative, the Global Civilization Initiative and the Global Governance Initiative into concrete actions to promote the all-round development of women, so as to actively provide opportunities and support for the global cause of women through their development. China actively participates in global governance in the field of women, supports the United Nations in prioritizing women's work, creates the Prize for the Education of Girls and Women in partnership with UNESCO and has announced three donations of 10 million dollars to UN Women. In the face of global challenges, China has sent more than 1,200 female officers and military personnel to participate in UN peacekeeping operations, providing humanitarian assistance to women and children affected by conflicts and disasters.
China has been deepening global exchanges and cooperation between women, maintaining friendly relations with women's organizations and institutions in more than 140 countries, implementing projects worth more than 40 million dollars in the women's sector in more than 20 countries, cultivating more than 200,000 female talents in more than 180 countries and regions, and providing assistance for women's employment in more than 100 countries. The development of women's cause in China has provided a referenceable Chinese solution to the global women's cause, which is widely recognized and praised by the international community.
Renewing our dedication to the purpose of the Beijing World Conference on Women and joining forces to create a better future for the advancement of the global cause of women. Globally, gender-based violence, digital inequality and the shadow of war and conflict still persist. Looking to the future, we must renew ourselves in favor of the purpose of the Beijing World Conference on Women to build greater consensus, expand the paths forward and take more concrete measures, with the aim of accelerating the new process of women's integral development.
President Xi Jinping, at the height of the progress of human civilization and the peaceful development of the world, with a global vision and sense of responsibility as the leader of a great country, proposed four suggestions for the global cause of women, which are: “jointly promote an environment conducive to the growth and development of women”, “jointly cultivate a vigorous drive for high-quality development of the cause of women”, “jointly build governance structures to protect the rights and interests of women” and “together write a new chapter in promoting global cooperation for women”. A series of new measures taken by China to support the development of the global women's cause were also announced. China is willing to work with all countries in the world to overcome global challenges with action-oriented vision, accelerate the new process of women's comprehensive development with unity, confidence, courage and practice, push forward the construction of a fairer and more reasonable global governance system, and join forces to move towards a community with a shared future for humanity.
With a shared destiny and hand in hand, women will move towards a promising future. As an active and firm supporter of global cooperation in the cause of women, China will continue to work with all countries to take accelerated actions to write a new chapter in the process of women's integral development!</description><pubDate>2025-10-22 23:06:37</pubDate></item><item><title>Musk's billion-dollar plan (1)</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/21/o-plano-bilionario-de-musk-1/</link><description>A director's duty is to work to optimize the performance of his company and maximize its profits. When the company increases earnings, it is natural that the director is financially rewarded. However, the media recently released a report from the most influential consulting firm in the world, Institutional Shareholder Services, which spoke out against the award to Elon Musk, Tesla's Executive Director, of 1 billion dollars as a reward for his performance, as this amount was too high. This recommendation could prevent Musk, “a lover of challenges”, from obtaining compensation for the feat of “landing on Mars”.
The plan to award Musk a billion dollars in compensation emerged last September, when Tesla's Board of Directors asked him to increase the company's productivity over the next ten years. If successful, he would receive that amount in shares. The plan is divided into 12 steps. After completing each of them, you receive 1% of the shares. Once they are all completed, you will receive 12%, an amount estimated to be no less than 1 billion dollars. The main points are:
Sale of 20 million electric vehicles
10 million subscriptions to the autonomous car system
One million autonomous cars registered and in operation.
From September 3, 2025, the delivery of a cumulative total of one million Optimus humanoid robots.
The company's capitalization will increase in 12 phases, from the current approximately 1.1 billion to 8.5 billion, eight times more.
The company's profit, after deducting interest, taxes and depreciation, will reach 400 billion.
The financial compensation plan presented in 2025 is not new. In 2018, Tesla approved a $56 billion plan. It also had a 10-year scope, over which Musk's performance would be evaluated and, if he reached the objectives defined by Tesla, he would receive shares worth 56 billion dollars. In January 2024, the Delaware Court of Chancery rejected the plan due to the lack of independence of the board of directors and the excessive amount of compensation.  Although 90% of shareholders agreed to a second vote, the court again rejected the resolution due to procedural errors. This month, Tesla filed an appeal with the Delaware Supreme Court, requesting approval of the $1 billion compensation plan.
This plan links Tesla's business to Musk's performance, highlighting that Tesla is not just a car manufacturer, but that it aspires to broadly develop the business at the level of artificial intelligence and robotics. Of course, this path involves significant changes.
First, Tesla's sales in markets such as France, Sweden, Denmark and California are currently declining, and profits from its core business are falling. From a more prudent point of view, should Tesla first revitalize its traditional business before moving on to new adventures? If the revitalization of car sales is successful, then the development of other business areas would be cause for celebration. However, if it fails, should Tesla abandon the automotive sector and focus on new businesses? These risks and these bets are issues that Tesla, its board of directors and its shareholders must confront and consider.
Secondly, Tesla plans to make autonomous cars. This will not only increase the value of these vehicles but will also pave the way for autonomous cars to enter the market. If the research is successful, Tesla will transform from a simple car manufacturer to a car manufacturer and autonomous vehicle service provider. Let's imagine that the autonomous vehicle business could be charged monthly, similar to what cell phone operators do, then this company's profits would undoubtedly be much greater than those obtained from simply selling cars. While providing autonomous driving services generates stable, long-lasting profits, the technology that supports them is not yet mature. If an autonomous car is involved in an accident, it will be harmful to the car owner, other drivers and the Government. Furthermore, the implementation of autonomous driving will inevitably require a review of road legislation. It is also unknown whether third-party accident insurance coverage will need to be modified. Changes in the global market will generate significant uncertainty for Tesla's autonomous vehicle business.
Next week, we will continue to discuss the impact of $1 trillion worth of equity compensation on the business world.

In 308, he obtained the “resounding” result of three Municipal Chambers. The polls that we unfortunately still have showed that victory would belong to AD, second place to Chega and third to the Socialist Party. Television commentators were full of praising the polls and pointing out that Chega's result would be normal because the PS had been in absolute decline since the last legislative elections. They were wrong, once again.
Polls and commentators. The Socialist Party rose from the ashes and achieved a very positive result. Overall, they did not lose by much and in terms of results from parties alone, without coalitions, the socialists obtained almost twice as many Municipal Chambers as the PSD. It has been proven that without radical populism, without xenophobia, without racism and without the cries of André Ventura, Chega is a flop at a local level, especially in the interior of the country. Populism has fallen into the well and we will see when the “firefighters” can bring it to the surface. Chega won in Entroncamento without knowing exactly why, it won in a Madeiran town where half a dozen people live and it won in Albufeira because the owners of the bars and hotels managed to convince the entire clientele and neighborhood to vote for the neo-Nazis. The voters of Albufeira will cry drool and snot because Chega recommends in its Algarve program that bars close at two in the morning and the owners of these nightlife establishments demand that they close at four in the morning. Local discontent will prevail and will certainly translate into the next elections. This, in Albufeira, because in the rest of the Algarve Chega thought of winning everything. Not even that kind of tavern keeper who is always shouting in Parliament and wiping sweat from his bald head managed to win in Faro.
The global map is divided between the AD/IL and the pink party. Cavakistan ended after several decades. You saw that there was always that Ruas, who dyes his hair and mustache wanting to look like he was 30 years old, he had a defeat like he never expected. In Lisbon and Porto, the case has already caused a lot of talk. The victories of AD and its Liberal Initiative counterparts in Lisbon, and in Porto with the verbal support of Rui Moreira, the mayor who ended his controversial mandates, were obtained by a minimal margin and until midnight on election Sunday the television stations were only talking about a technical draw. It was sad to see Luís Montenegro, in his capacity as prime minister versus president of the PSD, on election day calling for votes for his fellow candidates, going absolutely against the law. Montenegro claimed victory, but it could have been a little more humble because the municipal victory was tangential and lost many important Chambers such as Braga and Coimbra.
The people, this time, showed great civic sense and abstention was one of the lowest in electoral history. At many polling stations the queues were huge and the wait was very long. It was the translation that abstention would download. Even so, the fraud did not cease to exist. In one region of the country, the old illegality of a party having had voting slips printed similar to those given to voters and then proposing that their appeased parties carry a ballot in their pocket with a cross in the party in question and when they brought the blank ballot that the polling station had delivered, they would receive two thousand euros. Not bad for a few thousand “mercenaries”.
The people are fed up with elections, but nothing about the matter is going to end. The spearheads of the candidates for President of the Republic are already on the road. The variety is huge, but almost all in the same direction. On the center right we have Admiral Gouveia e Melo with Marques Mendes. Even further to the right appears the “bocas” André Ventura and Cotrim Figueiredo, who was leader of the Liberal Initiative. On the moderate left side, António José Seguro appeared and it was only last Saturday that the Socialist Party decided to officially support the candidate António José Seguro. Too late. And even so, the leftmost socialist wing will vote for António Filipe of the PCP, in the good style of Álvaro Cunhal, who suggested that sometimes you have to cover your eyes to vote for someone who doesn't belong to the party.
This time, the polls seem to be getting it right. A polling company, in which we have the greatest confidence, obtained in a national survey carried out last week, that there will be a second round between Gouveia e Melo and António José Seguro. However, when the respondents were faced with the final decision in the second round, victory fell to the admiral.
Because, just as we wrote last Monday, Luís Montenegro, with this municipal victory, will not resign, even if the Public Ministry opens a judicial inquiry against the current prime minister regarding the case of his family company Spinumviva. The man has been in politics for many years and knows everything about how to defend himself against suspicions of alleged scammers. Portugal will continue to be governed by a politician under serious suspicion, but that in no way affects his unhealthy desire to be head of the Executive.</description><pubDate>2025-10-19 23:51:20</pubDate></item><item><title>Picture books | Exhibition opens to the public Friday</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/22/livros-ilustrados-exposicao-abre-ao-publico-sexta-feira/</link><description>The “Exhibition of Illustrated Books in Chinese and Portuguese” opens to the public this Friday, which will be on view at the Carmo Auditorium until the 2nd of November, as part of the seventh edition of the “Encounter in Macau – Festival of Arts and Culture between China and Portuguese-speaking Countries”, which also includes the Lusofonia Festival.

This is the work of Portuguese artist Pedro Pascoinho, included in the “Common Vision” exhibition. There are 20 charcoal drawings made on “artistic fabrianno” paper, which reveal very unique compositions and visions.
It all started in the beauty of the Lou Lim Ieoc garden, an iconic place in Macau that Pedro Pascoinho, a Portuguese artist, visited for the first time in 2019. This was also the first time that the artist set foot in the territory and now he does so again with the exhibition “Common Vision”, organized by D’Entranhas – Associação Cultural and curated by Vera Paz.
“Common Vision” therefore began to be imagined in the Chinese-inspired garden, but it aims to show a certain common vision of how apparently different things can have points in common. "I really like Chinese painting, although Chinese painting is quite vast, but I especially like ancient painting from the 13th and 14th centuries. It was there [during the visit to Lou Lim Ieoc] that I thought about establishing some parallel", he told HM.
And according to a note from As Entranhas, what will be presented from this Saturday, at 6:30 pm, at the Lotus Art Space gallery, are 20 charcoal works on “fabrianno artistic” paper, consisting of “drawings of variable dimensions, in which Pascoinho shows us intimate, sober and refined compositions, which he himself considers universal”.
There is in “Common Vision” an “intentional choice of elements in the narrative construction”, as is the case of “fragments, objects, figures and represented landscapes that evoke enigmatic, almost ghostly spaces that take us back to the passage of time”.
These drawings are designed individually, but “are born from the desire to create a space of common memory”, in an “attempt to find new paths and references, in any time or place”. This is an “essential condition” of the artist’s work: an “inner observation and critical thinking”, mirrored in this exhibition.
In an interview with HM, the artist highlighted that this exhibition “brings a somewhat common vision, in the sense that our Western aesthetic is different from the Eastern one, but there is still a proximity”.
Always the drawing
Pedro Pascoinho's vision always translates into the desire to make drawings, not photographs. "What I do is start from fragments with an almost photographic base, although my intention is not to produce photography, but rather drawings. Basically, it is as if these works had a code, but a code that is quite universal, in which we can understand the image well, in a certain way. Hence this logic of 'common vision', of a common vision about things."
Pedro Pascoinho talks about how “the images and fragments were common, with a somewhat universal approach”, in which “you manage to capture the object, which ends up being figurative”.
"There is not a way of seeing here, but rather of observing. Things are in front of us, but then the observation depends on each one. There are several messages and readings that can be made. It is a figurative work, but it doesn't just go in one direction and I like to have things open like that, because then it depends on each one how to observe things."
Regarding his passion for Chinese painting, Pedro Pascoinho speaks of a “very advanced painting for the time”, being “aesthetically different” from Portuguese painting of those years, and even European painting. “Despite this, you can learn a lot, even through the themes themselves, both in terms of the landscape and the contemplative side of the pieces.”
In 2019, Pedro Pascoinho took “Establishment” to Macau, namely to Casa Garden. Since then, “significant changes” have taken place in his work. That year there were changes in the “very composition” of the works and in the choice of colors, or lack thereof.
"I think about the work before executing it, and for me it is as if it were a painting without colors, a black and white drawing. And in this exhibition “Common Vision” there is only one work with color. There was then this change, since 2020, in which I have only dedicated myself to drawing on a large scale and in which there is an absence of color. I had a debate about white, because it is a color that I don't deal with very well, it isn't even a color at all."
Pedro Pascoinho always approached color and “worked in series”, but at the end of 2019 it was already “difficult to think at the level of color, and then, even due to the way the world changed, from then on it became more difficult to think about colors”. "It's difficult to see things and produce in color, and I started to see the world in black and white. I'm not saying that I don't do things in color, but, for me, the preference and the way I think, the absence of color is part of that. It's difficult to think about color", he stressed.
About Macau, he says he was surprised. “It’s having contact with a completely different culture, it seems that we are always looking for what is Portuguese”, analyzing a kind of relationship with a territory “that is different from China”. “There is always this interesting side, where I was able to see points that, for me, ended up being fascinating, from the markets to the food,” he said.  The exhibition will be on view at the Lotus Art Space gallery until November 19th, from Tuesday to Sunday, from 1pm to 7pm.</description><pubDate>2025-10-22 23:42:48</pubDate></item><item><title>Lusofonia Festival | Calema, from São Tomé, performs this Saturday</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/22/festival-da-lusofonia-calema-de-sao-tome-actuam-este-sabado/</link><description>The Calema concert takes place this weekend in another edition of the Lusofonia Festival. The brother and sister duo will take the stage at Casas Museu da Taipa on Saturday, starting at 9:30 pm. There are, however, sounds from other countries in the Lusophony universe, such as Rui Orlando, from Angola performing on Sunday or Memu Sunhu, Carimbó Paidégua and Negros Unidos, a group from Equatorial Guinea
They are the brothers António and Fradique Mendes Ferreira and together they make up Calema. Originally from São Tomé and Príncipe, and residing in Portugal, the two brothers are traveling to Macau this week to participate in another edition of the popular Lusofonia Festival. The lights and music are felt on the stage at Casas Museu da Taipa, this Saturday, from 9:30 pm, in a show with free entry.
In Portugal, the Calema have been a success story. They started their career around 15 years ago and have performed on impressive stages such as Estádio da Luz and at dozens of music festivals. The first album was released in 2010, entitled “Ni Mondja Anguené”, followed by “Bomu Kêlê”, released in 2014, and “A Nossa Vez”, in 2017. This is followed by “Yellow Voyage”, released in 2020″, and “Voyage – Part II”, released four years later, and “Voyage – Part III”. In 2019, an album arrived that seems to be a kind of consecration, when the duo released “Ao Vivo no Campo Pequeno”, one of the most important concert halls in Lisbon.
The single “Maria Joana”, recorded with singers Nuno Ribeiro and fado singer Mariza, released more recently, won the Play – Portuguese Music Awards in the Song of the Year category.
But Calema have been immersed in solidarity projects, going beyond music. One of the examples is the fact that, in August this year, the duo received the designation of goodwill ambassadors of the Community of Portuguese Speaking Countries (CPLP) in the area of ​​culture and music, having stressed that they want to be an example for young people.
"When we were starting out, we didn't have any example because everything seemed very difficult. (…) I think, in a certain way, you can show them [young people] that it is possible, that there is a process and that if you work, if you believe, your dream can come true, but it depends a lot on you. It's that light that we want", declared Fradique Mendes Ferreira to Lusa, upon receiving this appointment.
António Mendes Ferreira stressed that the appointment of CPLP ambassadors is a source of pride. "We have always made music with the aim of making people happy, communicating with them, connecting with them, and being part of this family that is CPLP is incredible. We have grown within the community and its culture", said António.
Other sounds
The Lusofonia stage will be filled with other sounds in the Portuguese language, as is the case of Rui Orlando, who will perform on Sunday, 26th, from 8:40 pm. Originally from Angola, Rui is a musician, composer and instrumentalist, having won the television competition “Angola Encanta” in 2011.
Rui Orlando has a degree in accounting and management, but his passion for music won. At the age of 20, he took an intensive course in Lisbon and there he began to dedicate himself to his artistic career. Memu Sunhu arrives from Guinea-Bissau, who will perform this Friday from 8:40 pm. This is a very recent group, formed in 2021 by four musicians:
Ninanca Alfredo Carlos Banca, Desejado Carlos Gomes Sadjó, Sadibo Coté and Malam Djudju Mané. The collective is known for mixing different musical genres with the more traditional music of Guinea-Bissau.
From Brazil, Carimbó Paidégua also arrives, who will perform on Sunday from 7:10 pm. This band is a collective researching music and dances linked to the Amazon rainforest and is based in the city of São Paulo. Also noteworthy is the performance of Negros Unidos, coming from Equatorial Guinea, with a performance scheduled for Saturday from 7:55 pm. The Lusofonia festival continues the following weekend with more musical performances, gastronomy and craft spaces.

According to a note from Albergue da Santa Casa da Misericórdia, this year's event has the theme “Ghost Party”, including the “Spider Tunnel” activity and a variety of “ghostly decorations”. Thus, at the beginning of the evening, there will be “free makeup stalls, clown performances and an exciting challenge in the ‘Haunted House of Cockroaches’ in the Albergue SCM square, suitable for participants of all ages”.
In addition, between 3pm and 6pm, the activity “Albergue SCM – Let’s Trick or Treat” will be presented, an “exciting event that invites children aged 5 to 12, accompanied by an adult, to embark on an exciting adventure, in search of hidden treasures in the São Lázaro neighborhood”. Here, participants are equipped with a map and can explore “unique streets and alleys, collecting ‘mysterious patterns’ and being able to win delicious sweets on the return to Albergue SCM”.
11 years of celebration
Another highlight is the holding, between Saturday and Tuesday, of the “Albergue SCM Halloween Costume Competition”, in which, in order to win prizes, participants have to take a photo of their costume inside the Hostel space, sharing and commenting on the image on social media. The comment with the most likes will receive a prize.
For the event organizers, “Halloween is not only a festival that celebrates the autumn harvest, but also a platform for global cultural exchange”. For these activities, prior registration is required through Albergue SCM's official contacts or on social media. It was in 2013 that Albergue SCM, through CAC – Círculo de Amigos da Cultura, began celebrating Halloween, with the support of the Macau Cultural Institute.</description><pubDate>2025-10-22 00:27:45</pubDate></item><item><title>Real Estate | September with more transactions and slight appreciation</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/22/imobiliario-setembro-com-mais-transaccoes-e-ligeira-valorizacao/</link><description>Last month, there were a total of 247 housing transactions, an increase of 28 percent compared to last year.

In Taipa, the increase was from 70,242 patacas to 80,454 patacas, an annual increase of 14.5 percent.
Cheaper
When the comparison is made between August and September, the number of transactions showed an increase of 12 movements, given that in August 235 transactions had been registered, a difference of 5.1 percent.

The information was released yesterday afternoon, through a statement from the organization led by Alvis Lo Iek Long.
In relation to tobacco-related infractions, 3,744 cases of people smoking in prohibited places were detected, 196 cases of transporting electronic cigarettes when crossing borders, and 103 suspected cases of other infractions, which include situations of lack of signs prohibiting smoking or the lack of signs warning of the prohibition of the sale of tobacco products to minors under 18 years of age.
In relation to the main locations of infractions, 842 cases (22.5 percent) occurred in casinos, 552 cases (14.7 percent) in restaurants, and 319 cases (8.5 percent) in parks/gardens and leisure areas.
With regard to the control of alcohol consumption, between January and September 11 suspected cases of violation of the law were registered, with three cases related to the sale of drinks to minors. The remaining eight cases were due to various reasons, such as the lack of labels with warnings about the prohibition of selling or providing alcoholic beverages to minors, the lack of clear signage about the places reserved for the sale of alcoholic beverages or the lack of warnings in Chinese, Portuguese and English. The SS were also concerned about a case of a minor who managed to buy alcohol through an adult.</description><pubDate>2025-10-22 23:35:25</pubDate></item><item><title>DSSCU | Installation of metal cages condemned</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/22/dsscu-condenada-instalacao-de-gaiolas-metalicas/</link><description>In reaction to several online advertisements offering cage installation services, the Soils and Urban Construction Services issued a statement warning that these are illegal works that should be avoided
The Directorate of Land and Urban Construction Services (DSSCU) warns the population not to resort to installing metal cages, as they constitute an illegal practice. The alert was left yesterday, through a statement, following advertisements offering the service.
According to the DSSCU “in recent days, advertisements promoting the provision of metal cage installation services” have been published on various social networks and online audiovisual platforms, considered “manifestly illegal acts”.
For this reason, DSSCU “expresses its high concern and rejection of such practices, reiterating that the Government has been continuously combating illegal works, including metal cages”.
The press release from the organization led by Lai Weng Leong also promises to combat, as a matter of priority, illegal works to install cages, illegal renovations, buildings in a dilapidated state, as well as illegal works in buildings with a use license. “DSSCU appeals to citizens not to commit legal infractions and to refrain from resorting to such metal cage installation services,” it was requested.
At the same time, DSSCU is concerned about the “proliferation, on various audiovisual platforms and online social networks, of advertisements that, through short videos, actively promote the provision of metal cage installation services, with the aim of attracting customers and inducing citizens to carry out illegal works, putting public safety at risk”. The organization therefore asks citizens to actively contribute to the elimination of illegal constructions in order to help guarantee public safety.
Fines of 240 thousand patacas
Regarding the punishment for installing metal cages, DSSCU warns that it can lead to fines of MOP240,000, and that there has been at least one previous case in which a fine of this amount was imposed.
“Among the cases dealt with by DSSCU in recent years, illegal works deserve special attention, namely metal cages commonly known as ‘overhanging balconies’, with fines being imposed reaching the amount of 180,000 patacas in one case and 240,000 patacas in another, relating to the installation of several metal cages in a single unit”, it was reported.
The Government also points out that it will investigate the advertisements and that if the installation of cages in local buildings is confirmed, it will take the legally required measures. “Regarding the illegal works identified in the aforementioned advertisements, the DSSCU will carry out inspection and investigation actions, if the veracity of the facts is confirmed, a process will be opened for immediate monitoring”, it was pointed out.
In yesterday's statement, DSSCU also indicates that the latest changes to the legal regime for urban construction allow for the adoption of additional penalties for offenders, mainly in the case of refusal to demolish illegal works, such as the possibility of suspending the supply of water and electricity.</description><pubDate>2025-10-22 23:34:24</pubDate></item><item><title>UM / Law | Study highlights “success” of bilingual degrees</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/22/um-direito-estudo-destaca-sucesso-da-licenciatura-bilingue/</link><description>A study developed by three professors from the Faculty of Law of the University of Macau speaks of the “success” of bilingual degrees in this area, arguing that it can serve as a “model”. Another conclusion is that almost half of the students on the course achieved a better level of Portuguese with a period of study in Portugal compared to those who stayed in Macau
The degree in Chinese-Portuguese Law from the University of Macau (UM) is seen as a success story and an example to be taken into account in the local academy. This is one of the conclusions of the study “Experiences in Bilingual Legal Education: The Case of Macau SAR’s Chinese–Portuguese Bachelor of Law”, authored by professors Teresa Lancry Robalo, Cheng Hang Leong and João Ilhão Moreira, from the UM Faculty of Law.
The authors speak of the “success” of this degree program, which “combines rigorous legal training with strategic linguistic immersion”, consisting of a “model for bilingual legal education”. It is further argued that this degree constitutes “a model for other jurisdictions seeking to develop bilingual or multilingual legal education, regardless of whether they operate in bilingual systems”.
The study analyzes a decade of data, from 2014 to 2024, and a universe of 333 students. In ten years “the program has graduated 99 bilingual students, with flexibility that allows transfers to a Chinese-only course if linguistic benchmarks are not met.” The fact that 99 students on the course completed the course “demonstrates the program’s ability to train legal professionals in both Chinese and Portuguese”, argue the authors.
Furthermore, there were “67 students considered to have not achieved sufficient bilingual proficiency”, and who went “on to the Bachelor of Laws in Chinese, graduating from that program”, it is said.
In this way, it is considered that, “after a decade of implementation and five groups of graduates entering the job market, the program has proven that it can meet its ambitious objectives and demonstrated that effective bilingual legal education is possible, even in jurisdictions where one of the legal languages ​​is not widely spoken by the population”, it reads.
Question of languages
Another conclusion of the study relates to the greater benefits obtained by students who choose to study Portuguese in Portugal. This is because “48.77 percent of students who studied in Portugal achieved B2 proficiency” in Portuguese, which in the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages ​​means an “independent user”, someone capable of understanding the essential ideas of a more complex text, and having dialogue with some spontaneity with native speakers.
Meanwhile, only 20.83 percent of students who remained in Macau reached this level of proficiency in Portuguese. The study highlights that “the Covid-19 pandemic interrupted international mobility, drastically reducing proficiency gains in affected classes”.
The analysis carried out in the study shows that the highest graduation rate “was recorded in the inaugural year of the program (2014-2015), with 96.43 percent of enrolled students graduating”. For the authors, this is an “exceptional result”, which “can be attributed to the use of a more flexible definition of bilingual proficiency during the initial implementation of the program”.
On the contrary, “the lowest graduation rate occurred in the 2019-2020 academic year, with only 13.64 percent of enrolled students completing the program.” The study describes that “a likely reason for this decline is the restrictions imposed during Covid-19”.
But there is a “challenge” in the midst of success: the fact that “some graduates have varying levels of proficiency in Portuguese, which proves the need for continuous improvement of teaching methods”, and “the incorporation of new technological approaches, which can help to overcome these obstacles”, must be considered.
In the degree in Chinese-Portuguese Law, the first year consists of basic subjects such as Introduction to Law or History of Law, and then students “begin intensive linguistic training, with a curriculum aimed at developing oral and written proficiency”, with a focus on oral and written comprehension. In the second year, there is a focus on learning the language, whether in Macau or Portugal, and in the following three years “students continue their studies with a combination of Law subjects taught in both languages”, with students on the bilingual course “not attending separate classes, but rather classes from the Bachelor of Laws programs in Chinese and Bachelor of Laws in Portuguese”.
The study authors make several suggestions, such as the idea that “institutions could introduce an additional bilingual program with minimal incremental costs, improving their academic offering and attracting a wider group of potential students”.</description><pubDate>2025-10-22 00:25:40</pubDate></item><item><title>C-PLPEX with a record number of Portuguese-speaking exhibitors and Pelé’s “iconic shirt”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/22/c-plpex-com-recorde-de-expositores-lusofonos-e-iconica-camisola-de-pele/</link><description>The China-Portuguese-Speaking Countries Economic and Commercial Exhibition (C-PLPEX) kicks off today in Macau, with 320 Portuguese-speaking exhibitors and, in a “sporting touch”, the exhibition of the iconic shirt worn by Pelé in the 1962 World Cup.
In the second edition of C-PLPEX, Deep Robotics, a Chinese innovation company founded in 2017, will present two robot dogs. These are “very mature products”, which can, for example, be sent to assess the situation in a fire scenario, a representative of the BPS Global Group, Deep Robotics agent in Australia, Hong Kong and Macau, explained to journalists.
With its participation in C-PLPEX, highlighted Wong, the company has “Macau as a priority”, but doors can open to other latitudes.
“We need to know if Portuguese-speaking countries are interested and if the parent company has any plans to expand and to which Portuguese-speaking countries”, added the person in charge, during a visit by journalists to the fair site, which runs until Saturday.
Deep Robotics will occupy one of the almost 500 exhibitors from China and Portuguese-speaking countries present this year at C-PLPEX. There were 320 exhibitors in the Portuguese-speaking world alone, which represents “an increase of 23 percent compared to the first edition”, announced, at a press conference, the president of the Macau Trade and Investment Promotion Institute (IPIM). “A third are from Brazil, a third from Portugal and the rest are from [other] Portuguese-speaking countries”, added Che Weng Keong.
Years of debuts
In parallel, this year, for the first time, the China-Portuguese Speaking Countries International Agricultural Expo will take place. Brazil, considered the person responsible for IPIM, weighed in on the decision to launch this new exhibition.
"Brazil is a very large country, linked to food production, agricultural production and, taking this into consideration, we decided to hold this exhibition. In the interior of China, this [agricultural] area is very advanced and can have a good relationship with Portuguese-speaking countries", explained the president of IPIM.
Alan Ho, coordinator of C-PLPEX, also noted that bringing “many people” from the Portuguese-speaking world and the interior of China to Macau is “crucial to promoting the Macau platform”.

The game's gross revenues saw a “surprising recovery” after Golden Week, with the first 19 days of October generating 14.85 billion patacas. The scenario was outlined by the investment bank JP Morgan, in a report cited by the GGR Asia portal.
According to the financial services institution, the most recent week saw a “surprising recovery” in revenue, to an average daily level of 781 million patacas. This amount means an increase of 25 percent compared to the second week of this month, when average revenue per day did not exceed 593 million patacas.
Analysts DS Kim, Selina Li and Lindsey Qian also downplayed the fact that revenues during Golden Week were lower than expected, considering that it was a sporadic event rather than an industry trend: “We continue to believe that the weak performance in Golden Week [in October] was an isolated episode and not a trend, probably due to the typhoon [Matmo], the festival calendar of the moon cake, and the F1 race in Singapore. Events that all occurred during the Golden Week holidays,” said JP Morgan analysts.
Could be better
At the same time, JP Morgan admits that the latest revision of growth forecasts for October may be below the actual value, due to the latest figures, which show a better trend than expected. "We adjusted our forecast for gross gaming revenue for October to a growth of between three and six percent compared to the same period last year, following Golden Week. However, this adjustment now presents risks, given the strong and surprising recovery last week", he was justified.
The investment bank also forecasts revenue growth during the period between October and December of 10 percent, compared to the same period last year.
In relation to the beginning of 2026, forecasts point to an expansion of the sector “a little” above the 10 percent value, which should be around 13 percent in terms of pre-tax revenue.</description><pubDate>2025-10-22 00:21:18</pubDate></item><item><title>Taipa | Request for intervention on trees in abandoned houses</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/22/taipa-pedida-intervencao-sobre-arvores-em-casas-abandonadas/</link><description>There are two trees growing between the roof and walls of two abandoned houses in the Taipa Velha area, namely on Rua dos Bem Casados, which could pose a risk to public safety.
According to the Ou Mun newspaper, the Taipa Community Development Promotion Association hopes that there will be a public interdepartmental working group to analyze the risks of the growth of these trees in order to contact the house owners to find a solution. The association also wishes that the intervention can take place even if it is not possible to contact the owners.
Lam Ka Chun, vice-president of the association, referred to residents' complaints about the large branches of these trees, which reach the chimneys of the buildings opposite, and which in summer attract flying white ants. During the rainy season, trees can grow even larger, causing cracks in walls, collapsing structures, infiltration and harming residents and passersby.
The person responsible recalled that the common practice, in similar cases, is for the owners themselves to clean the place, taking into account that the trees grow in spaces that are private property. However, there are properties that have been abandoned for many years, making it difficult to find or contact the owners, recalled Lam Ka Chun.</description><pubDate>2025-10-22 00:19:55</pubDate></item><item><title>ZELENSKY VS ZELENSKY</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/31/zelensky-vs-zelensky/</link><description>10/27/22
A Ukrainian pensioner, with the same name as the president, blames Zelensky for the prolongation of the conflict that destroyed his village. Zelensky, the villager, who never left his land, is now mortified because his favorite gravedigger died in the bomber.
This Zelensky, a villager, represents half the world that recriminates the other Zelensky, the villain, for not wanting to negotiate with Putin.
Negotiate what? The invader enters our house, covers his wife and daughter (cf. recent UN report on the rapes in Ukraine, in this “special operation”), an act that forced us to watch, and then we say to him: hi there, we are for peace, but we have to negotiate: you still haven't said what name you want to give the children!
A peace that is not dignified is nothing more than a cessation of rights. As serious as the Russophobia that Putin inflicts on his people.

At a lunch with several guests, I heard a friend, who declared herself a spiritualist, explaining the particularities of her belief, in a calm and balanced way, I would even say, without a hint of “irrationalism”. He spoke long and serenely, devoid of any fanatical proselytism. “Here is someone whose belief has brought thoughtfulness!” I thought, a rare alliance.
However, at a certain moment a sentence comes out that horrifies me. It says, “there is no chance, nothing happens by chance!”, and I glimpse the voracious maws of holism. Because holism has a pathological aspect, like all good things, a shadow side.
Two examples: in Hinduism there is less sensitivity to existential dramas, if that child suffers in this life this is just an expression of rigorous karmic symmetry, an effect of the acts he committed in his previous life. In Africa, it is not accepted that death could have been accidental, and many women are accused by the family of the deceased of having caused the death of their husband, in an act of manifest dementia, and, in the blatant majority of cases, a huge injustice for the wife — madness that spreads and infiltrates the social fabric.
Buddhism introduced Compassion and Christianity introduced Caritas, trying to break with this logic, but in many other beliefs and religions the cage of causalities prevails over sensitivity to experience, the need to respond to the now.
It is a tremendous logic that transforms the world into a Platonic stage, where we are nothing more than the shadows of something — an inextricable law -, in a determinism that calcifies all singularities, but that strangely fascinates many.
The conquest of modernity was anchored in the conquest of chance and randomness, removing the incidences of a life from this fierce determinism that enclosed the world in a web. When the Renaissance freed the body from the influence of the stars, at that moment sexuality was relieved of guilt and individualism and its volition were able to emerge.
There is an unequivocal moral implication in the phrase “there is no such thing as chance, nothing happens by chance!”, which should function as a key to self-knowledge and self-judgment, however, this phrase is usually used to seek a reason for things outside of us, in others. It's an alibi.
Today there is a holistic temptation in the world, just as there was a satanic temptation in the Middle Ages, without much reflection on its consequences. Because it's not enough to want to connect everything in a resonant chain of affection. Even for the most unexpected: affection itself can kill.
I realize, thanks to that cultured, balanced, intelligent woman, that “the fight” took place at the beginning of this century. One of the great mistakes of the 20th century was the false dichotomy between “rationalism and irrationalism”, a debate that extended to all fields, including art. First, rationality (the positive side of reason) was confused with rationalism (the pathological aspect of reason), and articulated in this lack of discernment, irrationalism was confused with freedom. Almost all 20th century art, with Surrealism at its head, made this mistake. The fallacy still exists despite the emergence of “irrationalism” and the consequent relativist currents that followed it having been consolidated everywhere. Essentially, much of what happened in the 20th century revolved around this clash between two paradigms: Rationalism versus Irationalism.
Now, I see, we must save indeterminacy, chance, randomness from the terrible temptation of the cage of causalities. Holism, in its pathological form, may be reductionism that sets itself up as a new “eschatological narrative”.
Is it “by chance” that holism emerges at a time when neo-liberalism and its cynical contempt for the human person is besieging everything, all freedoms, all acquired rights?
Holistic awareness has brought a positive impact to greater ecological awareness, but followed with scholastic rigor, it stifles reality under the blanket of a determinism that is much more than uncomfortable: all great authoritarian ideologies are holistic.
My friend will know how to combine her holistic and transpersonal belief with the freedom and responsibility that each moment asks of us — but how many will make the distinction, under a Law that explains and encompasses everything?
How many will abandon themselves to what is?
The awareness of the indeterminate brings tragic awareness, as the Greeks knew, but it also brings agency and the courage of decision. And we cannot give up on this.
Furthermore, as Drummond shows in the poem “Quadrilha”, by Carlos Drummond de Andrade:
«João loved Teresa who loved Raimundo/ who loved Maria who loved Joaquim who loved Lili/ who didn't love anyone./ João went to the United States, Teresa to the convent,/ Raimundo died of a disaster, Maria stayed with her aunt,/ Joaquim committed suicide and Lili married J. Pinto Fernandes/ who had not entered the story.»
Real always runs outside the track, completely external to our concepts. That's what matters to us — a J. Pinto Fernandes emerges at the exact moment we thought we had everything under control.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>From Nobel and others</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/17/do-nobel-e-outros/</link><description>9/10/22
When reading many people's reactions when this year's Nobel Prize for Literature was announced, I couldn't help but remember this comment from Jean-Pierre Siméon, in relation to another Nobel Prize: «An editor of a large national daily newspaper wrote five lines of indignation at the fact that the Nobel Prize for Literature had been awarded to Thomas Traströmer, a complete stranger. But unknown to whom? How did it not occur to this literary columnist, patented and paid to do his job, that his apparent ignorance was a matter of professional misconduct? Tranströmer had been translated into many languages, it was available in French.»
There is always the chorus of those who wait for the Prize to be announced to complain about not having been invited to be on the jury, there is a subgroup of angry people who profess “I have never read it and I won’t even bother to read it”; It is a less than humble fauna, the one that inhabits social networks.
I don't always know all the winners – I didn't know about the existence of Louise Glück, who I think is a great poet, or Olga Tokarczuk, for example – but this only brings me the comfort of knowing that the world is not a soap opera where everyone knows everyone else and the joy of recognizing that the yardstick of the world is not measured with my short measure and that, on the contrary, it gives me a new opportunity to face the unknown and learn from it.
And perhaps the most stupid reaction was that of the intelligent man who wrote, But are there still people who read French?; simply confirming that today there is a new type of ignorance that is being raised with abandon: that of those who only read English.
I would also prefer that, in French, Pascal Quignard, Linda Lê or even Sollers were awarded, or, among the new ones, Mathias Énard, but that does not detract from the dignity of Annie Ernaux's work (and it would have been enough to have written “Les Années”). There are books of hers that I like less, like the vulgar “Uma Paixão Simples”, but that happens with almost all authors, they have pivotal books and others that are like breaks in their itinerary. I recommend reading a beautiful book of interviews with her, “L’écriture comme un couteau”.

Yesterday an article appeared in the morning newspaper “Notícias”, in Maputo, reporting that the Pen Club Narrative Prize had been awarded to my wife, Teresa Noronha, for her soap opera “Tornado”, which had already won the Maria Velho da Costa Prize.
The summary they made of the book does not even deserve comments, as it is pathetic, but what is important to highlight is the note of disqualification regarding its “Mozambicanness” when they call it Luso-Mozambican. It's not that it's inaccurate, but, for those who know the context, it's a touch naughty.
Because finally, following the same logic, Adelino Timóteo should be called Tsonga-Mozambican, Álvaro Taruma Ronga-Mozambican, and Macua-Mozambican for writers from the north, etc., etc. Which doesn't appear to happen.
At one point, in the novel, she writes:
«Our color was never the dominant one. In colonial times we were not white, we were dressed in monhés, mugs of washed asses, the pejorative term to speak of a son of Goan and Portuguese. In the post-colonial period, I was not black and if, in Lisbon, they took me for Brazilian or Cape Verdean, in France they were lost in thought about where I was from and were surprised when they discovered that I was African. There I had to explain the wanderings of my DNA before settling in Mozambique. It took me a long time to accept that it was like that because yes, and that it was no curse that that was the case; on the contrary, I could even discover intense patterns of fantasy and freedom in this harlequin cloak that is our genealogy…”
In modern-day Mozambique, it means being white… and that immediately takes precedence over what you do or what you are.
It's sad, but as Naipaul warned, in these parts race is everything and people live as deeply immersed in it as, in other places, in religion.

Bruno Latour, an anthropologist who studied the sciences and their procedures and legitimations, law, technique and religions and who entertained himself by turning his back on the dogmas of the “moderns”, has died. For him, the place, the role of the specialist, was defined more by the perplexity he embodied than by the supposed truth that would sustain him.
He proposed, as an alternative to the goodness of multiculturalism and its equivocal cliché “all different, all equal”, a return to “diplomacy”, given that this, precisely, does not start from the assumption that “we are unified because we share the same nature” but simply highlights that we “still do not share a common world”; It is necessary that we deal head-on with the “abyss of disagreement” that separates us, instead of trying to deceive it.
And about politics he said, boldly:
«If transparency is demanded from politicians, we kill them; if anyone demands fidelity to what the other was or what he says, kill him; If a mimetic relationship is required between what the crowd wants and what its representative says, representation is killed. These must therefore, by definition, betray, deceive, modify, distort the word. Without this ability to bend the word and betray, political language would not exist. I put forward the perfectly plausible hypothesis that political vocabulary will become as inaccessible as the religious language of the last twenty, three or fifty years.» (in “Un Monde Pluriel mais Commun”). I believe we will be needed to decipher this frantically complex world that has fallen to us.</description><pubDate>2022-10-17 02:18:03</pubDate></item><item><title>Fuxi</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/30/o-fuxi/</link><description>O my friends, companions of these disastrous journeys through countries as old as the stars and the Moon, and as strange as the deepest interior of our wretched souls, what surprises still await us, what secret magics will we still have to overcome, what horrors will arise before our pupils dilated with astonishment and terror?
Increasingly closer to our precarious existences, howls the monster of war, which threatens to merge humanity once and for all with the earth, incessantly traversed by the squalid specter of hunger and the invisible evil of ten thousand pestilences.
Oh damned human, who believes you are superior to Nature itself, but then you reveal yourself, time and time again, incapable of simply ordering your existence and do not understand that you are possessed by fickle anger and are a slave to your own ambition! You are not satisfied with white jade or resplendent gold, there is no treasure that quenches your inextinguishable thirst for command over other men, animals and things; for eternal anguish dwells in you; in you the expelled serpents crawl; for you grows, powerful and impressive, the most fertile ivy of Evil!
This is perhaps why on the Mount they call the White Deer, where one of the eight immortals on a sacred mount soared through the heavens towards Penglai, lives the fuxi, a bird whose shape resembles that of a rooster, although topped by a human head. What strange copulations, what monstrous embraces, what terrible procedures must have occurred to make the existence of this sinister animal possible? We don't know, but all it takes is for our exhausted mind to dare to come up with an answer, and then we feel our skin covered in horrendous goosebumps and our heart races in parade, like a wild horse whipped by the night whip of fear, unresponsive to reins and containment.
Men should refrain from visiting Monte do Veado, because although there are riches capable of calming the wildest ambitions, if they have the unfortunate luck of catching a glimpse of a fuxi, it is certain that a war will soon break out and the cultivated fields will perish because of it, tame animals will be beheaded, because of it the best young men of two generations will be sacrificed and the land will be destroyed. pride of countries.
The fuxi makes a sound reminiscent of its name. If you hear it, dark night or clear day, be on your way, because the path you are on is the surest path to misfortune!</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Procrastinators Club</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/29/clube-dos-procrastinadores/</link><description>While rereading Easter, because of an article I'm preparing, I come across this excerpt, taken from “The Universal Man”:
«Each man, morally, is one and absolute; but he has to live with attenuating his personality. (…) Coexistence is only possible between people reduced to a negative or hollow presence, which constantly gives way. Hence, the emptiness of society, an immense ghost made up of countless dead people. A superior man is antisocial or criminal. His destiny is prison and the desert”.
I hesitate to think whether Pascoaes reflects here on the political-social conditions that muzzle, and, worse, in a sad country like Portugal in the middle of the Estado Novo (and the book is from 1931) where any possibilities of spontaneity and frankness in human relationships were limited, or if it simply lends to the behavior of (oppressed) men a metaphysical framework, an “essence”, declared in the presumption of each one. to be, in isolation, “one and absolute”. Sometimes, in addition to an excess of Spirituality (or Saudade), Pascoaes lacks the world. He is a great poet, but he is a poet who takes Ampoules-of-Great-Ideas and who therefore writes often trapped by a programmatic furor, ceasing to have pores; It is not uncommon for a glass to be erected between him and reality, the same glass that made him write in O Bailado, from 1921: «Everything is a ghost. There are only clouds, clouds of voices, clouds of souls, of afflictions and tragedies! Clouds and more clouds, appearances and more appearances! And a divine lightning that pierces them, the instantaneous Apparition that appears and throws us to the ground, dazzled!»
Sometimes I felt like reminding him, as António Sérgio did, in the article “Regeneration and Tradition, Moral and Economy”, which he dedicated to Pascoaes: «Pascoais, Pascoais my dear friend: you are a pure, excellent and noble poet, but also a victim of this social environment, like us all: of this horrible isolation that you praise and I curse».
«As a child, he stole two blackbirds», says Jacinto do Prado Coelho, he stole them from a nest, and he felt remorse for that all his life. The Person, few more mischiefs are known to him. Only in Álvaro de Campos does a hint of wickedness and obscenity emerge: «Ah, and the ordinary and dirty people, who always look the same,/ Who use swear words as usual words,/ Whose sons steal from grocery store doors/ And whose daughters at the age of eight – and I think this is beautiful and I love it! –/ Decent-looking men masturbate in stairwells.” (Triumphal ode).
Both poets, driven by a certain idea of ​​sanctity, had the same inability to break the siege of their skin with the overflow of someone else's dam, the same curse of sublimating the concrete ferocity of eros with the gentleness of the verses.
Obviously, they are both “bigger than life”, but sometimes it makes me unnerved to watch, from my position as a hatter at the Procrastinators Club, the tantrums between them, just to see who occupies, in the internal organization, the place of President and Treasurer.
Although Pessoa guessed more things, for example, what he wrote in the lesser-known Ode Martial and which is reflected in the situation we live in today, in a different way, with his heart in his hands:
«MARTIAL ODE

Helahoho! helahoho!

According to the spokeswoman for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, Zhu Fenglian, the event aims to “remember the history of the war of resistance against Japan, pay tribute to the martyrs and preserve the results” of this transfer. The ceremony will be attended by representatives from various sectors, including guests from Taiwan, and will be accompanied by exchange activities before and after the event, Zhu said.
The spokeswoman stated that the return of Taiwan to China was “a victory achieved with the sacrifice of all Chinese, including Taiwanese compatriots”, adding that the objective of the event is “to reinforce the feeling of a common nation and the objective of ‘reunification’ under Beijing’s leadership”.
On October 25, 1945, after the surrender of Japan – which had colonized Taiwan since 1895 – the Republic of China took over the administration of the island under Japanese terms of capitulation.
At the same press conference, Zhu stated that Beijing will continue to promote contacts with all political parties on the island, including the opposition party Kuomintang (KMT), based on the so-called “1992 Consensus”, according to which both parties recognize the existence of “one China”.
Zhu also recalled that Chinese President Xi Jinping sent a message of congratulations to Cheng Li-wun on October 19, on her election as the new leader of the KMT, a gesture that, according to Beijing, “plots the way forward” in relations between the two parties.</description><pubDate>2025-10-22 23:14:17</pubDate></item><item><title>Aviation | China accuses Australia of provocation and denies dangerous maneuvers</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/22/aviacao-china-acusa-a-australia-de-provocacao-e-nega-manobras-perigosas/</link><description>Beijing yesterday accused Australia of “illegal intrusion” into its airspace over the Paracel Islands and of “distorting the facts”, after Canberra reported “unsafe” maneuvers by Chinese fighters against an Australian military plane.
“Australia’s allegations confuse right with wrong and seek to cover up a serious violation of Chinese sovereignty,” Defense Ministry spokesman Jiang Bin said in a statement. Jiang indicated that the People's Liberation Army's Southern Theater Command "organized forces to legitimately, legally, professionally and restrainedly intercept and expel" the Australian aircraft.
The Ministry also called on Australia to “immediately cease all provocations and sensationalism”, “restrict air and naval operations” and “avoid damage to bilateral relations and ties between the Armed Forces of both countries”.
On Monday, Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles revealed that an Australian Air Force P-8 maritime patrol plane was intercepted on Sunday by two Chinese Su-35 fighter jets, which dropped flares “very close” to the aircraft, describing the incident as “unsafe and unprofessional”. According to Marles, the plane was carrying out a routine surveillance mission over the South China Sea when it was intercepted.
Beijing maintains that the Australian aircraft entered the airspace of the Xisha – Chinese name for the Paracel Islands – without authorization, an archipelago whose sovereignty China claims almost in its entirety and where it maintains military installations.

The MSF, which suspended its activities in the city of Gaza on September 24, due to constant bombing and the advance of Israeli tanks, before the signing of the truce, stated yesterday that the priority is to serve the hundreds of people who returned to the north of the Palestinian enclave.
The non-governmental organization (NGO) teams have treated more than 500 patients, most of whom suffered trauma, since reopening their clinic in the capital of the Gaza Strip on October 15th.
Likewise, they resumed transporting water in tanker trucks and managed to supply between 90 and 120 cubic meters of water per day to up to 14 distribution points. The NGO, which continues to provide remote support to the Al-Helu maternity hospital and the Al-Shifa hospital, also reported that it is evaluating “the possible increase in the activities of its teams depending on the security situation” in Gaza city.
MSF yesterday estimated that 15,600 patients were waiting in the Gaza Strip to be transported abroad as soon as possible to receive medical treatment, and warned that the ceasefire “does not put an end to the extreme suffering of Palestinians” in the enclave.
Horror numbers
Israel and Hamas announced on the night of October 8 a ceasefire agreement in the Gaza Strip, the first phase of a peace plan proposed by US President Donald Trump, after indirect negotiations mediated by Egypt, Qatar, the United States and Turkey.
This phase of the truce involved the partial withdrawal of the Israeli Army to the so-called “yellow line” demarcated by the United States, the dividing line between Israel and the Gaza Strip, the release of 20 live hostages held by Hamas and 1,968 Palestinian prisoners.
The ceasefire aims to end two years of war in Gaza, triggered by Hamas' October 7, 2023 attack on Israel, in which around 1,200 people were killed and 251 kidnapped.
Israel's retaliation resulted in at least 68,229 deaths – including more than 20,000 children – and 170,369 injuries, most of them civilians – not only victims of Israeli fire, but also of hunger -, according to numbers updated yesterday (with victims already recorded after the ceasefire came into force) by local authorities, which the UN considers reliable.</description><pubDate>2025-10-22 23:09:06</pubDate></item><item><title>Thailand | Former PM resigns from leadership of the party founded by his father</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/22/tailandia-ex-pm-demite-se-de-lideranca-do-partido-fundado-pelo-pai/</link><description>Former Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra, dismissed in August by the Constitutional Court, resigned yesterday as president of Pheu Thai, a party founded by her father, Thaksin Shinawatra, also a former head of government. “My resignation will allow the party to modernize so that we can finally win the elections,” Paetongtarn said in a statement carried by Pheu Thai.
The 39-year-old politician added that she will, however, remain a member of the party and “continue to work hard” for Thailand. Daughter of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, Paetongtarn was suspended from office in July after being accused of failing to defend Thailand during a June telephone contact with former powerful Cambodian leader Hun Sen, which was published online.
In a verdict handed down at the end of August, nine judges from the country's Constitutional Court considered that the former prime minister did not respect the ethical standards required of a head of government during that call. Paetongtarn Shinawatra thus became the third member of the family to abandon the leadership of the government, after his father and aunt Yingluck, both overthrown by military coups.
“No matter who presides over Pheu Thai, it will always be run by the family behind the scenes,” Yuttaporn Issarachai, a political scientist at Sukhothai Thammathirat Open University, told AFP.
According to the analyst, this dismissal mainly aims to protect the party against legal proceedings. For decades, the Shinawatra dynasty shared power with Thailand's conservative elite, but recent legal setbacks have seen its influence wane.</description><pubDate>2025-10-22 23:02:41</pubDate></item><item><title>Rates | Seoul sends negotiators to Washington again</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/22/tarifas-seul-volta-a-enviar-negociadores-a-washington/</link><description>Two senior South Korean officials traveled to Washington yesterday, just days after returning from the United States with signs of important progress in negotiations leading to an agreement that reduces US tariffs on South Korea.

The “consecration” of this day “reflects the recognition of the importance of the sea for environmental balance, the livelihood of communities and the sustainable development of the country, as well as the Government's commitment to the conservation of marine resources and the implementation of the Policy and Action Plan for the Promotion of a Resilient and Sustainable Sea Economy 2025-2035”, highlights the statement.
The Timorese Prime Minister began on Tuesday, in Dili, the presentation of the “Policy and Action Plan for the Promotion of a Resilient and Sustainable Maritime Economy of Timor-Leste” to municipal authorities, community leaders and other strategic partners. Xanana Gusmão plans to travel around the country next year to carry out similar awareness-raising actions.
Protect the future
The protection of the oceans and marine biodiversity is one of the Government's main priorities. The Blue Economy policy reflects, according to the Government, a modern, environmentally responsible and people-centered approach, with a view to the sustainable development of the country.
In Timor-Leste, the Blue Economy is defined as a set of integrated policies and actions that promote economic and social development through the sustainable use of marine and coastal resources, based on solid environmental practices.
The Government's resolution also establishes that the National Sea Day celebrations be held annually, alternately, “in each municipality and region of the country” to reinforce the “cultural and spiritual value of the sea for the Timorese people and the national commitment to the preservation of the oceans”, adds the statement.</description><pubDate>2025-10-22 22:56:53</pubDate></item><item><title>Aviation | Beijing reaffirms cooperation with Airbus</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/22/aviacao-pequim-reafirma-cooperacao-com-airbus/</link><description>Chinese Commerce Minister Wang Wentao met in Beijing with the executive president of Airbus, Guillaume Faury, to strengthen cooperation with the company and ensure the stability of industrial chains, his ministry said yesterday.
During the meeting, held on Tuesday, Wang called on Airbus to take advantage of the entry into operation of the second assembly line for the A320 model in Tianjin, in northern China, in order to deepen cooperation with the Asian country and expand the offer of products and services in the country.
The government official assured that the ministry “will continue to promote the resolution of problems and concerns” that the company may face in local operations, and will work to “maintain the stability of global industrial and supply chains”.
Faury expressed “complete confidence” in the Chinese economy and the development of civil aviation in the country, stressing that the new unit in Tianjin “provides favorable conditions for deepening industrial collaboration”. The meeting takes place in a context of rapprochement between Beijing and the main European economies, after several years of trade tensions.
Airbus has maintained a consolidated presence in China since 2008, when it opened the first single-aisle aircraft assembly line in Tianjin. After addressing operational and investment issues, Wang framed the meeting within China's economic opening strategy, stressing that the Chinese market “maintains constant expansion” and is currently the second largest in the world in terms of consumption and imports.
He added that the country will continue to promote a favorable environment for foreign companies and defend the stability of global supply chains in the face of increasing protectionism. Airbus is currently the main supplier of aircraft to China, which, in parallel, seeks to reduce its external dependence with the development of the C919 commercial aircraft, produced by the state-owned COMAC.</description><pubDate>2025-10-22 22:51:06</pubDate></item><item><title>Swine fever | Taiwan suspends pork exports</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/22/peste-suina-taiwan-suspende-exportacoes-de-carne-de-porco/</link><description>The Government of Taiwan temporarily suspended pork exports yesterday, after the detection of a possible outbreak of African swine fever in the center of the island, reported the CNA news agency.
At a press conference, the Vice Minister of Agriculture, Tu Wen-jane, stated that, in compliance with its “responsibility as an exporting country”, Taiwan will only resume pork exports “when the epidemiological situation is clarified”. The director of the Livestock Department, Lee Yi-chien, indicated that current pork inventories correspond to about one month of consumption, which “should be enough to satisfy demand in the short term”.
The measures were announced after the detection of a possible outbreak of African swine fever in the city of Taichung, specifically in the coastal district of Wuqi, where 117 infected pigs died between October 10 and 20, according to the Ministry of Agriculture. As part of the prevention measures, the ministry announced the ban, since yesterday, on the transport and slaughter of pigs throughout the territory for five days, in addition to the ban on the use of food waste to feed the animals.
African swine fever does not affect humans, but it is highly lethal to pigs, with mortality rates that can reach 100 percent in the most acute forms.</description><pubDate>2025-10-22 22:48:13</pubDate></item><item><title>MNE | China expects EU to “support free trade” and “oppose protectionism”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/22/mne-china-espera-que-ue-apoie-o-livre-comercio-e-se-oponha-ao-proteccionismo/</link><description>Chinese and European Trade representatives held a telephone conversation with a view to finding points of balance in the relationship between the two blocs
China yesterday said it expected the European Union to “support free trade” and “oppose protectionism”, after Chinese Commerce Minister Wang Wentao and European Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic spoke by telephone. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun declared, at a press conference, that “the essence of economic and trade relations between China and the EU lies in complementarity and mutual benefit”.
Guo conveyed his wish that “the EU will fulfill its commitment to support free trade and oppose trade protectionism, and provide a fair, transparent and non-discriminatory business environment for companies in all countries”.
According to the spokesperson, China expects the 27 “to adopt concrete measures to defend the market economy and the standards of the World Trade Organization [WTO]” and “persist in the adequate resolution of trade differences through dialogue”.
During the call, Sefcovic invited Chinese authorities to visit Brussels to seek “urgent solutions” to the export controls on rare earths imposed by Beijing, measures that the EU considers “unfair”.
The European Trade Commissioner explained that the Chinese minister accepted the invitation from the community executive to address the issue in the “next few days” in the Belgian capital, a visit that has not yet been confirmed by the Chinese authorities. “After this morning’s conversation, we have no interest in escalation, but the situation casts a shadow on our relationship, so a quick resolution is essential,” said the European Commissioner.
Sefcovic, who classified the discussion as “constructive”, recalled that Brussels considers that the increase in Chinese controls on exports since April is “unjustified and harmful” and damages the bilateral relationship between both parties, while at the same time going against attempts to achieve more stable and reliable trade.
The European Commissioner discussed with Wang the ban on the company Nexperia from exporting semiconductors produced in its factory in China, following the decision by the Netherlands to intervene in the company to prevent the transfer of knowledge to China by the company, which was founded in the Netherlands, but in 2019 was acquired by a Chinese group.
In this sense, he said that both parties have communicated to him their intention to “resolve the situation and work towards a practical agreement that restores supply chains, provides much-needed certainty and avoids global production stoppages”.
In recent months, Brussels has expressed concern about restrictions on access to the Chinese market and the use of rare earths as an instrument of pressure. Furthermore, friction persists between Beijing and the 27 over European tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles and Chinese investigations into European brandy, pork and dairy products.</description><pubDate>2025-10-22 22:46:46</pubDate></item><item><title>Cuca Roseta, fado singer: “Fado is samba-poetry sung from the heart”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/06/cuca-roseta-fadista-o-fado-e-um-samba-poesia-cantado-vindo-do-coracao/</link><description>During the pandemic, she sang for the Macau public through a video concert, but now, the fado singer gives her heart and soul to a concert with the Macau Chinese Orchestra, part of the lineup for the Macau International Music Festival, next Saturday, 11th. In an interview with HM, Cuca Roseta talks about the show's lineup, her 15-year career and the truth found in her compositions.
Performs in Macau on October 11th with the Macau Chinese Orchestra (OCM). Tell me a little about what we can expect from this show.
Yes, we are finally going to Macau. It will be the first time because we previously did a video concert for Macau during the pandemic, and we were unable to be there physically. We now work with OCM, which is very good, and I am happy with this partnership, for being able to unite, in some way, two cultures. We are a little anxious about that fact.
The concert will have songs such as “Meu”, “Preto e Branco”, “Canção do Mar”, “Não Sei de Onde” and “Finalmente”. What does this alignment bring us?
We already had arrangements made for orchestra by Marinho de Freitas, which are extraordinary arrangements, and which will be adapted to the traditional OCM instruments. These songs are practically all written by me, lyrics and music, and tell different stories, some that I have lived myself or stories that, in some way, I have experienced someone living very closely. They are original fados. “Canção do Mar” is very old and became known in the voices of Dulce Pontes and Amália Rodrigues, and has a new arrangement. We thought it would look beautiful with OCM. Of course, there are songs that we always sing and that never leave the repertoire, linked to traditional phases of my career. There are some songs that people like and request, but we bring a completely different repertoire to what we presented at the time [in Macau, with the video concert], which was very well received. It was a concert that went very well, even though it was via video, and we received wonderful messages.
This year he released the album “Até a Fé Se Esqueceu”, which has an exclusively Brazilian repertoire, with several names in Brazilian music, such as Seu Jorge or Zeca Pagodinho. Why explore this universe, mixing it with the language of Fado?
Yes, but this year I will also release a French album with Amália Rodrigues' agent, who invited me. But “Até a Fé Se Esqueceu” came from an invitation from a great Brazilian producer to record old sambas, which have a lot to do with Fado. Even though it's a Brazilian album, all sambas, it's my saddest album of all, the most melancholic. That's why we went looking for this root of samba to find great poets and great composers that Brazil has, and who have this weight that Fado also has.
As?
Fado has a lot to do with words and composition, in fact, Fado is samba-poetry sung from the heart, because there has to be this truth in the interpretation, the idea of ​​truth coming from life's experiences, in transforming the story it tells. This melancholy is in the veins of Portuguese blood and is mixed with art and music. This invitation wanted to put a fado singer to sing seriously and with the weight that Fado brings, and be able to interpret the great poets and sambas. The album [Até a Fé Se Esqueceu] has very old sambas, one of them from 1937. It is, therefore, a very strong and even very beautiful album, with great poems and composers, such as Tom Jobim, Vinicius de Morais, and wonderful partnerships with Seu Jorge and Zeca Pagodinho, who came to Fado. It's an album that made me really proud.

Therefore, it is possible to marry Fado with the joy of samba, which also has a melancholic side, right? Like the melancholy of our Fado.
In fact, when we hear the word samba we think of joy, but in fact the basis of samba is not joy. There is that phrase by Vinicius de Morais, “To make a samba beautifully you need a bit of sadness, otherwise you won’t make a samba”. So that's where the beauty of this work lies, which goes to the roots of samba and shows that there aren't that many differences between the melancholy at the root of samba and the melancholy of Fado. It's a nostalgic and melancholic album, it doesn't bring that joy. It can bring hope, and we can say that some themes bring with them this hope, which we find in Brazilian culture and drums. Because they literally put their sadness on the skirt wheel and on the drums, right? They transform sadness into dance and music, but in this work we don't see that type of samba.
Cuca also has a previous album, “Cabo Verde Nha Cretcheu”, so it can be said that she has explored, in her career, the different Portuguese-speaking sounds, going beyond Fado, mixing sounds?
This album didn't come from my will, and I think [it's a sign] that life takes me, deep down. This album was born from a tour I took across the nine islands of Cape Verde with a live recording of the mornas I sang on each island, as I sang the traditional mornas of each island. Between one island and another there are very different moraines. What I did was, after my Fado concerts, I sang two mornas and then we compiled all the songs in Creole in celebration of the fact that I was the first international artist to do the nine islands in a row. But I was also in Goa and did my concert in Concanim. I find it easy and enjoy learning the traditional songs of the countries where I am going to sing. I already sang in Moscow and learned a Russian song; I learned the songs of Goa, and in Georgia, in Tblisi, I also learned a song. It's a treat I make when I travel around the world taking Fado. But morna is wonderful and there really are similarities between this musical genre, and I wanted to bring this encounter between Fado and morna to Cape Verdeans, and this album came about, which is beautiful.
Once it goes to Macau, can we expect a song in Cantonese, or Mandarin?
Yes. By chance, I had already spoken to my manager to contact someone in this regard, so that we could discover a traditional song that I could learn.
Last year, he celebrated 15 years of career. How do you review your career, which began with the albums “Cuca Roseta” and “Raiz”?
In fact, it was great to celebrate 15 years at MEO Arena [the concert hall in Lisbon], and be able to revisit all the albums since the first. “Raiz” opened up something that is rarer, which is the fado singer composing and writing her lyrics. This was a record that went wonderfully well and, from then on, it was good, because in this search for the truth that Fado has, being able to compose and write your own lyrics always means giving a little more of yourself. Each person composes and writes in their own way, and when they can do it, it is always a bit like the lines on the palm of their hand, that is, it is something unique. In this search that people make to follow standards to achieve success, I believe that success exists when we are not afraid to follow our voice and our instinct, what comes from our heart, tell our stories and sing our melodies without fear. In this way we end up becoming unique. Although it is not usual in Fado for a fado singer to compose and write, it was nice to see that my songs became important to many fans. Sometimes I have great composers and poets [to collaborate with me], but I think [writing and composing] brings out this side of the person being more truthful. My poems can never be compared to those of the great poets I have sung, but I think people feel that I am more in my own skin. In a way, this touches and moves them. Celebrating 15 years of career was the closing of a cycle and the beginning of another, and it was great to return to the “roots”, and realize that that was where the “gunpowder” lay, in the sense of not being afraid of ourselves.</description><pubDate>2025-10-06 05:24:32</pubDate></item><item><title>Hui So-ying, protagonist of the film “Ah Ying”: “Representing is being human”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/30/hui-so-ying-protagonista-do-filme-ah-ying-representar-e-ser-se-humano/</link><description>In 1983, Hong Kong cinema, through the lens of Allen Fong, revealed “Ah Ying”, a film that portrays the hard life of a girl who sells fish in the market and dreams of becoming an actress. That girl was Hui So-ying and “Ah Ying” was inspired by her life. HM spoke to the actress on the sidelines of “Making Waves – 2nd Hong Kong Cinema Exhibition”, which took place this weekend in Lisbon
 
How did you get involved in this film project?
The main reason I got involved in this film was because my theater teacher passed away. So I felt like I needed to do something to honor him, because he was the one who taught me how to act. So I tried to be an actress. Later, when [director] Allen Fong met me, he found my life story interesting, and he also ended up meeting some of my family members. Then he asked if they were also interested in participating in the film, which led to many of them also ending up joining the project. The film also shows the environment in which my teacher lived, it is a portrait of experiences and stories lived by me and my teacher.
The film portrays life in Hong Kong in those times. How did you prepare for the character?
The beauty of this film is closely related to the collaborations that were made, particularly in photography and costumes. It took many collaborations to create the beauty that exists in the film. It was hard work taking on the character [of Ah Ying], because the story was designed to describe some of my past experiences, and that's what the director wanted to do. But that was difficult for me, because there were some things I didn't want to face, but I had to. Of course, I later realized that, deep down, it was nothing, and I even felt relieved after finishing filming. Thinking about whether the story was a form of art or reality, when I was performing, I had to enter the situation of the moment because, in fact, the [real] episode had already passed, but I had to have certain feelings again during the performance. As an actress, it was a big test.
“Ah Ying” is considered one of the great films of the so-called “New Wave” of Hong Kong cinema. During the screening, did you expect the film to be successful?
I didn't think about it, but throughout the project I thought that Allen Fong was a very daring director, because a film of this kind had never been made in the entire history of Hong Kong cinema. It's a kind of “docudrama”, and he had the strength and courage to innovate the way he filmed it, which, at the time, was unprecedented.
What was the biggest challenge you faced in this film?
It was having to return to my old self. There were things I didn't want to face and I had to face them again, with the same feeling I had at that time.
Many years have passed between 1983 and the present. Looking back, what meaning did this film have for you, as a person and actress?
In fact, after seeing the film, I saw it as just a story. For me, acting is being human, every day is a performance.
The film portrays life in Hong Kong in the 1980s and has received a restored version. What do you think this project can bring to a younger audience watching the film today?
This year the film was shown several times, and I always ask the same question, whether people don't understand the film or whether they think it can't be immersive enough. In fact, given my experience, most younger viewers responded that this is not the case, that the film is quite real. I don't think this film is outdated or out of fashion just because times have progressed or society has changed. I don't think so.
“Ah Ying” closed, in Lisbon, the second edition of “Making Waves – Hong Kong Film Festival”. How do you feel about seeing this film shown in Portugal?
I found it interesting. I never thought that the film could be shown at this exhibition, I don't know if it was because there was a restored copy. Before this new version it was more difficult to display it. The public can see a film that shows family relationships experienced in the 80s, and I think that the film can be immersive [in the theme], when it addresses family conflicts, because everyone has a family. Watching the film, you may wonder what your relationship with your family is like. Of course, I also hope you learned more about Hong Kong. But, despite this film taking place in the 80s, it focuses a lot on family and interpersonal relationships.
Is there an episode from filming that left an impression on you?
There were several moments throughout the film, but the one that left the biggest impression on me was the last scene, in the interview, in which I was talking to a chair, but it was as if I were talking to my teacher. When I see this scene again I am always moved, because my teacher has already passed away, but all of this still makes a huge impression on me.</description><pubDate>2025-09-30 00:42:01</pubDate></item><item><title>Jorge Figueira, architect and academic at the University of Coimbra: “The heroic relationships” of Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/03/jorge-figueira-arquitecto-e-academico-da-universidade-de-coimbra-as-relacoes-heroicas-de-macau/</link><description>He has been writing and thinking about architecture for a long time, and Jorge Figueira, architect and academic at the University of Coimbra, has been doing so in Macau since then. After a session this week in which he highlighted the former Fai Chi Kei public housing complex, by Manuel Vicente, Jorge Figueira addresses the legacy of Nuno Portas today at the Rui Cunha Foundation
 
Participate today in the conference “Nuno Portas: from Architecture to Urbanism, from Man to City”. What legacy did this Portuguese architect leave?
Nuno Portas is someone who, at the end of the 50s, had a critical activity that was completely innovative and pioneering in the Portuguese context. Then, in the 60s, he had a more international activity, having been the first to publicize the work of Siza Vieira. It was there that he had his first contacts with Spanish and Italian architects, mainly. During those years he also wrote two books that were also unusual, such as “Architecture for Today”, in 1964, and “City as Architecture”, in 1969. They were also an extraordinary way of trying to understand what was happening in terms of international currents in architecture. But later he also had an [important] activity as an architect alongside Nuno Teotónio Pereira, namely in the work on the Church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, in Lisbon, and in a house in Vila Viçosa. Then, on April 25, 1974, he was appointed Secretary of State for Housing and Urbanism and launched SAAL – Outpatient Services for Local Support, a completely revolutionary social housing program, in keeping with the spirit of the time. Afterwards, Nuno Portas dedicated himself more to urban planning issues and not so much to architecture. He was linked to the beginning of Expo 98. He ended up being someone who, in the last 20 years of his work, began to have more scientific and sociological concerns, and less artistic ones. It's something he had from the beginning, but later it became the center of his activity.
Did Nuno Portas have any relationship with Macau?
I think that the relationships would not be as intense compared to other architects and contexts, but we know that Nuno Portas was in Macau at the invitation of the Government for a conference, between 2001 and 2002. It is interesting because from this passage we have echoes of what happened, such as his surprise when discovering Manuel Vicente's Ellen Liang orphanage, which he did not know about. It was Manuel Vicente's first work in Macau, in the 60s, and we know that Nuno Portas was moved when visiting this work, especially the small chapel that exists in the orphanage. It's interesting because there was no direct relationship between Manuel Vicente and Nuno Portas, they are figures at very different poles, and even opposites. There is also an interesting and positive reference to the Siza plan [Vieira, Plano de Expansão da Cidade de Macau (Areia Preta e Porto Exterior, 1982), which is being built when Nuno Portas visits Macau. It is interesting that he commented on this plan because in the 60s and 70s the relationship between Nuno Portas and Siza Vieira was no longer the same, and the fact that he made complimentary references to Siza is very interesting.
He was a student of Nuno Portas. What other aspects of your career or personality can you highlight?
I also worked with him. He was a cultured man, very intelligent and with an overwhelming memory. He was someone who liked to provoke, but in a good way, to argue, to contradict. I was lucky enough to maintain a decades-long dialogue with him, and it is this personal knowledge that I will pass on. I also notice that he was a man very close to the power in Lisbon, to the parties, but always very independent. He was a personal friend of Jorge Sampaio, he was Secretary of State, but he never had a major political role. On the one hand, this is due to his independence, but on the other he was such a controversial and intelligently restless figure, that I think power was also scared of him.
This week he also spoke at the conference “Lisbon, Porto, Macau, Maputo: Heroic Collective Housing from the 60s &amp; 70s”. How do you describe Macau’s public housing projects in those years?
There are many architects I could talk about, but I focused on the work of Manuel Vicente in Macau, namely the public housing complex in Fai Chi Kei, which was demolished and later gave rise to the project by Rui Leão and Carlota Bruni. I didn't specifically talk about Portuguese or Macanese architects, we also have names like, for example, José Maneiras. Especially because Portuguese architects have always been few in Portugal, and from the 1950s there were around 150, later increasing greatly in number. But I paid [at the conference] a tribute to the Portuguese architects who built during that period, because in a complex territory and with its vicissitudes, different from those that existed in Portugal, they knew how to carry out extraordinary architectural experiments in the field of public housing. I tried to demonstrate what was happening in Lisbon, Porto, Macau and Lourenço Marques, now Maputo, in different ways. In Macau, relationships were established, which I call heroic, in the sense that they were relationships of experimental architecture, in which people had to adapt, have their own spirit. These are architectures that already have a bit of history, as 50 or 60 years have passed, but the examples we find in these cities continue to be remarkable.
What projects do you highlight from these years?
I spoke about the “Pantera Cor-de-Rosa” housing development, by Gonçalo Byrne, in Chelas, Lisbon. I showed “Cinco Fingers”, by Vítor Figueiredo, also from Lisbon, and “Bairro da Bouça”, by Siza Vieira, in Porto. I showed the Fai Chi Kei complex, by Manuel Vicente, and a project by Pancho Guedes in Mozambique. Despite being distant in time, these are architectures that remain fundamental references from a cultural and architectural point of view. There is a kind of narrative luck in being able to talk about such different places, and with such different architects, and show how they had this heroic, experimental, moving, even radical side that the architecture of that period in particular had.
Has Macau had a positive evolution with regard to the supply of public housing?
I arrived in August and have been visiting the territory in recent years, so I have been following this process a little. Macau is, obviously, an extraordinary territory and due to the coexistence of very different cultures when it comes to housing, which here has a scale and expression completely different from that of Portugal. In Portugal there is an aversion to public housing towers, it has always been something unusual and the results that are known have not been successful for various reasons. But in Macau this is exactly what we see, public housing in towers and with a very strong expression. This has to do with the characteristics of the territory and also with a certain culture in China and Hong Kong. This does not mean that everything being built in Macau is good, there are towers and buildings with less interesting solutions or that result from a certain repetition. But there is no city that only has good architecture or good public housing. The challenge is to solve the housing problem on a large scale, something that must be studied and thought about. It is beautiful and overwhelming to see that Macau is a territory that grows day after day and it is exciting to observe this from an architectural point of view as well. That's what I'm doing, working on future projects.
Analysis projects, or academic ones?
Yes, I'm a professor and researcher at the University of Coimbra and a columnist for the Público newspaper, so my job is to analyze and investigate. I've already published a lot about Macau and I want to go back to some points that I left unresolved, so to speak. I am very encouraged by everything I have seen and the people I have spoken to, and perhaps I will increase my work on the territory from an academic and research point of view.
At a time when Portugal has a chronic housing problem, with a lack of public housing, could Macau be an example?
Not directly, because of the typological issue of the housing tower. It might not be a welcome model in the Portuguese context. But without a doubt, Portugal needs to learn from other experiences and other territories and needs to find solutions. Certainly, what is happening in Hong Kong and Macau are experiences that are very interesting to know, not to replicate, but to understand that this is a global problem [the lack of housing].
Remember Nuno Portas
The Rui Cunha Foundation (FRC) will host today, starting at 6:30 pm, the conference “Nuno Portas: from architecture to urbanism, from man to city”, with Jorge Figueira. It will be time to talk about a journey that the recently deceased architect began in 1959, with a text about the new generation of the Modern Movement in Portugal. Texts followed in the 60s and 70s with “scientific approaches”, with Nuno Portas wandering between architecture and urbanism, always in a reflective way. Nuno Portas was a “multifaceted figure, best known for launching the SAAL social housing program, which is still the subject of research and an example today”, describes Jorge Figueira in a note. The speaker is linked to the Center for Social Studies and the Department of Architecture of the University of Coimbra.</description><pubDate>2025-09-03 23:33:07</pubDate></item><item><title>Anabela Santiago, academic: “China is reformist and moderate”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/30/anabela-santiago-academica-a-china-e-reformista-e-moderada/</link><description>Anabela Santiago has just defended her doctoral thesis at the University of Aveiro that analyzes how China has positioned itself, in recent decades, as an important actor in “Global Health Governance”. Today, Beijing is looking for “alternative mechanisms” of cooperation in the “Global South” and is trying to build an alternative model to the World Health Organization
 
 
Let’s start with the concept of global health governance (GGS). Is it a more contemporary concept or one related to the post-World War II period and the founding of the World Health Organization (WHO)? Who have been the main actors in this governance until China's growth?
GGS is a concept whose prominence and relevance has grown significantly in the 21st century, largely driven by economic globalization and global interconnection. Although global health has always transcended national borders, requiring multidisciplinary approaches and international cooperation, it has only been since the 1990s that greater awareness has been made of it. Historically, GGS has been predominantly influenced by Western powers and neoliberal values. The main actors in this governance, until the rise of China, were historically marked by interventions from entities such as the WHO and non-governmental organizations, predominantly North American and European.
One of the conclusions of his doctoral thesis is that China has gradually positioned itself in this leadership. When and why did this positioning begin?
Yes, China has progressively positioned itself as a key player in the evolution of the GGS system. Although it is not possible to pinpoint an exact start date, China has evolved from a relatively isolated country to a major player in the global political, economic and technological arenas. Its growing economic and political influence also represents a change in the historical dynamics of the GGS, as in the 1960s China tried to play a role in humanitarian health assistance in neighboring countries and in Africa. The thesis highlights that China's experience can be seen as an example of what is achievable when a State chooses its own path instead of a pre-established model, aligning with the prediction of the 21st century as the “Asian Century”.
Did the years of the pandemic influence this position? In what way?
The Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for global health cooperation, as well as the potential consequences of failing to prioritize global health. The thesis explores the evolution of the Health Silk Road before and after the pandemic, indicating that the years of the pandemic allowed for greater awareness of the need for instruments such as the Health Silk Road as platforms for more effective cooperation between Nations. Although not detailed in this specific section, it is implicit that the pandemic has intensified China's role in health diplomacy and health development assistance.
Looking at the internal reforms that China has carried out in the health sector, which ones do you highlight as the most important?
In the thesis, I address the reforms of China's healthcare system and highlight that the Chinese governance model is a unique combination of market-oriented economic reforms and state-led development, incorporating elements of neoliberalism and authoritarianism in political issues in general, with the healthcare sector being no different from the rest. One of China's contributions mentioned, recognized by the WHO, is its primary health care model based on the recognized good practice of “barefoot doctors”. Furthermore, the thesis analyzes the main reform policies and their progress and challenges in the period 2009-2018, which include primary healthcare reforms, hospital and pharmaceutical reform. The “Healthy China 2030” program is also an important and ambitious benchmark for China's domestic health reforms, also covering social determinants.
Is Beijing's intention to create an alternative entity to the WHO, or simply to create an alternative movement that can coexist with the WHO, in the context of its relationship with the Global South? How could this work?
The thesis suggests that China adopts a “dual approach”: while integrating into existing global structures, it simultaneously forges alternative paths, particularly through regional alliances such as the BRICS and partnerships with the Global South. This indicates an intention to create an alternative movement that can coexist with and complement the role of the WHO, rather than a direct alternative entity. China demonstrates a clear commitment to aligning the objectives of the “Belt and Road” initiative with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, showing its willingness to present these initiatives as complements to the cooperation mechanisms already existing in the international liberal order. President Xi Jinping's vision of a “Community of Shared Future for Humanity”, which includes the notion of “Global Health Community for All”, also points to a new perspective in the scope of international cooperation.
Masks, vaccines and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM): what products or instruments are used by China to position itself as an increasingly global actor in GGS?
The thesis highlights that China is an indispensable provider of global public health goods, essential for the supply chain of products, such as masks and vaccines. TCM is also mentioned as one of China's great contributions to global health governance, with its treatments derived from Chinese herbs, some of which were already recognized by the WHO in 2017. Furthermore, Chinese medical assistance and medical teams sent to other regions of the globe are important instruments of Chinese health diplomacy.
In creating an alternative movement or reality to the WHO, could China be taking advantage of the lack of full representation in that same WHO, or gaps in its functioning?
The thesis does not directly address whether China is taking advantage of a lack of full representation in the WHO or gaps in its functioning. However, she emphasizes that the work aims to fill a gap in scientific knowledge regarding the health governance paradigm from a non-Western and liberal perspective, emphasizing China as an actor in the Global South. This suggests that China seeks to strengthen alternative models that can offer more personalized solutions to health challenges, different from those advocated by Western countries, positioning itself as a moderate reformist actor.
How has the European Union's (EU) foreign policy towards China affected or influenced the country's position in global health governance?
In the thesis, the fourth publication, entitled “Challenges on the European Union-China cooperation in higher education from ‘people-to-people dialogue’ perspective: The case of health-related joint projects”, explores cooperation in higher education, in particular that which includes projects related to health. It appears, therefore, that, despite strategic and economic dialogue, the deterioration of EU-China bilateral relations has intensified, with the Commission assuming a decline in enthusiasm due to “China's countermeasures to EU sanctions on human rights, economic coercion and trade measures against the single market, and China's position in the war in Ukraine”. Although challenges and tensions are recognized, cooperation in higher education, including health projects, is seen as part of a broader framework of building a strategic partnership between the EU and China. However, it is clear that there is no long tradition of health cooperation between the EU and China in higher education, and that there are few joint projects compared to the general picture. It is suggested that both the EU and China should make more efforts to align medical study curricula and promote more joint research in areas related to health, infectious diseases, among others.
In the Trump 2.0 era, and without a pandemic, what could China's role be in global health governance?
Although the thesis will be published this year, it focuses on the period leading up to and including the pandemic, where I do not directly speculate on a future scenario of “Trump 2.0” without a pandemic. However, the thesis argues that China is not just a participant but a moderate reformist force in shaping global health norms. Regardless of future political scenarios, its growing economic and political influence, strategic health diplomacy, domestic reforms and initiatives such as the Health Silk Road will continue to shape its role in global health governance. The vision of a “Global Health Community for All” also remains a guiding principle for China's efforts.
Does this power of China in the GGS occur more with bilateral or multilateral agreements?
The thesis suggests that China's power in global health governance is manifested through both bilateral and multilateral agreements, but with an increasing emphasis on certain forms of cooperation that strengthen its role in the Global South and through alternative mechanisms. Although the thesis does not explicitly quantify the predominance between bilateral and multilateral, the focus on regional alliances (BRICS) and partnerships with the Global South (which often involve bilateral agreements and group cooperation initiatives) and the Health Silk Road indicate a hybrid approach.</description><pubDate>2025-06-30 23:46:26</pubDate></item><item><title>Piménio Ferreira: “Anti-gypsy rhetoric has always worked in Portugal”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2021/04/26/pimenio-ferreira-a-retorica-anti-cigana-sempre-funcionou-em-portugal/</link><description>Piménio Ferreira, better known as Gitelles Ferreira, anti-racist activist, 34 years old, physical engineer, Romani national. He is a man with a provocative speech, a corrosive, gentle humor and a smile that leaves no one indifferent.
Gitelles, we live in an intercultural land and gypsies – in particular – have lived in Portugal for around five centuries. What happens so that gypsy communities continue to be “on the margins” of so-called society? 
We need to change the model of society. This is extremely stratified, placing people in subordinate positions to privilege a violent minority. The white social structure is patriarchal and racist. What is called the ‘margin’ of society is in fact an intrinsic place within it, which belongs to it. In other words, gypsy people have been included in this model of society since they discovered Europe and its kingdoms. The problem is the model of society that is maintained and the place to which they were relegated and how they were relegated: with violence, in a status of inferiority compared to white people, without the right to human dignity, to found a family, to choose their own language and religion, expropriated of any and all cultural and material rights. A place built and maintained to this day by genocidal and ethnocidal violence and persecution. In 1463, Vasco Gitano was granted an estate. In 1521, the gitanos, or gypsies, were already used as a reference for everything that is considered bad in the model of society. The “counter-example” compared to white that would stand out in a positive way. The ‘angel’ and the ‘demon’; the ‘other’, the enemy; the one against whom any attack and persecution is legitimate. Including the prohibition of defending oneself, having weapons, any type of property, and the right to stay.
And is it because they are denied the right to stay that we still have nomadic gypsy communities within the country today?
Yes, without a doubt. There are many ways to force nomadism: directly, by prohibiting permanence and expelling with police or military force; indirectly, refusing public or private housing to Roma people, because they are Roma; and also through the gentrification process.
I read the results of a survey by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, where it is said that approximately 80% of Roma respondents live below the risk of poverty threshold in their country; one in three gypsies lives in a house without running water; one in three Roma belongs to a family in which someone went to bed hungry at least once in the previous month; and 50% of Roma aged between 6 and 24 do not attend school. Why does this happen like this? 
It is the historic persecution that continues. There is no impoverishment that does not have an external cause. In this case, a political system of total expropriation is imposed on the basis of violence. As early as 1648, D João IV, the Restorer, prohibited ‘giving or renting houses to gypsies’. The same D João IV who achieved the kingdom of Portugal thanks to D. Jerónimo da Costa and his 250 Knights. The same D. Jerónimo da Costa who died defending Portugal's independence from Castile. Gypsy, like his wife and children. Among prohibitions on staying, “that gypsies do not enter the kingdom and those who are in it leave” (D João III, 1526), ​​with expulsions, banishment to the galleys, expropriation of goods and properties, imposed with penalties of flogging, mutilation and death, systematically carried out to this day (even in 2011 the Faro City Council wanted to ban gypsies in the municipality).
The prohibition of working for others (no one employs gypsy workers, and those who do do so in complete precariousness, for poorly paid positions and without rights and dignified conditions). They are unable to remain dependent on self-employment, they are unable to invest, due to extreme expropriation. They become dependent on precariousness. If you want to know what it's like to live in pure neoliberalism, get to know the lives of gypsies. The reality of these is paradigmatic of the aggression and lack of protection that the “lords” are willing to go to, for their own benefit.
The gentlemen we are talking about, is it economic and political power?
The group of political, social, cultural and economic power. The owner, the colonizer. This group has been in power since it instituted the current system of domination. And that only makes sense within the hierarchically stratified sociopolitical model in which we live. Hence the need to put an end to ‘lords’ and establish a new model of society, healthy, free, without hierarchies or strata, whether of race, class or gender.
The model in which we live leads the gypsy community (and beyond) to economic exclusion, removing them from access to the consumption of products or excluding them from their production process; political exclusion associated with lack of access to information; to education and consequently the social exclusion seen in the inequality of access to quality community areas such as restaurants, libraries, theater, cinema, concerts, healthcare, etc. How does a gypsy child feel when they realize they are not part of the whole? Children who never see themselves represented, not in films, not in books, not in cartoons, not even in an advertisement eating cereal, for example? Is this a disaster for self-esteem, is it a priori condemnation?
That's really the question. Gypsy people are not “excluded from society”, on the contrary, they are included in it. The problem is the existence of what is cynically called 'social exclusion', an Orwellian term, and people are under duress. Which concentration and extermination camp. In fact, the Nazi concentration camps are a more visual embodiment of what is called 'social exclusion' and, as here, they were not an 'excluded' part of Nazi society, but rather its fundamental and characterizing structure. It is a place of violence, where people are kept by violence, dedicated to their extermination, and designed so that few people can leave. And yet they resist. Just like in the Nazi concentration camps.
And what you listed as an example of the ‘consequence’ of this ‘exclusion’, is in fact the means by which this exclusion also happens and is maintained. Gypsy people are outside the cinemas, either as consumers or producers (but they go to the cinema). They are outside of school, education and the Academy. Either as ‘users’ or as producers (but they go to school and are at the basis of the construction of knowledge and academic and scientific debates).
Even in the attack on the gypsy child's self-confidence, we speak of a mechanism for maintaining this situation. But gypsy people respond very well: with gypsy pride. Another resistance, another aggression. Gypsy people are thus included in society. In a place that belongs to this modern model of society. And they resist and counter the power of domination and insist on being in the city, in the cinema, in the theater, in the Academy, in all spaces. With a lot of struggle and always resisting, but they are there. Social exclusion, more than a “place outside of society”, is part of its social structure.
Do you mean to say there is collective resistance?
At work, already in a context of absolute precariousness, during the pandemic, gypsy people rolled up their sleeves and once again showed proactivity and creativity in adversity. They learned by watching and doing. And here, it is again women who jump to the front line, show their face, learn to use digital tools with their daughters or sons, and launch themselves into the network. And so they explore online sales as well as app-based work (transport or couriers). In housing, in a pandemic context in which evictions were not stopped – as the law itself should and dictates – residents did not stop organizing and fighting against unfair evictions and demanding dignity in housing; residents associations allied in their action with other housing and anti-racist organizations.
It is also worth noting how they reinvented themselves and intensified to collect and distribute food items and mask/alcohol gel kits to the most expropriated people. Gypsies and non-gypsies. In the anti-racist fight, new movements emerged and their actions intensified through social media. People who had never organized or become active before began their first steps in activism, joining this path of gypsy and anti-racist organization and popular action. People forget, or don't want to appreciate, but gypsy action has helped to determine results in the political dispute. Gypsy citizens mobilized in large numbers and determined electoral results in the 2017 local councils, both in Alentejo and in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area, even causing electoral earthquakes.
And even in the Presidential elections, second place was decided by an amount equivalent to the estimated number of gypsy voters. Apart from the non-gypsy votes that were mobilized by the action of gypsy voters. Gypsy people are even co-building power in opinion spaces, in local media, on social networks and in party and institutional political disputes. And most importantly, in popular action and in alliances with other social movements. We never stopped fighting by all means and we continued to resist.
On the other hand, there is more and more hate speech, from the far right in particular. What do you have to say about that?
To begin with, these speeches are historical and European. They are neither current nor “extreme right-wing”. These speeches have been adopted and delivered for a long time, even in 'democracy and freedom', by various representatives of the center-right, conservatives, center-left, liberals, liberal left, even representatives of the PCP. Anti-gypsy rhetoric has always worked in Portugal, as it is the most white-natured rhetoric. That is, it allows the creation and recognition of “white” as the superior of all. And thus please the white electorate who, when they feel good, compensate with their vote. Even if the policies implemented by your elected officials harm you even more.
Finally, I would like you to talk a little about your personal experience and how you became an activist?
I studied, fought for my studies, made alliances, graduated, and entered the “formal precarious” job market. I started my militant action and here I am today. We can transform this society into a better one. This certainty, combined with the fact that the current one has so much suffering, makes anyone want to have a transformative attitude. I wanted to be an ‘inventor’ (physical engineer) and an anti-racist activist. And through study (not necessarily schooling) and organization with other people, in turn, with other studies, training and visions, I learned how the world works and how it can be changed. But before transforming, we need to survive.
This gives rise to two types of actions: transformative and survival. The fight against hate speech appears as survival, but its defeat will be a transformative victory. There is a lot that – as people who want a better world – we have to do, namely work to criminalize hate speech; condemn and ban organizations with racist speeches and practices; denounce the racist institutional structure and logic that organizes Power and manages community resources. And in this sense, there have been various types of actions, from petitions to demonstrations. And we need more.
In addition to being a member of the SOS RACISMO movement, I participate in the Podcast “Viemos Para Ficar”, with Mamadou Ba and Joseph da Silva. And if everything goes well, we will soon start a new project. With friendly people, we also have the “Cigana Initiative” project, dedicated to reflecting and promoting transformative movements. Essentially focused on educating against anti-gypsyism, denouncing historical and ongoing genocide and working towards a new societal project. Also with new projects in the pipeline. And finally, there are always voluntary actions, without an organization, where I try to share what I discovered about Anti-Gypsyism and Romani history in schools and with interested people. In addition, there is still the struggle for housing, because evictions did not stop during the pandemic. Due to housing and employment precariousness, racialized individuals, especially Roma nationals, are the most vulnerable to Covid-19. It is essential to have actions in this area; Of all the struggles, this is the most structural, as it goes against one of the main enemies of a healthy society: the real estate speculation of this capitalist system, which puts profit and goods above people and their humanization.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Motorsport | MSAR comics with special debut in Japan</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/26/automobilismo-banda-desenhada-da-raem-com-estreia-especial-no-japao/</link><description>The Macau comic strip, “Heróis do Circuito” (街道), had its first international appearance in a very special way two weeks ago, at the 1000 km of Suzuka, in Japan
The classic endurance race had not been contested since 2019, and, to mark the return of this iconic race in the Land of the Rising Sun, Porsche Motorsport Asia Pacific decided to decorate the three cars it supported with the Stuttgart brand's historic colors. Among them, one of Absolute Racing's Porsche 911 GT3 R was painted yellow and black, in honor of Joest Racing's victory in the 1985 24 Hours of Le Mans, when Portuguese Domingos Piedade was Sporting Director of the German team. With the current sponsors, and not with the French clothing brand NewMan, responsible for the decoration 40 years ago, the inscription in Portuguese stood out on the rear wing of the Porsche 911 GT3 R nº 7: “Heróis do Circuito”.
For those who follow local motor sport closely, the comic strip “Heróis do Circuito” is already part of the territory’s motoring culture. Passionate about the ninth art and a self-confessed devotee of motor sports, MP Man is the “Jean Graton of Macau”. His title, often seen on cars at local Grand Prix races, has this time reached an international stage.
Regarding participation in the most prestigious endurance race for GT3 cars on the Asian continent, MP Man told HM: "Upon receiving this exciting news, I felt surprise and admiration. This recognition not only values ​​the effort and dedication of years, but also opens a door for the presence of an original Macau brand on the international motorsport stages, allowing us to show the world the unique cultural character and creativity of Macau, an honor that fills me with pride and enthusiasm.”
The international debut could not have gone better in sporting terms, as Absolute Racing's #7 Porsche 911 GT3 R, driven by Kévin Estre, Laurens Vanthoor and Patrick Pilet, crossed the line in second place overall, in a race that also scored points for the Intercontinental GT Challenge.
Bring together synergies
Interestingly, the springboard for placing the MSAR cartoon on a top car from Absolute Racing, an Asian team supported by Porsche Motorsport Asia Pacific and with several triumphs in the Macau GT Cup, was a common sponsor: a model car brand from southern China.
"We maintain a close and friendly relationship with the renowned national collector model brand Almost Real. The founder, Liu Xueshen, Mr. Sum, has always enthusiastically supported my comic book, and has now become one of the main sponsors.
With an ambitious vision, they intend to take the work across borders, exploring new horizons", explained the author, responsible for some of the illustrations on display at the Macau Grand Prix Museum. "By becoming sponsors of Absolute Racing, they integrated elements of the Heróis do Circuito brand into the racing car's paintwork, allowing the vehicle, when running on the track, to announce to the world the unique charm of the comic strip.”
For MP Man, who launched the first issue of “Heróis do Circuito” in 2018, the objective is clear: “For racing and comic book fans to pay more attention to the original creation made in Macau and recognize the effort dedicated to this project.”
Looking to the future
Presence at the Suzuka event, which brought together more than 65 thousand spectators, constituted a decisive step in the brand's internationalization.
"Now, “Heroes of the Circuit” has reached a moment of great significance. Like an eagle taking flight, he has successfully joined a team supported by Porsche, participating in an endurance race that brings together the best teams and drivers from all over Asia", says MP Man, who does not hide his ambition to go further. "If one day my brand manages to reach races like Le Mans, or even a Formula 1 Grand Prix, it will be a dream come true! (laughs) This is, without a doubt, my deepest desire. But I also know that dreams do not come true immediately; my work still has a lot to evolve and perfect. I will continue to create with humility, persevering in improving the work, seeking to offer readers ever more experiences exciting.”
Meanwhile, the fourth volume of the “Circuit Heroes” series is about to be published, opening a new chapter, always with its unique charm and captivating narratives that have won the attention and affection of the local public, increasingly establishing itself in the global universe of comics and among motor sports fans.</description><pubDate>2025-09-26 07:21:12</pubDate></item><item><title>Vernice Lao, just 15 years old, made her F4 debut in Chengdu</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/19/vernice-lao-de-apenas-15-anos-estreou-se-na-f4-em-chengdu/</link><description>In an initiative supported by the Macau-China General Automobile Association (AAMC), Marcus Cheong and Vernice Lao participated in the Chengdu race of the Chinese Formula 4 Championship. The two drivers from local karting competed against some of the best single-seater drivers in the region, and for young Vernice Lao, this was an absolute debut in motorsport.
At the newly built Tianfu Chengdu International Circuit, Marcus Cheong returned to the Formula 4 discipline, having already had several forays into the category, having even finished in 12th place in the 2023 Macau Grand Prix Formula 4 Race.
On this return, the Macau driver drove one of the Mygale chassis, the same as those that will be used in the FIA ​​World Cup at the Guia Circuit, at the end of the year, by the Apollo RFN Racing by Blackjack team. In the sister team Asia Racing Team, founded in Macau in 2003, and also supported by AAMC, 15-year-old Vernice Lao took her first steps in motor racing, after two days of testing in Zhuhai with the single-seater built in France.
Rodolfo Ávila, Team Manager of the team of the two drivers from the territory, highlighted "how fantastic it is to see two drivers supported by the AAMC, something that has a special meaning for me, as I also took my first steps in the single-seater competition with the support of the AAMC. Seeing these young talents from Macau following a similar path is extremely gratifying, and their participation has a very special importance for both me and the team."
Consistent results
After Friday's qualifying sessions, in Saturday's first race Marcus Cheong reached sixth place in the CFGP class and finished 12th overall. Vernice Lao ranked 6th in the Formula 4 class for young drivers, occupying 18th position overall. In the second race of the same day, Marcus Cheong repeated the result, again taking 6th place in the CFGP class and 12th place overall. Vernice Lao finished in 23rd place, also securing 6th position in the Formula 4 class.
In the first race on Sunday, Marcus Cheong improved his performance, reaching 5th place in the CFGP class and 10th place overall. In turn, Vernice Lao finished 7th in Formula 4, corresponding to 19th overall. In the final clash of the weekend, Marcus Cheong shone by taking 2nd place in the CFGP class, also obtaining an honorable 6th place in the general classification. As for Vernice Lao, she finished 13th overall, securing a consistent 6th position in the Formula 4 class.
Very positive balance
On a particularly demanding weekend, with variable track conditions, Portuguese Rodolfo Ávila highlighted the performance of the Macau drivers supported by AAMC, Marcus Cheong and Vernice Lao. "Both showed clear progress throughout the weekend and Vernice, in particular, impressed everyone with a clean and confident debut in single-seaters. Competing against such an experienced field, with so little experience in a Formula 4 car, and delivering the performance she achieved was a pleasant surprise", said the 2003 Asian Formula Renault champion.
On social media, Vernice Lao reported that this was “an incredible experience”, adding that “over the weekend we lost a lot, but we ended up achieving a satisfactory result”. The Macao SAR driver acknowledged that “there is still a long way to go” and took the opportunity to thank “the support and encouragement” from the team, the Team Manager and her teammate, in what she classified as “an unforgettable weekend with the Asia Racing Team”.
The next step for the two drivers from the territory is not yet known, but the Chinese Formula 4 Championship ends in the neighboring city of Zhuhai on the weekend of October 11th and 12th. Afterwards, these same cars from the Chinese competition will be reviewed before traveling to Macau, where they will be used in the FIA ​​World Cup.</description><pubDate>2025-09-19 00:42:07</pubDate></item><item><title>GP Macau | Entry lists presented did not disappoint</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/16/gp-macau-listas-de-inscritos-apresentadas-nao-desapontaram/</link><description>Last Monday, the Organizing Committee of the Macau Grand Prix presented the 72nd edition of the biggest sporting event in the territory. In total, there will be seven grids of GT, touring cars, single-seaters and motorcycles that will provide, between qualifying races and races, a total of eleven unpredictable battles for victory in the always charismatic and world-respected Guia Circuit
The Macao SAR will have 19 riders in total, spread across four races in the program, as it will not have riders in either the GT race, the Motorcycle Grand Prix or the Guia Race. The territory will be represented by Charles Leong Hon Chio at the Macau Grand Prix – FIA FR World Cup. The champion of this season's PRO class of the Lamborghini Super Trofeo Asia moves on to Formula Regional, a category that has not been raced since 2020, when it was still called F3 (!) in Asia.
Tiago Rodrigues, in his third participation in the event, and Marcus Cheong, in his second, will defend the colors of the Macao SAR in the first edition of the F4 World Cup, a race that will feature seven former F4 champions or equivalent. The rest of the territory's delegation will compete in the GT Cup – Great Bay Race, with seven drivers, and in the Macau Roadsport Challenge, with nine.
We have to go back to the beginning of the 1970s to find such a low presence of Portuguese drivers in a Grand Prix. In addition to young Tiago Rodrigues, veterans of the territory Rui Valente and Jerónimo Badaraco will be present, both in the Macau Roadsport Challenge race. The universe of Lusophony is completed with the Brazilian Ethan Nobels, who will make his debut at the Guia Circuit in the F4 race.
Portugal's last representation in the race dates back to the 2022 Macau Motorcycle Grand Prix, when André Pires and Sheridan Morais overcame mandatory confinement, with Morais achieving a podium, a unique feat for Portuguese motorcycling. In cars, the last participation was in 2019, when Tiago Monteiro drove a Honda Civic Type-R TCR in the Guia Race.
Interestingly, at a time when there is an increase in female participation in motorsport events worldwide, there is not a single lady among the more than one hundred and sixty drivers registered in the Grand Prix.
Mercedes smudges the paint
After two years with pelotons with two dozen GT3 cars, the Macau GT Cup – FIA GT World Cup is once again below that benchmark number. Fortunately, the sixteen cars from six different manufacturers, including the returning McLaren, will be driven by drivers with world-class credentials. Well-known names from Macau, such as Edoardo Mortara or Raffaele Marciello, joined by the new hero of Chinese motorsport, the winner of the 24 Hours of Le Mans, Ye Yifei, alleviate any disappointments. If Audi Sport Asia, at a time when the Ingolstadt brand is disinvesting in GT races, had backed down, we would have fewer cars than in the 2018 edition, where only fifteen machines lined up.
The introduction of torque sensors in this year's race – a costly decision made entirely by the FIA ​​– was at the heart of Mercedes-AMG's decision not to participate in the event. The German brand's business model involves registering cars in partnership with teams from the region at the event. In Southeast Asia, cars are constantly on the move via containerized transport, leaving little opportunity for conversion work and sensor testing, which is imperative for Mercedes-AMG. Everyone is certain that the Stuttgart brand will return to the Guia Circuit in the near future, but this year Maro Engel will not be able to defend the crown won last year.
Classics maintain their aura
With Michael Rutter's absence confirmed, there was a lot of apprehension about the entry list for the Motorcycle Grand Prix, but the presence of Davey Todd, last year's winner, and Peter Hickman will keep the race on the international radar. Twelve countries, all European, will be represented on a grid that this year will feature four newcomers, while of the four brands present, BMW and Honda make up more than 70% of the twenty entries.
Notably, no rider competes on a Kawasaki, marking the first time this decade that the company, which next year celebrates 130 years since its founding, has not had a presence in Asia's premier motorcycle road race.
At a time when Tourist racing is experiencing a less vigorous moment worldwide, the Guia Race already has twenty-four cars registered, three of which will still have to be filled by drivers to be nominated. The presence of the stars of the FIA ​​TCR World Tour, which is once again decided on the local circuit, is always synonymous with a good show on the track.</description><pubDate>2025-10-16 02:48:16</pubDate></item><item><title>GP Macau: First names and first questions</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/10/gp-macau-primeiros-nomes-e-primeiras-duvidas/</link><description>October is usually the month of preparations for the Macau Grand Prix. With the championships coming to an end all over the world, attention turns to the Macao SAR's big event, which this year will take place from the 13th to the 16th of November
 
After Marcos Cheong and Vernice Lau raced in the Chinese Formula 4 Championship race, this weekend it is Tiago Rodrigues' turn to pick up the helmet again to compete in the closing race of the Chinese competition season, on the circuit in the neighboring city of Zhuhai. The former Chinese champion of the discipline has been away from single-seater racing since participating in the Middle East Formula 4 Championship at the beginning of the year, but his experience could prove to be an asset in defending the territory's colors at the Guia Circuit.
Twenty of the Mygale M21-F4 single-seaters from the Chinese championship will be overhauled after this race at the Zhuhai International Circuit and handed over to technicians appointed by the French Motor Sport Federation (FFSA), who will put them on the track in the first edition of the FIA ​​Formula 4 World Cup, in Macau. This is the same model used in the French Formula 4 Championship.
Some names of the bikes
Michael Rutter's absence from the entry list for this year's Macau Motorcycle Grand Prix is ​​now a certainty. However, through the specialized press, the first names that will shape the only road race on the Asian continent are beginning to become known.
Practically confirmed are the presence of Davey Todd, winner of last year's edition, and Peter Hickman, the motorcyclist who chases Rutter's record of victories and who should be practically recovered from the injuries suffered in the accident on the Isle of Man. Both will drive the official competitive BMW M1000RR from 8TEN Racing. Rob Hodson, SMT Racing driver, has also guaranteed his presence in the Macao SAR, usually being one of the strong candidates for the Top 5 in the race.
But not only renowned names are tested. Among the debutants already confirmed is ramp driver Maurizio Bottalico. The San Marino driver, who reached the podium at the Manx Grand Prix, follows in the footsteps of other great Italian names in 21st century road racing — such as Stefano Bonetti, Luca Gottardi or Alex Polita — by taking on the most famous and feared race in the East.
According to the Road Racing News portal, there will be more newcomers to the Guia Circuit this year, such as Mitch Rees, a driver with several titles in New Zealand, Ryan Whitehall, a driver from the Isle of Wight, and the new holder of the Frohburger Dreieck lap record in the Supersport category, Paul Jordan.
Questions in the GT
Stéphane Ratel, founder and CEO of SRO Motorsports Group — the company that co-organizes the FIA ​​GT World Cup Macau Grand Prix — has been one of the most critical voices regarding the introduction of torque sensors in GT3 racing. However, the FIA ​​decided in favor of its use in the Guia Circuit World Cup, and the French businessman spoke about the matter for the first time.
"The teams competing in Macau are mostly from Asia, where torque sensors have never been used. The lack of experience could affect the sporting balance, and that's why I opposed their use", said Stéphane Ratel to the German magazine Motorsport Aktuell, adding that he does not believe this is the way forward.
Although the SRO Motorsports Group is co-organizer of the event and has a Balance of Performance (BoP) recognized worldwide, in the last two years the Macau BoP has been determined by the FIA ​​itself. Last year, the FIA's BoP was subject to a series of criticisms, with teams and drivers – particularly from Audi, Porsche and Lamborghini, the main losers – publicly expressing their displeasure at the differences in pace. For this reason, the FIA ​​decided to introduce these expensive sensors, installed on the cars' transmission shafts, which represent the most accurate tool for measuring the power transmitted to the wheels.
“Some manufacturers supported the idea, but others, like Mercedes, were against it,” said Stéphane Ratel. "As a result, we lost some cars from the entry list. To be clear: I look at this issue pragmatically, not dogmatically. Last year in Macau, three or four manufacturers could have won without these torque sensors. In 2025 we will see if this technology is really useful", he concluded.</description><pubDate>2025-10-10 00:11:25</pubDate></item><item><title>GP | FIA presents 10 teams from the FR World Cup</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/12/gp-fia-da-a-conhecer-10-equipas-da-taca-do-mundo-fr/</link><description>On Wednesday night, the International Automobile Federation (FIA), in partnership with the Organizing Committee of the Macau Grand Prix, published the official list of teams registered for this year's edition of the Macau Grand Prix – FIA FR World Cup.
Although the names of the Formula Regional (FR) drivers who will visit Macau in November have not been released, according to the official statement from the organization, based in Paris, this “carefully selected squad of ten truly international teams will bring together the best regional talents from around the world to compete in this prestigious, unique race on the iconic Guia Circuit”.
This year's edition welcomes two new major teams to the event: the Italian Trident Motorsport, which arrives in Macau after a 2025 season in which it won the FIA ​​Formula 3 Championship, with the Brazilian Rafael Câmara, and the Dutch Van Amersfoort Racing (VAR), a team that has known the Guia Circuit well since 1998 and that, in 2018, suffered a huge scare with the spectacular accident by Sophia Flörsch.
Returning to defend the coveted title in Macau will be R-ace GP, a European team that won in 2024 with Ugo Ugochukwu, a driver who will not be present this year to try to revalidate the title. The French team remains in great form, leading the current FRECA standings and finishing second in the Middle East Formula Regional Championship earlier this year.
Return of SJM Theodore
Also returning are some of the strongest contenders from last year's Macau Grand Prix and the FR scene in general, including a well-known name from the event: SJM Theodore Prema Racing. The Italian team Prema, currently in second place in the FRECA 2025 championship, is one of the most successful teams in grassroots motorsport and is once again partnering with Teddy Yip Jr. at the Macao SAR event.
Also returning are Pinnacle Motorsport, an Irish-owned team; the Australian Evans GP, which achieved fourth place in the last edition; the Japanese TOM’S Racing, one of the most prestigious in Japanese motorsport; the German PHM Racing; and the always competitive French structures Saintéloc Racing and ART Grand Prix.
On the other hand, the Dutch MP Motorsport, the Australian Kiwi Motorsport and the Japanese TGM Grand Prix left the scene. No team from China was selected, but, unlike last year, none attempted to register for the competition.
The official list of entries should only be made known in mid-October, as is tradition for the Grand Prix.
The second edition of the FIA ​​FR World Cup will take place during the week of the Macau Grand Prix, from 13 to 16 November, and will also feature, for the first time, the FIA ​​F4 World Cup, making the event one of the most prestigious global showcases for the junior single-seater categories.</description><pubDate>2025-09-12 00:22:52</pubDate></item><item><title>Charles Leong wins Lamborghini Super Trofeo title</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/09/charles-leong-conquista-titulo-lamborghini-super-trofeo/</link><description>Macau driver Charles Leong Hon Chio became the winner of the PRO class of the Lamborghini Super Trofeo Asia last weekend, at the Sepang International Circuit, in Malaysia. This represents the Macao SAR driver's first title in Grand Tourism (GT) competitions and the first championship title achieved with SJM Theodore Racing.
Despite being ill and with two races remaining in the calendar of the competition organized by the prestigious Italian car brand, Charles Leong and the young Irishman Alex Denning always proved to be extremely fast on the Malaysian track. They won the first race of the weekend, thus achieving their sixth victory of the season, and finished second in the second race. This second place took the number of podiums achieved in 10 races to 10, extending the team's impressive run, which has never finished lower than second place.
With two races still to be contested at the Lamborghini Super Trofeo World Finals, in Misano, Italy, in November, SJM Theodore Racing will be able to focus on maintaining this impressive run of podiums, with the main objective of the season already achieved. Charles Leong and Alex Denning are tied at the top of the driver standings and are expected to complete the season side by side, sharing the same Lamborghini Huracán Super Trofeo EVO2.
Always adding
For Charles Leong, this result is the result of "incredible work by the team. We won the championship thanks to a great collective effort, without major mistakes and with total consistency. For the race, I expected a bigger group, but it was difficult to fight against my opponents with new tires. In the end, I followed my rhythm and we managed the tires to give the best car to Alex. It was a very good weekend."
After finishing in second place in the classification of this same single-brand trophy, the Macau driver adds this title to those he won at a young age in the Formula Renault Asian Championship and the Chinese Formula 4 Championship, in addition to two notable victories in the Formula 4 Macau Grand Prix.
Obviously satisfied with the results obtained by his pupils, Teddy Yip Jr., owner of SJM Theodore Racing, commented: "I want to congratulate the entire team for this achievement, the result of a collective effort throughout the season and previous years. The drivers responded in an exemplary way to the pressure. Thank you to Charles, despite being ill, and to Alex, who performed another fast and consistent stint, securing tenth ‘top-2’ in ten races.”
The Theodore Racing team and SJM have supported Charles Leong since 2021, when he achieved his second Formula 4 triumph at the Guia Circuit. In 2023, he finished very close to teammate Arvid Lindblad in the Macau Grand Prix Formula 4 race, completing a triumphant 1-2 for SJM Theodore PREMA Racing. Absent from last year's edition due to commitments at the Lamborghini Super Trofeo Asia in Spain, Charles Leong has not yet announced whether he will participate in this year's edition of the Macau Grand Prix.</description><pubDate>2025-09-09 00:01:15</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
