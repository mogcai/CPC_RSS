Still, last month was the second weakest this year
 
The game sector raised 18.3 billion Patacas last month, another 6 percent of September last year. The registration represented the second lowest monthly amount of 2025, revealed the Macao Game Inspection and Game Coordination Directorate.
Even so, revenues increased in annual terms, despite the passage of Ragasa, which led authorities in the semi-autonomous Chinese region to close casinos for 33 hours. Operators will have lost 880 million patacas in revenue, almost 5 percent of what was forecast for September, estimated Jeffrey Kiang, an analyst at consultancy CLSA, cited by the GGRAsia news portal.
The value recorded in September represents 82.8 percent of that reached in the same month of 2019, when Macau's casinos had revenues of 22.1 billion patacas.
Compared to the previous month, territory casinos loved 17.5 percent gross revenues. However, it should be noted that in August this year, the Macau game industry recorded the best monthly performance of this January 2020, with gross revenues around 22.16 billion.

In terms of accumulated gross revenue, the first nine months of 2025 recorded an increase of 7.1 percent over the same period last year, reaching 181.3 billion patacas. Macao closed 2024 with total revenues of 226.8 billion patacas, more 23.9 percent than the previous year.
The Macau Government predicted, in the initial budget for 2025, that the year would close with total revenues of 240 billion patacas, which would represent an increase of 6 percent compared to last year. However, on June 11, the Legislative Assembly approved a new budget, proposed by the Executive, which reduces the forecast for public revenue by 4.56 billion patacas.
The Secretary for Economy and Finance, Anton Tai Kin Ip, admitted to deputies that the cut was due to the fact that the game's gross revenues in the first quarter of 2025 were “slightly below expectations”.</description><pubDate>2025-10-03 02:02:05</pubDate></item><item><title>Tourism | Bus orders during sign 8 of typhoon</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/07/turismo-pedidos-autocarros-durante-o-sinal-8-de-tufao/</link><description>The president of the Macao Leisure Innovation and Tourism Services Association, Paul Wong, considers that buses must be ensured during periods when signal 8 of tufts is lifted. The idea was defended in statements to the Chinese channel of Radio Macau, with the associative leader to ask the buses and shuttle buses of the game companies to focus on tourists.
According to Paul Wong, Macau is a tourist city, so it is necessary to ensure that visitors have alternatives to taxis when typhoon signal no. The president of the association explained that in order to protect the Macao SAR's tourist image, it is necessary to ensure that tourists are not regularly stranded and that the buses provided operate in safe conditions.
Paul Wong also recalled that the Macao Bridge began to allow circulation during signal 8 and asked the possibility of tourists to travel between the borders, the city center zone and the Cotai hotels should be permanent.
Furthermore, the association leader wants weather information to be announced earlier, so that the sector has enough time to accommodate tourists, and organize shifts for employees, who face travel difficulties.</description><pubDate>2025-10-07 23:28:06</pubDate></item><item><title>“Lusophony Awards” | Distinguished East Foundation</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/07/premios-da-lusofonia-fundacao-oriente-distinguida/</link><description>The gala “Awards of Lusofonia”, scheduled for this Saturday at Estoril Casino, Portugal, aims to highlight the role of people and institutions that have best played the image of the “worldwide” community, the organization announced to Lusa.

In October, casino revenues are expected to reach 23 billion patacas, the highest value since the same month in 2019. The estimates were made by the investment bank JP Morgan, taking into account the revenues of Macau's main industry in the first days of Golden Week.
According to the JP Morgan report, cited by the GGR Asia portal, the game's gross revenue reached 5.5 billion patacas in the first five days of the month, which represented a daily average of 1.1 billion patacas. “It was the best Golden Week in more than five years”, can be read in the aforementioned report, which was signed by analysts DS Kim, Selina Li and Lindsey Qian.
Despite this aspect, analysts recognize that the numbers were slightly below initial expectations for this month: “annual growth appears relatively moderate, with an increase of 3 percent compared to last year's (very) high base, remaining a few points below our expectations and the market's expectations, which pointed to average single-digit growth”, was justified.
Revenue growth below expectations is not seen as a concern for JP Morgan because the 2025 golden week has one more holiday day than last year's golden week. Therefore, analysts believe that demand will remain strong in the second week of October.
Expectations maintained
Analysts believe that demand will remain strong in the second week of October, with daily revenues to reach 750 million patacas, a growth of about 15 percent compared to last year. In the second week of October, a 30 percent break is expected compared to the first week. This reduction is lighter than it happened last year, when the breach of revenues from the first to the second week reached 40 percent.
"Our projection for the month remains unchanged for now, with gross game revenues reaching 23 billion patacas, the highest value in six years, growing between 11 percent and 13 percent over the previous year," was indicated.
The bank's analysts also stated that they expect the growth trend to last until next year, with “sustained double-digit growth in gross gaming revenue until at least the first quarter of 2026”.</description><pubDate>2025-10-07 23:26:15</pubDate></item><item><title>Porto / Kevin Ho | Construction permit issued for “Torre do JN”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/07/porto-kevin-ho-emitido-alvara-de-construcao-para-torre-do-jn/</link><description>The Porto City Council issued a construction permit on January 30th to begin work on adapting the Jornal de Notícias (JN) tower into a hotel, the municipality responded to Lusa, but the work has not yet progressed. According to the municipality, the permit, issued at the beginning of the year, is used for “demolition, expansion and alteration works to adapt the pre-existence to a hotel”.
The building was sold in 2018 by the Global Media to Authentic Empathy society. Since 2020, it has been belonging only to one of the societies that constituted it, Magnetic Pocket, managed by Macau Lei Kei and David Siu entrepreneurs, Burgosublime managers, whose mother company is the Portuguese Kevin Ho KNJ branch, recently elected deputy.
The process of transforming the tower is already a decade old and dates back to 2015, when a Request for Prior Information (PIP) was filed with the municipality's urban planning services to reconvert that space into a hotel unit with more than 200 rooms, a process that received a favorable order in March 2016 and which “was successively revalidated”.
The architectural project of the future “Hotel Jornal” was delivered to the Opport Office for Design and Architecture collective. According to the architecture studio website, the tile panel on the Tower Facade, by sculptor Charters de Almeida, will be maintained and a part of the building that is next to the Trindade station will be demolished.
The journalists left this space in July 2023. Workers from JN and the sports team O Jogo moved to a building on Rua do Monte dos Burgos, in Prelada, and those from TSF to a space in Boavista. The tower, designed by architect Márcio Freitas, was the third editorial office for that newspaper's workers, who moved to these facilities in 1970.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Gastronomy | Study speaks of the “undervaluation” of the Fernando Restaurant</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/07/gastronomia-estudo-fala-na-subvalorizacao-do-restaurante-fernando/</link><description>In “Restaurante Fernando: A Case Study on Culinary Authenticity and Cultural Heritage”, José Ferreira Pinto, professor at the City University of Macau, draws attention to an “undervaluation”, by the authorities, of the restaurant’s cultural value, highlighting the maintenance of the space’s identity
 
José Ferreira Pinto, a tourism professor at the City University of Macau (UCM), has just published a case study about Restaurante Fernando on the academic platform CABI Digital Library, entitled “Restaurant Fernando: A Case Study on Culinary Authenticity and Cultural Heritage”, warning of the lack of cultural recognition of this space by the authorities.
“For policy makers and destination developers, [restaurant] Fernando represents an underutilized asset”, taking into account that it is an “asset that contributes to Macau’s global identity and provides a model of sustainable tourism”.
It is also explained that “despite the iconic status between local inhabitants and international visitors, Fernando Restaurante was not formally recognized by official tourism or culture institutions as one of the main exponents of Macau's destination brand”, but the truth is that it has “undeniable influence” in these fields.
"There are documented cases of travelers who fly to Macau only to dinner at Fernando before returning to their home countries, proof of their magnetic attraction and symbolic value," he is added.
Thus, “recognizing and supporting these institutions could improve the branding strategies of destinations and promote deeper connections between visitors and the place,” is mentioned.
In the same case study, aimed at university students and operators in the sector, it is stated that “Restaurant Fernando is a convincing example of how authenticity, when cultivated in a careful and consistent way, can transcend commercial trends and become a cultural institution”.
Fernando has existed in Coloane since 1986, next to Hac-Sá Beach, and since then has been an almost obligatory crossing point for many tourists and residents. This study was carried out based on “a combination of ethnographic observation, qualitative conversations and documentary evidence”, and in 15 months more than 20 visits were made to the restaurant “to interact with employees, customers, the restaurant owner and the restaurant manager”. Through “informal but systematic conversations”, topics such as “perceptions about authenticity, customer loyalty and commercial pressures” were addressed.
Resist crises
Another point highlighted in this case study is that the restaurant has resisted several crises throughout its existence. "The perseverance of [restaurant] Fernando during economic crises, pandemics and changes in tourism dynamics offers a powerful lesson of resilience. Its refusal to compromise the identity of the restaurant in favor of modernization has preserved a space that seems timeless and emotionally grounded."
Thus, the author considers that the maintenance of the traditional restaurant "challenges the dominant logic of constant innovation in hotel and tourism, suggesting that cultural consistency and fidelity can be equally, if no longer, valuable."
Regarding the future of this well-known gastronomic space, questions are left that only Fernando himself can answer: “Should it continue to resist modernization in favor of preserving the original spirit, or adapt to new hotel trends and formalize its brand to attract younger audiences and international markets?”</description><pubDate>2025-10-07 23:23:35</pubDate></item><item><title>Suicide | Administration stops publishing data</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/07/suicidio-administracao-deixa-de-publicar-dados/</link><description>After, in 2024, the number of suicides has reached the highest value since there are records, health services have been since the second quarter of the year without presenting data on the phenomenon. TDM advances that there were at least 40 suicides between April and October, but the actual number should be higher than the
 
Health services (SS) ceased to publish data on the number of suicides, a statistics that used to be disclosed quarterly. The evasion of data arises after 2024 the value of suicides was the highest ever in the territory.
In addition to not having published the data for the second quarter, which, taking the previous year as a reference, should have been published in August, the SS also ignored several requests made by Canal Macau regarding the compilation of this statistics.
The public broadcaster reveals that since April it has submitted several requests to the SS to understand the reasons for the delay in releasing the data, but for months it has been ignored by the body led by Alvis Lo. The new trend towards dealing with health statistics also happened a few months after Sam Hou Fai took over as Chief Executive. This is a completely different stance to that adopted by his predecessors, when numbers were considered public information.
In the first quarter of the year, 18 cases of suicide were reported, which appeared to indicate a reduction of four incidents compared to the period between January and March 2024.
That year, a total of 90 suicides were recorded, the highest number since 2003. However, since 2021 there has been a successive increase in the annual number of suicides, without the trend being reversed, despite the authorities regularly promising to pay attention to the situation.
Around 40 deaths
Given the absence of statistics, the Macao channel turned to messages shared by the Judiciary Police to try to calculate the number of suicides.
PJ messages present challenges in collecting information because they often classify cases simply as “discovery of a corpse” without suspected signs of crime, which does not always allow for the distinction between suicide or a death linked to the victim's health conditions.
Despite these challenges, the Macao channel has accounted for the messages in which it was clear that the deaths were due to suicide cases and indicates that from April to October there have been at least 40 people to put an end to life. However, the actual number should be higher.
The ages of the victims were not determined by the broadcaster, because the PJ stopped disclosing their ages, instead using generic descriptions, such as middle age, a term that can cover people over 30 years old and up to 65 years old. Even so, TDM adds that the majority of victims were “middle aged”. There were 10 cases with young people and one case with a minor. Among suicide victims, there are also some cases of elderly people.
Anyone who is emotionally distressed or considers themselves to be in a desperate situation should call the “Caritas Hope for Life” Hotline on 28525222 in order to obtain emotional counseling services.</description><pubDate>2025-10-07 23:18:48</pubDate></item><item><title>UNESCO | Egyptian Khaled el-Enany elected as next director general</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/07/unesco-egipcio-khaled-el-enany-eleito-para-proximo-director-geral/</link><description>Egyptian museologist Khaled el-Enany was elected this Monday director-general of UNESCO, by the executive board of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, succeeding Frenchwoman Audrey Azoulay, for the next four-year term.

"Today (yesterday) has spent two years of the terrible attacks perpetrated by Hamas. It is a day to reiterate our roundworm condemnation of terrorism in all its forms. To request the release of Israeli hostages. And to demand the Netanyahu to stop the genocide of the Palestinian people and open a humanitarian corridor," said Pedro Sánchez, who referred to the Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu.
"The dialogue and consolidation of the two states [Israel and Palestine] are the only possible solution to end conflict and get a future of peace," added the Spain government leader in a message published on social network X.
On October 7, 2023, militias led by Hamas, a terrorist group that controls the Palestinian territory of the Gaza Strip, carried out unprecedented attacks in southern Israel two years ago, during which they murdered around 1,200 people and kidnapped 251 who they took hostage to Gaza.
The Israeli army responded with an offensive against Hamas in the enclave controlled by the extremist group since 2007, which caused more than 67,100 deaths in two years and led to accusations of genocide against Israel.
Representatives of Hamas and Israel started on Monday, in Egypt, indirect negotiations on a plan proposed by US President Donald Trump to end the conflict. The 20-point plan provides for the release of hostages in Gaza, a ceasefire, the disarmament of Hamas, the removal of Israelites troops and a transient international administration of the Gaza Strip.
In these two years, the Spanish government, led by socialist Pedro Sánchez, was one of the first and the most blunt to criticize Israel's offensive in Gaza, which the Prime Minister himself qualifies as a genocide. Spain was also one of the first countries to recognize the state of Palestine in this period in May 2024.
Qatar's appeals
Qatar defended yesterday that Israel should have already ceased military operations in the Gaza Strip, in accordance with US President Donald Trump's plan. "We are waiting for the results of negotiations in the coming days regarding ceasefire," said Qatar Foreign Ministry spokesman Majed Al-Anari, quoted by France-Presse news agency (AFP).
"This issue must first of all be posed to Israel. It should have already given a term to military operations if the Israeli Prime Minister's statements about the adhesion to Trump's plan were true," he added.</description><pubDate>2025-10-07 23:17:14</pubDate></item><item><title>Equipment | Women want more recreational facilities</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/07/equipamentos-mulheres-querem-mais-instalacoes-recreativas/</link><description>Vice-presidents of the General Association of Macao Women, Wong Kit Cheng and Loi I Weng argue that the government should better enjoy interior spaces in public buildings to make more recreational options available to the population.

The newly elected deputies also asked that the example of opening more social equipment in vacant spaces is replicated in the provisional market of the Red Market and the Municipal Market of Iao Hon neighborhood, giving a productive use to empty rooms in these buildings.
At the same time, studies were requested to choose the type of services that are missing the population and should be made available in the unemployed rooms. In shared opinions, the deputies pointed out some examples such as spaces for sports, shows or meeting rooms.

In their philosophies about death, Portuguese and Chinese differ in the fundamentals, especially when the Taoist cultural matrix comes into play, but they agree in some aspects, when the Confucian Philosophy dominates. For the latter, as well as for the Portuguese, death causes mourning, sadness, suffering and pain. Confucius in the Analects advised a three -year mourning to all those to whom the parents died and death was a subject of extreme consequences and severity, while for the so -called passing was and is no more than a natural transformation, in a process in which life and death complement each other and interpenetrate in such a way that one cannot be perspective without the other, so funerals should not be space of pain and pain, no way not to interfere with the process of transmuting the being in question.
The Taoist philosopher Zhuangzi (莊子, 369-286) reports in the third of the seven interior chapters of the homonymous work, one of several episodes of death, relating to the funeral of the school's patriarch, Laozi (老子), where he strongly rebukes the way in which the disciples allow themselves to indulge in sentimental manifestations:
They violated the nature of things by abandoning themselves to sentimentality, in ancient times it was considered 'a crime of violating nature'. Your master's return to earth is timely and his departure is natural. A timely return and a natural departure have nothing to do with joy or sadness. This was considered emancipation from division by the ancients.
The resins and firewood can be consumed, but the fire will continue. No one knows when the fire ends.
(是遁天倍情，忘其所受，古者谓之遁天之刑。适来，夫子时也； Text
指穷于为薪，火传也，不知其尽也。2
(Zhuangzi, 1999, 46-47)
Death is nothing more in Taoist philosophy than the return movement to the great way, the Tao (道 道), as well explained in Chapter 40 of the Laozi Road and Virtue, or the “return” hexagra of the classic of mutations (易經), the classic founding of all others, or what some synologists called it, the philosophical “Bible” of the Chinese.  This hexagram of the "return" (復 fù), also called the "turning point" by Richard Wilhelm, is composed of the following trigarms, at the base the thunder (震 zhèn), initiator, and the top the earth (坤 kūn), affirming in the judgment of the hexagra that comes and go is the movement of the tao, it expands or returns, as its nature And therefore, there is always this possibility of starting any turning point sometimes to life sometimes to death. This hexagram is also associated with the image of a radius or thunder over the earth and the winter solstice, a natural period of major changes, in which the sun begins to grow on the horizon of the days. And will there be a greater change than that of life to death and from this to a new life, if to Taoism we add Buddhist hells and reincarnation in the various dimensions of being?
Read the judgment of the hexagram of the “return” (Wilhelm, 1989, 97):
Return. Success.
Go out and enter without error
Friends come what there is nothing to censor.
Forward and backwards it is the way.
We return to the Seventh day.
It's always good to have where to go.
(復 ， 亨 ， 出入无疾 ， 朋來无咎 ， 反復其道 七日來復 ， ，) 3 （張, 1995,109）
As a result, it is found that in Chinese native philosophies as ancient as Taoism and the most remote, such as the one that comes exposed in the classic of mutations, there is no split between immanence and transcendence, life and death, there is a fluid process that runs endless, tireless and unenforceable, so death does not appear as a true problem.
But this position of the most erudite philosophy did not always coincide with a popular philosophy, based on myths and real stories of the search for immortality, because although a true split between life and death was not supposed, these being seen as the two complementary faces of a transformational process, the truth is that philosophers practiced exercises that, in the first and last analysis, would lead them beyond longevity to immortality. and the rulers followed the zealous example in trying to free themselves from the natural process. The search for immortality pills was frequent not only in deities such as the Divine Archer Houyi (后羿Hòu Yì) and his Consort Chang´E （嫦娥Cháng’é）, but also in more human figures.  The First Chinese Emperor (秦始皇 Qín Shǐhuáng), the great unifier of Chinese territory, in addition to creating a legalistic bureaucratic system and confronting Confucian wisdom and scholars by burning school books, pursued the cult of physical immortality through the search for elixirs that would allow him to live eternally. Tradition has it that he hastened his death by ingesting elixirs made from highly toxic mercury. And the search for immortality, or at least the maximum possible longevity, continues to be a tradition within a popular philosophy that is now defined as being essentially secular, as was reported by Reuters when, in early September 2025, Russian presidents Vladimir Putin and North Korean Kim Jong Un were “caught” by a microphone that was inadvertently left open to discuss issues of longevity. and immortality with Chinese President Xi Jinping (习近平Xí Jìnpíng). The peaches of immortality from the Paradise of the Queen Mother of the West (西王母娘娘150 years, or more.
Thus, the Chinese, from ancient to contemporary, and erudite philosophies aside, believe as popularly as possible that “heaven can wait”, so the longer they live here on earth, the better.
As far as the Portuguese are concerned, it goes without saying that they subscribe to this position of Chinese popular philosophy with greater emphasis. These are the faithful heirs of a strong Christian tradition, even when they say they are not religious. In their cultural DNA is a radical dichotomy between divine good and satanic evil, earthly immanence, full of errors and omissions, and transcendence full of bliss. Therefore, they cannot escape the images, no matter how metaphorical they consider them, of heaven, hell, purgatory, etc. After all, even the most “intellectually evolved” consider that “the devil lurks”, “walks on the loose” and, obviously, is on the evil side of the world, the one in which darkness dwells where the angels of the Apocalypse will send all those who have acted incorrectly in this existence. There will be a final judgment from which only the good and the just will escape, those who have a pure heart like children or those who are “freed from the law of death” through their “valiant works”, in the manner of the Camonian song.
But it is understood: good works do not get rid of physical death, only spiritual, only honor and fame will remain to all who have left their high mark in this world, as well suggested the saying of the best popular philosophy "death with honor, disassess." Now it will be interesting to see the Chinese correspondence, which is provided by Monsignor António André ngan in sino-Portuguese agreement of idioms and idioms (1998, 216) 視死如歸 (Shì Sǐ Rú Guī), which means in a literal translation for Chinese, “seeing death as a return”, but the truth is that this return has a very different meaning in China, where it is seen as something Body, physically turns to life, while the “disassombre” for the Portuguese means leaving the world of spiritual darkness to return to life, but in spirit, the only possible way for a liberation of the law of death.
Death and life form a pair of non -complementary opposites in the Portuguese. It means that death, "that does not expect," this one that "is always certain although the time is uncertain" does not depend on normal circumstances of Himself, but on God, for "only who God wants," according to the Christian tradition. Only God and Jesus have the possibility of rescuing death. They are on the side of life and eternal life, while death belongs to the kingdom of darkness and Satan. In the Book of Proverbs, 8, 35-36 is clearly affirmed regarding wisdom, "Whoever finds me finds life and enjoys the favor of Yahweh. Who loses me, arranges himself, for all who hate me love death."
Note that the vast majority of miracles performed by Jesus and the saints of the Catholic Church are related to miraculous healings and the resurrection of the dead, and can be described as moments in which the supernatural order intervenes in the natural order to free it from illness and death, towards life, and these extraordinary actions do not happen to everyone, but only to those who are just and good or who were possessed by some evil against their will, as in this case where demons were cast out.
For the Portuguese there is then to choose sides, through a wise stance, that is, acting correctly to be on the side of life so that when the end of time comes, as is predicted in the book of Revelation, each is judged according to their conduct (Rev. 20, 13-14) and so that the end of the history announced in this text of the apostle John can be transformed into life: “ Text ends with the promise of a new sky and land.
The big difference between Chinese and Portuguese philosophies about death is that the Chinese by tradition is allowed greater flexibility, life and death go hand in hand, they are part of the same process, so if death is certain, life is also guaranteed at the outset. They have the conceptual gadgets necessary to face the passing more at will and naturalness. Although many times throughout the history of this people, there has been a coexistence of postures, on the one hand, death is better accepted and, on certain schools, of taoistorist, even advises to face it with Gúudio, but on the other, one seeks to extend to the limit of the possible eyes not in a spiritual immortality to the Portuguese, but physical and concrete, either in the present via the present via the various experiences. scientific that the contemporary world favors.
Already the Portuguese, although also very closely trust in science and doctors, see and as parentheses the legitimate struggle for better health services, and have a language centered on "health", being the proverbial "how has passed?" The best of the examples of this, only very recently have been awakening to the exercises and practices of longevity, so in this respect the Chinese have greater advantages regarding healthy postures and the “manufacturing of elixires”; The compatriots never lose sight of the certainty that "death does not expect" and that "who has to die," even though those who have true faith believe in the possibility conditioned on the good works of an eternal life in a new world.
The Chinese will succeed the same with regard to good works, which will allow them according to Buddhist philosophy to reach Nirvana, or in their most popular aspects, reach a Buddha paradise, or, alternatively, to return to Tao, diluting in an eternal present.

Emperor Wanli (1572-1620), named Zhu Yijun, had an underground palace built to be his tomb, whose value spent would allow feeding ten million people for a year. The decay was prevailed and the population lived in misery. He was forced to pay high incomes and fees, which led the peasants to revolt and take up arms to protect themselves.
In 1627 a peasant revolt began in northern Shaanxi, which spread to Shanxi and Henan. In 1635, the leaders of armed groups of peasants met in Xingyang, Henan province, to plan a strategy. Li Zicheng, one of the leaders, with his army of peasants occupied Xian, in 1644, and the entire province of Shaanxi, forming the state of Dashun there. Then, he left for the East and, passing through Shanxi and Hebei, arrived in Beijing, which led the last emperor of the Ming dynasty, Chongzhen (1628-44), who was also called Zhu Yijun, to take refuge on Mount Wansui (Hill of Long Life), located in the northern part of the Imperial Palace. He stayed there for 43 days, but all efforts failed and without a solution to the complicated situation, the emperor hanged himself. China was left without an imperial government for a few months, a period known as the Shun Interregnum.
Ming troops fought peasant revolts in many parts of China and a small Ming court moved to Nanjing, now named Yingtian, creating the Southern Ming dynasty.
The Manchus had their ancestors on the Nuzhen tribe, which in the Song had formed the Jin dynasty and lived in the Northeast many centuries from the mountains of Altai. In 1616, they joined the command of Nurhachi and in 1636, his son Huangtaiji formed the state of Qing. With an increasingly strong military body, he was preparing to invade China. For a long time, the Manchus troops were being parked along the borders with the territory of the Ming Dynasty.
General Ming, Wu Sangui, who ruled the passage of Shanhaiguan, surrendered to the Manchus and let them go through the great wall so that the Ming troops, together with the Manchus, to fight the rebels. Li Zicheng had to leave Beijing and, heading west, to Shanxi, was chased by the Manchus and Ming troops that had united. He was killed in Hubei, at the age of 39.
After the Manchus troops crossed the great wall with the help of Wu Sangui, they found China without a dynasty on the dragon throne a few months ago. In 1644, the Manchus occupied Beijing and stopped their capital, which until then was in Shenyang. Many Ming officers, who hitherto cooperated with the Manchus against the peasants, changed to their side, fighting the invaders Manchus.
With the last emperor of the Ming dynasty dead in 1644, the small Ming court settled in Nanjing and formed the Southern Ming dynasty (1644-1662) there. Zhu Yousong, Prince of Fu, becomes Emperor Hong Guang (1644-1645) and releases Zhu Yujian from prison, condemned since 1636, when the title of Prince of Tang was stripped from him.
Yingtian (Nanjing) was captured in June 1645 by Qing forces and the Ming court fled again. After the Southern Ming dynasty was divided, part went to Shaoxing (Zheijiang) and the other took refuge in Fuzhou, where Emperor Long Wu (1645 -1646) ascended to the throne, whose name was also Zhu Yujian, prince of Tang. He belonged to the eighth generation descended from the third son of the first emperor of the Ming dynasty and hoped to defeat the Manchus, who already formed the Qing dynasty.
Macau and Ming resistance
With the background explained, we arrive at the period of History that we are interested in studying to recognize the character linked to the Ming who hides behind the god Zhu Da Xian, whose belief in his protection has great power.
Until 1660 there was a resistance from the Chinese Han to the Manchus, where Macau has placed himself, sending several times military detachments, with cannons, to help the Ming Dynasty, which had opened the doors of the middle country.
In 1630, paid by the Ming court, four hundred Portuguese left Macau towards the Great Wall, but when they were in Jiangxi they were interrupted in their march, due to the intrigues of Canton merchants with the provincial mandarins.
In 1643, a cannon and four top scorers are sent from Macau to Guangzhou and Nanjing, which between 1644 and 1645, receives the court that runs out after the Manchu invasion.
After the conquest of Beijing by the Manchus, forces loyal to the Ming dynasty once again asked the Portuguese for help and so, in 1646, Nicolau Ferreira joined the last Southern Ming emperor, Yang Li. He reigned for a period of fifteen years, being captured at the beginning of 1662, when the second Qing emperor, Kang Xi, had already been in power for a year.
Macau remained faithful to Ming and good relationships with resistance forces, led since 1644 by Zheng Chenggong. Whether this name tells us little or nothing, the Coxinga is more recognized by those who use history, although both represent the same person.
Coxinga's name was given to Zheng Chenggong by the Dutch, who heard him in Taiwan from the mouth of the inhabitants of Fujian, where the mini dialect and the Kejia of the Hakka people, who called him Kok Sèng Iâ. Coxinga, whose birth name was Zheng Sen and then passed to Zheng Fu Song and only in 1645 moved to Zheng Chenggong, was the son of a former inhabitant of Macao, with the Christian name of Nicholas Gaspar. Coxinga's father, Zheng Zhilong (1604-61), born in Fujian, had spent some time as a young man in Macau, where he was converted and baptized. After recognizing the good money in trade, Nicholas Gaspar again as Zhilong, joined a group of pirates, who attacked mainly Dutch, headquartered in Taiwan and Chinese merchants, still making trade with Japan. And it is in Japanese Mother, who was born Zheng Fu Song's Zheng Sen (1624-83). The father, Zheng Zhilong in 1628 he was dedicated to the attack of Chinese Qing ships, fighting for Ming. Already his son, who had spent his first seven years of life in Japan, then will pick him up to be with him living in Fujian. At 15, Zheng Fu Song studied in Nanjing Guo Zhi Jian and in 1645, at the age of 21, studied at Beijing Guo Zhi Jian.
Zheng Zhilong was the most powerful ally of Emperor Long Wu (1645-1646) with whom he had a great friendship, as he was the one who helped him become emperor. Due to the loyalty of both Zheng Zhilong and his son, the emperor, in Fuzhou, in 1645, attributed his family name, Zhu, to Zheng Fu Song, which thus became the official name of Zhu Chenggong. Although this name means “Success of the Zhu”, in 1646, with the victories of the Qing army in central China and Fujian, Emperor Long Wu was captured and executed on October 6.
The Manchus bought Zheng Zhilong to be at their service and it accepts. His son, angry by the parent having passed to the Manchus hosts, refuses to abandon the Ming and with others from his father's group, ruled Fujian's back since 1646.
Emperor Longwu's younger brother, Zhu Yuyue, escaping by boat from Fuzhou, arrived in Guangzhou where he founded a Ming state, and on December 11, 1646 took the reign title Shao Wu. But after a month, Li Chengdong, a former Southern Ming dynasty commander who led a small group of Qing troops, captured and killed Shao Wu. Little by little, the Qing dynasty occupied all Chinese territory.
The Manchu siege of Guangzhou (Canton), which lasted ten months and ended on November 25, 1650, caused 70,000 deaths. It was a major blow to the Ming resistance which, in the eastern part of China, was confined only to the sea. There, the commanding general of the armada, Zheng Chenggong, was defeated in 1659, in the estuary of the Yangtze River. After this battle, Coxinga returned to Fujian and from there led 25 thousand people to Taiwan, where after a nine-month siege they took the island from the Dutch in April 1661. So many Fujians went to live in Taiwan.
In 1662, Zheng Chenggong died of illness at the age of 38, but Taiwan only came under Qing rule in 1683, when it was conquered from his grandson.

The history of that period, briefly presented here, takes us to Coxinga, a name given by the Dutch based on what they heard the Fujian Chinese call Kok Sèng Iâ.
Analyzing the name Coxinga, which in Mandarin is Guo Xing Ye and in Cantonense, Kok Sèng Iâ, we have for Guo (国) the meaning of country, to Xing (姓) the family name and for Ye (爷), respectful way of calling an elder, an officer, the father or grandfather, the parents or grandparents, linked to the representation of power. This means that Kok Xing represents the nickname of the Emperor of China that was Zhu, in the Ming Dynasty.
In 1645, Emperor Long Wu gave Zheng Fu Song the name Zhu and therefore had the official name Zhu Chenggong, which meant “Successful Ming dynasty”. It was only used in official documents and only the emperor could call it that, as Zhu was the nickname of those who ruled in the Ming dynasty. Normally called Zheng Guoxing and with greater respect Guo
The god Zhu of Xian, which means great immortal Zhu, is also connected with Fujian and both linked to the nickname Zhu, the family name of the ming emperors. Therefore, there seemed to be something to unite them, but because it could not be revealed, due to the Manchu dominion then the enemy of the Han, had to hide Coxinga on the cover of a god to worship him.
Still in the South Ming Dynasty, Emperor Yong Li (24/12/1646-20/1/1647) gave Zheng Chenggong the title of Yan Ping Wang.
Attempts to rehabilitate Ming Dynasty, the Manchus consolidated in power in China, when Zheng Guoxing's descendants wrote to the second Emperor of the Qing Dynasty, Kangxi (1661-1722), asking Zhu Chenggong, who was in Taiwan, for the province of Fujian.
Emperor Kangxi wrote to them saying that, although Zhu Chenggong did not belong to his supporters, he allowed the body to come to Nan An, in Fujian, the birthplace of his father, Zheng Zhilong (1604-1661).
As Zhu Chenggong was against the reigning Qing dynasty, it was only narrated in the book Fujian Tong Zhi in 1737, during the period of Qianlong's reign.
Lastly, our hypothesis of Zhu from Xian being Zhu Chenggong seems to be understood in 1875. Emperor Guangxu of the Qing dynasty, from the title of King Yan Ping awarded to Zhu Chenggong by the Ming Dynasty, passed him to God, Yan Ping Jun Wang. But since it did not belong to the supporters of this dynasty, it was called Zhu da Xian, thus hiding the name of Guo Xing Ye, which had great power. In the same year, the emperor offered the renewal of the Kai Shan Wang Temple, which now has the god Yan Ping Jun Wang.
So we believe, with these small explanations, we can hypothesize that this god, Zhu Da Xian, is the Coxinga deity.  In Macau, we found the statue of Zhu Da Xian in the Pau Kong temple, on Rua da Figueira.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Linguistics | Published study based on a trip to Macau in the 19th century</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/03/linguistica-publicado-estudo-baseado-numa-viagem-a-macau-no-seculo-xix/</link><description>Academic Anabela Leal de Barros has just published a linguistic study that focuses on the trip of Father Miranda e Oliveira, linked to the Congregation of the Mission, to Macau in 1825. With touches of history, details are revealed about the Portuguese of the time and of Macau. The book will be presented at the Macau Scientific and Cultural Center next Wednesday
 
“Journey from Lisbon to Macau – 1825” is the title of the most recent work published by Grão-Falar, written by University of Minho academic Anabela Leal de Barros.
The book makes a critical and interpretative analysis of the Portuguese of the time left in the manuscript of parish priest José Joaquim de Miranda e Oliveira, priest of the Congregation of the Mission. This documentation is kept by the Braga District Archive. However, the work does not just explore the Portuguese of the time, revealing other historical details of Macau, Asia and a sea voyage.
According to Anabela Leal de Barros to HM, the work is “as faithful as possible to the spelling of the manuscript”, to the virtually unknown date.
In this travel diary, Father Miranda e Oliveira “reveals enormous curiosity about all the news and shares with us their names in the languages ​​of the world in which they were baptized, starting with ours”.
This is how it explains situations such as “maritime nausea, a still relatively unknown and strongly invasive reality in vessels” in those days. The priest named or defined "the tones, the tones, the caravels, the beans, the flying, the Albacoras-all sorts of birds and fish that along the trip was admired, fished, or proved," or the "meteorological phenomena with local names-Cacimba, Samatra, Typho." There are also details about "cultural habits such as the chicken, Buio in Indonesian; the Philippines, the Berloches, and the ruling class of the nightgown, as well as to the sômas, Chinese vessels."
The vessel departed from Lisbon in April 1825 and was taking long in the Philippines, arriving in Macao on October 23. The arrival of "to the island of Caó" and the next day "to the College of St. Joseph", the "a city with" a magnificent port of commerce ", situated" in a pleasant wake peninsula ", with" good waters "and" famous buildings to the European ".
Linguistic varieties
In the work edited by Grand Fault there are, for example, "rich stories like that of the St. John's Orion, Frei Junipero's Cauldron or the habit of the marvelors shouting" Refresca S. Lourenço! "For the wind to blow, which is the meaning of" refreshing ".
There are also “allusions to the linguistic variety itself”, as “at various times it refers to foreigners made in Latin, in Indonesian-Holy and Philippine-Spanish territory; the private teaching of English in the Philippines by members of the Spanish Mission Congregation and use, even in Manila, and the variation of the tagal itself, a language in which the priest is concerned to leave the priest. Hail Mary ”.
Before arriving at this travel report, Anabela Leal de Barros was already in the intricacies of investigating this type of manuscripts, coming across the story of another priest, “the greatest Portuguese sinologist, Joaquim Afonso Gonçalves, who had traveled from the same house as Rilhafoles of the Congregation of the Mission to Macau in 1812”.
According to the author, this parish priest “dedicated the last twenty-nine years of his life to the mission of evangelization in China, and in particular to the research and teaching of Chinese at the Colégio de S. José in Macau”. In his entire life, “this Trás-os-Montes native wrote more than five thousand pages of grammars and dictionaries in Portuguese, Latin and Chinese, expressly dedicated to his students at the College, seven printed in his typography and at least two manuscripts”.
Then, in 2017, António Lázaro, from the Department of History of the University of Minho, and director of the Confucius Institute, made the Anabela Leal de Barros available “a list of references to manuscripts of the Braga District Archive on Macau and China”. Then, a "trip" that culminated in the edition of this study began.
“This book is the first result of a project of mine to edit and study unpublished travel literature manuscripts whose main objective is exactly this: to contribute to the appreciation and consolidation of the micro-history of the Discoveries and the memory of history, between the 15th and 19th centuries”.
Accompanied on travel
José Joaquim de Miranda e Oliveira took around seven months to arrive in Macau, leaving Lisbon on April 1, 1825, and arriving in Oriente on October 24 of the same year. He left on the ship Vasco da Gama with three other priests from the congregation: João da França de Castro e Moura, Jerónimo José da Mata and José́ Ferreira da Silva.
According to Anabela Leal de Barros, “the manuscript does not appear to have been cleaned by the author himself, given the type of spelling variations and typos and amendments it presents”, having probably been “translated, to safeguard copies, by a Macanese member of the College, since Macau Portuguese, in the 19th century, had characteristics compatible with certain traits, strange in a priest arrived from Portugal, even how young.”
This travel diary "ends on the day of arrival in Macao, with the brief presentation of the city and the college, being clear the Catholic perspective of the time in the face of the Chinese cult of the ancestors and without getting attention to the mere five thousand Christians in the 40 to 50 thousand inhabitants of the city."
Political hostilities
José Joaquim de Miranda and Oliveira describes how the bishop of Macau did not receive the entourage, which is “enough to lead us to the hostile context in which Lazarists were, defenders of liberalism, which had led Joaquim Afonso Gonçalves, a few years earlier, to take refuge in the Philippines, with the college with two of his masters.”
Furthermore, “along the journey the priest does not fail to narrate all the moments in which he carries out his daily mission, with the administration of the sacraments, the prayer of responsos and the celebration of masses, but above all he notes the notable lack of priests who reveal the Christianized peoples, particularly in Batavia, now Jakarta, where the community of Portuguese origin, of more than a thousand people, had only an old priest.”
These reports also reveal the concern to “remember the first French martyrs of the Congregation in the attempt to evangelize Madagascar and to report the presence of friars and priests from the different congregations, from Cape Verde to the Philippines, where they are recognized as more important for the solidity of Spanish rule than its army”.
According to Anabela Leal de Barros, the report also alluded, in Java, “to the Lutherans and Mohammedans, as well as to the religions of China and, in Manila, to the persecution of Christians (referring to the ‘dinner’, that is, lunch with a Chinese Christian, ‘and as such persecuted’)”.
Miranda and Oliveira will have had “a very diplomatic and convivial conduct, ensuring the establishment and maintenance of cordial relations between the various orders and also with the governors and foreign powers in presence, from the Dutch to the Spanish, who visit in all stops”.
A project ongoing
In these years, it was a dangerous adventure to travel by boat, facing “anthropophagous peoples, piracy, embarking diseases and epidemics”, a “perfectly cinematic view” already described in those Lusíadas, by Luís de Camões. Those who boarded these trips were also alone, "individually and in a small ship just more than a nutshell, in front of an endless sea, for months, when it was common for several passengers not to reach the destination, or not to return a ship from a complete squad."
In the account of Miranda and Oliveira “there is no big news” in view of previous reports, but “we are intended for the main difficulties of the sea journey to Asia in the nineteenth century: the stones existing before the Belém Tower, which caused not a few wrecks; and the sickness, which deserves even definition for the many readers who had never put their feet into a boat, and about which it refers to the captain of the captain Ladies nauseated to climb the awning and work, as it is the best medicine. ”
There is also "the episode of the man lying in the sea of ​​the plow that accompanied them in part of the trip, which they could not save - a death to which everyone was so exposed, as the narrator says." Also noteworthy is another potential period on such trips, "the encounter with ships that, not immediately raising any flag, or raising it without giving true confidence, immediately led to the decision to light the horsepower and open fire, which well translates the dimension of piracy and the fears that imposed."
Essentially, “the main character of sea voyages was the wind”, which led the still “young priest” to “evoke the Camonian verses of the storm twice”.
After the arrival in Macau, Miranda and Oliveira left for his post in Nanjing, "on a comparatively longer trip than the first, received by Christians at cost and secretly." "In the face of persecution," it succumbs "to the dangers and diseases of land at the age of 31, far from all its confreres, as early as November 1, 1828, just two years after the difficult farewell of his spiritual family in Lisbon has described." “The more longevity of their traveling companions, one of which would become Bishop of Macau and the other, of Beijing and Porto,” says Anabela Leal de Barros.</description><pubDate>2025-10-03 01:39:42</pubDate></item><item><title>Ragasa | Sam Hou Fai calls for prevention so that Macau is not left to fate  </title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/23/ragasa-sam-hou-fai-apela-a-prevencao-para-que-macau-nao-fique-entregue-a-sorte/</link><description>The government gathered yesterday to discuss civil protection operations due to Super Typhoon Ragasa. Sam Hou Fai appealed to prevention and Tai Kin IP indicated that casinos will close this afternoon, when the sign 8. CNN was advanced yesterday that, so far, Ragasa is the strongest storm worldwide worldwide
 
After playing on land yesterday on the island of Calyan in the Philippines, Super Typhoon Ragasa advanced through the Southern Sea of ​​China, following a trajectory that Macao authorities estimate to be able to pass on 100 kilometers from the territory. CNN indicated yesterday that so far this was the worst storm this year globally.
Here, the arrival of Super Typhoon led the authorities to gather yesterday at the Civil Protection Operations Center with the Chief Executive. Sam Hoi Fai highlighted the importance of preventive work, noting that, based on the analysis of China's interior authorities, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Ragasa may be the strongest storm to reach the Mangkhut, a possibility that has classified as "very tall".
According to forecasts from the Meteorological and Geophysical Services, Ragasa could pass less than 100 kilometers from Macau between dawn and Wednesday morning.  Sam Hou Fai understands that society and all government services must be alert, and should not just “have a mentality to count on good luck”. “It is often said that ‘Macau is a blessed land’, but this can result in negligence,” he added.
The chief executive explained that Ragasa can cause “Storm appear” phenomena as happened with Mangkhut, giving rise to floods with a maximum of five meters high, at the first floor of the red market, for example.
"The impact could be significant. Preparation was carried out in advance and interdepartmental communication, hoping that the losses could be reduced to the minimum possible, in order to guarantee the safety and stability of the entire population. I seriously appeal to all traders, public and private institutions, and even associations, to do the preparation work against the catastrophe in advance", he warned.
Casinos can close
On the sidelines of the same meeting, the Secretary for Economy and Finance, Tai Kin Ip, said that casinos will close their doors if storm signal 8 is raised, and that authorities will broadcast this scenario in advance, in order to guarantee the personal safety of tourists and employees in the tourism sector.  Wong Sio Chak, Secretary for Security, said that his department met with companies and associations to coordinate street cleaning efforts after the typhoon hit. The secretary also called for the evacuation, first of all, of older residents.
In turn, the head of the Department of Family and Community Services of the Institute of Social Action, Law Lai Peng, pointed out that the body has prepared the launch of level 2 of the emergency evacuation and reception mechanism, and the 17 available emergency reception centers could be open, capable of receiving 24,000 people.
Regarding the Macau Bridge, Raymond Tam, secretary for transport and public works, ensured that the infrastructure will be ended in traffic during the typhoon, although the previous results of tests to storm height have been positive.  The secretary justified the closing of the bridge saying that Ragasa is a “super typhoon” and that took into account the poor condition of infrastructure access.
Raymond Tam also said that if the floods exceed one meter, he will consider the possibility of suspending the electricity supply in the lower areas of the territory, in order to speed up the entire recovery process after the typhoon.
From 3pm this afternoon until tomorrow, between 250 and 280 flights to or from Macau International Airport will be cancelled.  Regarding the return to school, the Secretary for Social Affairs and Culture, O Lam, assured that the Government will analyze the situation based on official data on floods and intense rains that occurred after the typhoon, provided by the Meteorological and Geophysical Services.
The state of schools and roads will also be analyzed to decide that there are conditions for reopening. However, LAM indicated that schools have flexibility to address issues such as students' presence and testing.</description><pubDate>2025-09-23 03:12:24</pubDate></item><item><title>Cinema | Filmes de Hong Kong exibidos pela segunda vez em Lisboa</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/11/cinema-filmes-de-hong-kong-exibidos-pela-segunda-vez-em-lisboa/</link><description>Former resident of Macau Vanessa Pimentel is the artistic director of the second edition of the Hong Kong Film Festival, which will take place from 25 to 28 September at the Ideal Cinema in Lisbon. "Making Waves - Navigators of Hong Kong" will present films like "Papa", the documentary "Four Trails" and the restored copy of "Ah Ying", 1983
 
There are six films, four fiction and two documentaries, which promise to show the best that is being done in Hong Kong cinema. This is the second edition of the Hong Kong Film Festival, taking place in Lisbon, at Cinema Ideal, between the 25th and 28th of September, and which has as artistic director Vanessa Pimentel, also a director, former resident of Macau linked to the production company Blue Lotus Lisboa.
In addition to the screenings, the Portuguese public will be able to see actors, directors and producers from Hong Kong up close, proving that it is possible to establish links between Portugal and different cinematographic environments. This year's poster is made up of “Papa”, a 2024 film by director Philip Yung that will be shown on the 25th, a Thursday. “All Shall Be Well” by Ray Yueng follows; “Never Too Late” by Rikki Choy; “Montages of a Modern Motherhood”, by Chan Oliver Siu Kuen; “Four Trails”, a 2023 documentary directed by Robin Lee. To end the festival in beauty, the restored copy of “Ah Ying”, by Allen Fong, a 1983 film, will be screened.
Vanessa Pimentel explained to HM that the show has “a program that comes from Hong Kong”, where it has been around since 2022. “It is a itinerant program that aims to promote Hong Kong cinema, especially the cinema made by younger filmmakers, although programs always contain more veteran performance works,” he said.
This year, in addition to Lisbon, the Hong Kong Film Festival will visit cities such as Berlin, Paris, Montreal and Udine, in Italy. The event may or may not be linked to Asian film festivals. And it is Vanessa and Blue Lotus' intention to create an Asian film festival in Lisbon, with Macau cinema being part of it.
“In our case, the exhibition is not associated with any festival because it doesn’t exist yet, but I hope to be able to do it,” he said. "I was born and raised in Lisbon, but I come from Macau, and my life in Macau is very linked to all of this. Of course, an Asian film festival in Lisbon has to include Macau, and it couldn't be any other way."
“We do this program with a view to going a little further, and we have our sights set on creating an Asian film festival”, he further said. “We haven't achieved it yet, we have to keep working, but I think we're on the right track.”
Vanessa Pimentel says that, despite no longer living in the territory, she continues to be closely linked to the cinema that takes place here. "I go to Macau at least twice a year, and I have been in constant contact with film people. They are all aware of our program [at the Hong Kong Film Festival] and there is a relationship."
Film to film
We ask the artistic director of the show to talk about what the public can see in the small room of the ideal cinema, which works independently, without connection with large film screenings, which is located in the heart of Bairro Alto.
“Papa”, which opens the festival, is described “as a very strong and good film, which talks about mental health and has an incredible approach”. Vanessa Pimentel describes that this film was awarded in Hong Kong with the distinction of best actor, presenting “a very particular narrative” throughout the plot.
“All Shall Be Well” will be shown again in Lisbon, after its presentation at the International Queer Film Festival, and has already been shown in Berlin. “It’s a very good film, it wasn’t shown again after being in Berlin, I thought it would be interesting to put it on the schedule.”
Vanessa Pimentel also highlights the presentation of the restored copy of "Ah Ying", which belongs "to the new place of Hong Kong cinema", which shows a story that wanders incessantly between "fiction and documentary." It is a "very interesting movie in which the story is inspired by the story of the actress's own [Hui So Ying] who plays him."
The second Hong Kong cinema show will be attended by Hui So Ying. "It's a great honor because the actress will make a giant trip. She is already some age, but has soon came to come. It will be very interesting to have a movie inspired by her life and count on her presence to share with us this moment," said Vanessa Pimentel.
Little known paths
Another highlight of the Film Show is the exhibition of the documentary “Four Trails”, which has been “a ticket phenomenon”. It is a movie about the 298-kilometer race for the four best known Hong Kong tracks.
The film portrays a daily reality "from the Hong Kong regions that almost no one knows." "It's a movie about the challenge of sports and people who, not being professional sportsmen, sign up and run, training all year long. It's interesting to see the challenge they propose and how they live," said Vanessa Pimentel, who also highlights "Never Too Late", "A movie about our relationship with the environment." Here one can glimpse "a very Asian and Chinese side of this perspective of what the environment is and what our relationship with nature is like."
Then there is “Montage of a Modern Motherhood”, a film that “has been playing a lot at festivals”. “It's a film that has a very interesting side, about motherhood and a perspective that, perhaps, may not be so romantic, about the idea that motherhood is not just a bed of roses, having some downside”, says Vanessa Pimentel.
Here the artistic director of the show warns that the film “can challenge a little,” playing “in things that concern everyone, like this thing of family tradition and sharing in motherhood and paternity”.
Vanessa Pimentel assures that the first edition of the show was a success, with "about a thousand people going to the cinema in four days." "It was surprising to see a lot of new people, older and also many people of Chinese origin, that is, children of immigrants, eventually a second generation, who were born in Lisbon, speak Portuguese and live here with families. We had sessions with many Chinese to ask questions at the end of the sessions and had never seen it in Lisbon," he said.
The Hong Kong Film Festival also ends up becoming part of the itinerary of spectators who usually go to festivals. "We also have a very interesting audience, made up of people who like cinema and attend other festivals. It is not common to see a program that, in Lisbon, focuses on Asian cinema. We have Doc Lisboa, or Indie, but in their programming the proportion of this cinema is much smaller. I am not making a criticism here, I think that is perfectly normal", said Vanessa Pimentel.
Between the Hong Kong Film Festival and the future festival, the person responsible says there is “exhibition space” in Lisbon and Portugal, due to the fact that Asian cinema is “very vast and rich, with a very high quantity and quality ratio”.</description><pubDate>2025-09-11 23:54:29</pubDate></item><item><title>Physics | Nobel Prize for Macroscopic Quantum Mechanical Tunneling</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/07/fisica-nobel-para-tunelamento-mecanico-quantico-macroscopico/</link><description>The Nobel Prize for Physics was awarded to John Clarke, Michel H. Devoret and John M. Martinis “by the discovery of macroscopic quantum mechanical tunneling and the quantization of energy in an electrical circuit,” the Swedish Sciences actual academy announced yesterday.
"An important question in physics is the maximum size of a system capable of demonstrating the effects of quantum mechanics. This year's Nobel Prize laureates carried out experiments with an electrical circuit in which they demonstrated both quantum tunneling and quantized energy levels in a system large enough to be held in the hand", explains the Swedish Academy of Sciences in a statement published on its website.
The British John Clarke carried out his research at the University of California, Berkeley, USA; the American John Martinis at the University of California, Santa Barbara; and the Frenchman Michel Devoret at Yale University and also in California, Santa Barbara.
According to academia, quantum mechanics allows a particle to directly cross a barrier, through a process called tunneling. When a large number of particles are involved, quantum effects usually become negligible. The experiments of the now distinguished scientists demonstrated that quantum properties can be made concrete on a macroscopic scale.
"It is wonderful to be able to celebrate the way in which quantum mechanics, more than a century old, continues to offer new surprises. It is also extremely useful, as it is the basis of all digital technology", said the chairman of the Nobel Committee for Physics, Olle Eriksson, quoted in the statement.
The Swedish Academy says that transistors in computer microchips are an example of consolidated quantum technology. Scientists today distinguished with the Nobel Prize sharing a prize of 11 million Swedish crowns (almost one million euros).</description><pubDate>2025-10-07 23:15:50</pubDate></item><item><title>Visit | Montenegro believes in a “more agile” visa regime for Portuguese people</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/10/visita-montenegro-acredita-em-regime-de-vistos-mais-agil-para-portugueses/</link><description>On a visit to Macau, which lasted just a few hours, the leader of the Portuguese Government expressed confidence in a new regime to speed up the arrival of Portuguese people to Macau. Montenegro also praised the development of the territory and spoke of a “very positive” phase in relations between Portugal and Macau
 
The Prime Minister of Portugal, Luís Montenegro, believes that the Macao SAR will create a “more agile” visa regime for Portuguese citizens. The statements were made to journalists yesterday, when Montenegro was confronted with the fact that the Macao SAR had eliminated the attribution of a preferential regime for Portuguese citizens in accessing the Resident Identity Card.
According to the Portuguese politician, the matter was discussed yesterday morning, in a meeting with the Chief Executive, which took place before the visit to the Portuguese School of Macau.
“We are concerned about the residence visas of all those [Portuguese] who head to this territory with the desire to work and help Macanese institutions to be able to carry out their work”, acknowledged the leader of the Government of Portugal. “Our staff are in contact and it was agreed to continue what had already started with the visit of the Minister of State and Foreign Affairs, last March, […] I believe that things will be on track so that we can have the consecration of a more agile, easier, more expeditious regime, and, therefore, so that we can overcome this constraint that we know exists”, he added.
When asked if the regime would be the same as applied before the Ho Iat Seng government propose its elimination, approved by the Legislative Assembly, Montenegro refused to enter details. "I cannot now be entering this detail. What we want, from the point of view of the authorities on both sides, is that all this dynamic is as easy as possible and, therefore, that the rules are fast and also so as not to disagree with this [Portuguese Portuguese] mobility that is positive mobility," he said.
Positive phase of cooperation
Montenegro also considered that he felt like the side of Macau to continue to receive Portuguese. "I believe yes [that there is a desire to have Portuguese in Macau], I think it was very clear from the conversation we had," he said.
Regarding relations between Portugal and Macau, Montenegro considered that they are going through “a very positive phase” of cooperation, in terms of economic, social, cultural and historical and entity aspects.
"We have registered a very strong commitment of the Macao Executive in the preservation of architectural heritage, of the historical heritage, which is also part of what is the identity of Macao," he said. "We want, in fact, that there will be compliance with a mutual cooperation relationship, which is based on the documents that have presided over the transition […] and that attributes responsibilities to all. And we will be up to our [responsibilities] and, of course, to request compliance with others," he added.
Some obstacles
Regarding the situation of Macao, Montenegro claimed to be “a good example”, although with some “obstacles” and “tensions”, which explained to be normal of these kinds of regions.
“I think that overall this is a good example of how it was possible to organize a transition process, safeguard the most relevant interests present and contribute to the economic and social development of this territory”, said the Prime Minister of Portugal. The numbers, although they do not express everything, are a good instrument for us to assess the economic and social success of this journey and this process, which is not free from tensions, is not free from obstacles. It's like all processes that involve changes, something that is never truly finished and that pushes us to be proactive", he said. The leader of the Government of Portugal did not specify the "obstacles" or the "tensions".
Off the agenda
Speaking to journalists, Montenegro also addressed the case of the detention of former deputy Au Kam San, who also has Portuguese nationality. The Prime Minister revealed that the case was not part of the schedule of this trip and must be treated with discretion. "It was not the subject of our conversation, but it is a subject, this and others, which we follow and that we promote with the necessary description, because there are some subjects that also deserve some modesty in treatment. And this is one of them," he explained.
Montenegro also refused to explain whether there was any movement to support the detainee. "We are not discussing this case, I will not detail it. In this context of the visit, what I want to reiterate is our firm intention to take our cooperative relationship further at the most varied levels and the preservation of a connection that has borne fruit, despite also having its problems", he explained.
Sam Hou Fai guarantees Portuguese rights
The Chief Executive stated that the Government of Macau attaches great importance to the rights and traditions of Portuguese residents in the territory. Sam Hou Fai's statements were made yesterday morning, when he received Luís Montenegro, according to the Social Communication Office (GCS).
In a press release, it is reported that the representative of the MSAR stressed "that the government of MSAR has always attributed, throughout its development, great importance to the protection and respect for the rights, customs and cultural traditions of the Portuguese residents of Macao."
The government leader also associated the Portuguese traditions with the “teaching and diffusion of the Portuguese language”, which indicated to be the target of a proactive promotion by the executive.
The Government leader also “highlighted that the friendship between the Chinese and Portuguese people is long and lasting, and the two countries have established, for 20 years, a more comprehensive strategic partnership, with special emphasis on taking advantage of the Macau platform to promote Sino-Portuguese exchange and cooperation”.
In response, GCS indicates that Montenegro defended the implementation of the principle a country, two systems. "Portuguese Prime Minister Luís Montenegro praised the successful implementation of the principle" a country, two systems "in Macao and the huge advances made since its return to the country. He also praised the preservation of cultural diversity in Macao, including Portuguese culture," was reported.
Security | Visit of Montenegro with great fanfare
Unlike the visits of other Portuguese leaders to Macau, as happened with Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, in 2019, Luís Montenegro's visit was marked by a large security apparatus, which was guaranteed by a team of Chinese security guards and agents, as well as Macao SAR forces. Before the Prime Minister of Portugal arrived at the Portuguese School of Macau (EPM), everyone who wanted to be inside the institution had to be searched. Journalists or image reporters who had not registered in advance were also unable to enter.
Inside the institution there was also a dog accompanying one of the agents. Outside the school, when the car that carried Montenegro arrived, police warded the passers -by and prevented the passage. During the stop of the Montenegro car, the car was being protected by a higher van that stopped next to it to block one of the angles of vision. After passing the EPM, the area between the consulate of Portugal and the Sé Zone was full of security agents.
Culture | Montenegro highlights Portuguese “values”
During his reception speech to the Portuguese community, Luís Montenegro highlighted the “values” brought by the community in Macau, and mainly the spread of the language.
"I mean that we have attributed special importance to those who are here, in the most varied affinities, that bring the values ​​of Portugal, which bring and transport and preserve the Portuguese culture and tradition, which are therefore a link between our countries and our peoples," he said.
The official also said that the community “through work” can “take further” the “preservation of the language”, which he considered to be an “irreplaceable identity factor and also as a factor of rapprochement”. On the economic side, Montenegro considered that the community contributes to the common objective of building “prosperous societies”, with “opportunities for all” and that promotes “equality and social justice”. The Prime Minister also promised to support the community: “Count on the Government of Portugal, we also count on you a lot”, he stated.</description><pubDate>2025-09-10 23:01:31</pubDate></item><item><title>China | Montenegro expects “close relationship” fruits with Russia</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/09/china-montenegro-espera-frutos-de-relacao-proxima-com-a-russia/</link><description>The Portuguese Prime Minister said yesterday, in a meeting with President Xi Jinping, that he hopes that the “close relationship” between China and Russia will help to reach a peace agreement in Ukraine.

Luís Montenegro made these statements at the beginning of the first day of his official visit to China, during the meeting with Xi Jinping, of which journalists were only able to record the first three minutes. “I cannot fail, on behalf of the Government of Portugal, to convey to Mr. President that we greatly count on your contribution and the close relationship that China maintains with the Russian Federation so that we can, as quickly as possible, build a fair and lasting peace in Ukraine”, he stated.
Previously, Montenegro highlighted that, in the international context, Portugal and China have maintained “on many occasions a basis of cooperation and shared values”. “China has a fundamental role in the global and international context, it is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council and we hope for your contribution so that we can build bridges between peoples, bring together some of those who are in conflict, promote peace, promote multilateralism, promote respect for human rights”, stated the Portuguese politician.
Montenegro said he was confident that the appeal he addressed to the president of China about the Russian-Utrinia conflict will be heard. "I believe that the appeal, coming from a friendly country, coming from a European Union (EU) country, coming from a country, such as Mr. President XI Jinping also emphasized, who has an identity of values ​​and route, will not fall into a rotor bag," he said.
Saying not being able to answer for the president of China, Montenegro has manifested convinced that Portugal has done what is required for this conflict.
"My conviction is that, to our dimension and without any kind of pretentiousness, we do what is required to a nation with history and the international respectability that Portugal has. We are builders of bridges, we are protagonists of the approach between peoples, we are advocates of peace, defenders of values, respect for people's rights," he said.
Montenegro considered that, at the meeting with Xi Jinping, he was limited to “being frank, loyal and direct in the appeal” so that China's ability to influence and “bring practical results” to Ukraine.
Luís Montenegro also mentioned that “it is very tasteful” that he makes this official visit to China, after brief statements by Chinese President Xi Jinping.
"As Mr. President said, Portugal and China have a relationship founded on a story that has shared with various times in common, but also a relationship facing the future. I remember Mr. President's visit to Portugal for seven years and I also want to convey the greetings of Mr. President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa," he said.
Good friends
The Portuguese Prime Minister expressed agreement with the words of Xi Jinping about how the transition from the administration of Macao de Portugal to China in 1999 took place.
"We had in the transition from Macau a good expression of the way we were able to converge and we managed to ensure the cultural identity and the relationship between the special administrative region of Macau, with Portugal and with China," he said.
At yesterday's meeting, Xi Jinping said that “Portugal is a good friend of China”, saying that it is “a pleasure” to meet the Prime Minister, Luís Montenegro.
“Welcome on the visit to China. I remember that in 2018 I made a state visit to Portugal, which left me a beautiful impression, and deep,” he said, taking the opportunity to ask Montenegro to transmit to the Portuguese head of state, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, “sincere greetings”, according to the simultaneous translation into Portuguese of his statements.
The Chinese president stressed that China and Portugal "are countries with deep history, and the two peoples have idiosyncrasy, openness, inclusion, progress and autonomy", arguing that "Portugal plays an important and unique role on the international stage."
Xi Jinping also highlighted “the important role” played by three former Portuguese prime ministers in international and regional affairs.
"The Secretary General of the United Nations, António Guterres, the president of the European Council, António Costa, and the former president of the European Commission Durão Barroso. I have good relations with them," he said.
In the brief statement, the Chinese president stated that "Portugal is a good friend of China" and considered that both countries have "properly resolved" the issue of Macao through friendly negotiations. "
“Portugal was also the first country in Western Europe to sign acts of cooperation with China under the ‘One Belt, One Route’ initiative, and the first country in the Euro Zone to issue bonds” in Chinese currency, he said.
A little help in the crisis
In turn, Luís Montenegro thanked China's support to Portugal during the period of the financial crisis. "At the level of our bilateral economic cooperation, it is my duty to tell you that we do not forget, on the contrary, we have very well present and respect the bet that China has developed in the Portuguese economy, in one of the most critical moments of our country, when the financial crisis," he said.
As had been highlighted moments before by the President of the People's Republic of China, Montenegro also considered that, in recent years, the two countries have strengthened ties “in various sectors of the economy, from energy to banking, from health to water supply”. “Our conviction is that we can continue to follow this path based on trust,” said the prime minister.
Luís Montenegro landed in Beijing early Monday afternoon, closed to the media, and did not have any public agenda that day. The prime minister's official agenda began yesterday morning with a ceremony of deposition of a wreath at the monument to the people of the people, in Tiananmen Square, where he was accompanied by his wife and three ministers who are part of this visit: Paulo Rangel, Minister of State and Foreign Affairs, Manuel Castro Almeida, Minister of Economics and Territorial Cohesion, and Graça Carvalho, Minister of Environment and Energy.
In addition to the meeting with XI Jinping, Luís Montenegro met first with the president of the China National Popular Assembly, Zhao Leji.
At the end of the afternoon, the head of the Portuguese Government had a working meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Li Qiang, also at the Grand Palace of the People, and then continued on to Macau, where he only has an agenda today in the morning. Tomorrow and Friday, Montenegro will make an official visit to Japan, with visits to Tokyo and Osaka.
Pilfe
At HM, analyst Tiago André Lopes, an auxiliary professor responsible for Asia Study at Lusíada do Porto University, argued that “Lisbon and Beijing share quite different views regarding international conflicts”. It should be noted that Montenegro visits China when they spend a few days about the summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, which took place in the Chinese town of Tianjin, and where conflicts were discussed Gaza or Russia-Ucrania.
"We can see that Lisbon is distinctive in the Palestinian issue, looking little uncomfortable with the barbarism that is slaughtered over the Palestinians; while China positions itself in a different spectrum of Portugal in the Ukraine War. What does this tell us? The trip will be very focused on the dimension of economic diplomacy and much less in the so -called traditional diplomacy," said the analyst.
Tiago André Lopes considers that Portugal could take advantage of this trip through Asia "to self-admit some of the dependence on the Brussels-Washington axis and gain space for maneuver by integrating Beijing's Force," although "the current government bets on an atlanticism-Europeist without global ambitions."
Asked about the issue of 5G, which has shaped the Portugal-China relationship in recent months, Tiago André Lopes understands that Montenegro's trip to Beijing serves to “minimize the impact” of this issue and “try to boost economic cooperation between the two countries”.
"An element that could help measure the pulse of the visit of the Prime Minister of Portugal will be the signing of documents. Will Memoranda of Understanding (which are generally not binding), or Commercial Agreements be signed? Or just vague press releases? This will be the best barometer, in addition to the circumstantial words that will naturally be uttered", he highlighted.
Investments | Montenegro says Portugal is “reliable and confident”
Luís Montenegro said yesterday that during the official visit to China and then Japan, he wants to bring the message that Portugal “is a reliable and confident country” for economic investments.
According to the prime minister, the program “brings together the opportunity for the Portuguese prime minister to talk and interact directly with the president of the National Assembly of the People's Republic of China, with the President of the Republic, with the prime minister”.
"At the same time that the Minister of State and Foreign Affairs, the Minister of Economy and the Minister of Environment and Energy interact bilaterally with their counterparts and also with entrepreneurs and Chinese companies that operate in Portugal and with Portuguese companies operating in China," he added.
For Montenegro, the fact that the visits are being made “with some compression in terms of durability” - four days divided between China and Japan - should be seen from another perspective.
“It's just the record that we are capable of doing all this simultaneously, we are capable of leaving from here to Macau, we are capable of leaving Macau for Tokyo and for us to be able, in this geographical area, to bring the message that Portugal is a confident country, it is a trustworthy country, it is a country worth looking at and that also looks at the world”, he defended.
Montenegro also pointed out that Portugal is already “enjoying several investments that originate in China and have been levers for the transformation and economic development of Portugal”.
“It is our intention to contribute by coming here so that we can also open doors so that more Portuguese companies can find the destination of their products in the Chinese market and, through this, also increase our export share to this geography”, he stated.

In a report by Lusa agency, there are details of the “MPOP” style of the election campaign, with a lot of music and requests for financial support to the mixture
 
Crowded audience, all dressed in the gowns on the list with which they compete for the elections on the 14th; Chinese drums next to the stage and above candidates and supporters, various microphones, music and choreography. This is the campaign for Macao legislatures, in a style that can be called "MPOP".
The microphones change hands, reproducing the same slogans with different voices, in short phrases and high scales, which almost all end in a party instruction. At this point, the drums are heard loudly and the audience reproduces the last note heard, while at the same time loudly shaking the political merchandise given to them at the beginning of the rally: plastic hands to clap, list numbers with LED lights, malleable straws, fans, all with the same strong color.
Campaign actions in Macao, restricted to the last two weeks before legislative elections for the local parliament, do not contain speeches in the events of the six lists that will elect 14 of the 33 deputies to the Legislative Assembly (AL).
The remaining 12 candidates are chosen through associations, via indirect suffrage, and there are still seven deputies appointed by the Chief Executive, in this case Sam Hou Fai.
Describing campaign events is like an exercise in similarity to musical shows, namely the “kpop” genre, among the lists led by younger candidates, or the “old-style pop” genre, as if it were figures like Elvis or Olivia Newton John resurrected.
The concentrations are made up of members of the lists and the people mobilized by them, both dressed in the same uniforms. But there are no politicians on the stages and no spectators listening to them.
In these events, politicians seem to be assumed as artists, but there are no audiences, because they seem to be part of the choreography. Finally, there are very few people besides and each other, that is, people watching who are not directly linked to the lists.
Abstention is the great ghost that hangs over the whole process, which takes place for the first time under the framework of the new Electoral Law of April 2024, which aims to "reinforce the implementation of the" Macao Macao governed by Patriotas "principle.
Os desafios económicos
Ilia Chou, 40, an employee of the financial sector, was with a child and a friend watching one of these rallies and seemed to be one of those few people present not involved in the campaign list. He agreed to talk to Lusa after he had spoken to another microphone.
Ilia was attracted to the list there because those people have a “young and community aspect” and are concerned with “offering prospects for progress” to young people. "Given the current challenging economic climate, we face a critical issue: our young people now have fewer options than before. This specific aspect is what attracts me most to this initiative," he said.
But "other groups also talk about youth and employment, what are the differences? Why do you like this group in particular?", we asked. "I don't know them [the other groups]. Well, I was attracted by the charming characters on this list", he replied. “I think these four characters are quite charming”, added Ilia, they talk about “love, the title is very charming, and the color is pink, it looks very welcoming”.
Political programs are, without exception, lists of requests to an “provider father”, incarnated by the executive, who has the responsibility of managing a comfortable and growing financial reserve, fueled by taxes paid by the six game dealers in Macao.
The numbers show this comfort. In August, Macau's Financial Reserve, which was constantly growing throughout the first half of the year, reached 647.3 billion patacas, and was invested in subcontracted investments, deposits, current accounts, and credit securities.
The lists want it to also be applied to initiatives such as the creation of a development fund and the reversion of 10 percent of profits for distribution to all citizens, they want an increase in pensions or more money in consumption coupons, subsidies and maternity leaves, they want more social housing, they want free healthcare and higher education, or they simply demand a greater annual distribution of money.
Pasta
There are also other demands, such as the promotion of economic diversification, measures to support the transformation and modernization of Small and Medium-sized Companies or the development of smart cities, but the most significant part of the programs on the six lists points directly to the distribution of money by the Government, in the most varied forms.
The other recipients of the requests are the game dealers, to which the candidates go with warnings that they are determined to defend the priority of residents in access to the best paid jobs.
Macao's unemployment rate is 2 percent and permanent residents at 2.6 percent. That is, technically, Macau has full employment. However, as Lusa told a candidate, the employment issue has nothing to do with statistics, it just holds on with "perception."
And in fact the issue of unemployment, especially for those who have just graduated, is a pressing issue for political programs, as HM indicated. This is the case of the first list to compete for direct suffrage, the “Association of United Citizens of Macau”, which is led by Song Pek Kei, a deputy linked to the Fujian community, who took his first steps in politics alongside businessman Chan Meng Kam.
The list led by the deputy calls, for example, for the creation of a quota for residents in all professional areas, “support for employment and local businesses”, and the guarantee that “85 percent, or more, of employees are local residents”.
The Nova Esperança list, led by José Pereira Coutinho, and one of the few Macanese participants in these elections, calls for “jobs for all”, a slogan present in its electoral program which promises “employment priority for permanent residents of Macau in gaming concessionaires”.
Who goes out to their
List campaigns for indirect suffrage may seem more discreet, but that doesn't mean there is no news. After investing in Global Media, Portugal, and betting on the real estate area, in Porto, Kevin Ho, the nephew of the first chief executive, Edmund Ho, bet on local politics, when entering the list “Union of Macao Business Interests”, led by José Chui Sa Peng. Also he is familiar, in this case, from a previous head of the Executive of MSAR, Chui Sai On, already removed from the political scene.
In the case of these lists, representing the sectors of work, culture, education or business interests, employment is a concern, but what the candidates are looking for is a Government that knows how to support companies and, ultimately, diversify the economy.
Thus, the “Union of Business Interests of Macau” advocates “support for digital and high-technology transformation to modernize traditional industries and develop emerging sectors”. The candidates promise to play the role of intermediaries between those who face difficulties in maintaining themselves in this business fabric and the Executive, by “listening carefully to the difficulties and demands of the commercial and financial industries, especially small and medium-sized companies”. The names of the seven nominated deputies are not yet known, as the choice of the Chief Executive is usually only made public after the elections.

TDM advances that there were at least 40 suicides between April and October, but the actual number should be higher than the
 
The Health Services (SS) stopped publishing data on the number of suicides, a statistic that used to be released quarterly. The data withholding comes after in 2024 the number of suicides was the highest ever in the territory.
In addition to not having published the data for the second quarter, which, taking the previous year as a reference, should have been published in August, the SS also ignored several requests made by Canal Macau regarding the compilation of this statistics.
The public broadcaster reveals that since April has filed several requests to the SS to realize the reasons for the delay in disclosure of the data, but for months that is ignored by the body led by Alvis Lo. The new tendency to deal with health statistics also happened a few months after Sam Hou Fai assumed the position of Chief Executive. This is a totally different stance from that adopted by its predecessors, when the numbers were considered public information.
In the first quarter of the year, 18 cases of suicide were reported, which appeared to indicate a reduction of four incidents compared to the period between January and March 2024.
That year, a total of 90 suicides were recorded, the highest number since 2003. However, since 2021 there has been a successive increase in the annual number of suicides, without the trend being reversed, despite the authorities regularly promising to pay attention to the situation.
About 40 deaths
Given the absence of statistics, the Macao channel turned to messages shared by the Judiciary Police to try to calculate the number of suicides.
PJ messages present challenges in collecting information because they often classify cases simply as “discovery of a corpse” without suspected signs of crime, which does not always allow for the distinction between suicide or a death linked to the victim's health conditions.
Despite these challenges, the Macao channel has accounted for the messages in which it was clear that the deaths were due to suicide cases and indicates that from April to October there have been at least 40 people to put an end to life. However, the actual number should be higher.
The ages of the victims were not determined by the station, because the PJ failed to disclose the ages, using, instead of generic descriptions, such as middle age, a term that can cover people over 30 and up to 65 years. Still, TDM said most of the victims were "middle age". There were 10 cases with young people and one case with a minor. Among the suicide victims, there are also some cases of elderly.

The streets of the ZAPE and NAPE areas, once lively with players, are becoming deserted. "The pawnshops in these areas will simply close or move. I don't see any other solution," the president of the General Association of Pawnbrokers of Macau, Alexander Wai Kai Leung, told Lusa.
It is expected that at least nine of the city's 11 satellite casinos cease operations by December 31, a period of a period of grace period of three years granted to agreements between the operators of the game spaces and the dealers under which they operated.
Among the satellite casinos located in the areas of Zape and NAPE are the Casa Real, Fortune, Kam Pek, Landmark, Legend Palace and Waldo. Lusa tried to contact the hotels that houses these spaces, but none of its employees could indicate what the future of the place will be after closing. Grand Emperor serves as an example: the casino has closed three years ago and the facilities remain empty to this day.
"If the casinos close, the impact on us is significant. Our livelihood depends on players," Leung said, also expressing the hope that the satellite casinos will remain open.
Letter of intent
The Directorate of Tourism Services (STD) told Lusa that it “intends to attract visitors” to the Zape area to support local commerce. Measurements for the doing include events, improvement of the urban landscape and the offer of special packages directed to concert spectators, which include 'vouchers' of purchases and museum tickets.
Businesspeople like Leong remain skeptical, however. The president of the pawnshops association questions these measures, considering them useless for pawnshops.
"Our industry depends on players as its main customers. They can attract people to dine on the street, but I don't see how that benefits us," he said, adding that he feels that the sector has been "marginalized by the authorities, who consider the business 'high risk' for money laundering." According to the association, there are around 25 pawnshops in the ZAPE and NAPE area.
The threat extends beyond pawnshops. Store windows like the In Vo Chong Group display shark fins, ‘premium whiskey’ and Moutai, captivating a wealthy clientele.
Owner, Lok Chi Lai, Deputy Secretary General of the Hong Kong and Macau Swallow Nests Association, recognizes government efforts to increase the influx of people other than gaming space regulars. However, he told Lusa, these initiatives “cannot attract high range customers to consume”, only attract “young people to take photographs”, clarifying that there are more than 40 establishments of this kind in both areas of the city.
"Those who come to play are willing to buy luxury goods at higher prices to offer. Without these customers, the future doesn't look so laughing," Lok said. On the other hand, he added, promoting hotel offer located at Zape and Nape is also ineffective because "the hotels here are old (…), and high -end customers prefer to stay in five -star hotels in Cotai."</description><pubDate>2025-10-06 05:12:56</pubDate></item><item><title>AMCM | Macao and Cape Verde regulators reinforce cooperation</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/06/amcm-reguladores-de-macau-e-cabo-verde-reforcam-cooperacao/</link><description>The new agreement was signed on Thursday and announced the following day. The signing took place during the 12th edition of the Meeting of Governors of the Central Banks of Portuguese-speaking Countries, in the City of Praia
 
The Monetary Authority of Macao (AMCM) has announced that it signed a new agreement to “deepen cooperation” in matters in financial supervision with the Cape Verde Central Bank. The financial regulator said the protocol with the Cape Verde bank covers the “fight against the laundering of capital and the financing of terrorism, technical cooperation, the formation of professional staff”.
According to a statement, the agreement also covers “supervision and exchange relating to emerging financial services, with the aim of jointly safeguarding the security and stability of the respective financial systems”. The document was signed on Thursday, during the 12th edition of the Meeting of Governors of the Central Banks of Portuguese-Speaking Countries, held in the capital of Cape Verde, Praia.
The meeting, which took place behind closed doors, included interventions by governors and representatives of the central banks of Angola, Brazil, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Equatorial Guinea, Mozambique, Portugal, São Tomé and Príncipe, and Timor-Leste as well as the Central Bank of West African States and the Bank of Central African States.
“This initiative symbolizes a deepening of cooperation and exchange between the two institutions in the field of financial supervision,” added AMCM. “This new agreement particularly focuses on collaboration in matters of prudential supervision, establishing a specific framework for cooperation between AMCM and Banco de Cabo Verde,” added the regulator.
Since 1999
AMCM signed the first cooperation and technical assistance agreement with the Cape Verde Bank in 1999. In September 2024, during the second conference of the central banks and the financial areas between China and the Portuguese -speaking countries, which took place in Macao, Macau's financial regulator announced that it would update the protocol with the homologous institution of Cape Verde.
AMCM has already signed bilateral cooperation agreements with 12 financial supervisory authorities from eight Portuguese-speaking countries.</description><pubDate>2025-10-06 05:11:46</pubDate></item><item><title>Game | Revenue rises 6% in September despite super typhoon</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/03/jogo-receitas-sobem-6-em-setembro-apesar-de-super-tufao/</link><description>Macau casino revenues rose 6 percent in September compared to the same period in 2024, despite the temporary closure due to super typhoon Ragasa. Still, last month was the second weakest this year
 
The game sector raised 18.3 billion Patacas last month, another 6 percent of September last year. The registration represented the second lowest monthly amount of 2025, revealed the Macao Game Inspection and Game Coordination Directorate.
Still, revenues have increased in annual terms, despite the passage of Ragasa, which led the authorities of the Chinese semi -autonomous region to end the casinos for 33 hours. Operators will have lost 880 million patacas in revenues, almost 5 percent from September, estimated Jeffrey Kiang, analyst at CLSA consultant, quoted by the Ggraia news portal.
The amount recorded in September represents 82.8 percent of the same month of 2019, when Macao casinos had revenues of 22.1 billion patacas.
In relation to the previous month, the territory's casinos collected 17.5 percent less gross revenue. However, it is worth mentioning that in August this year, the Macau gaming industry recorded the best monthly performance in January 2020, with gross revenues of around 22.16 billion patacas.
Widen
In terms of accumulated gross revenue, the first nine months of 2025 recorded an increase of 7.1 percent over the same period last year, reaching 181.3 billion patacas. Macao closed 2024 with total revenues of 226.8 billion patacas, more 23.9 percent than the previous year.
The Macao government predicted, in the initial budget for 2025, that the year would close with total revenues of 240 billion patacas, which would represent a 6 percent increase compared to last year. But on June 11, the Legislative Assembly approved a new budget, proposed by the executive, which reduces the forecast for public revenues by 4.56 billion.
Secretary for Economics and Finance, Anton Tai Kin IP, admitted to the deputies that the cut is due to the fact that the game's gross gross revenues in the first trimester of 2025 "was" slightly below planned.

The document points out that since 2021 there have been no convictions of traffickers, while the Executive denounces prejudice and “severe interference and expressed in the internal affairs of the MSAR”
 
"This 'report' denigrates the Macao SAR and contains defamatory and arbitrary statements regarding the notable fruits obtained by the Macao SAR, which is why it has no credibility. The USA has produced, year after year, reports with false information regarding the issues of human trafficking, in an attempt to create confusion in international society, constituting a serious and express interference in the internal affairs of the SAR. For these reasons, the authorities security officers vehemently repudiate this “report” and strongly demonstrate their dissatisfaction”. This is how the Government of Sam Hou Fai reacted to yet another report prepared by the US State Department on human trafficking, published on Monday.
The local Executive's strong opposition was made public on Tuesday at the end of the day, with the Government stating that the document “is full of political prejudices and subjective judgments, in addition to ignoring objective facts”.
The fact, highlighted by the department led by Marco Rubio, that Macau rarely convicts suspects involved in human trafficking, or identifies victims, is justified by the “joint efforts” of the Government and Macau society. “Crimes related to human trafficking have always recorded a low percentage or an almost zero percentage, which shows that Macau is one of the safest cities in the world”, highlights the Government.
The value of the word
The organism that belongs to the Trump administration acknowledges that the Macao government "has taken a few steps to combat human trafficking, namely investigating potential affairs, training staff and organizing seminars in schools to increase awareness for the subject." However, “general efforts to apply the law against trafficking and protection to victims remained inappropriate”, is indicated.
The report also highlights that Macao SAR authorities have in the past considered that the victim's initial consent or “voluntary association” with a trafficker constituted sufficient evidence to demonstrate that a trafficking crime had not occurred.” This stance, according to the State Department, causes authorities to treat trafficking cases like other crimes and weakens efforts to identify victims.
Reports from observers who pointed out that the lack of comprehensive legislation against trafficking in China negatively affected the ability of Macau authorities to conduct joint operations are also highlighted, something that caused a “disproportionate impact” on the fight against human trafficking, since the “victims exploited in Macau were predominantly from Mainland China”.</description><pubDate>2025-10-03 01:56:41</pubDate></item><item><title>Administration | Johnson Ian advocates new mindset</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/03/administracao-johnson-ian-defende-nova-mentalidade/</link><description>Former candidate for the Legislative Assembly, Johnson Ian, argues that the main problem of Public Administration will not be resolved with government reform.

The Chief Executive plans to make an official visit to Portugal in the first half of next year, after being postponed from September. The target date was set on Wednesday, on the sidelines of the ceremonies marking the 76th anniversary of the establishment of the People's Republic of China.
"I have communicated with Prime Minister Montenegro, and when he came to Macau told him that my wish was that my first visit abroad would be to Portugal," said Sam Hou Fai, according to Macau channel. "Now we are preparing the new lines of government action, but, I hope the visit can be made in the beginning of next year. Only then will we plan the visits to other countries," he added.
Governing lines of action should be presented at the Legislative Assembly from November, until December, and constitute the governance plan for next year.
The Chief Executive also highlighted the importance of visiting the MSAR, as it consider that it is a way to promote development. "[The trip] is a very important action for our development and I am convinced that it can be held in the first half of next year," he said.
Visit postponed
Initially, Sam Hou Fai's official visit to Portugal, which included a visit to Spain, was scheduled for the period between 16 and 23 September.
However, just a few days before the trip, the Executive announced the postponement, without an official justification or new date being given. “The visit has been postponed and there is still no date for when it will take place”, said a source from the Social Communication Office (GCS) at the time, cited by Agência Lusa.
However, the platform newspaper revealed that the postponement of the trip will have been related to the Portuguese Prime Minister's agenda. Between September 9 and 12, Luís Montenegro visited China and Japan, and the itinerary program in the Japanese country will have led the Portuguese authorities to consider that it would be more opportune to receive the leader of the government of Macao on another occasion.
However, when he went to Macau, between the 9th and 10th of September, Luís Montenegro was received by Sam Hou Fai, in a meeting that took place behind closed doors at the Government headquarters. If the visit had not been postponed, the two would have held two meetings in just over a week.</description><pubDate>2025-10-03 01:48:07</pubDate></item><item><title>The sin of incuria</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/07/o-pecado-da-incuria/</link><description>On September 23rd and 24th, Typhoon Ragatsa hit Guangdong Province in mainland China, as well as Hong Kong and Macau, two special administrative regions of China. This super typhoon caused some damage in these three zones. Fortunately, everyone was prepared and the damage was minimal. The most serious occurrences were injuries caused in some people.
In Hong Kong, a family decided to go to the jetty to observe the winds and the waves. Unfortunately the mother and son fell into the sea. The father jumped right away to save them leaving the 9 -year -old daughter alone, alone and crying. Other people who were there tried to save them immediately but couldn't. Luckily, a fishing boat was passing and the sailor and the son went to the victims' aid. The mother and son were unconscious and the father though conscious was slightly injured.
Subsequently, Hong Kong's secretary for security, Chris Tang, said that although the “chase of winds and waves” (追風逐浪) was not criminalized in Hong Kong, bringing children into the storm during the passage of a typhoon can constitute “child neglect” (疏忽照顧兒童) and said the Hong Kong government will further investigate this matter. This means that the “persecution of winds and waves” can be criminalized.
A few weeks ago, we mentioned in this column the lawsuit filed in Shenzhen against people who climbed the mountain during a storm. Currently, Hong Kong only has legislation that punishes entry to beaches closed by the Hong Kong Government, with a maximum fine of 2,000 HKD and 14 days in prison. However, only “entering prohibited areas” is criminalized and not “chasing winds and waves” during a storm. Ultimately, in Hong Kong, “wind and wave chasing” is not a crime.
To completely prevent the tragedies caused by the “chase of winds and waves” during the passage of typhoons, it is necessary to implement legislation that criminalizes it. As we mentioned in the previous column, the act of “pursuing winds and waves” is difficult to define and regular. If the fact that it is on the beach during a storm is considered a crime of “chase of winds and waves”, many people will be accused. The law must be clear and detailed and its scope must be limited. Otherwise, a law is created that will be broken by many people, which will certainly not be the intention of the legislator. In addition, the current inspection agency is made up of employees of the Hong Kong government's cultural and leisure services department (LCSD), not the police. If there is resistance to employee indications, the situation will be even more chaotic.
Another consideration in criminal legislation is the question of proof. How can it be proved that this group of people was "chasing winds" on the coast during a storm? LCSD employees, although on duty, also put their lives at risk during the weather and have simultaneously enforce the law. The adverse environment in law enforcement requires special attention. In other words, in a high risk environment, how can we guarantee that the LCSD team is applying the law in security?
Perhaps Hong Kong could consider the use of drones to patrol the coast during the storms. If any “chase of winds and waves” were detected, it could immediately be issued a sound message by appealing to the withdrawal of the place. As this crime was recorded in film, if the infrastructors refused to leave the Hong Kong government would naturally have evidence to sue them.
The success of this legislation would depend on the future attitude of Hong Kong society, which is why it is difficult to predict at the moment. However, the Hong Kong Government should certainly consider the possibility of forcing offenders to pay the costs of rescue operations. During a storm, rescue teams risk their lives to save those “chasing winds and waves,” and the equipment used is very expensive. It is not unreasonable to ask these “adventurers” to bear the costs.
Legislation to regulate “wind and wave chasing” involves prevention rather than prosecution. These laws are intended to deter these behaviors. Criminal proceedings are only initiated after repeated warnings. Even with the legislation in force, its application is fraught with difficulties. Lastly, we must pay tribute to those who remain on duty during typhoons or carry out rescue operations. Without them, safety would be much lower during typhoons. Regarding the case of the family that fell into the sea in Hong Kong, we must pay tribute to all the rescuers. Your courage and selflessness in saving three people during a storm was admirable.
Macau currently has a “civil defense legal system” (民防法律制度) and has implemented a series of measures to be applied during storms, such as preventive deployment, the evacuation of residents from riverside areas and ensuring supplies for daily needs. Many people were evacuated, demonstrating the robustness of Macau's civil defense system. Furthermore, there were no recorded incidents of “wind and wave chasing” on the coast, proof of the excellent work of the Macau Government in protecting the lives and property of residents. Macau residents take their personal safety very seriously. Therefore, although “chasing winds and waves” is not criminalized in Macau, people are careful. Currently, with unusual weather conditions and frequent and particularly powerful typhoons, Macau society must prioritize awareness and education to ensure that people understand what must be done to protect their lives and property during a storm. Only when everyone pays attention to safety can the impact of typhoons be minimized.

It is enough to give you an example: in a classroom full of boys and white girls there was a black student, Kikas. The teacher asked the students what they had enjoyed most so far in life. Everyone answered and when Kikas commented on what he had liked most, he stressed that it had been the return to the world he had given. The teacher shouted him, calling him "liar !!!". Kikas replied that he did not accept the offense and informed the teacher that he was an adopted son of a very rich white family and had been walking around the world with his parents. Not satisfied, the teacher stressed, "Shut up! Types like you always end up on the street!" And he told him to leave the room giving him disciplinary lack. This is one of the many most deplorable examples of racist attitudes in our society.
Last week, the AD/arrival alliance approved in the Assembly of the Republic a new law of foreigners. Criticism has been more than many, fundamentally because this law could increase racism in Portugal. Those who immediately came to Terreiro was the organization SOS racism that opposed the new law of immigrants, considering it a setback in protecting the guarantees of fundamental rights and freedoms, by altering the conditions of residence and obtaining citizenship directed to immigrants, including CPLP citizens. According to Mariana Carneiro, director of SOS Racism, the approval of the law with the support of the radical right represents a violation of the Constitution of the Portuguese Republic and the European Conventions of Human Rights, as well as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The SOS Racism leader has even denounced that immigration has been treated as a crime, which unfortunately is not new, because Portugal has been walking this path for a long time. Mariana Carneiro said that the government, sworn in March 2024, had already adopted an increasingly aligned stance with the far right yielding to racist and xenophobic principles present in Portuguese society. For the director of SOS Racism, the new law is a blatant attack on people who choose to live and work in our country, while Gold visas receive privileged treatment, when simultaneously increasingly restrictive immigration policies applied to other immigrants are implemented.
The clamorous lead by the constitutional court of the initial version of the law on foreign residence authorization and family regrouping was a precious opportunity given by the President of the Republic to the Government to correct the shot in matters that are a test to humanistic values, defense of family principles and a privileged relationship with Lusophone countries. The solution found by AD and arrives is a legal tracery to circumvent the arguments of the Constitutional Court by maintaining all the political inconveniences of the initial version. It maintains as a rule of two years to request the family regrouping, from the granting of residence authorization and not of its request with the proof of payment of taxes and contributions to Social Security, despite the exceptions of reduction for one year when there are minor children.
The disappearance of the special regime for citizens of CPLP countries is confirmed. Denying the vaunted preference for Lusophony and violating our commitments on mobility within the Lusophone space. On the other hand, we find it strange that the privilege of access to family reunification is maintained for holders of Gold visas, European Blue Cards or for individuals considered highly qualified, prioritizing income over origin or integration into Portuguese society. Proof of having decent housing conditions and means of subsistence continues to be established by ordinance, in clear violation of the principle of reservation of law in matters of fundamental rights. However, all these limitations can be overcome by ministerial order, which opens the door to unlimited discretion and a lack of transparency. There remains a broad possibility of extending the period for considering the request for family reunification by up to 18 months, as well as the possibility of appealing to the courts to order AIMA to comply with decision deadlines, which continues to be severely limited.
To give us an idea of ​​the bad intentions of the law, it is clear that issues such as the aggravated punishment of those who violate the labor rights of foreign workers, the effective control of irregular immigration penalizing traffickers and employees or the employer's responsibility for decent housing for seasonal workers are matters that are absolutely ignored. The same happens with the rules on access to learning the Portuguese language.
In conclusion, we can see that the new Foreigners Law meets the Chega racists and that immigrants are the most significant target to be increasingly harmed, giving strength to neofascists to continue treating immigrants like trash and throwing them out of Portugal and, this, is pure racism.</description><pubDate>2025-10-06 05:39:39</pubDate></item><item><title>Between Hyperion and Extinct Peace – 2nd part</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/03/entre-hyperion-e-paz-extinta-2a-parte/</link><description>(Continued from September 26th edition)
“Peace cannot be kept by force; it can only be achieved by understanding.”
Albert Einstein
The North is entirely shared by meridians between Russia, China and the United States. Three empires without continuity solution. Never have the maximum powers have been all adjusted. Never like now the sparks generated by reciprocal frictions can set the planet on fire. Ordolândia is overwhelming as Caosland expands to the northeast. Long -term scholars will notice that the Hot Peace Zone, the true name of the Cold War corresponds to the plimylness ecuma of the empires, that of the conflicts armed in (ex?) Colonies. According to geostrategic stenography, we find that Global North continues to dedicate itself to its favorite sport to discharge the rivalries between empires, through real or presumed clients, agile in changing acronyms and flag as needed. Austral massacres are endemic because they can only be resolved by boreals. Which have other priorities. When they do not dedicate themselves to keeping or expanding them as wars by power of attorney. The geopolitical economy of the reproduction of self -delighted peripheral outbreaks and/or directed externally would reveal altars that no actor is interested in exposing. An example among many is piracy cycles in the horn of Africa, encouraged by Americans to block to China access to hydrocarbons spread between Yemen and Somalia.
We rise to the imperial latitudes to verify the state of the supreme triangle. The competition between the United States, China and Russia, in order of value, paradoxically involves three subjects of contingent health. Close to the wearable pain threshold without soothing each other. What is the game today? We are still in time to avoid the threat of fair self -proclaimed peace by the single winner, if it will exist? Minerva's owl has not yet raised flight. Too much short -time turns and dilated spaces announce others, equally unforeseen. The limits to impure commitments are reduced. While the advertising obsessions of advertisements activate in the unpublished West totalitarian tics. Truths admit it in a low voice, with their hand in front of the mouth. In the temples of free American universities to the head with the politically correct, censorship and self -censorship mimic Soviet neuroses. The dead devour the living. The challenge is asymmetrical. As for global potential, the United States maintain a decreasing advantage over China. Both distance themselves from Russia. But they are simplified static quantifications, while history accelerates geometrically. There is no mechanics or theology that emancipate in the calculation of probabilities.
Common sense, trivialized by national mainstream, dull or omits deep factors. Five examples. First; Strength relationships are subject to the whims of intransitive cultures. Americans, Chinese and Russians believe they understand themselves but cannot. They are heirs of proud civilizations, bearing deeply rooted cultural codes, often indecipherable to those who watch them from the outside. When one reads where the other writes Z, the risk of involuntary war is approaching precisely the most difficult to avoid, because not foreseen. The interval between Russian and American reasoning is relatively narrow, allowing them to manage tensions such as those unfolding in Ukraine. Already in the Indo-Pacific, the degree of misunderstanding between the United States and China is more pronounced, which makes any incident potentially more dangerous, requiring extra prudence and effective channels of communication. As for the relationship between Russia and China, the distance between their symbolic universes is recognized by both, which leads them to privilege pragmatic cooperation, supported by convergent interests and mutual respect. The expression “boundless friendship” must be understood as a diplomatic formula that celebrates this approach, without intending to erase the differences that enrich each civilization. It is important to remember that slogans and appearances can be misleading.
Contemporary geopolitics is marked by complex overlays, where today's ally may be tomorrow's competitor, and vice versa. The simplifying narrative that opposes democracies to autocracies ignores the multiple forms of political organization and the historical contexts that shape each society. It is more productive to abandon such dichotomies and recognize that Western models also face internal contradictions that challenge any pretense of universality. We find that Russia and China have two distinct, more popular regime models in its countries than Trump and several European democracies leaders. Today, the Russian Federation and the Popular Republic of China, separated and connected by 4,209 kilometers of Siberian border along the Amur River, maintain a complex and historically dense relationship. They are strategic neighbors that, aware of their civilizational differences and distinct interests, opt for a prudent and mutually advantageous collaboration. This approach is also a way to prevent third parties from exploring any differences, fostering artificial tensions between two fundamental poles of euro-Asian stability.
Third; Washington and Beijing are undoubtedly first -rate powers, capable of acting anywhere and in all strategic dimensions from marine backgrounds to space, from earth to air and cyberspace to artificial intelligence. Moscow is only a great cultural, military-nuclear, energy and agricultural power, but limited by demographic and geopolitical constraints that feed their anxiety of being crushed between NATO and the center's empire. There is, however, a powerful indicator who plays in his favor in this triangular background race that is social cohesion. Expressed in patriotism that still sustains the Ukrainian adventure promoted by Putin, even against influential mechanisms, many of which they ignored until the last moment their risk. They criticized him discreetly in the early months of the war, because they underestimated the national spirit of the Russian people often superior to their own, more professional than spontaneous. Room; If we set free from the economic illusionism that idolizes GDP as a measure of all things, and evaluated the power relations between geopolitical subjects from the degree of social cohesion, we would discover the United States in third place well behind Russia and China.
French anthropologist Emmanuel Todd diagnoses the United States as a defeated and nihilistic oligarchy stating that “its dependence on the rest of the world has become immense and its society is disintegrating. The two phenomena interact ». There are nations without empire. But not empires without nation. And never nations without society. Today, America is an oligarchy intoxicated by the richness of the few, which are reflected in absolute poverty and the relative deprivation of the "deplorable." And they are confirmed in faith that "there is no such thing as a society" (Margaret Thatcher). Perhaps it is by the zero degree reached by the American Creed, a Protestant Anglo-Saxon Religion fragmented in neo-evangelical shrapnel centered on the special self-(for this order) relationship, excited by unlikely teleprife. Source of solipsism, fragmentation of families and communities, violence without values, depression aggravated by opiates, loss of common sense and, therefore, of reality. Perhaps also due to the social consequences of neoliberalism, which reduce citizens to clients, institutions to companies, government to “governance” and people to human resources.
Abyss of the degenerate elite and zénitis of the super class Manager, caste that surrounds the decision makers in their automatic technicism and living absence of spirit. It remains to be seen how a great empire may be again removed from national references and withdrawn without strategic within the American fortress, while dance and wants to dance to the rhythm of the fun whims of his shrink. Fifth; The competition in the triangle, triggered by the American crisis, shuffles the hierarchy of the powers. Average powers are assumed as maximum averages, while conceiving super maxims for the future. In front of all, the neo-imperial Türkiye, on a transcontinental scale. Others, such as Japan and even Germany in nervous crisis, focus on less large areas. They take advantage of the American retreat to expand in their respective regions as priority partners of today's “number one” because tomorrow will be another day. The Japanese and Germans offer to the United States to contain the visible Chinese expansion in Asia and the alleged Russian invasion of the European NATO, scheduled for 2029 according to Atlantic Communication.
Japanese rearmament continues discreetly, the German in ostentatious rhetoric is still far from materializing in practice to the point of proposing itself as the first continental military power in the next decade. Without humor, European leaders seem to imitate the eve of the double world war. Macron and Carlos III rediscover the anti-German “entente cordiale” of 1904, promoted as “friendly”. With a hand extended to the Poles, committed to restoring Marshal Piłsudski's thoughts. And with a thumbs up to the Russians. We don't know how many symptoms of the emergency hysteria circulating among Europeans are staged or believed. In any case, the Europeanist bluff has been called. It is replaced by alarmism. In a strict sense, we go to arms. The Cossacks arrive. Thus discouraged, we return to the central question of how to neutralize, through dirty peaces, the threat of total war, with unified war focuses? While utopians do not produce the general plan for universal just peace, let us move forward with the modest means at our disposal. We start again with Negotiated Peace.
A bubble of informal indulgence between duelists reassured by its refined ambiguity. Inspiration for reasoning about order from chaos. In its wake, a hierarchy of conflicts, and therefore the urgency to deal with them. The classification is based on the probability of a strategic confrontation below the military threshold of the United States against China or two ongoing regional conflicts of Russia against Ukraine and Israel against Iran (on apparent pause), Palestinians and other neighbors triggering the third world war. It is expected to involve the three vertices of the Triangle. Dragging us, fragile hinge between order and chaos. As a basis for discussion, we invented a military expansion coefficient, borrowed from thermodynamics. Subjective measure that invites refutation. On a scale of 1 to 10, we place first, with a 7, the Sino-American duel centered on the Indo-Pacific. Right behind, Ukraine, with a score of 6. Third, the war in Israel, not above 3.</description><pubDate>2025-10-03 02:17:57</pubDate></item><item><title>Artificial intelligence at the service of suicide (II)</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/30/inteligencia-artificial-ao-servico-do-suicidio-ii/</link><description>Last week, we talked about a California couple who sued the technology company OpenAI and its CEO, Sam Altman, for having their artificial intelligence-generating chatbot, ChatGPT, provide information and encourage their 16-year-old son Ryan to commit suicide. This case is not complex, but the legal, ethical and technological issues it raises are worthy of extensive reflection.
Although Ryan's parents have filed a lawsuit against OpenAI and its executive director, Sam Altman, this is a civil case and not a criminal case. The reason is simple: it is a recent technology and currently lacks legal regulation. If encouraging suicide is a crime, then it must be condemned. However, there is currently no law that provides for the possibility of this incentive from Artificial Intelligence platforms, thus making criminal actions impossible.
The situation is similar for civil proceedings. Because there is no law stipulating that AI-induced suicide is illegal, Ryan's parents were only able to file a “product liability” lawsuit based on the “defective product” claim. The success of the case will depend on whether California courts accept the legal argument.
From an ethical standpoint, Altman stated that OpenAI was trying to find ways to notify appropriate government agencies if in the future a minor seriously discussed suicide-related issues with ChatGPT and the company was unable to contact the parents. However, this method should not proceed because it goes against the company's privacy protection policy. He further stated that ChatGPT should not support or contest anything, which means that it should not take a position.
From a technological perspective, AI is incapable of understanding the complexities of human thinking. For example, if one person says to another; Next time we meet, we'll have tea; the AI ​​just interprets it as; In the future, at any given moment, two people will drink tea. However, if these words are just an act of courtesy, and in fact the person who wrote them has no intention of reviewing the other, there is a psychological complexity here that is beyond the reach of current AI technology. When AI can't understand the true meaning of a sentence, how can users interpret its responses?
After considering the legal, ethical and technological issues, what steps can we actually take to resolve the issues raised by AI?
ChatGPT, originating in the United States, must be governed by North American law. In response to the Ryan case, we hope that this country will consider quickly adopting laws that regulate the civil and criminal liability of those who use AI for illegal purposes.
ChatGPT users are spread across the world. When implementing laws that regulate the sector, the US should allow users from other countries to appeal to American courts to seek compensation or to bring actions similar to that of Ryan's parents. Let's imagine a British user who is faced with a similar situation. If the UK does not have specific legislation, the minor's parents have no other option than to file the case in the USA. Only with adequate legal protection can users around the world continue to access ChatGPT with confidence.
If a company that runs ChatGPT discovers that a minor is morbidly interested in suicide and cannot contact his parents, but does not call the police for reasons of privacy protection, does that mean that privacy is more valuable than life? Under what terms can a company choose between protecting privacy and saving a life? Should you violate privacy to save a life, or should you turn a blind eye to potential suicide and protect privacy?
The ethical questions are anyway; No choice is easy. If the right to privacy and the right to life are incompatible, can ChatgPT ignore certain questions merely not to answer? Or you may simply give an answer, "this question may be illegal, so I refuse to answer. The user must consult a lawyer before deciding whether to proceed."
The Ryan case is just the beginning of the problems with AI. The more implanted this technology is, the more questions will arise. More unexpected and bizarre things will be revealed in the future. In addition to developing technology and improving AI quality, manufacturers should also make efforts to constantly remember employees of their social responsibilities, the importance of business ethics and the need for products to meet security standards. AI companies can take the initiative to conduct “ethics audits” with external auditors during annual financial audits to assess whether employees are up to business ethical standards and whether the company's ethical awareness is sufficient. This procedure would give users a lot of tranquility.
Promotion and education are essential for users to correctly understand AI. If they realize that AI is just a computerized method of disseminating information, devoid of any human emotions, they will naturally be less inclined to trust their answers and the number of complicated cases will decrease.
Only by fully understanding the limitations of AI and continually focusing on improvement can we maximize its benefits.

There are runs and walks, depending on the physical capacity of each person, scheduled for this Sunday, in the Natural Park of Barragem de Hac-Sá
The Association for the Rehabilitation of Drug Addicts of Macau (ARTM) celebrates 25 years and to mark the event, it is promoting, this Sunday, from 6:30 am to 12 pm, the “Hike With a Purpose” initiative, which takes place in the Hac Sá Dam Natural Park, and which aims to take residents to walk or run in support of a cause.
“This initiative is intended to promote a community free of illicit substances, encourage healthy lifestyles and habits, and encourage outdoor activities and community involvement among participants of all ages”, highlights the association in a note. The first edition of the event took place in 2022.
This is an initiative that takes place in collaboration with Trailman 100 with two participation options, namely the “14Km Challenge Race” and the “8Km Fun Run”, both “designed to foster community spirit and promote physical fitness”.
In the case of the “14km Challenge Race”, in individual format, it is made at a distance of 14 kilometers as the name implies and the registration should be made from 6:15 am to 07h, starting the race scheduled for 07h. Participants will have a time limit of 3 hours and 30 minutes and must be 16 years or older to participate.
The “8Km Fun Run”, with groups of three people, is held over an eight-kilometre route, with mandatory registration between 8am and 9am and a scheduled start at 9am. Participants will have a time limit of 2 hours and 30 minutes and must be 8 years or older. Here, the prizes will be awarded to the winning group, while in the case of the individual race, the prizes will be awarded to the three best male and female runners.
Heat
This ARTM event also has the support of UFC Gym to “provide a warm-up session before the group fun run”, in addition to the fact that at the event there will be two stalls selling items, food and drink for charitable purposes, in partnership with “Friends U Can Keep Macau” and “Go Tower”, with part of the profits going to ARTM.
The event is expected to attract around 300 participants, bringing together families, friends and community members in an attempt to engage “in healthy activities”, also increasing “awareness about preventing substance abuse”.
In 1993, ARTM was born under the name “Ser Oriente” and began by offering conversation sessions and psychological support to drug addicts, in addition to focusing on their social integration. The association was renamed ARTM in 2000, and today it has reception centers for those addicted to alcohol, drugs or gambling, having created a therapeutic community that aims to heal without prison and return to life in society. ARTM also carries out social work in Ka-Hó, in the houses of the former leper colony, with the “Hold On To Hope” cafeteria and art gallery project.</description><pubDate>2025-10-07 23:32:58</pubDate></item><item><title>Cinema | “The Memory of the Smell of Things” distinguished in Morocco</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/06/cinema-a-memoria-do-cheiro-das-coisas-distinguido-em-marrocos/</link><description>The film “The Memory of the Smell of Things”, by director António Ferreira, was distinguished with the honorable mention for 'best argument' at the Tanger Film Festival, in the northwest of Morocco, the producer announced yesterday.
Persona Non Grata Pictures highlighted that the feature film was recognized by the festival's official jury “for the originality and subtlety with which the script addresses issues of aging”. The script was written by the director himself and co-screenwriter Tiago Cravidão, the producer said in a statement.
“This is a film about empathy, about learning to see the other, through dialogue, not as a threat, but as someone who, like us, has desires and aspirations similar to ours, no matter how different we appear to be”, said António Ferreira, during the awards ceremony.
The Tangier Film Festival took place from the 1st to the 4th of October. “The Memory of the Smell of Things” opens in Portuguese cinemas on November 6th. The film had already won, in June, the best actor award at the Shanghai International Film Festival, in eastern China, for José Martins.
In the end, José Martins plays “a forced colonial war veteran to enter a nursing home, where he faces the ghosts of his past and forms an unexpected bond with his black caregiver,” according to the synopsis.
The film, a Portugal-Brazil co-production, presents itself as “a poetic and intimate portrait of an elderly person in an institution, exploring the fragility of the human condition, the inevitability of death and the search for redemption”, works on “pressing issues in society, such as population aging and structural racism.”</description><pubDate>2025-10-06 05:41:28</pubDate></item><item><title>Opera | “Carmen”, by Bizet, presented today at CCM</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/03/opera-carmen-de-bizet-apresentada-hoje-no-ccm/</link><description>The Macau International Music Festival (FIMM) begins today with a show that has long been part of the international scene: the opera “Carmen”, which is presented in “Carmen – Opera in Four Acts by Georges Bizet”. The stage is the large auditorium of the Macau Cultural Center (CCM), with the show scheduled to start at 7:30 pm.
The production is carried out by the Opéra Comique and the Zurich Opera, directed by Andreas Homoki. This show takes place in partnership with the Macau Orchestra, and the collaborations of the Choir of the National Symphony Orchestra of China and the Macau Youth Choir.
“Let us immerse ourselves in a world of burning passion.” This is the challenge left in the official program of the show, marked by a “dramatic involvement and unforgettable music”.
On the CCM stage is “an inventive production”, with “pulsating arias and inspired by Spanish musical exoticism and timeless themes”. With this adaptation of the “Bizet masterpiece”, “Carmen” remains “today as powerful and relevant as when it was created”.
"Led to the stage by the award-winning Andreas Homoki, the production transports the plot to an austere and meta-theatrical setting. A replica of the Opéra Comique stage becomes the backdrop for a journey through time, in which each act suggests a different era: from Belle Époque Paris to the Second World War and, finally, to the present", describes the program.
“Carmen” thus captures “like never before the raw and dramatic emotion of the classic, reinterpreting themes that touch on destiny and humanity from a subtle and at the same time bold perspective”.
According to the program, this show can be enjoyed by “music lovers or novice spectators”, as “this production engages and challenges us, remaining with us long after the show ends”. We are thus faced with “an extraordinary demonstration of music, tragedy and seduction”.</description><pubDate>2025-10-03 02:22:54</pubDate></item><item><title>Real Estate | Market to grow in September</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/07/imobiliario-mercado-a-crescer-em-setembro/</link><description>The beginning of September shows a recovery market compared to last year's number of transactions. However, the largest purchase and housing sales also results from prices to be lower now

The idea was defended in statements to the Chinese channel of Radio Macau, with the associative leader to ask the buses and shuttle buses of the game companies to focus on tourists.
According to Paul Wong, Macau is a tourist city, so it is necessary to ensure that visitors have alternatives to taxis when typhoon signal no. The president of the association explained that in order to protect the Macao SAR's tourist image, it is necessary to ensure that tourists are not regularly stranded and that the buses provided operate in safe conditions.
Paul Wong also recalled that the Macao Bridge began to allow circulation during signal 8 and asked the possibility of tourists to travel between the borders, the city center zone and the Cotai hotels should be permanent.
In addition, the associative leader wants weather information to be announced more in advance so that the sector has enough time to accommodate tourists, and organize shifts for employees, who face travel difficulties.</description><pubDate>2025-10-07 23:28:06</pubDate></item><item><title>JP Morgan | October with the highest revenues in six years</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/07/jp-morgan-outubro-com-as-receitas-mais-altas-em-seis-anos/</link><description>Although the growth of game revenues in the golden week is below initial expectations, the investment bank believes that the figure of 23 billion patacas will be reached
In October, casinos' revenues are expected to reach 23 billion patacas, the highest value since the same month of 2019. Estimates were made by the JP Morgan investment bank, taking into account the revenues of Macao's main industry in the early days of the golden week.
According to the JP Morgan report, cited by the GGR Asia portal, the game's gross revenue reached 5.5 billion patacas in the first five days of the month, which represented a daily average of 1.1 billion patacas. “It was the best Golden Week in more than five years”, can be read in the aforementioned report, which was signed by analysts DS Kim, Selina Li and Lindsey Qian.
Despite this aspect, analysts recognize that the numbers were a little below initial expectations for this month: “annual growth appears relatively moderate, with an increase of 3 percent compared to last year's (very) high base, remaining a few points below our expectations and market expectations, which pointed to average single-digit growth”, was justified.
The growth of revenues below expectations is not viewed as worrying for JP Morgan, because the Golden Week of 2025 has another day of holiday than last year's Golden Week. Therefore, analysts believe that demand will remain strong in the second week of October.
Expectations maintained
Analysts believe that demand will remain strong in the second week of October, with daily revenues reaching 750 million patacas, an increase of around 15 percent compared to last year. In the second week of October, a 30 percent drop is expected compared to the first week. This reduction is slighter than what happened last year, when the drop in revenue from the first to the second week reached 40 percent.
"Our projection for the month remains unchanged for now, with gross game revenues reaching 23 billion patacas, the highest value in six years, growing between 11 percent and 13 percent over the previous year," was indicated.
Bank analysts also said they hope that the growth trend will last until next year, with "sustained two -digit growth of gross game revenues up to at least the first trimester of 2026".</description><pubDate>2025-10-07 23:26:15</pubDate></item><item><title>Porto / Kevin Ho | Issued building permit to “Torre do Jn”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/07/porto-kevin-ho-emitido-alvara-de-construcao-para-torre-do-jn/</link><description>The Porto Chamber issued a construction permit on January 30 to begin the work of adapting the Jornal de Notícias Tower (JN) at a hotel, responded to Lusa's municipality, but the works have not yet advanced. According to the municipality, the permit, issued at the beginning of the year, serves to “works of demolition, expansion and change to adapt the pre -existence to the hotel”.
The building was sold in 2018 by the Global Media to Authentic Empathy society. Since 2020, it has been belonging only to one of the societies that constituted it, Magnetic Pocket, managed by Macau Lei Kei and David Siu entrepreneurs, Burgosublime managers, whose mother company is the Portuguese Kevin Ho KNJ branch, recently elected deputy.
The process of transforming the tower is already a decade and dates back to 2015, when it was entered into the city's urbanism services a request for prior information (PIP) to regain that space in a hotel unit with more than 200 rooms, which obtained a favorable order in March 2016 and which was successively revalidated ”.
The architectural project of the future “Hotel Jornal” was delivered to the Opport Office for Design and Architecture collective. According to the architecture studio website, the tile panel on the Tower Facade, by sculptor Charters de Almeida, will be maintained and a part of the building that is next to the Trindade station will be demolished.
The journalists left this space in July 2023. Workers from JN and the sports team O Jogo moved to a building on Rua do Monte dos Burgos, in Prelada, and those from TSF to a space in Boavista. The tower, designed by architect Márcio Freitas, was the third editorial office for that newspaper's workers, who moved to these facilities in 1970.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Gastronomy | Study talks about the “undervaluation” of the Fernando restaurant</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/07/gastronomia-estudo-fala-na-subvalorizacao-do-restaurante-fernando/</link><description>In “Fernando Restaurant: A Case Study on Culinary Authenticity and Cultural Heritage”, José Ferreira Pinto, professor at the City University of Macau, draws attention to an “undervaluation”, by the authorities, of the cultural value of the restaurant, highlighting the maintenance of the space’s identity
 
José Ferreira Pinto, professor in the Tourism area of ​​the City of Macau University (UCM), has just published a case study on Fernando's Restaurant on the Cabi Digital Library Platform, entitled “Fernando Restaurante: A Case Study on Culinary Authenticity and Cultural Heritage”, warning of the lack of cultural recognition of this space by the authorities.
"For political decision makers and destinations programmers, [restaurant] Fernando represents a underused active," given that it is an "active that contributes to the global identity of Macao and provides a sustainable tourism model."
It is also explained that “despite the iconic status between local inhabitants and international visitors, Fernando Restaurante was not formally recognized by official tourism or culture institutions as one of the main exponents of Macau's destination brand”, but the truth is that it has “undeniable influence” in these fields.
“There are documented cases of travelers flying to Macau just to have dinner at Fernando before returning to their home countries, proof of its magnetic attraction and symbolic value”, it adds.
Thus, “recognizing and supporting these institutions could improve the branding strategies of destinations and promote deeper connections between visitors and the place,” is mentioned.
In the same case study, intended for university students and sector operators, it refers that "Fernando Restaurant is a convincing example of how authenticity, when cultivated in a careful and consistent manner, can transcend commercial trends and become a cultural institution."
Fernando has existed in Coloane since 1986, next to Hac-Sá Beach, and since then has been an almost obligatory crossing point for many tourists and residents. This study was carried out based on “a combination of ethnographic observation, qualitative conversations and documentary evidence”, and in 15 months more than 20 visits were made to the restaurant “to interact with employees, customers, the restaurant owner and the restaurant manager”. Through “informal but systematic conversations”, topics such as “perceptions about authenticity, customer loyalty and commercial pressures” were addressed.
Resist crises
Another point highlighted in this case study is the fact that the restaurant has resisted several crises throughout its existence. "Fernando's perseverance through economic crises, pandemics and changing tourism dynamics offers a powerful lesson in resilience. Their refusal to compromise the restaurant's identity in favor of modernization has preserved a space that feels timeless and emotionally grounded."
Thus, the author considers that the maintenance of the traditional restaurant "challenges the dominant logic of constant innovation in hotel and tourism, suggesting that cultural consistency and fidelity can be equally, if no longer, valuable."
Regarding the future of this well-known gastronomic space, questions are left to that only Fernando himself can answer: “Should it continue to resist modernization in favor of preserving the original spirit, or adapt to the new trends of the hotel and formalize its brand to attract younger audiences and international markets?”</description><pubDate>2025-10-07 23:23:35</pubDate></item><item><title>Equipment | Women want more recreational facilities</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/07/equipamentos-mulheres-querem-mais-instalacoes-recreativas/</link><description>Vice-presidents of the General Association of Macao Women, Wong Kit Cheng and Loi I Weng argue that the government should better enjoy interior spaces in public buildings to make more recreational options available to the population.

The newly elected deputies also asked that the example of opening more social facilities in unoccupied spaces be replicated in the Red Market Provisional Market and the Iao Hon Neighborhood Municipal Market, giving productive use to the empty rooms in these buildings.
At the same time, studies were requested to be carried out to choose the type of services that the population most lacks and that should be made available in unoccupied rooms. In the shared opinions, the deputies pointed out some examples such as spaces for sports, shows or meeting rooms.
Regarding the urban planning of the different zones of the territory, Wong Kit Cheng and Loi I Weng asked the executive to plan potential parks and other spaces, based on population data and the needs of each zone.</description><pubDate>2025-10-07 23:21:08</pubDate></item><item><title>Drug addiction | Number of cases decreasing</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/07/toxicodependencia-numero-de-casos-a-diminuir/</link><description>In the first half of the year, there were 85 toxicode dependents registered in the Central Macao Registry system, which represents a 11.5 percent reduction compared to the same period last year. The number was released during a meeting of the drug fighting committee, which took place on Monday.
According to a statement from the Institute of Social Action (IAS), there was no registration of toxicode dependents under 21 years. The data also showed that ICE is the most consumed drug among toxicode dependents, with 22.7 percent to consume this substance regularly. Following is the heroin consumption, consumed for 9.1 percent of toxicode dependents, and cannabis, consumed for 4.5 percent of registered toxicodependents.
The meeting allowed the commission to also discuss the work plan for next year, which involves intensifying promotional campaigns to attract more young people to the fight against drug use. Furthermore, the work will also aim to improve the quality of rehabilitation services for drug addicts. The consumption of drugs in Macau is considered a crime.</description><pubDate>2025-10-07 23:19:53</pubDate></item><item><title>Zelensky vs Zelensky</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/31/zelensky-vs-zelensky/</link><description>10/27/22
A Ukrainian pensioner, with the same name as the president, blames Zelensky for the prolongation of the conflict that destroyed his village. Zelensky, the villager, who never left his land, is now mortified because his favorite gravedigger died in the bomber.
This Zelensky, a villager, represents half the world that recriminates the other Zelensky, the villain, for not wanting to negotiate with Putin.
Negotiate what? The invader enters our house, covers his wife and daughter (cf. recent UN report on the rapes in Ukraine, in this “special operation”), an act that forced us to watch, and then we say to him: hi there, we are for peace, but we have to negotiate: you still haven't said what name you want to give the children!
A peace that is not worthy is but a cessation of rights. As severe as Russophobia that Putin inflicts his people.

At a lunch with several guests, I heard a friend, who declared herself a spiritualist, explaining the particularities of her belief, in a calm and balanced way, I would even say, without a hint of “irrationalism”. He spoke at length and serenely, devoid of any fanatical proselytism. “Here is someone whose belief has brought thoughtfulness!” I thought, a rare alliance.
However, at one point a phrase that horrify me. He says, “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!” And I enter the voracious fauces of holism. Because holismo has a pathological aspect like all good things, a side of shadow.
Two examples: in Hinduism there is less sensitivity to existential dramas, if that child suffers in this life this is just an expression of rigorous karmic symmetry, an effect of the acts he committed in his previous life. In Africa, it is not accepted that death could have been accidental, and many women are accused by the family of the deceased of having caused the death of their husband, in an act of manifest dementia, and, in the blatant majority of cases, a huge injustice for the wife — madness that spreads and infiltrates the social fabric.
Buddhism introduced Compassion and Christianity introduced Caritas, trying to break with this logic, but in many other beliefs and religions the cage of causalities prevails over sensitivity to experience, the need to respond to the now.
It is a tremendous logic that transforms the world into a Platonic stage, where we are nothing more than the shadows of something — an inextricable law -, in a determinism that calcifies all singularities, but that strangely fascinates many.
The conquest of modernity was anchored in the conquest of chance and randomness, removing the incidences of a life from this fierce determinism that enclosed the world in a web. When the Renaissance freed the body from the influence of the stars, at that moment sexuality was relieved of guilt and individualism and its volition were able to emerge.
There is an unequivocal moral implication in the phrase “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!”, Which should work as a key to self-knowledge and self-judgment, but usually this phrase is managed to seek a reason for things abroad from us in the other. It is an alibi.
There is a holistic temptation in the world today, as in the Middle Ages there was a satanic temptation, without great reflection on its consequences. Because it is not enough we want to connect everything in a resonant chain of affection. Even the most unexpected: affection itself can kill.
I realize, thanks to this cultured, balanced, intelligent woman, that “the combat” moved at the beginning of this century. One of the great misconceptions of the twentieth century was the false dichotomy between "rationalism and irrationalism", a debate that extended to all fields, including art. First, rationality was confused (the positive side of reason) with rationalism (the pathological feature of reason), and articulated in this lack of discernment was confused irrationalism with freedom. Almost all the art of the twentieth century, with surrealism to the head, worked in this error. The fallacy still exists despite having consolidated the emergence of 'irrationalism' and the consequent relativist currents that followed it. Essentially much of what happened in the twentieth century, it turned around this shock between two paradigms: rationalism versus irrationalism.
Now, I see, we must save indeterminacy, chance, randomness from the terrible temptation of the cage of causalities. Holism, in its pathological form, may be reductionism that sets itself up as a new “eschatological narrative”.
Is it "by chance" that the holism emerges at the moment when neo-liberalism and its cynical contempt for the human person besides all freedoms, all acquired rights?
Holistic consciousness has brought positively a greater ecological awareness but followed with scholastic rigor stifles reality under the blanket of a determinism that is much more than inconvenience: all great authoritarian ideologies are holistic.
My friend will know how to combine her holistic and transpersonal belief with the freedom and responsibility that each moment asks of us — but how many will make the distinction, under a Law that explains and encompasses everything?
How many will not be abandoned to what it is?
The awareness of the indeterminate brings tragic awareness, as the Greeks knew, but it also brings agency and the courage of decision. And we cannot give up on this.
Furthermore, as Drummond shows in the poem “Quadrilha”, by Carlos Drummond de Andrade:
"John loved Teresa who loved Raimundo/ who loved Maria who loved Joaquim who loved Lili/ who did not love anyone./ John went to the United States, Teresa to the convent,/ Raimundo died of disaster, Maria stayed to aunt,/ Joaquim suicide himself and Lili married J. Pinto Fernandes/ who had not entered the story."
Real always runs outside the track, in full exteriority to our concepts. This is what is worth a J. Pinto Fernandes at the exact moment we thought we had everything under control.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Nobel and others</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/17/do-nobel-e-outros/</link><description>9/10/22
When reading many people's reactions when this year's Nobel Prize for Literature was announced, I couldn't help but remember this comment from Jean-Pierre Siméon, in relation to another Nobel Prize: «An editor of a large national daily newspaper wrote five lines of indignation at the fact that the Nobel Prize for Literature had been awarded to Thomas Traströmer, a complete stranger. But unknown to whom? How did it not occur to this literary columnist, patented and paid to do his job, that his apparent ignorance was a matter of professional misconduct? Tranströmer had been translated into many languages, it was available in French.»
There is always the choir of those who wait for the announcement of the prize to complain about not being invited to the jury of the prize, there is a subgroup of Irados that professes “never read and I will not bother to read”; It is an uncommon fauna, which inhabits social networks.
I don't always know all the winners-I was unaware of the existence of Louise Glück, who I find a great poet, or the Olga Tokarczuk, for example-but it only brings me the comfort of knowing that the world is not a soap opera where everyone knows each other and the joy of recognizing that the gauge of the world is not measured with my short measure and that on the contrary it gives me a new opportunity to face the unknown.
And perhaps the most cretin of reactions was the smart one who wrote, but there are still those who read French? Confirming only that today there is a new kind of ignorance that fires with a displeasure: the one who only read English.
I would also prefer that, in French, Pascal Quignard, Linda Lê or even Sollers were awarded, or, among the new ones, Mathias Énard, but that does not detract from the dignity of Annie Ernaux's work (and it would have been enough to have written “Les Années”). There are books of hers that I like less, like the vulgar “Uma Paixão Simples”, but that happens with almost all authors, they have pivotal books and others that are like breaks in their itinerary. I recommend reading a beautiful book of interviews with her, “L’écriture comme un couteau”.

Yesterday an article appeared in the morning newspaper “Notícias”, in Maputo, reporting that the Pen Club Narrative Prize had been awarded to my wife, Teresa Noronha, for her soap opera “Tornado”, which had already won the Maria Velho da Costa Prize.
The summary they made of the book does not even deserve comments, as it is pathetic, but what is important to highlight is the note of disqualification regarding its “Mozambicanness” when they call it Luso-Mozambican. It's not that it's inaccurate, but, for those who know the context, it's a touch naughty.
Because finally, following the same logic, Adelino Timóteo should be called Tsonga-Mozambican, to Álvaro Taruma-Mozambican, and Macua-Mozambican to the writers who are from the north, etc., etc. Which is not reported to happen.
At one point, in the novel, she writes:
«Our color has never been dominant. In colonial time we were not white, we were ripped from monories, gone mugs, the pejorative term to speak of a son of Goes and Portuguese. In the postcolonial period, I was not black and if, in Lisbon, they took me by Brazilian or Cape Verdean, already in France were lost in cogitations of where they would be and amazed when they found out it was African. There I had to explain my DNA's wanderings before relying on moorms. It took me a long time to accept that it was so because yes, and that it was no curse that were so; On the contrary, I could even discover intense patterns of fantasy and freedom in this shrewd cloak that is our genealogy… »
In modern-day Mozambique, it means being white… and that immediately takes precedence over what you do or what you are.
It's sad, but as Naipaul warned, in these parts race is everything and people live as deeply immersed in it as, in other places, in religion.

Bruno Latour, an anthropologist who studied the sciences and their procedures and legitimations, law, technology and religions and who entertained himself by turning his back on the dogmas of the “moderns”, has died. For him, the place, the role of the specialist, was defined more by the perplexity he embodied than by the supposed truth that would sustain him.
He proposed, as an alternative to the kinds of multiculturalism and his mistaken password "all different all the same", the return to "diplomacy", given precisely, not from the presupposition that "we are unified because participants of the same nature" but simply reveal that we "do not yet share an ordinary world"; It is necessary to deal frontally with the "abyss of disagreement" that separates us, rather than wanting to delude it.
And about politics he said, boldly:
«If transparency is required from the politician, we kill him; If one requires fidelity to what the other was or he says, kills him; If a mimetic relationship is required between what the crowd wants and what its representative says, the representation is killed. These must, therefore, by definition, betray, deceive, modify, distort the word. Without this ability to double the word and betray, political language would not exist. I put the perfectly plausible hypothesis that political vocabulary will become as inaccessible as the religious language of the last twenty, three or fifty years. (in “UN Monde Pluriel plus Commun”). I believe it will be missed to decipher this frantically complex world that fit us.</description><pubDate>2022-10-17 02:18:03</pubDate></item><item><title>The yo -yo</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/30/o-fuxi/</link><description>O my friends, companions of these disastrous journeys through countries as old as the stars and the Moon, and as strange as the deepest interior of our wretched souls, what surprises still await us, what secret magics will we still have to overcome, what horrors will arise before our pupils dilated with astonishment and terror?
Increasingly close to our precarious existences, howling the war monster, which threatens to merge humanity with the earth, incessantly traveled by the squalid spectrum of hunger and the invisible evil of ten thousand pests.
O human human, who cries superior to his own nature, but then reveals to you, once and again, unable to simply order your existence and do not understand that you are possessed by the fickle wrath and are slave to your own ambition! Do not be content with the white jade or the light gold, there is no treasure that gives you your inextinguishable thirst for other men, animals and things; for in you an eternal anguish in you; in you crawl the expelled snakes; For you grows, powerful and impossible, the very fertile ivy of evil!
This is perhaps why on the Mount they call the White Deer, where one of the eight immortals on a sacred mount soared through the heavens towards Penglai, lives the fuxi, a bird whose shape resembles that of a rooster, although topped by a human head. What strange copulations, what monstrous embraces, what terrible procedures must have occurred to make the existence of this sinister animal possible? We don't know, but all it takes is for our exhausted mind to dare to come up with an answer, and we soon feel our skin covered in horrendous goosebumps and our heart races in parade, like a wild horse whipped by the night whip of fear, unrestrained by reins and containment.
Men should refrain from visiting Monte do Veado, because although there are riches capable of calming the wildest ambitions, if they have the unfortunate luck of catching a glimpse of a fuxi, it is certain that a war will soon break out and the cultivated fields will perish because of it, tame animals will be beheaded, because of it the best young men of two generations will be sacrificed and the land will be destroyed. pride of countries.
The fuxi makes a sound reminiscent of its name. If you hear it, dark night or clear day, be on your way, because the path you are on is the surest path to misfortune!</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Procrastinators Club</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/29/clube-dos-procrastinadores/</link><description>While rereading Easter, because of an article I'm preparing, I come across this excerpt, taken from “The Universal Man”:
«Every man morally is one and absolute; But you have to live with your personality to mitigate. (…) Coexistence is only possible among people reduced to a negative or hollow presence, which is constantly giving in. Hence, the emptiness of society, a huge ghost composed of numerous deceased. An upper man is antisocial or criminal. Its destination is jail and desert.
He is in thinking about whether she reflects here about the political-social conditioning that gagging, and worse, in a sad country as Portugal was in the middle of the Estado Novo (and the book is from 1931) where any possibilities of spontaneity and frankness in human relations were coarcet, or only lends the behavior of men (oppressed) a metaphysical frame, a “essence”, from a presumption of each one in the presumption of each one be in isolation “one and absolute”. Sometimes, to an excess of spirituality (or longing), it adds to Pascoaes to lack the world. He is a great poet, but he is a poet who takes gray-Jewish ampoules and is therefore written amiiude on a programmatic furor, ceasing to have pores; There is often a glass between him and the real, the same one who made him wring the Ballet, 1921: “Everything is ghost. There are only clouds, clouds of voices, clouds of souls, afflictions and tragedies! Clouds and more clouds, appearances and more appearances! It is a divine lightning that pierces them, the instant appearance that arises and throws us to the ground, dazzled! »
Sometimes I would like to remind him, as António Sérgio did in the article “Regeneration and Tradition, Moral and Economy”, which dedicated to Easter: “Easter, Easter My Dear Friend: You are a pure, excellent, and very noble poet, but also a victim of this social environment, like us all: of this horrible isolation that you praise and I”.
«As a child, he stole two blackbirds», says Jacinto do Prado Coelho, he stole them from a nest, and he felt remorse for that all his life. The Person, few more mischiefs are known to him. Only in Álvaro de Campos does a hint of wickedness and obscenity emerge: «Ah, and the ordinary and dirty people, who always look the same,/ Who use swear words as usual words,/ Whose sons steal from grocery store doors/ And whose daughters at the age of eight – and I think this is beautiful and I love it! –/ Decent-looking men masturbate in stairwells.” (Triumphal ode).
Both poets, driven by a certain idea of ​​sanctity, had the same inability to break the siege of their skin with the overflow of someone else's dam, the same curse of sublimating the concrete ferocity of eros with the gentleness of the verses.
Of course, they are the two "Bigger Than Life", but sometimes unnerves to watch, from my hostor's post at the Procrastinators Club, to the tantrums between them, just to see who occupies, in the internal organization, the place of president and treasurer.
Although a person has guessed more, for example, this he wrote in the least known martial ode and that is declining in the situation we live today, differently, with the heart in his hands:

My pantheistic feet stumbled on the sewing machine
[widow who was killed with a bayonet
And this poor instrument of peace put a spear in my heart.
Yes, I was the one to blame for everything, I was the soldier for them all
Who killed, raped, burned and broke,
It was me and my shame and my remorse as a shadow

And a physical dread of accounting for God makes me close the

I sent, captain, to shoot the trembling peasants,
I let the daughters of all parents tied to trees,
Now I saw that it was inside my heart that all this happened,
And all scald and suffocate and I can't move without
[Everything is the same.
God have mercy on me, I didn't have it from anyone!
Là-bas, je ne sais où… »

"Today (yesterday) marks two years since the terrible attacks perpetrated by Hamas. It is a day to reiterate our resounding condemnation of terrorism in all its forms. To call for the release of Israeli hostages. And to demand that Netanyahu stop the genocide of the Palestinian people and open a humanitarian corridor", said Pedro Sánchez, who was referring to the Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu.
“Dialogue and the consolidation of the two States [Israel and Palestine] are the only possible solution to put an end to the conflict and achieve a future of peace”, added the leader of the Government of Spain, in a message published on the social network X.
On October 7, 2023, militias led by Hamas, a terrorist group that controls the Palestinian territory of the Gaza Strip, carried out unprecedented attacks in southern Israel two years ago, during which they murdered around 1,200 people and kidnapped 251 who they took hostage to Gaza.
The Israeli army responded with an offensive against Hamas in the enclave controlled by the extremist group since 2007, which caused more than 67,100 deaths in two years and led to accusations of genocide against Israel.
Representatives of Hamas and Israel started on Monday, in Egypt, indirect negotiations on a plan proposed by US President Donald Trump to end the conflict. The 20-point plan provides for the release of hostages in Gaza, a ceasefire, the disarmament of Hamas, the removal of Israelites troops and a transient international administration of the Gaza Strip.
In these two years, the Spanish government, led by socialist Pedro Sánchez, was one of the first and the most blunt to criticize Israel's offensive in Gaza, which the Prime Minister himself qualifies as a genocide. Spain was also one of the first countries to recognize the state of Palestine in this period in May 2024.
Qatar Apos
Qatar argued yesterday that Israel should have already ceased military operations in the Gaza Strip, in accordance with US President Donald Trump's plan. “We await the results of the negotiations in the coming days regarding the ceasefire”, declared the spokesman for the Qatari Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Majed al-Ansari, quoted by the news agency France-Presse (AFP).
"This question must, first of all, be put to Israel. It should have already put an end to military operations if the Israeli prime minister's statements about adherence to Trump's plan were true", he added.</description><pubDate>2025-10-07 23:17:14</pubDate></item><item><title>Timorese university investigates professor suspected of sexual harassment</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/07/universidade-timorense-investiga-professor-suspeito-de-assedio-sexual/</link><description>The Timorese public university is investigating a professor suspected of having committed crimes of sexual harassment against female students since 2008.
"The Disciplinary Council of the National University Timor Lorosa'E (UNTL) is the one who is conducting the investigation, because we cannot make a decision without an investigation. The Council will establish an executive committee to investigate the case, listen to the victims and also the accused teacher," said UNTL rector, João Soares Martins.
The rector spoke to journalists after a public lecture by the Indonesian Minister of Culture directed at students at the University, at the Auditorium of the Faculty of Social Sciences in Dili.
A group of students from the Public Policy Department required the UNTL Rector to resign from the teacher, as he was allegedly involved in sexual harassment cases since 2008. João Soares Martins said that if it proves that the teacher committed the crime, he will have to face the consequences.
"When there are results that confirm the facts, we will take action, or prevent the teacher from continuing to teach, either by applying a suspension," said the rector. The UNTL official also stressed that if the suspicions are confirmed, the case will be referred to the Public Service Commission to take disciplinary measures, since the teacher is also a permanent civil servant.
Zero tolerance
João Soares Martins recalled that UNTL has promoted awareness-raising actions aimed at teachers and students about sexual harassment and other inappropriate conduct. “We have a dean for counseling that encourages all students or anyone who is a victim of sexual harassment or other immoral conduct to file a complaint,” said the dean.
The leader also acknowledged that UNTL seeks to create a safe environment for all, with a view to freedom in the learning process, and reiterated the university's commitment to a zero tolerance policy to sexual harassment.
Francelino Alves Correia, spokesperson for the students at the Department of Public Policy at the Faculty of Social and Political Sciences at UNTL, stated that, after a press conference, the department issued a letter requesting the suspension of the aforementioned professor's teaching hours.
“The department collaborated with the college, which in turn prepared a circular to advance the investigation into the alleged sexual predator, suspected of having committed crimes since 2008,” explained the spokesperson.</description><pubDate>2025-10-07 23:11:17</pubDate></item><item><title>Everest | Hundreds of climbers trapped due to snowstorm</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/07/evereste-centenas-de-alpinistas-presos-devido-a-tempestade-de-neve/</link><description>Rescue teams are helping hundreds of snow -trapped climbers at tourist camps on a slope of Mount Evereste, Tibeta, the Chinese state press revealed.
Around 350 climbers arrived at a meeting point in the Tingri region and rescuers were in contact with another 200, state broadcaster CCTV reported on Sunday night. The climbers were trapped at an altitude of more than 4,900 meters, according to a previous report on Jimu News, a Chinese website.
Mount Everest is around 8,850 meters high. A climber who rushed down before the snow blocked the path told Jimu News that others still on the mountain told him the snow was a meter deep and had destroyed tents.
Hundreds of rescue teams climbed the mountain on Sunday to open the way so that people arrested could go down, said the Jimu report. A video recorded by a resident showed a long line of people with horses and oxen climbing a winding track in the snow.
Snow storm took place during a national holiday of a week in China, when many people travel to the country and abroad. In another mountainous region in western China, a climber died of hypothermia and altitude illness and another 137 were removed in the northern part of Qinghai province, CCTV reported Monday.
The search in an area in Menyuan County, with an average altitude of over 4,000 meters, has been complicated by the ground, unpredictable climate and continuous nevions, can also be read in a CCTV 'online' report. Mount Evereste, known as Mount Qomolangma in Chinese, is on the border between China and Nepal, where the heavy rains made more than 40 dead.

The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs indicated, in a statement, that Beijing will take advantage of Li Qiang's visit to “strengthen strategic communication, strengthen exchanges and cooperation, and promote the continued development of traditional friendly and cooperative relations between China and North Korea”.
"China and North Korea are traditional and friendly neighbors. Maintaining, consolidating and developing well-Norte-Korean relations has always been a firm and unshakable strategic policy of the Chinese party and government," it reads in the note.
Last week, the Chinese Prime Minister met in Beijing with the North Korean Foreign Minister, Choe Son-hui, to whom he assured that China is willing to “strengthen exchanges and interactions” with North Korea “at all levels”.
During the meeting, Li assured that China values ​​North Korea's “consistent and firm support” on issues that affect China's “core interests and main concerns”. Choe, for his part, declared that “consolidating and developing relations with China” is Pyongyang’s “unshakable position.”
Li's presence in North Korea comes a month after North Korean leader Kim Jong-un traveled to the Chinese capital to attend a military parade to mark the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II in the Pacific. Beijing continues to be Pyongyang's main political ally and economic partner, in a scenario marked by international sanctions against North Korea and the country's growing military cooperation with Russia.</description><pubDate>2025-10-07 23:05:51</pubDate></item><item><title>HK | Seized anesthetic linked to synthetic drugs that killed three people</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/07/hk-apreendido-anestesico-ligado-a-droga-sintetica-que-matou-tres-pessoas/</link><description>Hong Kong police announced the seizure of 850 grams of an anesthetic used to produce a new synthetic drug, known as 'space oil', which is believed to have caused at least three deaths in the territory.
In a statement released on Sunday, Customs in the semi-autonomous Chinese region said the anesthetic etomidate was seized on the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge, the world's longest sea crossing. The substance, in powder form, was found hidden inside two cans of powdered milk for children, inside a private vehicle that had crossed the bridge to enter Hong Kong, on Saturday.
The driver, aged 41, and the passenger, aged 49, were both arrested. Police later found, among the passenger's belongings, an etomidate capsule, which can be consumed in electronic cigarette devices. The quantity of etomidate seized had a street value of 2.3 million Hong Kong dollars.
Made in Malaysia
Ethomidate, an intravenous short action anesthetic, is mainly used in emergency services, anesthesia units, surgery rooms and intensive care units.
According to Hong Kong media, police said at a press conference that the seized substance had originally been sent from Malaysia to the neighboring region of Macau. In February, Hong Kong security forces announced the seizure of three kilograms of etomidate at the airport, inside unclaimed luggage from Malaysia.
In early November, Hong Kong authorities confirmed suspicions that at least three deaths are related to 'space oil'. In February, the territory implemented new protocols involving more rigorous control not only about drug storage, but also on documentation and handling requirements in local hospitals.
Ethomidate was included in a list of hazardous products targeted by restrictions, raising the maximum penalty for possession of ‘space oil” to seven years in prison and a fine of one million dollars from Hong Kong. The trafficking or illegal importation of this substance has become a maximum penalty of perpetual imprisonment and a fine of five million dollars of Hong Kong.
Macau also revealed in December that the police have already detected four cases linked to this narcotic since the first case of 'space oil' found in a local school, in October 2023. This drug is known in Hong Kong as the 'zombie drug' because it can cause serious physical and mental harm, including addiction, memory loss, convulsions, loss of consciousness and even death.</description><pubDate>2025-10-07 23:04:40</pubDate></item><item><title>Africa | Import of panels from China helps break record in solar energy</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/07/africa-importacao-de-paineis-da-china-ajuda-a-bater-recorde-na-energia-solar/</link><description>Consultant Oxford Economics said Monday that the increase in the purchase of African countries' solar panels to China helped solar capacity by July to hit the record with 9,516 megawatts (MW).
“Africa, with its vast solar potential, is experiencing an increase in imports of solar panels from China; this influx is boosting the continent's generation capacity, with imports this year until July reaching a record 9,516 MW”, reads an analysis from the African department of this British consultancy.
In a commentary on the evolution of solar energy production on the African continent, sent to customers and what Lusa had access to, analysts write that the reduction in solar facilities costs has made Africa solar capacity increase.
"The lifetime cost of solar energy has fallen dramatically over the past decade, and it is now considered the cheapest form of electrical energy in history. These lower costs are driving increased investment and generation around the world, with global solar energy capacity more than doubling in the last three years."
For Africa, this means an important benefit, analysts point out: “Sub -Saharan Africa has the lowest access to the world's electricity, with only 53.3 percent of the electrified population in 2023, well below the global average of 91.6 percent, and many African countries also face a poorly reliable supply and high electricity costs, which makes economic development difficult”.
The amount of solar panel imports by capacity reached a record value of 1,702 MW in July 2025, but looking at the first seven months of the year, solar imports by capacity increased to 9,516 MW, compared to 6,625 MW last year, which represents a 43 percent increase.
By parts
By country, the biggest increases in imports of solar energy production capacity over these seven months were from South Africa (+1,790 MW), Algeria (+1,073 MW), Nigeria (+1,064 MW) and Egypt (+798 MW), the Oxford Economics report also reads.
Expanding electricity supplies significantly “could be transformative, as it would reduce the cost of living and support industries needed to create jobs and increase productivity”, adds Oxford Economics, noting, however, that the risks to increasing solar energy production in Africa remain significant.
“The intermittency of solar energy means that Africa still needs to invest in basic infrastructure to guarantee a reliable supply, and many state-owned utility companies view private solar energy as a threat, creating barriers for independent producers”, which makes it difficult to make energy available in the most remote areas of the continent, analysts conclude.</description><pubDate>2025-10-07 23:02:42</pubDate></item><item><title>Japan | Former minister should become the first woman to lead the country</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/06/japao-ex-ministra-deve-tornar-se-a-primeira-mulher-a-liderar-o-pais/</link><description>Sanae Takaichi, a right-wing nationalist, was elected Saturday leader of the Democratic Liberal Party (PLD) and should soon become the first woman to hold the position of Prime Minister of Japan.
The PLD-a party leading the government-may have lost the absolute majority in both parliament chambers this year, but opposition seems too fragmented to prevent Takaichi from being elected Prime Minister in the coming days, in October 13, according to local media.
Sanae Takaichi, 64, will succeed Shigeru Ishiba, who was elected head of government in October 2024 and resigned last month. In the second scrutiny, which took place Saturday and in which only the elected representatives and PLD members were voted, Sanae Takaichi surpassed the minister of agriculture, Shinjiro Koizumi, 44.

According to North Korea's official news agency, KCNA, the revelation took place on Saturday, in a speech given at the opening of a weapons exhibition in Pyongyang, but Kim did not disclose details about the “special means”. “The nuclear alliance between the United States and South Korea is progressing rapidly, and they are conducting various types of exercises to test dangerous scenarios,” said the North Korean leader.
"As US military personnel reinforce their arsenal in the South Korea region, our strategic concerns about this region also intensify and therefore allocated our special key resources," Kim said. The North Korean leader assured that he was “closely accompanied” the military developments across the border.
"The enemy (…) will have to worry about changes in his security environment," he said. Photos released by KCNA show Kim to walk in front of weapons, including a missile, surrounded by North Korean generals in an exhibition center.
Promises to fulfill
On September 22, the North Korean leader declared his willingness to resume dialogue with the United States if they stop demanding that Pyongyang abandon its nuclear weapons program. “If the United States abandons its delusional obsession with denuclearization and, recognizing reality, truly wishes to coexist peacefully with us, then there is no reason why we cannot sit at the table with them,” Kim said.
“I have good memories of the current North American President, Donald Trump”, he added. North Korea carried out six nuclear tests between 2006 and 2017 and has since continued to develop its arsenal despite heavy international sanctions. Pyongyang justifies its military nuclear program with the threats it claims to face from the United States and its allies, including South Korea.</description><pubDate>2025-10-06 05:35:37</pubDate></item><item><title>Cuca Roseta, fado singer: “Fado is samba-poetry sung from the heart”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/06/cuca-roseta-fadista-o-fado-e-um-samba-poesia-cantado-vindo-do-coracao/</link><description>In the pandemic sang to the audience of Macau through a videoConcerto, but now the fadista gives herself from soul and heart to a concert with the Chinese orchestra of Macau, integrated on the poster of the International Macao Music Festival, next Saturday, 11. In an interview with HM, Cuca Roseta speaks of the alignment of the show, the 15 years of career and the truth found in his authorship.
Acts in Macao on October 11 with the Chinese orchestra of Macao (OCM). Tell me a little about what we can expect from this show.
Yes, we are finally going to Macau. It will be the first time because we previously did a video concert for Macau during the pandemic, and we were unable to be there physically. We now work with OCM, which is very good, and I am happy with this partnership, for being able to unite, in some way, two cultures. We are a little anxious about that fact.
The concert will have songs such as “Meu”, “Preto e Branco”, “Canção do Mar”, “Não Sei de Onde” and “Finalmente”. What does this alignment bring us?
We already had arrangements made for orchestra by Marinho de Freitas, which are extraordinary arrangements, and which will be adapted to the traditional OCM instruments. These songs are practically all written by me, lyrics and music, and tell different stories, some that I have lived myself or stories that, in some way, I have experienced someone living very closely. They are original fados. “Canção do Mar” is very old and became known in the voices of Dulce Pontes and Amália Rodrigues, and has a new arrangement. We thought it would look beautiful with OCM. Of course, there are songs that we always sing and that never leave the repertoire, linked to traditional phases of my career. There are some songs that people like and request, but we bring a completely different repertoire to what we presented at the time [in Macau, with the video concert], which was very well received. It was a concert that went very well, even though it was via video, and we received wonderful messages.
This year released the album “Even Faith Forgot”, which has an exclusively Brazilian repertoire, with several names of Brazilian music, such as Seu Jorge or Zeca Pagodinho. Why explore this universe, mixing it with the language of fado?
Yes, but this year I will also release a French album with the agent of Amália Rodrigues, who made me this invitation. But "even faith forgot" came from an invitation from a great Brazilian producer to record old sambas, and that have a lot to do with fado. Although it is a Brazilian album, all with sambas, it is my saddest album of all, more melancholy. Hence we went looking for this samba root to find great poets and great composers that Brazil has, and which have this weight that fado also has.
As?
Fado has a lot to do with words and composition, in fact, Fado is samba-poetry sung from the heart, because there has to be this truth in the interpretation, the idea of ​​truth coming from life's experiences, in transforming the story it tells. This melancholy is in the veins of Portuguese blood and is mixed with art and music. This invitation wanted to put a fado singer to sing seriously and with the weight that Fado brings, and be able to interpret the great poets and sambas. The album [Até a Fé Se Esqueceu] has very old sambas, one of them from 1937. It is, therefore, a very strong and even very beautiful album, with great poems and composers, such as Tom Jobim, Vinicius de Morais, and wonderful partnerships with Seu Jorge and Zeca Pagodinho, who came to Fado. It's an album that made me really proud.

Therefore, it is possible to marry Fado with the joy of samba, which also has a melancholic side, right? Like the melancholy of our Fado.
In fact, when we hear the word samba we think of joy, but in fact the base of samba is not joy. There is that phrase of Vinicius de Morais, "to make a samba with beauty it takes a bit of sadness, if not, no samba is done." So this is where the beauty of this work falls, which goes to the root of samba and shows that there are no such differences between the melancholy of the root of samba and the melancholy of fado. It is a nostalgic and melancholy album, it does not bring this joy. It can bring hope, and we can say that some themes bring with it this hope, which we find in Brazilian culture and in the drums. Because they literally put the sorrows on the wheel of skirt and drums, aren't they? They transform the sadness into dance and music, but in this work we do not see this kind of samba.
Cuca also has a previous album, “Cabo Verde Nha Cretcheu”, so it can be said that she has explored, in her career, the different Portuguese-speaking sounds, going beyond Fado, mixing sounds?
This album has not departed from my will, and I think [it's a sign] life leads me deep down. This album is born from a tour I made for the nine islands of Cape Verde with the live recording of the warm I sang on each island, because I sang the traditional warm of each island. Between one island and another there are very different warm. What I did was, after my Fado concerts, sang two warm and then compilationed all the themes in Creole in celebration of the fact that it was the first international artist to make the nine islands in a row. But I was also in Goa and did my concert in Concanim. I have ease and I like to learn the traditional songs from the countries where I will sing. I already sang in Moscow and learned a Russian song; I learned the songs of Goa, and at Georgia, in Tiblisi, I also learned a song. It is a treat I do when I travel the world to take the fado. But the warm is wonderful and there really is like this musical genre, and wanted to bring to Cape Verdeans this meeting between Fado and the warm, and this album, which is beautiful.
Once it goes to Macau, can we expect a song in Cantonese, or Mandarin?
Yes. I had already spoken to my manager to contact someone in this regard, so that we could discover a traditional song I could learn.
Last year, he celebrated 15 years of career. How do you review your career, which began with the albums “Cuca Roseta” and “Raiz”?
In fact, it was great to celebrate the 15th anniversary at MEO Arena [Lisbon Show Room] and be able to revisit all albums from the first. The "root" has opened something that is rarer, which is the fadista compose and write her lyrics. This was a disk that went wonderfully well and, from there, it was good, because in this search for the truth that fado has, being able to compose and write the letters themselves is always to give us a little more. Each person composes and writes in their own way, and when it can do it, it is always a little like the palm lines, that is, it is something unique. In this search that people do by following patterns to achieve success, I believe this exists when we are not afraid to follow our voice and instinct, what comes from our hearts, tell our stories and sing our melodies without fear. In this way we end up becoming unique. Although not usual in fado a fado singer composing and writing, it was beautiful to see that my songs became important to many fans. Sometimes I have great composers and poets [collaborating with me], but I think [writing and composing] brings this side of the person being real. My poems can never be compared to those of the great poets I've ever sung, but I think people feel that I'm more on my skin. In a way, this touches them and thrills them. Celebrating the 15 years of career was the closure of one cycle and the beginning of another, and it was great to go back to the root, and to realize that it was in it that was the "gunpowder", in the sense that we were not afraid of ourselves.</description><pubDate>2025-10-06 05:24:32</pubDate></item><item><title>Hui So-Ying, protagonist of the movie “Ah Ying”: “To represent is being human”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/30/hui-so-ying-protagonista-do-filme-ah-ying-representar-e-ser-se-humano/</link><description>In 1983, Hong Kong's cinema, by Allen Fong's lens, revealed “Ah Ying”, a film that portrays the hard life of a girl who sells fish on the market and dreams of being an actress. This girl was Hui So-Ying and "Ah Ying" was inspired by her life. HM talked to the actress on the sidelines of the “Making Waves-2nd Hong Kong Cinema Show”, which took place this weekend in Lisbon
 
How did you get involved in this film project?
The main reason I got involved in this movie was because my theater teacher passed away. So I felt that I needed to do something to honor him, because he taught me to represent. So I tried to be an actress. Subsequently, when [the director] Allen Fong met me, he found my life story interesting, also eventually meeting some of my family members. Then he asked if they were also interested in participating in the movie, which led many of them to enter the project as well. The film also shows the environment in which my teacher lived, is a portrait of experiences and stories lived by me and my teacher.
The film portrays life in Hong Kong in those times. How did you prepare for the character?
The beauty of this movie is very related to the collaborations that were made, namely in photography and costumes. It was necessary many collaborations to create the beauty that exists in the movie. It was hard work to take on the character [of Ah Ying], because the story was conceived to describe some of my past experiences, and that's what the director wanted to do. But that was hard for me, because there were some things I didn't want to face, but I had to do it. Of course then I realized that, deep down, it was nothing, and I even felt relieved after finishing the filming. Thinking whether the story was an art form or reality, when I was representing, I had to enter the situation of the moment because, in fact, the [Real] episode had passed, but I had to have certain feelings again during the representation. As an actress, it was a great test.
"Ah Ying" is considered one of the great films of the so -called "new vacancy" of Hong Kong cinema. During the round, expected the success of the movie?
I didn't think about it, but throughout the project I thought that Allen Fong was a very daring director, because a film of this kind had never been made in the entire history of Hong Kong cinema. It's a kind of “docudrama”, and he had the strength and courage to innovate the way he filmed it, which, at the time, was unprecedented.
What was the big challenge you faced in this movie?
It was having to return to my old self. There were things I didn't want to face and I had to face them again, with the same feeling I had at that time.
Many years have passed between 1983 and the present. Looking back, what meaning did this film have for you, as a person and actress?
In fact, after seeing the film, I saw it as just a story. For me, acting is being human, every day is a performance.
The film portrays Hong Kong's life in the 80s and gained a restored version. What do you think this project can bring to a younger audience to see the movie today?
This year the movie has been screened several times, and I always do the same question, if people don't understand the movie or if they think it can't be immersive enough. In fact, given my experience, most younger viewers responded that this is not the case, that the movie is quite real. It doesn't seem to me that this movie is outdated or out of fashion just because times have progressed or society has changed. I don't think that.
"Ah Ying" ended in Lisbon the second edition of "Making Waves - Hong Kong Cinema Show." How do you feel to see this movie screened in Portugal?
I found it interesting. I never thought the movie could be screened in this show, I don't know if it was because there is a restored copy. Before this new version it was harder to display it. The audience can see a movie that shows family relationships lived in the 1980s, and I think that the film can be immersive [on the subject] when it addresses family conflicts, because everyone has a family. Seeing the film may wonder what the relationship with your family members is like. Of course I also hope you have learned more about Hong Kong. But although this movie is set in the 1980s, it focuses a lot on family and interpersonal relationships.
Is there any episode of the filming that has marked it?
Throughout the movie there were several moments, but the one that left me biggest impressions was the last scene, of the interview, where I was talking to a chair, but it was like I was talking to my teacher. When I see this scene again I am always moved, because my teacher has passed away, but all this still impresses me a lot.</description><pubDate>2025-09-30 00:42:01</pubDate></item><item><title>Jorge Figueira, architect and academic at the University of Coimbra: “The heroic relationships” of Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/03/jorge-figueira-arquitecto-e-academico-da-universidade-de-coimbra-as-relacoes-heroicas-de-macau/</link><description>It has long written and thinks architecture, and since time Jorge Figueira, architect, academic at the University of Coimbra, does it in Macau. After a session this week that highlighted the former Fai Chi Kei Public Housing Complex, Manuel Vicente, Jorge Figueira today approaches the Rui Cunha Foundation O Legado de Nuno Portas
 
Today participates in the Conference “Nuno Portas: From Architecture to Urbanism, from man to city”. What legacy did this Portuguese architect have left?
Nuno Portas is someone who, at the end of the 50s, had a critical activity that was completely innovative and pioneering in the Portuguese context. Then, in the 60s, he had a more international activity, having been the first to publicize the work of Siza Vieira. It was there that he had his first contacts with Spanish and Italian architects, mainly. During those years he also wrote two books that were also unusual, such as “Architecture for Today”, in 1964, and “City as Architecture”, in 1969. They were also an extraordinary way of trying to understand what was happening in terms of international currents in architecture. But later he also had an [important] activity as an architect alongside Nuno Teotónio Pereira, namely in the work on the Church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, in Lisbon, and in a house in Vila Viçosa. Then, on April 25, 1974, he was appointed Secretary of State for Housing and Urbanism and launched SAAL – Outpatient Services for Local Support, a completely revolutionary social housing program, in keeping with the spirit of the time. Afterwards, Nuno Portas dedicated himself more to urban planning issues and not so much to architecture. He was linked to the beginning of Expo 98. He ended up being someone who, in the last 20 years of his work, began to have more scientific and sociological concerns, and less artistic ones. It's something he had from the beginning, but later it became the center of his activity.
Did Nuno Portas have a relationship with Macau?
I think that the relationships would not be as intense compared to other architects and contexts, but we know that Nuno Portas was in Macau at the invitation of the Government for a conference, between 2001 and 2002. It is interesting because from this passage we have echoes of what happened, such as his surprise when discovering Manuel Vicente's Ellen Liang orphanage, which he did not know about. It was Manuel Vicente's first work in Macau, in the 60s, and we know that Nuno Portas was moved when visiting this work, especially the small chapel that exists in the orphanage. It's interesting because there was no direct relationship between Manuel Vicente and Nuno Portas, they are figures at very different poles, and even opposites. There is also an interesting and positive reference to the Siza plan [Vieira, Plano de Expansão da Cidade de Macau (Areia Preta e Porto Exterior, 1982), which is being built when Nuno Portas visits Macau. It is interesting that he commented on this plan because in the 60s and 70s the relationship between Nuno Portas and Siza Vieira was no longer the same, and the fact that he made complimentary references to Siza is very interesting.
He was a student of Nuno Portas. What other aspects of your career or personality can you highlight?
I also worked with him. He was a cultured man, very intelligent and with an overwhelming memory. It was someone who liked to provoke, but in a good way, to discuss, to counteract. I was lucky enough to maintain a dialogue with him for decades, and this is my personal knowledge that I will convey. I also notice that it was a man very close to the power of Lisbon, the parties, but always very independent. He was a personal friend of Jorge Sampaio, he was secretary of state, but never had great political protagonism. On the one hand, this is due to his independence, but on the other he was such a controversial and intelligently restless figure that I think power was also startled by him.
This week he also spoke at the conference “Lisbon, Porto, Macau, Maputo: Heroic Collective Housing from the 60s &amp; 70s”. How do you describe Macau’s public housing projects in those years?
There are many architects I could talk about, but I focused on the work of Manuel Vicente in Macau, namely the public housing complex in Fai Chi Kei, which was demolished and later gave rise to the project by Rui Leão and Carlota Bruni. I didn't specifically talk about Portuguese or Macanese architects, we also have names like, for example, José Maneiras. Especially because Portuguese architects have always been few in Portugal, and from the 1950s there were around 150, later increasing greatly in number. But I paid [at the conference] a tribute to the Portuguese architects who built during that period, because in a complex territory and with its vicissitudes, different from those that existed in Portugal, they knew how to carry out extraordinary architectural experiments in the field of public housing. I tried to demonstrate what was happening in Lisbon, Porto, Macau and Lourenço Marques, now Maputo, in different ways. In Macau, relationships were established, which I call heroic, in the sense that they were relationships of experimental architecture, in which people had to adapt, have their own spirit. These are architectures that already have a bit of history, as 50 or 60 years have passed, but the examples we find in these cities continue to be remarkable.
What projects highlight these years?
I spoke about the “Pantera Cor-de-Rosa” housing development, by Gonçalo Byrne, in Chelas, Lisbon. I showed “Cinco Fingers”, by Vítor Figueiredo, also from Lisbon, and “Bairro da Bouça”, by Siza Vieira, in Porto. I showed the Fai Chi Kei complex, by Manuel Vicente, and a project by Pancho Guedes in Mozambique. Despite being distant in time, these are architectures that remain fundamental references from a cultural and architectural point of view. There is a kind of narrative luck in being able to talk about such different places, and with such different architects, and show how they had this heroic, experimental, moving, even radical side that the architecture of that period in particular had.
Has Macao had a positive evolution with regard to public housing supply?
I arrived in August and have been visiting the territory in recent years, so I have been following this process a little. Macao is obviously an extraordinary territory and from the outset by the coexistence of very different cultures regarding housing, which here has a completely different scale and expression of the Portuguese. In Portugal there is an aversion to public housing towers, it has always been unusual and the results that are known have not been successful for various reasons. But in Macao this is exactly what we see, public housing in towers and with a very strong expression. This has to do with the characteristics of the territory and also with a certain culture of China and Hong Kong. This is not to say that everything that is being built in Macau is good, there are towers and buildings with less interesting solutions or that result from a certain repetition. But there is no city that only has good architecture or good public housing. The challenge is to solve the large -scale housing problem, something that must be studied and thought. It is beautiful and overwhelming to see that Macau is a territory that grows day after day and it is exciting to observe this from the point of view of architecture. This is what I am doing, working on future projects.
Analysis projects, or academic?
Yes, I'm a professor and researcher at the University of Coimbra and a columnist for the Público newspaper, so my job is to analyze and investigate. I've already published a lot about Macau and I want to go back to some points that I left unresolved, so to speak. I am very encouraged by everything I have seen and the people I have spoken to, and perhaps I will increase my work on the territory from an academic and research point of view.
At a time when Portugal has a chronic housing problem, with a lack of public housing, could Macau be an example?
No directly, because of the typological issue of the housing tower. It might not be a welcome model in the Portuguese context. But no doubt Portugal needs to learn from other experiences and other territories and need to find solutions. Surely what happens in Hong Kong and Macau are experiences that are very interested in knowing, not to replicate, but to realize that this is a global problem [the lack of housing].
Remember Nuno Portas
The Rui Cunha Foundation (FRC) will host today, starting at 6:30 pm, the conference “Nuno Portas: from architecture to urbanism, from man to city”, with Jorge Figueira. It will be time to talk about a journey that the recently deceased architect began in 1959, with a text about the new generation of the Modern Movement in Portugal. Texts followed in the 60s and 70s with “scientific approaches”, with Nuno Portas wandering between architecture and urbanism, always in a reflective way. Nuno Portas was a “multifaceted figure, best known for launching the SAAL social housing program, which is still the subject of research and an example today”, describes Jorge Figueira in a note. The speaker is linked to the Center for Social Studies and the Department of Architecture of the University of Coimbra.</description><pubDate>2025-09-03 23:33:07</pubDate></item><item><title>Anabela Santiago, academic: “China is reformist and moderate”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/30/anabela-santiago-academica-a-china-e-reformista-e-moderada/</link><description>Anabela Santiago has just defended at the University of Aveiro the doctoral thesis that analyzes how China has been positioned in recent decades as an important actor in the “global health governance”. Today, Beijing seeks “alternative mechanisms” of cooperation in the “global south” and tries to build an alternative model to the World Health Organization
 
 
Let's start with the concept of Global Health Governance (GGS). Is this a more contemporary concept or relating to the post-war period and the Foundation of the World Health Organization (WHO)? What have been the main actors of this governance until China's growth?
GGS is a concept whose prominence and relevance have grown significantly in the 21st century, largely driven by economic globalization and worldwide interconnection. Although global health has always transcended national borders, demanding multidisciplinary approaches and international cooperation, only from the 1990s it was made greater awareness of it. Historically, GGS has been predominantly influenced by western powers and neoliberal values. The main actors of this governance, until China's growth, were historically marked by interventions of entities such as WHO and non-governmental, predominantly American and European organizations.
One of the findings of its doctoral thesis is that China has been progressively positioning itself in this leadership. This position started specifically when and why?
Yes, China has progressively positioned itself as a key player in the evolution of the GGS system. Although it is not possible to pinpoint an exact start date, China has evolved from a relatively isolated country to a major player in the global political, economic and technological arenas. Its growing economic and political influence also represents a change in the historical dynamics of the GGS, as in the 1960s China tried to play a role in humanitarian health assistance in neighboring countries and in Africa. The thesis highlights that China's experience can be seen as an example of what is achievable when a State chooses its own path instead of a pre-established model, aligning with the prediction of the 21st century as the “Asian Century”.
Did the pandemic years influence this position? How?
Covid-19 pandemic highlighted the need for global health cooperation, as well as the potential consequences of the failure to prioritize global health. The thesis explores the evolution of the Health Silk Route before and after the pandemic, indicating that the pandemic years allowed greater awareness of the need for instruments such as the Health Silk Route as the most effective cooperation platforms among nations. Although not detailed in this specific section, it is implicit that the pandemic intensified China's performance in health diplomacy and health development assistance.
Looking at the internal reforms that China has carried out in the health sector, which ones do you highlight as the most important?
I approach, in the thesis, the reforms of the China Health System and I point out that the Chinese governance model is a unique combination of state -oriented economic reforms and development by the state, incorporating elements of neoliberalism and authoritarianism into political issues in general, and the health sector is nothing different from the rest. One of China's mentioned contributions, recognized by WHO, is its primary health care model based on the recognized good practice of “barefoot doctors” (barefoot doctors). In addition, the thesis analyzes the main reform policies and their progress and challenges in the period 2009-2018, which comprise the reforms of primary health care, hospital and pharmaceutical reform. The “Healthy China 2030” program is also an important and ambitious reference of China's domestic reforms in health, also encompassing social determinants.
Is Beijing's intention to create an alternative entity to WHO, or simply create an alternative movement that can coexist with WHO, in the context of the relationship with the global south? How could this work?
The thesis suggests that China adopts a “dual approach”: while integrating into existing global structures, it simultaneously forges alternative paths, particularly through regional alliances such as the BRICS and partnerships with the Global South. This indicates an intention to create an alternative movement that can coexist with and complement the role of the WHO, rather than a direct alternative entity. China demonstrates a clear commitment to aligning the objectives of the “Belt and Road” initiative with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, showing its willingness to present these initiatives as complements to the cooperation mechanisms already existing in the international liberal order. President Xi Jinping's vision of a “Community of Shared Future for Humanity”, which includes the notion of “Global Health Community for All”, also points to a new perspective in the scope of international cooperation.
Traditional Chinese Masks, Vaccines and Medicine (MTC): What are China's products or instruments to position itself as an increasingly global actor in GGS?
The thesis points out that China is an indispensable provider of global public health, essential for the product supply chain, such as masks and vaccines. The MTC is also mentioned as one of China's great contributions to global health governance, with its chinese herbal treatments, some of which already recognized by WHO in 2017. In addition, Chinese medical assistance and medical teams sent to other regions of the globe are important instruments of Chinese health diplomacy.
In creating an alternative movement or reality to the WHO, could China be taking advantage of the lack of full representation in that same WHO, or gaps in its functioning?
The thesis does not directly address whether China is taking advantage of a lack of full representation in the WHO or gaps in its functioning. However, she emphasizes that the work aims to fill a gap in scientific knowledge regarding the health governance paradigm from a non-Western and liberal perspective, emphasizing China as an actor in the Global South. This suggests that China seeks to strengthen alternative models that can offer more personalized solutions to health challenges, different from those advocated by Western countries, positioning itself as a moderate reformist actor.
How has the European Union (EU) foreign policy in relation to China affecting or influenced this position of the country in global health governance?
In the thesis, the fourth publication, entitled "Challenges on the European Union-China Cooperation in Higher Education from" People-To-People Dialogue ’Perspective: The Case of Health-Related Joint Projects," explores cooperation in higher education, in particular that includes health-related projects. Therefore, despite the strategic and economic dialogue, the deterioration of UE-china bilateral relations intensified, with the commission to assume a decline of enthusiasm due to “China's countermeasures to EU human rights sanctions, economic coercion and commercial measures against the single market, and the positioning of China in the war in Ukraine”. Although challenges and tensions are recognized, cooperation in higher education, including health projects, is seen as part of a broader picture of strategic partnership between EU and China. However, it is evident that there is no long tradition of health cooperation between EU and China in higher education, and that there are few joint projects compared to the general panorama. It is suggested that both EU and China should make more efforts to align medical study curricula and promote more joint research in areas related to health, infectious diseases, among others.
In the Trump 2.0 era, and without a pandemic, what could China's role be in global health governance?
Although the thesis is published this year, it focuses on the preceding period and includes the pandemic, where it does not speculate directly on a future scenario of “Trump 2.0” without pandemic. However, the thesis argues that China is not just a participant, but a moderate reformist force in the formation of global health standards. Regardless of future political scenarios, their growing economic and political influence, strategic health diplomacy, internal reforms and initiatives such as the Health Silk Route will continue to shape their role in global health governance. The view of a “global health community for all” also remains a guiding principle for China's efforts.
Does this power of China in GGS verify more with bilateral or multilateral agreements?
The thesis suggests that China's power in global health governance manifests itself through both bilateral and multilateral agreements, but with a growing emphasis on certain forms of cooperation that strengthen their role in the global south and through alternative mechanisms. Although the thesis does not explicitly quantify the predominance between bilateral and multilateral, the focus on regional alliances (BRICS) and partnerships with the Global South (which often involve bilateral agreements and group cooperation initiatives) and the Health Silk Route indicate a hybrid approach.</description><pubDate>2025-06-30 23:46:26</pubDate></item><item><title>Piménio Ferreira: “Anti-igan rhetoric has always worked in Portugal”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2021/04/26/pimenio-ferreira-a-retorica-anti-cigana-sempre-funcionou-em-portugal/</link><description>Piménio Ferreira, better known as Gitelles Ferreira, anti-racist militant, 34, physical engineer, national Romani. He is a man with a provocative speech, a corrosive, kind mood and a smile that leaves no one indifferent
Gitelles, we live in an intercultural land and gypsies – in particular – have lived in Portugal for around five centuries. What happens so that gypsy communities continue to be “on the margins” of so-called society? 
The model of society remains to be changed. This is extremely stratified by placing people in subordinate places to privilege a violent minority. The white social structure is patriarchal and racist. What is called the "margin" of society is actually an intrinsic place to it, which belongs to it. In other words, Gypsy people have been included in this model of society since they discovered Europe and its kingdoms. The problem is the model of society that is maintained and the place to which they were relegated and how they were relegated: with violence, in inferior status against whites, without the right to human dignity, to constitute a family, to choose one's own language and religion, expropriated from any and all cultural and material law. A place built and maintained to this day by violence and genocidal and ethnicidal persecution. In 1463, a Gitano Vasco was drowned to an estate. In 1521, Gitans, or Gypsies, were already used as a reference for all that is considered bad in the model of society. The "counter-exemple" in the face of the white that would stand out for the positive. The 'angel' and the 'devil'; the 'other', the enemy; That against whom any attack and persecution is legitimate. Including the prohibition of defending, having weapons, any kind of goods, and the right of permanence.
And is this right to permanence that we still have nomadic gypsy communities within the country is denied?
Yes, without a doubt. There are many ways to force nomadism: directly, by prohibiting permanence and expelling with police or military force; indirectly, refusing public or private housing to Roma people, because they are Roma; and also through the gentrification process.
I read the results of a survey by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, where it is said that approximately 80% of Roma respondents live below the risk of poverty threshold in their country; one in three gypsies lives in a house without running water; one in three Roma belongs to a family in which someone went to bed hungry at least once in the previous month; and 50% of Roma aged between 6 and 24 do not attend school. Why does this happen like this? 
It is the historic persecution that continues. There is no impoverishment that does not have an external cause. In this case, a political system of total expropriation is imposed on the basis of violence. As early as 1648, D João IV, the Restorer, prohibited ‘giving or renting houses to gypsies’. The same D João IV who achieved the kingdom of Portugal thanks to D. Jerónimo da Costa and his 250 Knights. The same D. Jerónimo da Costa who died defending Portugal's independence from Castile. Gypsy, like his wife and children. Among prohibitions on permanence, “that gypsies do not enter the kingdom and those who are in it leave” (D João III, 1526), ​​with expulsions, banishment to the galleys, expropriation of goods and properties, imposed with penalties of flogging, mutilation and death, systematically carried out to this day (even in 2011 the Municipal Council of Faro wanted to ban gypsies in the municipality).
The prohibition of working for others (no one employs gypsy workers, and those who do do so in complete precariousness, for poorly paid positions and without rights and dignified conditions). They are unable to remain dependent on self-employment, they are unable to invest, due to extreme expropriation. They become dependent on precariousness. If you want to know what it's like to live in pure neoliberalism, get to know the lives of gypsies. The reality of these is paradigmatic of the aggression and lack of protection that the “lords” are willing to go to, for their own benefit.
What are you talking about, is it economic and political power?
The group of political, social, cultural and economic power. The owner, the colonizer. This group that has been in power since it established the system of current domination. And that only makes sense within the hierarchically stratified sociopolitical model in which we live. Hence the need to end 'gentlemen' and institute a new model of society, healthy, free, without hierarchies or strata, whether of race, class or gender.
The model in which we live leads the gypsy community (and beyond) to economic exclusion, removing them from access to the consumption of products or excluding them from their production process; political exclusion associated with lack of access to information; to education and consequently the social exclusion seen in the inequality of access to quality community areas such as restaurants, libraries, theater, cinema, concerts, healthcare, etc. How does a gypsy child feel when they realize they are not part of the whole? Children who never see themselves represented, not in films, not in books, not in cartoons, not even in an advertisement eating cereal, for example? Is this a disaster for self-esteem, is it a priori condemnation?
The question is that. Gypsy people are not “excluded from society”, by contrast, they are included in it. The problem is the existence of what is cynically called 'social exclusion', which term Orwellian, and there be under coercion, people. Which field of concentration and extermination. Incidentally, Nazi concentration camps are a more visual realization than called 'social exclusion' and, as here, were not a 'excluded' part of Nazi society, but rather its fundamental and characterizing structure. It is a place of violence, where people are maintained by violence, dedicated to their extermination, and designed so that few people can leave. And yet they resist. As in Nazi concentration camps.
And what you have listed as an example of 'consequence' of this 'exclusion', is actually the means by which this exclusion also happens and remains. Gypsy people are out of theaters, both as consumers and producers (but go to the cinema). They are out of school, education and the gym. Either as 'users' or as producers (but go to school and are on the basis of knowledge construction and academic and scientific debates).
Even in the attack on the gypsy child's self-confidence, we speak of a mechanism for maintaining this situation. But gypsy people respond very well: with gypsy pride. Another resistance, another aggression. Gypsy people are thus included in society. In a place that belongs to this modern model of society. And they resist and counter the power of domination and insist on being in the city, in the cinema, in the theater, in the Academy, in all spaces. With a lot of struggle and always resisting, but they are there. Social exclusion, more than a “place outside of society”, is part of its social structure.
Do you mean to say there is collective resistance?
At work, already in a context of absolute precariousness, during the pandemic, Gypsy people rolled up sleeves and showed once again proactivity and creativity in adversity. They learned seeing and doing. And here, it is again the women who jump to the front line, face, learn to use digital tools with their daughters or children, and throw themselves into the network. And so they explore online sales as well as application by application (transportation or rehabs). In housing, in a context of pandemic in which the evictions were not locked - as they owed and dictated the law itself - residents did not fail to organize and fight unjust evictions and claim dignity in housing; associations of allied residents in their action with other housing and anti-racist struggle organizations.
It is also worth noting how they reinvented themselves and intensified to collect and distribute food items and mask/alcohol gel kits to the most expropriated people. Gypsies and non-gypsies. In the anti-racist fight, new movements emerged and their actions intensified through social media. People who had never organized or become active before began their first steps in activism, joining this path of gypsy and anti-racist organization and popular action. People forget, or don't want to appreciate, but gypsy action has helped to determine results in the political dispute. Gypsy citizens mobilized in large numbers and determined electoral results in the 2017 local councils, both in Alentejo and in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area, even causing electoral earthquakes.
And even in the presidential, second place was resolved by a value equivalent to the estimated number of Gypsy voters. Apart from the non -Gypsy votes that were mobilized by the action of Gypsy voters. Gypsy people are even co-considering power in the spaces of opinion, local media, social networks and party and institutional political dispute. And most importantly, in the popular Ação and alliances with other social movements. We have never stopped fighting for all means and continuing to resist.
In contrast there are more and more hate speeches, from the far right in particular. What do you have to say about it?
To begin with, these speeches are historical and European. They are neither current nor “extreme right-wing”. These speeches have been adopted and delivered for a long time, even in 'democracy and freedom', by various representatives of the center-right, conservatives, center-left, liberals, liberal left, even representatives of the PCP. Anti-gypsy rhetoric has always worked in Portugal, as it is the most white-natured rhetoric. That is, it allows the creation and recognition of “white” as the superior of all. And thus please the white electorate who, when they feel good, compensate with their vote. Even if the policies implemented by your elected officials harm you even more.
Finally, I would like you to talk a little about your personal experience and how you became an activist?
I studied, fought for studies, made alliances, graduated, went in the labor market of the “formal precariousness”. I started my militant action and here I am today. We can transform this society a better. This certainty combined with the fact that the current one has so much suffering makes anyone want to have a transformist attitude. I wanted to be 'inventor' (physical engineer) and anti -racist militant. And through study (not necessarily schooling) and organization with others, in turn, with other studies, formations and visions, I learned how the world works and how it can be changed. But before transforming, we need to survive.
Hence two types of actions arise: transformative and survival. The struggle against hate discourse arises as survival, but his defeat will be a transformative victory. There is a lot that - like people who want a better world - we have to do, namely working to criminalize hatred speech; condemn and prohibit organizations with racist discourses and practices; denounce the racist institutional structure and logics that organize power and generate community resources. And in this sense, there have been various types of actions, of petitions, to manifestations. And we need more.
In addition to being a member of the SOS RACISMO movement, I participate in the Podcast “Viemos Para Ficar”, with Mamadou Ba and Joseph da Silva. And if everything goes well, we will soon start a new project. With friendly people, we also have the “Cigana Initiative” project, dedicated to reflecting and promoting transformative movements. Essentially focused on educating against anti-gypsyism, denouncing historical and ongoing genocide and working towards a new societal project. Also with new projects in the pipeline. And finally, there are always voluntary actions, without an organization, where I try to share what I discovered about Anti-Gypsyism and Romani history in schools and with interested people. In addition, there is still the struggle for housing, because evictions did not stop during the pandemic. Due to housing and employment precariousness, racialized individuals, especially Roma nationals, are the most vulnerable to Covid-19. It is essential to have actions in this area; Of all the struggles, this is the most structural, as it goes against one of the main enemies of a healthy society: the real estate speculation of this capitalist system, which puts profit and goods above people and their humanization.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>GP | FIA makes known 10 teams from the FR World Cup</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/12/gp-fia-da-a-conhecer-10-equipas-da-taca-do-mundo-fr/</link><description>On Wednesday night, the International Automobile Federation (FIA), in partnership with the Macao Grand Prix Organizing Committee, published the official list of teams registered for this year's Macao Grand Prix-FR DA Mundo Cup.
Although the names of the Formula Regional (FR) drivers who will visit Macau in November have not been released, according to the official statement from the organization, based in Paris, this “carefully selected squad of ten truly international teams will bring together the best regional talents from around the world to compete in this prestigious, unique race on the iconic Guia Circuit”.
This year's edition welcomes two new major teams to the event: the Italian Trident Motorsport, which arrives in Macau after a 2025 season in which it won the FIA ​​Formula 3 Championship, with the Brazilian Rafael Câmara, and the Dutch Van Amersfoort Racing (VAR), a team that has known the Guia Circuit well since 1998 and that, in 2018, suffered a huge scare with the spectacular accident by Sophia Flörsch.
Return to defend the coveted title in Macau will be the R-ACE GP, a European training that won in 2024 with Ugo Ugochukwu, a pilot who will not be present this year to try to revalidate the title. The French team remains largely, leading Freca's current classification and ending second in the Middle East Formula Regional Championship earlier this year.
Return of SJM Theodore
Also back are some of the strongest candidates of the Macao Grand Prix last year and the Panorama FR in general, including a well -known name of the event: SJM Theodore Prema Racing. The Italian team Prema, currently in second place in the Freca 2025 Championship, is one of the most successful formations of Base Motorized Sports and returns to partner with Teddy Yip Jr. at the MGI event.
Return are also Pinnacle Motorsport, Irish flag team; Australian Evans GP, who reached a fourth place in the last edition; Japanese Tom’s Racing, one of the most prestigious of Japanese motorsport; the German PHM Racing; and the always competitive French structures SaintLoc Racing and Art Grand Prix.
On the other hand, the Dutch MP Motorsport, Australian Kiwi Motorsport and the Japanese TGM Grand Prix came out of the scene. No team from China has been selected, but unlike last year, none tried to sign up for the race.
The official list of entries should only be made known in mid-October, as is tradition for the Grand Prix.
The second edition of the FIA ​​FR World Cup will take place during the week of the Macau Grand Prix, from 13 to 16 November, and will also feature, for the first time, the FIA ​​F4 World Cup, making the event one of the most prestigious global showcases for the junior single-seater categories.</description><pubDate>2025-09-12 00:22:52</pubDate></item><item><title>Charles Leong Conquest title Lamborghini Super Trofeo</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/09/charles-leong-conquista-titulo-lamborghini-super-trofeo/</link><description>Macao pilot Charles Leong Hon Chio was won of the Pro Lamborghini Super Trofeo Asia class last weekend at the Sepang International Circuit in Malaysia. This represents the first title of the rider of the rider in competitions of Grand Tourism (GT) and the first title of a championship achieved in the service of SJM Theodore Racing.
Despite being sick and with two races for competing in the calendar of the competition organized by the prestigious Italian car brand, Charles Leong and the young Irish Alex Denning were always extremely fast on the Malaysian track. They won the first weekend race, thus reaching the sixth triumph of the season, and finished second in the second race. This second place raised to 10 the number of podiums obtained in 10 races, extending the impressive team series, which never ended below second place.
With two races still playing in the World Lamborghini Super Trofeo World Finals in Misano, Italy, in November, SJM Theodore Racing could focus on maintaining this impressive podium sequence, with the main objective of the season achieved. Charles Leong and Alex Denning are tied at the top of the pilot standings and are expected to complete the season side by side, sharing the same Lamborghini Huracán Super Trofeo EVO2.
Always adding
For Charles Leong, this result is the result of “incredible work on the team. We won the championship thanks to a great collective effort, without great errors and total consistency. For the race, I expected more group, but it was hard to fight my opponents with new tires. In the end, followed my rhythm and managed the tires to deliver the best car to Alex.
After finishing in second place in the classification of this same single-brand trophy, the Macau driver adds this title to those he won at a young age in the Formula Renault Asian Championship and the Chinese Formula 4 Championship, in addition to two notable victories in the Formula 4 Macau Grand Prix.
Obviously pleased with the results obtained by his pupils, Teddy Yip Jr., owner of SJM Theodore Racing, commented: “I want to congratulate the whole team for this done, the result of a collective effort over the season and previous years. Pilots responded exemplary to pressure. Thanks to Charles, even sick, and Alex, who held another fast and consistent stint, guaranteeing the tenth, the tenth ‘Top-2’ in ten races. ”
The Theodore Racing team and SJM have supported Charles Leong since 2021, when he achieved his second Formula 4 triumph at the Guia Circuit. In 2023, he finished very close to teammate Arvid Lindblad in the Macau Grand Prix Formula 4 race, completing a triumphant 1-2 for SJM Theodore PREMA Racing. Absent from last year's edition due to commitments at the Lamborghini Super Trofeo Asia in Spain, Charles Leong has not yet announced whether he will participate in this year's edition of the Macau Grand Prix.</description><pubDate>2025-09-09 00:01:15</pubDate></item><item><title>Motorsport | MSAR comics with special premiere in Japan</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/26/automobilismo-banda-desenhada-da-raem-com-estreia-especial-no-japao/</link><description>Macao's comic book, “Circuit Heroes” (街道), had its first internationalization very specially two weeks ago, in the 1000 km from Suzuka, Japan
The classic endurance race had not been contested since 2019, and, to mark the return of this iconic race in the Land of the Rising Sun, Porsche Motorsport Asia Pacific decided to decorate the three cars it supported with the Stuttgart brand's historic colors. Among them, one of Absolute Racing's Porsche 911 GT3 R was painted yellow and black, in honor of Joest Racing's victory in the 1985 24 Hours of Le Mans, when Portuguese Domingos Piedade was Sporting Director of the German team. With the current sponsors, and not with the French clothing brand NewMan, responsible for the decoration 40 years ago, the inscription in Portuguese stood out on the rear wing of the Porsche 911 GT3 R nº 7: “Heróis do Circuito”.
For those who follow local motor sport closely, the comic strip “Heróis do Circuito” is already part of the territory’s motoring culture. Passionate about the ninth art and a self-confessed devotee of motor sports, MP Man is the “Jean Graton of Macau”. His title, often seen on cars at local Grand Prix races, has this time reached an international stage.
Regarding participation in the most prestigious proof of resistance to GT3 cars on the Asian continent, MP Man told HM: “By receiving this exciting news, I felt surprised and admiration. This recognition not only values ​​the effort and dedication of years, but also opens a door to the presence of an original macao mark on the international stages of motorsport, allowing the world to be unique and the creativity of Macau, an honor that fills me with pride and pride and pride and pride and is filled with pride and pride and pride and pride and pride and have a pride with pride and pride and pride and pride and beets with pride and pride and pride and beets with pride and pride and pride and beets that fills with pride and pride and pride and beets that fills me with pride and enthusiasm. ”
The international debut could not have gone better in sporting terms, as Absolute Racing's #7 Porsche 911 GT3 R, driven by Kévin Estre, Laurens Vanthoor and Patrick Pilet, crossed the line in second place overall, in a race that also scored points for the Intercontinental GT Challenge.
Syner
Interestingly, the trampoline to put the mashed band in an Absolute Racing top car, Asian team supported by Porsche Motorsport Asia Pacific and with several triumphs in the GT Macau Cup, was in a common sponsor: a brand of southern car miniatures.
"We maintain a close and friendly relationship with the renowned national collector model brand Almost Real. The founder, Liu Xueshen, Mr. Sum, has always enthusiastically supported my comic book, and has now become one of the main sponsors.
With an ambitious vision, they intend to take the work across borders, exploring new horizons", explained the author, responsible for some of the illustrations on display at the Macau Grand Prix Museum. "By becoming sponsors of Absolute Racing, they integrated elements of the Heróis do Circuito brand into the racing car's paintwork, allowing the vehicle, when running on the track, to announce to the world the unique charm of the comic strip.”
For MP Man, who launched the first issue of “Heróis do Circuito” in 2018, the objective is clear: “For racing and comic book fans to pay more attention to the original creation made in Macau and recognize the effort dedicated to this project.”
Looking to the future
The presence at the Suzuka event, which brought together more than 65,000 spectators, constituted a decisive step in the internationalization of the brand.
"Now, “Heroes of the Circuit” has reached a moment of great significance. Like an eagle taking flight, he has successfully joined a team supported by Porsche, participating in an endurance race that brings together the best teams and drivers from all over Asia", says MP Man, who does not hide his ambition to go further. "If one day my brand manages to reach races like Le Mans, or even a Formula 1 Grand Prix, it will be a dream come true! (laughs) This is, without a doubt, my deepest desire. But I also know that dreams do not come true immediately; my work still has a lot to evolve and perfect. I will continue to create with humility, persevering in improving the work, seeking to offer readers ever more experiences exciting.”
However, the fourth volume of the “Circuit Heroes” series is about to be published, opening a new chapter, always with its unique charm and captivating narratives that have gained the attention and affection of the local audiences, stating more and more in the global universe of the comic and with the mothers of motorized sports.</description><pubDate>2025-09-26 07:21:12</pubDate></item><item><title>Vernice Lao, just 15 years old, made her F4 debut in Chengdu</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/19/vernice-lao-de-apenas-15-anos-estreou-se-na-f4-em-chengdu/</link><description>In an initiative supported by Macau-China General Automobile Association (AAMC), Marcus Cheong and Vernice Lao participated in the China 4 China Championship test. The two riders from local karting measured forces with some of the region's best monologens, and for the young Vernice Lao, this was an absolute debut in motorsport.
In the newly settled Tianfi Chengdu International Circuit, Marcus Cheong returned to the Formula 4 discipline, which has had several raids in the category, even ending in 12th place in the Formula 4 race of the 2023 Macao Grand Prix.
In this return, the Macau pilot led one of the Mygale chassis, the same as those used in the FIA ​​World Cup on the Guide Circuit, at the end of the year, the Apollo RFN Racing by Blackjack team.

Rodolfo Ávila, Team Manager of the team of the two drivers from the territory, highlighted "how fantastic it is to see two drivers supported by the AAMC, something that has a special meaning for me, as I also took my first steps in the single-seater competition with the support of the AAMC. Seeing these young talents from Macau following a similar path is extremely gratifying, and their participation has a very special importance for both me and the team."

As for Vernice Lao, she finished 13th overall, securing a consistent 6th position in the Formula 4 class.
Very positive balance
On a particularly demanding weekend, with variable track conditions, the Portuguese Rodolfo Ávila highlighted the performance of Macau pilots supported by AAMC, Marcus Cheong and Vernice Lao. "Both showed a clear evolution throughout the weekend and the varnice, in particular, impressed everyone with a clean and confident of monoligrai debut. Competing against such an experienced platoon, with such little shooting in a formula 4 car, and presenting the performance he got was a pleasant surprise," said the 2003 Renault Formula Asian champion.
On social networks, Vernice Lao reported that this was "an amazing experience," adding that "over the weekend we lost a lot, but we ended up achieving a satisfactory result." The MSAR rider acknowledged that "there is still a long way to go" and took the opportunity to thank "the support and encouragement" of the team, Team Manager and the teammate, in the one that classified as "an unforgettable weekend with Asia Racing Team."

The charismatic British driver continues to recover from the serious accident he suffered at the Isle of Man TT, last June, and is not ready to fight for his tenth victory
 
In early summer, in the great classic of road, Michael Rutter fell off the motorcycle on the last lap of the Superwin race, in the place known as 31st Milestone, and suffered several column fractures, between L2 and L5 vertebrae, even being transferred by helicopter to the hospital. The 53 -year -old pilot was also diagnosed with an ankle fracture.
After nearly three months away from the competition, “The Blade”, as he is known in the middle, made his return to motorcycling last August, participating in the famous classic TT parade, on top of a Honda RVF750 RC45, integrated in a tribute to the 1980s and 1990s. Of his nine wins in 1998, he went back to a motorcycle for the first time in the Classic TT, where he led a Honda RC45 in the 1980s and 1990s parade. However, Rutter is not yet prepared to return to the competition, the Irish publication News Letter said in the past week.
His last victory was achieved at the Guide Circuit in 2019, although not the way Rutter would like to have increased his palm, as the result was decided on the basis of positions after just one lap, after two red flag interruptions that led to the definitive cancellation of the race. Still with ambition to win a tenth time at the Macao Motorcycle Prize last year, deeply affected by bad weather, Rutter was disappointed with the result, having qualified with the fourth best time, in a race in which the result of the qualification determined the final positions of the race.
Before the Isle of Man TT accident, Rutter had told the News Letter that he wanted to travel to Macau at the end of the year. "We'll try again, because it's another race that I really enjoy going to. It's completely unique, it's on the other side of the world, in another time zone, so it's unique", he said without knowing what to expect.
Another big question
Rutter may not be the only “historic” Macau Motorcycle Grand Prix to be left out of this year's edition, as many doubts persist surrounding Peter Hickman, who was also the victim of an accident at the Isle of Man event. The Briton's accident was caused by a mechanical failure: the exhaust fixing broke, causing it to come into contact with the rear tire and causing a puncture that led to the expert's fall. pilot. The winner of four editions suffered serious injuries: fractured collarbone and left shoulder blade, three broken ribs, four fractured vertebrae and facial injuries.
In a social media publication, Hickman said he has worked “very hard” behind the scenes and even recently performed a test on Cadwell Park. Three months after the accident, he returned this weekend to the popular British Superbike Championship in Donington Park. The 38 -year -old has not yet recovered his best and the requirement of a city circuit, such as Macao, is far superior to a conventional circuit. So in the coming weeks it will be known if Hickman will try to conquer his fifth victory on the streets of Macau in 2025.
The 72nd Macau Grand Prix will take place between November 13 and 16 this year. In addition to the 57th Macao Motorcycle Grand Prix, the program also features the Macao Grand Prix -FR's FR's World Cup, the FIA ​​GT GT Cup, the Macao Guide Race -Kumho Fia TCR World Tour of Macau, the Macao Formula 4 -FIA Formula 4 Cup (GT4) and Macao Roadsport Challenge.</description><pubDate>2025-09-08 02:43:40</pubDate></item><item><title>GP | Event literature is expected to grow in the coming years</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/01/gp-literatura-do-evento-devera-crescer-nos-proximos-anos/</link><description>Literature about the Macau Grand Prix could continue to grow in the coming years. The launch of the book Macau Grand Prix – Personal Collection of Victor H. de Lemos, 1954-1978, Volume II (1967-1978), written by Macau native Carlos Lemos, residing in Toronto since 1974, will take place in November, and not in October as initially planned, at the same time that a new book on motorcycling events is taking shape.
This change in date is not related to any delay, but rather to the date of the author's visit to the territory. After the success of Volume I, the second part of a book that aims to pay homage to the author's father, Victor Hugo Lemos – a Macau Grand Prix enthusiast who, in his lifetime, collected a vast number of photographs and everything related to car and motorcycle racing in Macau since 1954, the date of the first edition of the event.
"This second volume completes a significant part of the Macau Grand Prix collection of my father, Victor H. de Lemos. It is a hardcover book with 356 pages, that is, 100 more than the first volume", reveals Carlos Lemos. "The content and composition are very identical to the first volume. It includes more Chinese newspaper clippings and documents the first fatal accident, the failed attempt to create the Far East Motor Racing Association Circuit (FEMRAC), the first edition of the Guia Race, the Race of Giants and the gradual evolution of the Macau Grand Prix, from amateur races to becoming a world-class event, recognized by the International Federation of the Automobile (FIA).”
Also according to the author, “The book contains about 471 photographs, as well as an introduction to the other collection of my father, World of Motor Racing, composed of over 1900 autographed pilots photographs, car owners and international renowned designers, such as Il Commendatore Enzo Ferrari, Sir Stirling Moss, Michael Schumacher, Roy Salvadori, Dan Gurney, Sir Jack Brabham, Juan Manuel Fangio, Helmut Marko, Colin Chapman, Sir Jackie Stewart, Janet Guthrie, Professor Sid Walkins, Tony and Mary Hulman (owners of the Indianapolis circuit), Frank Williams, Charlie Whiting, Louis Meyer, among others. ”
Sales of the first volume exceeded expectations and, therefore, 550 copies will be sold. The cover price will be MOP400, but will be sold for MOP350 during the promotion period. Part of the net proceeds from the sale will benefit the institution Associação IC2 – “I Can Too”, which supports people with autism or disabilities, and also APOMAC. The presentation should take place at the headquarters of the Association of Retirees, Retirees and Pensioners of Macau (APOMAC), on a date and time to be revealed.
A book about motorcycles
Literature about the Macau Grand Prix could continue to grow in the coming years. Carlos Barreto, the author of the book History of Karting in Macau, written in co-authorship with Pedro Dá Mesquita, is considering writing a book about motorcycling in the Macau Grand Prix, a discipline that sometimes ends up taking a backseat in terms of literary coverage of the more than seventy years of the Guia Circuit event.
"The idea is to gather the testimonials of pilots from Macao who participated in the proof of motorcycles of the Macao Grand Prix," Carlos Barreto told HM. “We already have some material collected; there is still a lot of collection of collecting, compiling and writing the story, selecting the images, etc… We are in a hurry!”
The Macau Grand Prix currently has only one motorcycle race on the program, the historic Macau Motorcycle Grand Prix, but it wasn't always like this. The event had more than three motorcycle races, and even scooter races took place on the Macao SAR city circuit, always with a very strong presence of local riders.</description><pubDate>2025-09-01 03:08:38</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
