Beijing criticizes the decision and accuses the US of not contributing to peace in the region
 
China criticized Washington's decision to impose visa restrictions on members of the organization for the release of Palestine and the Palestinian National Authority, which Washington accuses of "supporting terrorism."
"We are surprised and disappointed by these sanctions. We do not understand that the United States continues to belittle the efforts of the international community for peace. The Palestinian issue is a question where equity and justice should prevail," Foreign Affairs spokesman Guo Jiakun said at a press conference.
Guo added that the United States must "be responsible and implement the United Nations resolutions and make efforts to achieve a proper solution to this issue rather than doing the opposite."
The spokesman reiterated that Beijing will continue to work with the international community "to end the conflict in Gaza, relieve the humanitarian crisis and advance to the implementation of the framework of the two states."
The US State Department indicated on Thursday in a statement that "it is in the interest of US National Security to impose consequences and blame the organization for the release of Palestine and the Palestinian National Authority for not fulfilling their commitments and undermine the prospects of peace."
“In addition, (both entities) continue to support terrorism-including the glorification of violence, especially in school books-and to grant payments and benefits in support of terrorist to Palestinian activities involved in terrorism and their families,” reads in the statement.
High blood pressure
The announcement of sanctions arises in the midst of increasing international pressure on Israel to improve the conditions in the Gaza Strip, which crosses a severe humanitarian crisis and where, in recent days, local authorities have reported a peak of hunger -related deaths.
France, the United Kingdom and Canada, among other countries, expressed their decision to recognize a Palestinian state before the UN in response to the situation, announcements that were received with strong criticism from the Israeli government, which considers this measure a "support for Hamas."
US President Donald Trump defended on Thursday that the “fastest” way of ending the crisis in Gaza is the surrender of the Palestinian Islamist group and the return of Israeli hostages that maintain in their power.</description><pubDate>2025-08-04 07:53:59</pubDate></item><item><title>DSEDJ | Condemned use of smaller smuggling network</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/01/dsedj-condenado-uso-de-menor-em-rede-de-contrabando/</link><description>The Directorate of Youth Education and Development Services (DSEDJ) condemned the use that a smuggling network made a minor.

In his hands, Kaebauk, an ornament with buffalo horns, which represents the sun, strength, safety, protection and power, traditionally used in the head and on the roofs of sacred houses, gains the form of earrings and pending to be used in a necklace.
Already the “Belak”, a bronze disc that symbolizes the moon and is used to the chest and inside the sacred houses, can also be bought in earrings.
In Joaquim Sumali's workshop, neither does necklaces, called “Morten”, are normally listed with the orange color, which bring luck and prosperity and push the evil spirits and negative energies.
“I want to do this job. My father also worked with jewelry, shaped Belak and Kaebauk since the time of the Portuguese, and so far my brothers and sisters sometimes still make jewelry like Kaebauk and Belak in Dili,” Lusa Joaquim Surumali told.
The 34 -year -old jeweler stressed that his art is a family tradition, which continues to this day. “I learned to make jewelry with my father and my brothers. But our work comes from our own blood, from our father and the elders who also made jewelry like the ones that are done today,” explained Joaquim Surumali.
Other materials
Joaquim Surumali makes the jewelry in gold, silver or bronze, depending on the preference and money of customers. The material, according to the jeweler, is bought in Timor-Leste, but most come from Indonesia or Singapore, because resources in the country are scarce.
"As people buy in gold to put in holy houses, it is no longer available. So we try to buy abroad. Most of the time, customers are the ones who bring gold and we only charge for our labor," said the jeweler.
Asked about jewelry prices, the craftsman explained that a pure gold "Belak" can cost $ 600 and a $ 100 "death". "Many Timorese buy these jewelry, but also many Portuguese, especially teachers," he said.
Joaquim explained that the Portuguese appreciate these pieces because they see in them something unique and traditional of Timor-Leste. The Timorenses buy them to put them in the sacred houses of families and can be seen in all municipalities of the country. The most bought articles are, above all, the “Belak” of gold.
About the monthly yield of jewelry production, Joaquim Surumali said it can reach the monthly $ 500, but it depends on the number of customers and visits.</description><pubDate>2025-08-04 07:57:41</pubDate></item><item><title>Game | Recipes reach in July the highest value from pandemic</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/04/jogo-receitas-atingem-em-julho-o-valor-mais-alto-desde-pandemia/</link><description>After the beginning of the year the revenues disappointed and forced to review the budget, the scenario seems to be changing now. July revenues reached 22.125 billion patacas, the highest value since the start of the pandemic
 
The game's revenues recorded in July an annual increase of 19 percent and monthly 5 percent, reaching the highest value of the year and also since January 2020, according to the data announced on Friday.
The casinos raised 22.125 billion Patacas in July, compared to 18.595 billion patacas in the same month of 2024, according to data from the Games Inspection and Coordination Directorate (DICJ). In June this year, casinos had recorded revenues of 21.064 billion patacas, and May was so far the month with the highest value of 2025: 21.193 billion patacas.
July is also present as the best month since January 2020, when the revenues of the casinos have reached a very close value: 22.126 billion Patacas. Since late January 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on the game, the engine of Macau's economy, with taxes on the revenue of this industry to fund the overwhelming majority of the government budget.
In terms of accumulated gross revenue, the first seven months of this year registered an increase of 6.5 percent over the previous year, with a total of 140.896 billion of patacas against 132.348 billion patacas between January and July 2024.

Budgetary review
The government predicted, in the initial budget for 2025, that the year would close with total revenues of 240 billion patacas, which would represent a 6 percent increase compared to last year.
But on June 11, the Legislative Assembly approved a new budget, proposed by the executive, which reduces the forecast for public revenues by 4.56 billion. The Secretary for Economics and Finance, Tai Kin IP, admitted to the deputies that the cut is due to the fact that the game's gross recipes in the first trimester of 2025 "were slightly below the planned."
Since May this year that monthly revenues have never been below 20 billion and Patacas, a serious three consecutive month. However, until April, even at the time of the Lunar New Year, one of the high peaks of the industry, revenues had never reached 20 billion patacas.</description><pubDate>2025-08-04 07:49:09</pubDate></item><item><title>Immigration | Less Portuguese to arrive. Weight above 6%</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/04/imigracao-menos-portugueses-a-chegar-peso-acima-de-6/</link><description>The latest report on Portuguese emigration indicates that in 2023 they came to live to Macau 53 Portuguese citizens, making this fate with less Portuguese immigration
 
Macau was the destination where the Portuguese least emigrated in 2023, according to the latest report prepared by the Emigration Observatory and Migra Network, Center for Research and Studies of Sociology and ISCTE - University Institute of Lisbon. The study data were released by Lusa on Friday.
According to the same source, in 2023 they lived in Macau another 53 Portuguese citizens. This is a record that is equivalent to practically half of the Portuguese who began living in Australia, the second destination with the lowest emigration in Portugal in 2023, which registered 91 entries.
In 2022, the number of new entrances to Macao from Portugal, according to the previous report, was 20, which means that the number rose to more than double. The report does not point to the number of Portuguese immigrants who left the masters.
Despite the changes, the report indicates that Portuguese immigration in Macao continues to take some expression: “Although Portuguese immigration has lost relative importance over the years, the impact of these flows in destination countries remains expressive. In Luxembourg, for example, the Portuguese represented about 13.5 percent of the total immigrant entrances, while in Macau the number was 6 percent and in Switzerland 5. One hundred ”, is pointed out by the authors.
Stabilized exits
Regarding the general trend of immigration, the study points out that in 2023 they left the country about 70 thousand Portuguese, a number that remained stable in relation to the recent past. The main destination was Switzerland.
“It is estimated that 70,000 Portuguese will have come out in 2023, the same number of 2022, thus continuing the recovery of Portuguese emigration to values near the years before the COVID-19 pandemic”, reads in the report of Portuguese emigration 2024, with data for the previous year.
According to the document, there was only a total recovery since emigration to the UK fell more than 40 percent, maintaining the descending trajectory started with ‘Brexit’ and for France down 25 percent.
Still, Portuguese emigration is higher than pre-covid levels in most of its main destinations. In 2023, Switzerland became the main destination country for the Portuguese, accounting for 12,652 entries, followed by Spain, with 11,554.
Also noteworthy are countries such as France (7,426), Germany (6,375), the Netherlands-now Netherlands (4,892), the United Kingdom (4,414), Belgium (3,857) and Luxembourg (3,638). Denmark (1,818), Mozambique (1,439) and Canada (1,005) are followed.

Hours later, the Macao government also repudiated the statement from Europe
 
The Commissioner for Macao Affairs of the China Ministry of Foreign Affairs repudiated “The Illusory Comments” of Brussels, who condemned the detention of former Macao deputy and Portuguese citizen Au Kam San, expressing concern about the erosion of freedoms in the region.
In a statement sent to Lusa, on Saturday, the Commissioner's spokesman for Macao Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China, led by Liu Xianfa, expressed “discontent” and “firm opposition to the illusory comments of the European Union (SEAE) service (EU) on the application of the Macao Special Administrative Region (Maca),” classifying them as a “gross interference with Macao affairs and China's internal affairs”.
"We urge the European Union to stop immediately to make remarks and unfounded accusations about Macao's affairs and stop immediately to interfere with China's Macao and internal affairs!" Says Liu Xianfa's office.
Beijing's main diplomatic representative in Macao also stressed "firmly the government of the RAE of Macao in the performance of his duties in accordance with the law", as well as "Macao police in taking law enforcement measures against the anti-china rebels against Macau, in accordance with the law."
Macau defends herself
Also the Macao government has “vehemently” the European Union's statements on “criminal proceedings and preventive enforcement actions”. "The Government of the Special Administrative Region of Macao [Mande] vehemently repudiates and is firmly opposed to the statements made [on Saturday] by the European Union (SEAE) Action (SEAE) [EU) on criminal proceedings and pre-trial execution actions of the law recently triggered by MSAR under the law on the defense of state security." Connecting cabinet.
The SAM Hou Fai Executive stressed that it will be all done according to the law: “Mand's police and judicial authorities have always treated the case scrupulously under the law, and the defendant's procedural law is effectively guaranteed under the law,” was pointed out. "The fundamental rights of MSAR residents, including the right of suffrage and freedom of expression, are fully safeguarded by the Basic Law of MSAR and other relevant legislation, the human rights conventions applicable in the MSAR, and the practice of the administrative, legislative and judicial authorities of Masters," he was added.
Macao also refused “external interference” in his matters by the European Union: “the application of the law relating to the defense of state security by the MSAR is strictly an internal subject of China and its special administrative region”, so “any foreign or abroad organisms, including the European Union, have no right to interference.” "The Special Administrative Region of Macao will continue, as always, to comply with the duties of the defense of state security under the law, in favor of the lasting and stable successful application of the principle" a country, two systems ", the statement concluded.
EU condemned
The reactions of the local authorities arose after the European Union condemned the detention of the former deputy, who arises as a citizen of the EU, because it has Portuguese nationality.
"The EU [European Union] condemns the detention of Au Kam San, an EU citizen and former deputy of Macao on July 30, on charges of [violating the law of national security," a spokesman for the Brussels Diplomatic Service said in a statement.
The message stressed that it “constitutes the first application of the National Security Law of the Special Administrative Region of Macao since its adoption in 2009”, and the European service for external action stated that the event “aggravates existing concerns about the continuing erosion of political pluralism and freedom of expression” in the region.
Brussels “recalls that respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms is a central element of the Macao Basic Law and the maxim 'a country, two systems',” he added to the statement.
Portugal to accompany
In turn, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Portugal told Lusa to be following the detention of former Macao Deputy and Portuguese citizen Au Kam San. MNE “is following this subject through the Portuguese Consulate-General in Macao,” the ministry led by Paulo Rangel told Lusa.
"The subject will deserve the best attention of the Portuguese authorities, from the outset at future meetings at the political level, in the spirit of the joint statement," he continued, in reference to the Sino-Portuguese Treaty signed in 1987, where the two countries declared the terms in which Beijing would take over the administration of Macao after 1999.
The reactions in Portugal did not stay here. In Parliament the Liberal Initiative Party will present a vote of conviction of the detention. According to the voting project to which Lusa had access to, the detention "is the first under Macao National Security legislation, approved in 2009 and reviewed in 2023, and occurs in a context of accelerated repression of fundamental freedoms in the Special Administrative Region of Macao."
The document written by IL states that the Portuguese State has the “duty to rigorously follow the case and subsequently guarantee respect for the commitments made in the Luso-Chinese joint statement of 1987, a binding document under International Law.
In pre -trial detention
On Thursday at the end of the day, the Public Prosecution Service confirmed that Au will await the trial in pre-trial detention, considering that there is "strong evidence of the crime of establishing connections with organizations, associations or individuals from outside the masters for the practice of state security." The crime implies a penalty that it can reach 10 years in prison and always requires the application of pre -trial detention as coercion measures.</description><pubDate>2025-08-04 07:44:03</pubDate></item><item><title>One country, two systems | Sam says principle is in a new phase</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/04/um-pais-dois-sistemas-sam-diz-que-principio-esta-numa-nova-fase/</link><description>The chief executive indicated that the principle "one country, two systems" has entered, again, in a new phase due to "drastic and complex mutations" with which Macao debates in the "internal and external conjuncture".

“At present, major changes, unpublished in the last 100 years, are accelerating the evolution of the world, and the world has entered a new period of turbulence and change. Macau is discussed with drastic and complex mutations that occur in the internal and external conjuncture and the practice of 'one country, two systems' has also entered a new phase.” This is how Sam Hou Fai closed the speech on the occasion of the commemorative reception of the 98th anniversary of the establishment of the people's liberation army (ELP) on Friday.
The ruler assured that, together with the ELP garrison, the executive will "persist on the right track" and "write new chapters of high quality development of the cause" a country, two systems ".
The announcement of entry into a new phase of the principle 'one country, two systems' has been a constant in recent years, as well as the reference to “major changes, unpublished in the last 100 years”, which open doors to “periods of turbulence”.
The Chief Executive has promised that his government "will continue, as always, to maintain the close connection and sincere cooperation with the Macao garrison, to unite and lead Macao compatriots to value further, and safeguard with commitment, stability and social harmony, nothing easy to achieve."
Almost a century
Sam Hou Fai recalled that, over the ninety -eight years, the “honorable and grand liberation army of the Chinese people, always guided by the noble ideals and firm convictions, has accompanied the evolution of times with commitment and innovative spirit, honoring the glorious tradition with the conduct of excellence”.
"The army grows as it fights, innovates as it keeps and conveys tradition, and progresses in the construction of causes. Narrowly aligned with the steps of the development of the homeland and the people, it has made great historical achievements that make it a firm strength to safeguard world peace," added the chief executive.
Sam Hou Fai also highlighted the objective of the defined ELP “under the guidance of Xi Jinping's thinking”, which is “transforming the people's armed forces into world -class forces that obey party command, can fight and win and maintain excellent conduct”.
In addition, the Chief Executive said that since the parking lot in Macao, the ELP "has always been persisted in defending sovereignty, security and interests of the country's development, comprehensive and accurate implementation of the principles" a country, two systems "and" Macau governed by their people "with a high degree of autonomy, and in the scrupulous observance of the basic law, the droop parking law."</description><pubDate>2025-08-04 07:41:43</pubDate></item><item><title>CCCM | Fusion with Foundation for Science and Technology creates new agency</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/04/cccm-fusao-com-fundacao-para-a-ciencia-e-tecnologia-cria-nova-agencia/</link><description>Operating since 1999, the Macau Scientific and Cultural Center will merge with the Foundation for Science and Technology and the National Innovation Agency, creating a new institution. The practical consequences for the CCCM that aims to promote studies on Macao, China and Asia in Portugal are unknown. The president of the center says it is early to make comments
 
It is not known whether it will maintain its name, the number of scholarships for studies on China, Macao and Asia, or whether to change staff, but what is certain is that the Macao Scientific and Cultural Center (CCCM) will merge with the Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) and the National Innovation Agency. Of these three entities will be born the new agency for research and innovation.
The process is linked to the desire to reform the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology by the Portuguese government led by Luís Montenegro, and the changes were announced on Thursday.
However, there is still no great information about the consequences of this merger to the CCCM. At HM, Carmen Amado Mendes, its president, chose to refer to clarification for the future operation of the center, considering that it is "premature" to give answers about something "that is not yet defined."
On Thursday, Minister Fernando Alexandre announced the reform of the Ministry of Education, Science and Innovation with the extinction of several entities, including FCT that has been the main financier of PhD and other research projects in Portugal.
The reform of the ministry was approved by the Council of Ministers and, at a press conference at the end of the meeting, Fernando Alexandre justified the restructuring by describing his ministry as an “anacronic structure”, with fragmented organizations, disintegrated information systems and disarticulated governance.
With 18 entities and 27 higher leaders between the services of the non -higher education system and higher education, science and innovation, the ministry will have only seven entities and 27 higher leaders, with the integration of extinguished entities into new entities.
Regarding the extinction of the FCT, the minister assured that the financing of science will be preserved, with funding for four years that guarantees stability, predictability and “the protection of the financing of the most basic fundamental investigation”.
“When we started thinking about this reform, we do it with a vision: to ensure equal opportunities to access quality education,” said Fernando Alexandre, also underlining the reinforcement of the education system.
Marcelo can veto
The extinction of FCT has generated some less good reactions in Portugal because it fears a reduction in investment in science and research. Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, president of the Portuguese Republic, said he had “the sensation” that the foundation was replaced “with an agency in which he was integrated, and had other functions beyond those of FCT.”
Marcelo acknowledged that the Foundation was a “very old structure” and that “it had many aspects that deserved to be rethought”, but said: “Just seeing what the new agency will do can I answer if this extinction is a good or bad idea.”
As for the eventual 'green light' from Belém, Marcelo said that if he thinks this extinction is "good", promulgates the diploma "without anguish." "If you have doubts about a point that is this diploma that is very important I ask the government to rethink. It has happened. I may not veto soon. If the government insists, I can come to veto, if it is until the end of my mandate," he also admitted.
A history of the transition
The CCCM was born in 1995 during the administration of Vasco Rocha Vieira, the last Portuguese governor of Macao, intending to be “a place of excellence for the dissemination of Macau, its history, its culture and its economy”, reads in the memories of Rocha Vieira, “to all the ports I arrived”.
This entity, operating in the Alcântara area, in Lisbon, was inaugurated in November 1999 by the then President of the Republic, Jorge Sampaio, and had as first president Alexandra Costa Gomes.
On the CCCM website it is read that the institution is endowed with administrative autonomy and its own heritage, being a public institute integrated in the indirect administration of the state and under the tutelage of the Ministry of Education, Science and Innovation.
In the objective booklet, it is read that the CCCM “has as its mission to produce, promote and disseminate knowledge about Macao as a platform between Portugal and the Popular Republic of China, as well as between Europe and Asia”, also presenting itself as “a space dedicated to the study and teaching of Chinese language, culture and history”. The center has also been established as "a center for scientific research and continuous and advanced training on the relations between Portugal and China, as well as between Europe and Asia."
After the long presidency of Luís Filipe Barreto, academic at the University of Lisbon, the CCCM began to be chaired, from February 2020, by Carmen Amado Mendes. The leader recently saw her service committee renewed by 2030.
A few months after taking office as president, Carmen Amado Mendes presented, on September 18, 2020, the new “Strategic Development Plan of the Macau Scientific and Cultural Center 2020-2030”.
Since then, the CCCM has awarded dozens of doctoral scholarships for the studies of Macao, China and Asia, and the “Spring Conferences”, which bring together academic performances around the same themes every year. Also noteworthy that the CCCM opened, in December last year, the “Gallery of Governors”, with 41 paintings of the former Portuguese governors of Macao. A new building that houses the file and library was also inaugurated.
This plan sets objectives by 2030, "the reinforcement of scientific and cultural cooperation in the domain of past understanding, present and future trends of relations between Europe and Asia."
With regard to archives, it is intended to “modernize and dynamization within a network of documentation centers and international reference file on euro-seatic themes, with emphasis on the various files in Lisbon, but also in Portugal and Europe”.
Tendo em conta que o CCCM alberga, nas suas instalações, o Museu de Macau, a direcção aponta para a “inserção e valorização na rede de museus a nível de Lisboa e nacional”.
A ideia central do plano era desenvolver, até 2030, “as instalações do CCCM como um pólo de dinamização das relações científicas, culturais e económicas entre Portugal e a China, incluindo a instalação de entidades como a Câmara de Comércio e Indústria Luso-Chinesa, da Associação de Jovens Empresários Portugal-China, e da Agência ERASMUS+, para além de núcleos de investigação em estudos Euro-Asiáticos”. It remains to be seen if, with the merger, all these initiatives will continue their initial course.</description><pubDate>2025-08-04 07:39:48</pubDate></item><item><title>Middle East | China regrets US sanctions to Palestinian employees</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/04/medio-oriente-china-lamenta-sancoes-dos-eua-a-funcionarios-palestinianos/</link><description>The US Administration has decided to further condition the granting of visas to members of the organization for the release of Palestine and the Palestinian National Authority.

High blood pressure
The announcement of sanctions arises in the midst of increasing international pressure on Israel to improve the conditions in the Gaza Strip, which crosses a severe humanitarian crisis and where, in recent days, local authorities have reported a peak of hunger -related deaths.
France, the United Kingdom and Canada, among other countries, expressed their decision to recognize a Palestinian state before the UN in response to the situation, announcements that were received with strong criticism from the Israeli government, which considers this measure a "support for Hamas."
US President Donald Trump defended on Thursday that the “fastest” way of ending the crisis in Gaza is the surrender of the Palestinian Islamist group and the return of Israeli hostages that maintain in their power.</description><pubDate>2025-08-04 07:53:59</pubDate></item><item><title>DSEDJ | Condemned use of smaller smuggling network</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/01/dsedj-condenado-uso-de-menor-em-rede-de-contrabando/</link><description>The Directorate of Youth Education and Development Services (DSEDJ) condemned the use that a smuggling network made a minor.

In his hands, Kaebauk, an ornament with buffalo horns, which represents the sun, strength, safety, protection and power, traditionally used in the head and on the roofs of sacred houses, gains the form of earrings and pending to be used in a necklace.
Already the “Belak”, a bronze disc that symbolizes the moon and is used to the chest and inside the sacred houses, can also be bought in earrings.
In Joaquim Sumali's workshop, neither does necklaces, called “Morten”, are normally listed with the orange color, which bring luck and prosperity and push the evil spirits and negative energies.
“I want to do this job. My father also worked with jewelry, shaped Belak and Kaebauk since the time of the Portuguese, and so far my brothers and sisters sometimes still make jewelry like Kaebauk and Belak in Dili,” Lusa Joaquim Surumali told.
The 34 -year -old jeweler stressed that his art is a family tradition, which continues to this day. “I learned to make jewelry with my father and my brothers. But our work comes from our own blood, from our father and the elders who also made jewelry like the ones that are done today,” explained Joaquim Surumali.
Other materials
Joaquim Surumali makes the jewelry in gold, silver or bronze, depending on the preference and money of customers. The material, according to the jeweler, is bought in Timor-Leste, but most come from Indonesia or Singapore, because resources in the country are scarce.
"As people buy in gold to put in holy houses, it is no longer available. So we try to buy abroad. Most of the time, customers are the ones who bring gold and we only charge for our labor," said the jeweler.
Asked about jewelry prices, the craftsman explained that a pure gold "Belak" can cost $ 600 and a $ 100 "death". "Many Timorese buy these jewelry, but also many Portuguese, especially teachers," he said.
Joaquim explained that the Portuguese appreciate these pieces because they see in them something unique and traditional of Timor-Leste. The Timorenses buy them to put them in the sacred houses of families and can be seen in all municipalities of the country. The most bought articles are, above all, the “Belak” of gold.
About the monthly yield of jewelry production, Joaquim Surumali said it can reach the monthly $ 500, but it depends on the number of customers and visits.</description><pubDate>2025-08-04 07:57:41</pubDate></item><item><title>Fringe | Event dedicated to “Urban Ride” returns in September</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/04/fringe-evento-dedicado-ao-passeio-urbano-regressa-em-setembro/</link><description>“Urban Ride” is the central theme of the next edition of the Fringe Festival, the 23rd, which arrives in the territory between September 5 and 28. The public can enjoy a total of 18 shows and 13 activities, inside and out of doors, and with the usual wave of energy and creativity to which the fringe has accustomed Macau
 
The Cultural Institute (IC) announced, on Friday, the program of the 23rd edition of the Fringe Festival, scheduled for September 5-28 and with the theme “Urban Ride”. In total, 18 shows and 13 activities will be held in the territory, promising “stages full of creativity”, in which “art spreads according to the paths of each one” reads in the IC press release.
One of the highlights is the “Crème de La Fringe” section, where two events are integrated: “Tomato - Interactive Digital Theater Show”, presented between September 10 and 21; and "Clowns for the" Complicité "festival".
As for “tomato”, it is an Erik Kuong curated event featuring four distinct programs: “The Monster-an immersive and personal adventure theater”; “Diaries to Deriva - Urban Tour Theater”; “Vellada Brightness: Exposure of Installation of Urban Micro Sensações” and “Adventure Book-A Hidden Window in Macao-version with musical accompaniment”.
The aim is that, through a mobile phone application, the “Chito” platform, the public can follow the stories behind these programs, which take place in old Macao areas as is the case of the parishes of Santo António, Sé or São Lourenço. This is an initiative “where digital and physical worlds converge”, highlights the curator, and that allows “the public to follow history and explore hidden corners of the city through an application”, which is a “pioneering theatrical experience that connects communities through digital stories narration”.
Then, inside the “Crème de la fringe” also presents the “clowns for the festival‘ Complicité ’”, which is curated by Chan Lai Nei and includes three events: “Kung Food: Vegetarian Martial Art”, “The Menu of Today” and “You or Me?”, All of them held at the Carmo Fair and with free participation.
With the creation of the theater company, this Fringe series brings “artistic groups from Europe and Asia”, presenting “three culturally diverse and interactive shows and two extension activities”, with the promise of an “conspiracy of joy” and an “accidental hilarity that triggers a reaction in a jail of laughter”.
Chan Lai Nei says his view of the clowns world "changed completely" after a period of study in France. Thus, the “clowns for the‘ Complicité ’festival wants to offer an unexpected theatrical experience, with moments that resonate in your heart,” reads the synopsis of the show.
Comedies and other stories
In addition to the “Crème de La Fringe” there are also other initiatives, namely the performance of the Japanese group Co.Scoopp that presents the show “To Survive in Cities!”, A “comedy full of emotions that combines elements of air acrobatics, interaction and juggling”.
Also noteworthy is for programs such as “oscillating deck”, presented by Ieong Pui San and Zhang Hui, where “augmented reality is adjusted to the real world, allowing participants to experiment with the inner port [otherwise] where memories merge with dream visions”.
Suzuki Cheng presents "thanks for being here", addressing the theme of motherhood in a "temporal and spatial dialogue through an immersive theater." Already the art studio PO presents "Dreaming Machine, Useless Class", where "participants become judges and experience various types of self-service machines in the shopping center."
The company Own Theater brings to Fringe “Wendy and the Wonderland” to tell a story “for the search for child innocence” where “body acrobatics, ride and air dance” are part of. Also emphasizing the inclusion of the “Congregation” show, which is born of a collaboration between British sound artist Ray Lee and “Tempest Projects”. It is "a dynamic experience that combines environment, music and technology", where, with "emission of sounds, the suspended sphere guides participants by paths and alleys that can be familiar or a discovery."
Connection to the story
The IC points out that this edition of Fringe is concerned to bring the festival to older areas, such as the Verde Island neighborhood or the Lai Chi Vun shipyards in Colaane, just to name a few examples. What is intended to do is the mix of “scenographic art with historical charm”, where many local groups participate.
This is the case of the Dirks Theatrical Art Association, which presents “Orchids to the Old House”, telling the story of “piglet traffic” using music.
Then we have the solo show of Chan Si Kei, "a meeting in solitude", which has as its background an old tea hall, where the artist "weaves considerations about evocative vignettes of family dinners."
Casa de Portugal in Macau also joins the Fringe poster with the show “Jazzés &amp; The Blackbird”, where “three musicians sing the jazz classics, on a makeshift stage on the porch of Casa de Portugal headquarters, admitted by an artistic installation of giant birds by Elisa Vilaça”.
If there is already poster, there are no tickets available yet. Ticket sales to Fringe starts on August 10, next Sunday.</description><pubDate>2025-08-04 07:55:36</pubDate></item><item><title>UN | Request to Thailand and Cambodia Respect for the ceasefire</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/01/onu-pedido-a-tailandia-e-camboja-respeito-pelo-cessar-fogo/</link><description>The United Nations asked Thailand and Cambodia to respect the ceasefire after the two countries of Southeast Asia have been mutually accused of violating the truce agreement.
"This crucial agreement must be fully respected in good faith on both sides, while diplomats continue to address the causes of conflict," UN high-compensation for human rights, Volker Türk said in a statement.
Bangkok and Phnom Penh agreed with a truce, which began on Monday to Tuesday, after five days of gunfire at its 800 km shared border due to a territorial dispute. However, the Thailand Foreign Ministry has announced that several Thai soldiers from Sisaket's eastern province have been attacked “by Cambodian forces” equipped with “small weapons” and grenades. "This represents a blatant violation of the ceasefire agreement," the ministry said in a statement.
Thai government spokesman Jirayu Huangsab also reported clashes on Wednesday night, stating that "the Thai side maintained the control of the situation" and that the general situation along the border only normalized at 08h local (09h in Macao). For his part, an official from the Cambodian Ministry of Defense also accused Thailand of violating the ceasefire twice.</description><pubDate>2025-08-01 01:06:48</pubDate></item><item><title>Chikungunya | The first two local cases registered</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/04/chikungunya-registados-os-dois-primeiros-casos-locais/</link><description>Health services (SS) announced on Saturday the first two local cases of chikungunya fever. Both cases are linked to zone A of new landfills, previously associated as a contagion zone, by the interior authorities.
The first local case of chikungunya fever concerns a local, 34 -year -old local resident in the black sand and works in a shipyard in zone A. The man began to show symptoms on June 27, with an inflamed throat, although he had no fever or joint pain. The first test was negative.
Symptoms get worse in the following days, which had moved on August 1 to the Conde São Januário Hospital Center. On this day, the diagnosis was positive. During the period prior to the contagion, the man did not leave Macau.
The second case involves a 34 -year -old resident who works at the ship's A landmark shipyards. According to the SS, the woman began to develop symptoms on July 30, initially with her legs to get red. However, symptoms spread to the face, while began to develop fever. So on August 1, the woman went to Kiang Wu Hospital. The diagnosis was made the next day by the public health laboratory.
The patient is in a stable situation, far from danger, and to receive treatment at the Conde São Januário hospital center.
The woman was in Japan between July 13 and 21, but said she was not bitten by mosquitoes. From that date he was always working in zone A of new landfills, even during the weekend days. In addition to these two local cases, six other cases imported from chikungunya fever were reported.</description><pubDate>2025-08-04 07:47:30</pubDate></item><item><title>PAULO MAIA AND CARMO</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/autor/paulomaiaecarmo/</link><description>Zhao Gou (1107-1187), Emperor Gaozong (R.1127-62), lived the difficult time of recreation of the Song dynasty, when in 1127 his members were forced by the Jurchen nomades to abandon the capital Bianjing (current Kaifeng) towards the southern.
Of these unsettling times with which the South Song (1127-1279) was started the escape itinerary made them pass through Nanjing, where they went to the current Shangqiu, then Yangzhou until they set a new capital in Linan (current Hangzhou) in 1129.
Xiansheng Cilie (1115-1197), the Emperor's wife, or simply Song's Empress Wu who was, like he lover of the brush arts, recalled with bitterness in a brief poem: “Here beautiful plums are early and peach-winged by the wind,/ In the light of dusk, the Jade album in the vicent Celeste./ In Yangzhou I met the soft face of the spring breeze,/ comparing all the flowers, in general, nothing resembles the others.
Everything, by the way, would be a little different. In the influence of neo-confutic philosophy, the reform of the society from the bottom up was now sought. Seeing painters' works, there will be a tendency to reduce the size of the paintings, abandoning the great scenarios with the large mountain visually dominating other smaller ones suggesting a order from above, and a closer form of representation emerges from more intimate scenes linked to everyday life.
An example of this change is seen in the works of Su Hanchen (1094-1172), a painter of the Imperial Academy, sponsored by Gaozong's father, the inspired Emperor Huizong (1082-1135). In a painting made in a round range (Tuanshan) is a lady sitting in front of a parker in a garden (paint, color and gold on silk, 25.2 x 26.7 cm, at the Museum of Fine Arts of Boston). Seen from her back, her face appears in the mirror she holds in her right hand, stressing the fact that we are admiring a private moment.
Su Hanchen would, however, be more recognized by two themes that would become genres within figurative painting. The scenes of children playing, Yingxi Tu, shown in different environments, and Bujigangas sellers, Huolang Tu, carrying a huge paraphernalia of objects, usually cheap articles accessible to all. Both figures capable of provoking an unconstant joy.
In two paintings that are at the National Palace Museum in Taipei (one of them, a vertical roller, ink and silk color, 181.5 x 267.3 cm) joins both themes, showing the street vendor welcomed by children from rich families. In a foreboding of what would come next. After all, with a smaller territory, the dynasty resumed in the south by Gaozong would be even more prosperous than in the north.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Today Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/autor/hoje-macau/</link><description>It is in his workshop in Tasi Tolu, Dili, that Joaquim Surumali preserves the cultural heritage of Timor-Leste by replicating in jewelry, for daily use, pieces used in sacred houses and in traditional ceremonies and dances.

In addition to the EU agreement, the US government has agreed new commercial terms with the United Kingdom, China, Vietnam, Japan, Philippines and Indonesia, while negotiations continue with dozens from other countries, US authorities.
Here is the data from the list of the seven bilateral trade agreements that Trump was able to obtain since January, when he returned to the White House for a second presidential term.
+++ United Kingdom +++
Signed on May 8, it was the first bilateral agreement signed by Trump since the US government announced a new tariff plan.
This agreement establishes the reduction of tariffs on British cars from 25% to 10% - up to 100,000 vehicles per year - and the elimination of steel and aluminum tariffs; Reciprocal permissions for export of beef and agricultural products, as well as reduction of non -tariff barriers and simplification of customs procedures.
+++ China +++
On June 26, after reciprocal threats of tariffs up to 115%, the United States and China have reached an agreement of principle that is still being developed.
Although it keeps high rates-55% for exporting certain Chinese products to the United States-facilitates the export of rare land in China, eliminates mutual retaliation measures and softens controls on Chinese products to the US market.
+++ Vietnam +++
The US and Vietnam agreed on July 2 to increase the vietnamese exports to the US to 20% (with a 40% rate on the products suspected of being Chinese origin). Trump's previous threat was to establish tariffs in the 46%.

++ Japan ++
Japan agrees with a 15% rate on all its exports to the United States compared to the 25% rate with which Trump had threatened. The country was committed to investing $ 550 billion (about 470 billion euros) in the US and opening its markets to sectors such as car, rice and agricultural products.
++ Philippines ++
The US now imposing a 19% rate on Philippine products, less a percentage point than the 20% that had threatened, in exchange for the exemption of tariffs on US products that enter the Philippines. The announcement was made on July 22, after the visit of Filipino President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., to the White House.
++ Indonesia ++
On the same date, July 22, and with almost identical content, Trump's agreement with Indonesia establishes 19% rates on exports to the United States and, in parallel, includes aircraft purchase commitments, US agricultural and energy products.
++ European Union ++
On Sunday, July 27, the trade agreement between the United States and the EU was announced, which states that most European exports will be subject to 15% fees - Trump had threatened with 30% - but included tariff exemptions for certain products.
In the agreement, the EU is committed to buying $ 750 billion (about 650 billion euros) in the United States, investing $ 600 billion (about 510 billion euros) in the country and increasing its US military equipment purchases.</description><pubDate>2025-07-29 02:33:12</pubDate></item><item><title>Macao Forum | Former advisor to Rocha Vieira enhances complementarity</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/24/forum-macau-antigo-assessor-de-rocha-vieira-realca-complementaridade/</link><description>The role of the Macao Forum should be compromised in a complementary way to other existing cooperation. The idea was defended by Tiago Vasconcelos, advisor to Rocha Vieira, at a symposium promoted by the City of Macau. The Major General also agrees with the extent of the forum to Spanish-speaking countries
 
On Tuesday at the City of Macau (UCM), a symposium centered on cooperation in areas of scientific research and higher education between Macau, China and Portuguese-speaking countries, which served to present various academic projects that are being developed at MSAR.
The event was attended by Major-General Tiago Vasconcelos, who was an advisor to General Rocha Vieira in the last years of the Portuguese administration of the territory, and who defended a broader look at the role that the Macao Forum can take.
In its presentation, which HM had access, it is read that "the importance of the creation of the Macau Forum cannot be underestimated, both from a symbolic and practical point of view," but "it is necessary to be realistic as to what one can expected from such an organization."
Thus, for Tiago Vasconcelos, “the Macao Forum must find its place among other forms of diplomacy”, such as “bilateral relations, in some cases 'strategic partnerships' bilateral, such as Brazil and Portugal”, or “belonging to other forums” or “multilateral organizations such as G20 or BRICS, of which both China and Brazil are members, or the ASEAN Regional Forum, of which Timor-Leste as China are participants. ”
It is for the person responsible for a "variable geometry", where "the belongings of countries to various forums simultaneously can offer opportunities for the" Macao Platform "to broaden its scope."
And here the former advisor of the last Portuguese governor of Macau highlights the importance of the extent of the MSA platform to Spanish -speaking countries, something that has also been defended by the local executive.
Thus, the MSAR can, with the multiplicity of roles and partnerships of the Macao Forum, “reach other Latin-speaking countries, especially Spanish-speaking, given the similarities between Portuguese and Spanish languages, and existing dialogue platforms, such as the Ibero-American conference, which connects Portugal, Spain and most Latin American countries”.
In general terms, the official understands that one should “understand the proper role played by the Macau Forum among the various personalized bilateral and multilateral cooperation formats, as well as the lessons learned from the more than 20 years of history of the Forum”. This “is of paramount importance to ensure the proper level of ambition and the effectiveness of any new forms of cooperation in which Macau can act as a useful platform,” he said.
A promising land
In conclusion, Tiago Vasconcelos said that since the arrival of the early Portuguese to the territory, in the mid -16th century, that "Macau has played a traditional role as a platform between mainland China and the outside world", playing "part of the" Portuguese world "for almost 450 years, naturally integrating its network."
Thus, ties with Portuguese -speaking countries are "a legacy of their history," which "helps Macao to preserve some of their distinctive characteristics, but also play a useful role in supporting Chinese diplomacy, further facilitating China's relations with Portuguese -speaking countries."
For Tiago Vasconcelos, “Macau's prospects are quite promising to continue to play its traditional and very distinctive role as a connecting platform between China and the Portuguese-speaking countries”, taking into account that it begins half of the 50-year transition period present in the Sino-Portuguese joint statement of 1987.
Still in the area of higher education, the Major General pointed out that "despite its dimension, Macau is becoming, if it is no longer, a center of excellence for higher education in China." "Even worldwide, the same can be said about some specific sectors, making Macau a highly attractive destination for very talented students," he added. The official highlighted the role of the four key laboratories of the existing state, namely VLSI (large-scale integrated circuits) analog and mixed signal at the University of Macao (one); The Quality Research Laboratory in Chinese Medicine, between one and the University of Science and Technology of Macao; The Internet of Things Laboratory to Smart Cities, at UM; and also the laboratory for the Lunar and Planetary sciences, of Must.
The seminar where Tiago Vasconcelos participated, entitled “Scientific and Technological Cooperation between China and Portuguese -speaking countries”, also attended representatives of the central government's connection office on the Macau forum, among other academic and business personalities.
According to a press release on the event sent to HM, José Paulo Esperança, vice-rector of the UCM Faculty of Economics, spoke of the importance of financing academic investigations by the Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) in Portugal, highlighting “FCT's efforts to promote international cooperation and resolution of common challenges”.
IP KUAI PENG, Vice-Rector of UCM and Director of the Institute of Studies of Portuguese Speaking Countries of the same educational institution, argued that Macau “should be based on cooperation with Portuguese-speaking countries”, as well as “actively expanding exchange in various areas with Spanish-speaking countries, building a deep, and sustainable cooperation ecosystem, continuing to expand the circle of international friends and international friends and draw a new plan for modernization ”in the format followed by China.
In addition, the official believes that the “remains an important high-level outside opening window for the country” should continue to create “an international cooperation model in areas such as high technology, digital economy and standardization of traditional Chinese medicine, contributing to the construction of a technological power of the country and, at the same time, achieving diverse and moderate economic development”.
Think-Tank to Spanish
The UCM Vice Rector believes it can be created in Macau “an interregional Think Tank with the best universities in Portuguese and Spanish countries, focusing on areas such as green energy, biomedicine and digital technology, promoting transionic circulation with technological means and helping developing countries to overcome digital gap”.
Among the participating researchers in the seminar, highlighting Marta Filipa Simões, from the Macao University of Science and Technology, which presented the Sino-Portuguese Cooperation Project in Fungi and Astrobiology Research. The academic suggested “the conduct of various research projects through cooperation between Macau and scientific research institutions in Angola, Brazil, Cape Verde, Mozambique and Portugal, in order to promote interregional scientific innovation”.
Already André Antunes, from the University of São José, stressed that, currently, "Macao plays an important role as a point of contact in the network of Portuguese-speaking countries", with a very centered cooperation "in the economic area", although, he defended, "the scientific area will become in a new strong point."</description><pubDate>2025-07-24 05:04:52</pubDate></item><item><title>Dengue Fever | Authorities warn of the risk of imported cases</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/22/febre-da-dengue-autoridades-alertam-para-risco-de-casos-importados/</link><description>Macau is facing a “high risk” period of imported cases of dengue fever and chikungunya. The warning was reiterated yesterday at a joint conference on health services and the institute for municipal affairs. Last year's dengue fever cases have been the highest of the last two decades
 
Health Services (SS) and the Institute for Municipal Affairs (AMI) joined yesterday to alert the population to the growing risk of imported cases of dengue fever and chikungunya fever, given that the summer period is synonymous with more travel and travel.
At a press conference, Leong Iek Hou, doctor and head of the SS disease prevention and control center, said that "there was an increase in cases of dengue fever and chikungunya fever in neighboring regions, which is a high risk to Macao." In addition, he added, "we know that we are in the summer time, there is an increase in the number of Macao residents who travel abroad, or tourists traveling to Macao, factors that may increase the risk of disease." Thus, “the risk of cases [fever] in Macau is high,” said the official.
Leong Iek Ham has advanced some numbers, having said that until Sunday, 2,285 confirmed cases of fever were reported, 2,100 occurred only in Shunde district.
In the case of Macao, between 2013 and 2019 there were “two to three imported cases of chikungunya fever, all from Southeast Asia”, but in recent years it has increased, although there are no serious cases.
Leong Iek Hou also highlighted the fact that, last Friday, Macau registered the first imported case of this year's Chikungunya fever. According to a statement issued by the SS that same day, the patient is a 61 -year -old man, resident and resident in the Cheng I building, on Avenida do Conselheiro Borja.
Between July 8 and 17, the patient moved to Shunde district in Foshan, with the aim of visiting family members. However, they describe the SS, on the morning of the 17th “began to present symptoms such as fever, headaches, muscle and joint aches, among others”, having returned Macao and sought medical treatment at the Conde de São Januário hospital center.
On the 18th, the public health laboratory confirmed the presence of the Chikungunya virus, with a positive result. To date, the patient has kept stable.
Since the beginning of the year and until July 19, the city of Foshan recorded a total of 1,873 confirmed cases of chikungunya fever, of which 1,790 are from the Shunde district, focusing mainly on the villages of Lecong, Beijiao, Chencun. 49 cases occurred in the district of Chancheng, focusing mainly on the sub-district of Shiwanzhen, Zumiao and Zhangcha; While 34 cases were detected in the Nanhai district, focusing mainly on the Guicheng sub-district.
A dengue of the worst
As for dengue fever cases, Leong Iek Hama pointed out that by 2024 the occurrence of this disease "it was relatively more severe when compared to the last 20 years, as 38 cases of dengue were recorded, nine locations."
"This year were registered eight cases imported of dengue fever, being a place," said the SS official. It has been said that it is possible to lock and combat these infections through, for example, the cleaning of stagnant water, which attracts the proliferation of mosquitoes.
“This year we have done more work to eliminate mosquitoes with Jardim Camões,” said Fong Vai Seng, head of the AMI Environmental Hygiene and Licensing Department.
"We can say that we can eliminate mosquitoes that can be carriers of the virus [causer of fevers], avoiding its transmission. In any of the forms we are at the peak of cases, and residents and tourists may be carried to the virus, so we have to be alert. We have done a series of cleaning work to avoid the source of mosquitoes proliferation, and until June [since the year] we have supervised about 7,400 spaces." It was mentioned.
Inspection actions took place in 140 places that are considered “black points” with regard to the proliferation of mosquitoes, and between January and June this year, 1,220 chemical elimination actions of these insects were made.
Both entities promise to work side by side in cleaning land. “AMI and SS have a mechanism for monitoring and treatment of hygiene problems in private spaces or unoccupied land. Whenever the ss find that there is danger to public health, or in case of an emergency situation, and whenever it is not possible to contact the landowners, AMI will collaborate on removing containers or zones with stagnant water that may serve as proliferation of Mosquitoes, ”was said at the press conference.
Leong Iek Hou also explained that there are not yet many places in Macao where tests can be done that disapprove of the infection. "There are not many medical institutions that have this type of test available. When clinics or private hospitals want to take the test for the displaying of transmitted diseases, these institutions send us blood samples and we do the tests in our public health laboratory for free for various types of fever, given that symptoms are similar."
Hong Kong on Alert
The risk alert of more imported cases of these two types of fever has also arrived in Hong Kong. According to the South China Morning Post newspaper on Thursday, several experts warn of the high risk of infections taking into account the outbreak registered in the city of Foshan, belonging to Guangdong province.
Wong Hoi-Kei, a senior doctor and head of the Guangdong Center for Health Protection, said that "although outbreaks do not occur in popular cities among Hong Kong inhabitants, frequent trips between Guangdong and Hong Kong mean the risk of imported cases is higher."
Also quoted by the same newspaper, doctor Joseph Tsang Kay-Yan, an infectious illness expert, said it is possible that Hong Kong will have imported cases that may lead to sporadic infections, and explained that the two types of fevers have similar symptoms, but with a big difference: with chikungunya fever, patients feel joint pain.
Wong Hoi-Kei said that several cleaning actions are being developed to prevent mosquito proliferation and to inform the population for symptoms. "We have the ability to reduce the risk of an outbreak triggered by imported cases as much as possible," Wong said.
This year alone, and according to data released by SCMP, more than 220,000 cases of chikungunya fever were recorded worldwide in 14 locations, including the Taiwan and Singapore regions. The latest cases of this type of fever in Hong Kong had occurred in 2019, with only 11 patients.
According to the SS, the means of transmission and measures to prevent and control chikungunya fever and dengue fever are identical, both transmitted by mosquitoes of “aedes albopictus” species, which usually reproduce in small amounts of stagnant, clean and stopped water. Given the recent passage through Macao do Typhoon Wipha, the authorities yesterday remembered the importance of cleaning these spaces.
Chikungunya fever is a viral disease and has a period of incubation of three to eight days, which can vary between two and 12 days, with fever symptoms and then joint pain in body areas such as wrists, knees, ankles and fingertips. Two to three days later rashes appear. "The whole course of the disease usually lasts five to seven days, being the state of health of most patients considered light," explains the SS.</description><pubDate>2025-07-22 23:51:12</pubDate></item><item><title>CCCM | Fusion with Foundation for Science and Technology creates new agency</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/04/cccm-fusao-com-fundacao-para-a-ciencia-e-tecnologia-cria-nova-agencia/</link><description>Operating since 1999, the Macau Scientific and Cultural Center will merge with the Foundation for Science and Technology and the National Innovation Agency, creating a new institution. The practical consequences for the CCCM that aims to promote studies on Macao, China and Asia in Portugal are unknown. The president of the center says it is early to make comments
 
It is not known whether it will maintain its name, the number of scholarships for studies on China, Macao and Asia, or whether to change staff, but what is certain is that the Macao Scientific and Cultural Center (CCCM) will merge with the Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) and the National Innovation Agency. Of these three entities will be born the new agency for research and innovation.
The process is linked to the desire to reform the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology by the Portuguese government led by Luís Montenegro, and the changes were announced on Thursday.
However, there is still no great information about the consequences of this merger to the CCCM. At HM, Carmen Amado Mendes, its president, chose to refer to clarification for the future operation of the center, considering that it is "premature" to give answers about something "that is not yet defined."
On Thursday, Minister Fernando Alexandre announced the reform of the Ministry of Education, Science and Innovation with the extinction of several entities, including FCT that has been the main financier of PhD and other research projects in Portugal.
The reform of the ministry was approved by the Council of Ministers and, at a press conference at the end of the meeting, Fernando Alexandre justified the restructuring by describing his ministry as an “anacronic structure”, with fragmented organizations, disintegrated information systems and disarticulated governance.
With 18 entities and 27 higher leaders between the services of the non -higher education system and higher education, science and innovation, the ministry will have only seven entities and 27 higher leaders, with the integration of extinguished entities into new entities.
Regarding the extinction of the FCT, the minister assured that the financing of science will be preserved, with funding for four years that guarantees stability, predictability and “the protection of the financing of the most basic fundamental investigation”.
“When we started thinking about this reform, we do it with a vision: to ensure equal opportunities to access quality education,” said Fernando Alexandre, also underlining the reinforcement of the education system.
Marcelo can veto
The extinction of FCT has generated some less good reactions in Portugal because it fears a reduction in investment in science and research. Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, president of the Portuguese Republic, said he had “the sensation” that the foundation was replaced “with an agency in which he was integrated, and had other functions beyond those of FCT.”
Marcelo acknowledged that the Foundation was a “very old structure” and that “it had many aspects that deserved to be rethought”, but said: “Just seeing what the new agency will do can I answer if this extinction is a good or bad idea.”
As for the eventual 'green light' from Belém, Marcelo said that if he thinks this extinction is "good", promulgates the diploma "without anguish." "If you have doubts about a point that is this diploma that is very important I ask the government to rethink. It has happened. I may not veto soon. If the government insists, I can come to veto, if it is until the end of my mandate," he also admitted.
A history of the transition
The CCCM was born in 1995 during the administration of Vasco Rocha Vieira, the last Portuguese governor of Macao, intending to be “a place of excellence for the dissemination of Macau, its history, its culture and its economy”, reads in the memories of Rocha Vieira, “to all the ports I arrived”.
This entity, operating in the Alcântara area, in Lisbon, was inaugurated in November 1999 by the then President of the Republic, Jorge Sampaio, and had as first president Alexandra Costa Gomes.
On the CCCM website it is read that the institution is endowed with administrative autonomy and its own heritage, being a public institute integrated in the indirect administration of the state and under the tutelage of the Ministry of Education, Science and Innovation.
In the objective booklet, it is read that the CCCM “has as its mission to produce, promote and disseminate knowledge about Macao as a platform between Portugal and the Popular Republic of China, as well as between Europe and Asia”, also presenting itself as “a space dedicated to the study and teaching of Chinese language, culture and history”. The center has also been established as "a center for scientific research and continuous and advanced training on the relations between Portugal and China, as well as between Europe and Asia."
After the long presidency of Luís Filipe Barreto, academic at the University of Lisbon, the CCCM began to be chaired, from February 2020, by Carmen Amado Mendes. The leader recently saw her service committee renewed by 2030.
A few months after taking office as president, Carmen Amado Mendes presented, on September 18, 2020, the new “Strategic Development Plan of the Macau Scientific and Cultural Center 2020-2030”.
Since then, the CCCM has awarded dozens of doctoral scholarships for the studies of Macao, China and Asia, and the “Spring Conferences”, which bring together academic performances around the same themes every year. Also noteworthy that the CCCM opened, in December last year, the “Gallery of Governors”, with 41 paintings of the former Portuguese governors of Macao. A new building that houses the file and library was also inaugurated.
This plan sets objectives by 2030, "the reinforcement of scientific and cultural cooperation in the domain of past understanding, present and future trends of relations between Europe and Asia."
With regard to archives, it is intended to “modernize and dynamization within a network of documentation centers and international reference file on euro-seatic themes, with emphasis on the various files in Lisbon, but also in Portugal and Europe”.
Given that CCCM houses, in its facilities, the Macao Museum, the board points to the “insertion and appreciation in the museum network at the level of Lisbon and National”.
The central idea of the plan was to develop, by 2030, “CCCM facilities as a pole of streamlining scientific, cultural and economic relations between Portugal and China, including the installation of entities such as the Luso-Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Erasmus+Youth Entrepreneurs Association, as well as research nuclei in eurical studies”. It remains to be seen if, with the merger, all these initiatives will continue their initial course.</description><pubDate>2025-08-04 07:39:48</pubDate></item><item><title>War | Historians defend a monument about Vitória against Japanese invasion</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/22/guerra-historiadores-defendem-monumento-sobre-vitoria-contra-invasao-japonesa/</link><description>In a year of celebration of the 80th anniversary of China's victory in the war against Japanese aggression, Macao schools were encouraged by the government to convey these historical episodes to students. In the fervor of the ephemeris, an academic defended the construction of a monument to mark the date. HM has heard historians who enhance the ideas that should be transmitted by the monument
 
2025 is the year in which the 80th anniversary of China's victory is celebrated in the so -called Chinese people's resistance war against Japanese aggression and anti -fascist World War, that is, when China and Hong Kong managed to escape the Japanese occupation. Macao, having Portuguese administration, and for having kept neutral during World War II, was not occupied by the Japanese, although the neutrality status was quite volatile, as historian Helena Lopes showed in the work “Neutrality and Collaboration in South China: Macau During the Second World War”.
In this context, the authorities have encouraged the territory schools to remember the historical episode through various activities with a patriotic nature, while Lin Guangzhi, director of the Institute for Social and Cultural Research of the University of Science and Technology of Macao (Must in the English), argued that a monument of war in Japan with Japan should be created in Macau.
HM invited two historians, experts in this historical period, to comment on what has indeed happened in these years and what main messages should be transmitted if the construction of the monument actually advances.
Alfredo Gomes Dias, professor of the Lisbon Polytechnic Institute and author of the Doctoral Thesis on Macaense Diaspora in World War II and the Foundation of the Popular Republic of China, entitled “The Macaense Diaspora. Macau, Hong Kong, Shanghai (1850-1952)”, argues that the celebration of this historical period is common to several countries. "In the case of China, the end of the Japanese invasion, taking into account the violence of which it has covered, can and should be celebrated generically throughout the Chinese territory," he said.
But considering that Hong Kong had an effective occupation, while Macau dealt with refugee seizures and power games between Portuguese, Chinese, English and Japanese, will make sense to have a monument on the mashes? Alfredo Gomes Dias understands yes.
“In the case of Macao, the monument gains relief if he perpetuates the memory that Chinese, Portuguese and Macanese have fought the invasion, especially on the island of Hong Kong, many of them died on the battlefield. In addition, Macau maintained the tradition of being a territory of refuge that housed Chinese and Macanese from Hong Kong.”
Essentially, the researcher understands that "in any of the cities he can be erected," but in the particular case of Macao, it is important that the monument "intends to take into account the specificity of the history of Macao and the diversity of origin of its residents." Moreover, which argues that it should "preserve the memory of all who have joined side by side to oppose Japanese imperialism at this time."
“Ambiguous neutrality”
For Helena Lopes, a particular interest historian in Macao's landscape in World War II, and author of the work on Macao's neutrality during this period, said she did not see "no problem in building a commemorative monument of World War II in Macao."
In the 1930s and 40s of the twentieth century, he recalls, "most of the population was, like today, Chinese," although "a significant number of the population was a refugee, having sought in Macao (such as in other places not occupied in China) shelter of the violence of conflict."
Desta forma, Helena Lopes, professora de história da Ásia contemporânea na Universidade de Cardiff, em Gales, diz ser “normal que a China celebre a vitória na Segunda Guerra, como outros países dos Aliados o fazem”.
Regarding Macao's neutrality, the historian says it was "ambiguous", given that "many opposite sides intersected in the territory during the war."
In these years, "the territory has been deeply linked to networks of resistance and humanitarian aid during the war: it was not isolated from conflict, but it was deeply linked to several of its dynamics identically to other territories in China under foreign dominance (such as foreign concessions of Shanghai or Hong Kong until these territories were completely occupied)."
In this context, he adds Helena Lopes, "it seems natural to celebrate resistance against Japan during the war, where they participated - openly or underground - several people in Macao (Chinese and other nationalities)," he said.
THE ROLE OF HISTORICAL EDUCATION
Territory schools have been "encouraged" by the Directorate of Youth Education and Development Services (DSEDJ) to organize sessions for students and teachers to watch the ceremonies of the "80th anniversary of the Chinese people's victory in the war against Japan and world victory against fascism." According to a press conference organized to announce these initiatives, the celebrations of the 80th anniversary of victory against the Japanese start on September 3 in Beijing, and DSEDJ intends to organize various events in Macao.
Asked about the inclusion of historical celebrations, with a patriotic nature, in local schools, Helena Lopes says “she has no elements to comment on the educational situation in Macao currently”, recalling that in the years of World War II, “schools in Macau were themselves spaces of refuge and resistance to Japanese occupation of China”.
In turn, Alfredo Gomes Dias stresses that “historical education is always an extension of the narrative of national history”, “a reality common to all countries” and not exclusive to Macao.
The DSEDJ press conference for the presentation of commemorative events was attended by the secretary for social and culture affairs, Lam, which has the Pelouro da Education. The ruler said last June that the government's goal is to "promote the great spirit of the War of Resistance" and "inspire patriotic fervor." All activities will be subordinate to the theme: "Remember the story, stroking the memory of the martyrs, caressing peace and creating the future."
One of the highlights of the celebrations will be the memory of the victims of the Nanjing massacre, a celebration scheduled for December 13. Nanjing's massacre took place in 1937, having stepped for a few weeks after the conquest by the Japanese troops of the one who was the capital of the Republic of China. After the conquest, the Japanese troops massacred the population, including children, women and not combatants.
The invasion of China through Japan began in 1931 with the occupation of Manchuria at first. In 1937, Japan expanded the scope of war, seeking the total occupation of China. What began as a conflict located in Asia would eventually be integrated in World War II, from December 1941, with the attacks of Pearl Harbor. Over the course of several years, estimates point out that on the Chinese side between 3.8 million and 10.6 million people died. Peace was reached on December 2, after the United States attacked Japan with the second atomic bomb in Nagasaki.
HM sent questions to Lin Guangzhi, author of the idea of building a monument, but until the closing of this edition was not obtained.</description><pubDate>2025-07-22 05:02:35</pubDate></item><item><title>Wipha | Macau reached the maximum signal 10 and only lowered to 3 at night</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/21/wipha-macau-chegou-ao-sinal-maximo-10-e-so-baixou-para-3-a-noite/</link><description>Typhoon Wipha's passage through Macao forced the authorities to take sign 10, and a total of 163 occurrences were registered, highlighting, highlighting five people who were injured and had to receive medical treatment. Sign 3 of storm was only lifted last night
 
Typhoon Wipha passed yesterday by Macau without leaving havoc of larger, although he has obliged the authorities of the Meteorological and Geophysical Services (SMG) to keep the 10th of storm, the maximum in this type of occurrences, for many hours, between 12:30 and 17h, when it was passed to signal 8. At the time of the closing of this edition, the probability of the tropical signal 3 Between 21h and 23h, synonymous with permission to resume the activities of daily life. Sign 3 was really lifted at 10:30 pm on Sunday.
At 20h was still the blue sign of “Storm Surge”, with expectations of flooding in the low areas of the city between 4am and 8am this Monday.
According to official data, until 7 pm on Sunday the Civil Protection Operations Center recorded 163 occurrences on both the Macao Peninsula and the islands, especially the registration of five typical injuries, which received hospital treatment in both public health facilities and the Kiang Wu Hospital. Only one person will have been retained in the elevator during the passage of the tropical storm.
It is also mentioned the registration of 54 cases in which authorities had to remove broken lamps, falling trees or overthrowing, or construction infrastructure with potential risk. There were also 98 cases of plaster removal, advertising panels, windows or awnings, as well as seven cases where scaffolding or other facilities was required at work-attest, or even overthrown. There was also the registration of a fire.
It is highlighted, of the data of civil protection, the reception of 24 people in the emergency host center of the Institute of Social Action, around 7 pm, and from the opening of these centers 139 people who were not safe were welcomed.
Posts opened at 17h
With regard to transport infrastructures, the SAI VAN PONTE LOWER TABLE was closed at 11am, being open to the circulation of light cars and vehicles from 17h, but by special permission. The upper passage of the same bridge was closed for a long period.
Also from 17h, it was “obtained consensus among the authorities of Macao and Zhuhai” for the reopening of the migration posts of the doors of the siege, Qingmao and the Transfronho Industrial Park Zhuhai-Macau.
Another transport infrastructure closed due to the passage of the Wipha Typhoon, was the HK-Zhuhai-Macau bridge, having been banned at 3:30 am on Sunday.
Macao bridge closed
Another point to be highlighted from the passage of the Wipha Typhoon through the territory, the closing of the new Macau Bridge, the fourth crossing between the Macao peninsula and the mud. It was the first time that this crossing closed doors regarding the passage of a typhoon, but what is certain is that the authorities never clarify whether this bridge would, or not, ended when the occurrence of tropical storms.
In 2023, when the bridge was still being built, Deputy Lei Chan U raised questions to the Executive on this matter. "In the fourth Macau-Taipa bridge, which is currently under construction, will be installed barriers to wind protection in the main line area, to the wind velocity on the bridge board is not higher than the wind velocity on the ground and it is less than the wind speed provided for signal No. 8, enabling uniforming driving with the conditions in the terrestrial areas," he asked.
However, the deputy stressed the existence of “doubts about the possibility of the fourth bridge may be open to vehicle circulation when signal 8 of typhoon is lifted”.
"In response to my written interpellation, the government stated that, before the bridge's entry into operation, the respective regulation should be observed, which will be defined by the Administration. However, according to recent news, the fourth bridge may also be closed to traffic on Typhoon days, for safety reasons, and to be true, in the future, the pressure of traffic between the Macao peninsula and the mud is even more severe," remembered law chan u.
The deputy asked directly whether the bridge would be “open to circulation when signal 8 or higher of typhoon”, and, if negative, “the administration would consider advancing, as soon as possible, with the construction of the fifth connection, in order to satisfy the needs resulting from the constant increase in traffic between Macao and the mud on typhoon days”.
The response of Lam Hin San, director of services for traffic affairs, granted on August 8, 2023, was comprehensive against the deputy's questions: “When the sign of Tropical Storm No. 8 or of higher degree is a sign, the government will adopt, under the law, restrictive precautionary measures, and the residents and tourists remain at home or in safe places”.

CPSP | Intercepted tourists on the bridge
Two tourists were intercepted by agents of the Public Security Police Corps (CPSP) while walking on the noble bridge of Carvalho in full sign 10 of Typhoon. The agents suggested to tourists a trip to a safer place. According to a statement from the Social Communication Office, the CPSP received the complaint at 11:30, having sent the agents to follow the occurrence with the tourists. Tourists were punished with a fine of 50 to 250 patacas for violation of trafficked traffic, a sanction provided for in the road traffic regulation.
Tin Hau | Temple survived the fall of trees
Yesterday afternoon, during the passage of Typhoon Wipha, the trees dropped and the collapse of a platform near the Tin Hau temple, on Fisherman Street, and is also near Macao Water's headquarters. According to a note from the Cultural Institute (IC), the fall of trees did not damage the main structure of the temple, and contacts were made with the temple administrator, confirming that there were no victims. The IC has stated that "it will send, as soon as the safety conditions allow it, employees to inspect and carefully evaluate the state of the Tin Hau temple and will maintain communication with the administrator, with a view to coordinating repair work."
Health | All services return today to normal
Health Services (SS) issued a note yesterday clarifying that all consultation and exam services return to normal today, taking into account the descent of Signal 8 of Storm for signal 3 after Sunday dinner time.
Today, external specialty consultations will be resumed at the Conde de São Januário Hospital Center, namely in radiology and imaging specialties, clinical pathology, hemato-oncology day hospital, differentiated external consultations, endoscopy center and diagnostic room and daytime treatment, among others.
Also from today, centers or health centers, including Covid-19 vaccination services, provide services regularly, while the blood transfusions center maintains their normal blood donation function.
For users who saw the outdoor consultation or blood collection markings at centers and health posts are canceled due to the typhoon, they may present, according to the scheduled time, next Saturday, July 26, at the center or health center of your residence. In addition, affected residents whose markings at the Macao Neighborhood of Macau in Hengqin and the Medical Examination Center for civil servants will be informed of the new marking date, the SS clarifies.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Sao Tome and Prince | Relationship with China is discreet, but strategic</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/14/sao-tome-e-principe-relacao-com-china-e-discreta-mas-estrategica/</link><description>On Saturday, 50 years of the independence of Sao Tome and Principe were celebrated. The future advances to the rhythm of diplomatic relations with other Portuguese speaking countries. For academic Cátia Miriam Costa, the African country and China are strategic partners, despite the description of the relationship between both
 
Researcher Cátia Miriam Costa considers that the relationship between Sao Tome and Principe and China remains discreet, despite being almost celebrating a decade, with growing Beijing's strategic interest in the position of the archipelago in the South Atlantic.
"Since neither country nor another talks much about the subject, we ended up not realizing the depth of the relationship well. But I believe it is not yet a very deep relationship," the researcher at the Center for International Studies of ISCTE - University Institute of Lisbon, noted to the Lusa.
The geostrategic position of the archipelago, located in the Gulf of Guinea, feeds, however, the interest of Beijing, namely in the context of the Chinese bet on the expansion of logistics and sea corridors in the South Atlantic.
"Sao Tome, if it is not a very important port in logistical terms, is a relevant port for control, for example, of piracy, threats. Therefore, this position also certainly reflected by Beijing," he explained.
The restoration of formal ties in 2016, after two decades of Taiwan's recognition by Sao Tome, was a “pragmatic” decision of the African country, and a trump card for Beijing diplomacy, which always maintained “open channels”, even during the removal period, Cátia Miriam Costa explained.
"The relationship with China is more fruitful because it brings other counterparts," explained the researcher. "It was also for these counterparts that [in 1997] Sao Tome exchanged the Popular Republic of China for Taiwan, because at that time the Popular Republic of China was a developing country. So it didn't have to offer what Taiwan had, which was perfectly integrated into the international market," he said.
A VOLTE-FACE
In December 2016, Sao Tome officially announced the establishment of relations with the Popular Republic of China, ending the recognition of Taiwan.
The decision caused the immediate cancellation of the scholarships offered by Taiwan to St.-Tome students, many of whom were eventually integrated into the other Chinese universities. China has quickly become one of the main cooperation partners in São Tomé, with promises of investment and support in areas such as education, technical training, agriculture and infrastructure.
The researcher recalled that even before formal relations, Beijing never completely broke with Sao Tome, keeping the country involved in the activities of the Macao Forum, albeit only as an observer, a strategy he considers "typical of Chinese diplomacy." "China does not fully close the doors. It can suspend relationships, but if it is something of national interest, it is usually renegotiated again," he said.
“Limited Results”
Nevertheless, Cátia Miriam Costa acknowledged that the concrete results of cooperation are still limited. “There are more projects in the role than properly ongoing works,” he said, attributing part of the responsibility to the weak institutional capacity of São Tomé, which only recently began to create structures to attract and negotiate foreign investment.
Among the sectors with the potential for the deepening of cooperation, the researcher highlighted the fishing, the marine resources and eventually the cocoa. Oil exploration raises “high risks”, both for technical complexity and environmental limitations.
"China is interested in the region, but it is not because Sao Tome is an attractive market -because it is not -yes, for its location, stability and integration capacity in a broader regional project," he said.
The researcher also stressed Chinese investment in Chinese language teaching in Sao Tome, which also aims to "create a network of people with language dominance, familiar with culture and potentially useful for the future of bilateral relations." "China maintains a strategic interest in the relationship, even if it does not express it with great visibility. And for a country like Sao Tome, any small help can have a significant impact," he concluded.
Reports of four Sao Tomers who followed courses in China
Denise, Lucineidy, Reginaldo, and Aithysa grew up under the sign of an alliance with Taiwan, until life and academic path were redefined by the rupture of diplomatic ties between Sao Tome and Taipei in 2016.
Denise Aragão Fortes still remembers her hand to Tsai Ing-Wen. It was November 2016, the day of Africa in Taiwan was celebrated, and the official was attended at the time.
It is very likely that behind the scenes would already outline the end of diplomacy between Taiwan and Sao Tome and Principe, but for this student of International Relations at the University of Ming Chuan, in Taoyuan, North Taiwanese, the news, who arrived a month after these celebrations, on December 21, was a surprise.
“There was no rumors, nothing,” recalls Lusa Denise, now 29, working in marketing and living in Almada, Portugal.
When the secondary finished, also the bonds between the island and the African nation, agreed in 1997, had just reached the age of adult. There was “very closeness” between the parts, with Taiwanese friendships in the family.
Normality shaken this December 2016. Studying with a scholarship granted by Taipei, Denise and other St.-Tome students in Taiwan was given the option of continuing studies, without financial assistance, or being transferred to China as scholarships. Being at the end of the academic course, Denise remained in Taoyuan. Most, however, changed geography, university and life.
Country “full of opportunities”
Lucineidy Almeida, now 28, saw the arrival in Tianjin, northern China, as "a new restart" in a "country full of opportunities." Attending the second year of biotechnology in Taichung, this native of Santo António had some difficulty in following the degree in Mandarin. A limitation that would eventually surpass, evaluates today, but in China, had the possibility of studying in English pharmaceutical sciences.
He says he learned of the diplomatic break through social networks and, like all students who spoke to Lusa, left criticism of conducting the process, with “many uncertainties”, information given “on time”, “a feeling of disrespect”, and, in the middle, the suspension of the bags.
Two months after the announcement, he landed in Hong Kong, where he treated his visa, although he still unaware of what his final destination. Only upon arrival in Beijing was he told that he went to Tianjin, recalls Lucineidy, living today in Portugal, in Cacém, and working as an English and Portuguese interpreter in the medical field.
Regarding the diplomatic interruption, it notes that "from what was perceived at the time", it was "a monetary question": "in the sense that China offered more [to Sao Tomé] than Taiwan at the time could provide."
The São Tome Prime Minister of the time, Patrice Trovoada, considered the unilateral break of relations as “the right”, taking into account the authorities' view of the country's development. "We decided the principle of joining one China and when adhering implies the cut of relations with Taiwan. The international scenario 20 years ago, not the same as today," he added.
But the new political order did not take students to advance in the academic career. Aithysa Ramos, 32, is still in Beijing, where, after leaving Taiwan, she concluded the master's degree in business management.
If this morning of 2016, the story had not taken this course, would probably have been in Taiwan, where he had lived seven years ago. At the time, it now remembers the English education teacher, it was “devastated and angry”: “It was like my second home, I passed [part of] my adolescence, growth phases”.
Reginaldo was in the second year of Business Management at the University of Yuan Ze, Taoyuan, when he stayed to the news. He realized that he “had no power” to change the course of history.
The initial shock, assumes today, was really the cold. Despite admitting "it was" always a process of doubts, "China, where he moved two months after the cut of relationships," it was a surprise for the better. " “Because I was still here, not coming back, I can say yes, it was the best thing that happened,” he says.</description><pubDate>2025-07-14 01:35:35</pubDate></item><item><title>Au Kam San Case | MNE criticizes “illusory comments” from EU</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/04/caso-au-kam-san-mne-critica-comentarios-ilusorios-da-ue/</link><description>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed “strong discontent” compared to the European Union's reaction after the detention of former deputy Au Kam San. Hours later, the Macao government also repudiated the statement from Europe
 
The Commissioner for Macao Affairs from the China Ministry of Foreign Affairs repudiated “The Illusory Comments” of Brussels, who condemned the detention of former Macao deputy and Portuguese citizen Au Kam San, expressing concern about the erosion of freedoms in the region.
In a statement sent to Lusa, on Saturday, the Commissioner's spokesman for Macao Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China, led by Liu Xianfa, expressed “discontent” and “firm opposition to the illusory comments of the European Union (SEAE) service (EU) on the application of the Macao Special Administrative Region (Maca),” classifying them as a “gross interference with Macao affairs and China's internal affairs”.
"We urge the European Union to stop making remarks and unfounded accusations about Macao's affairs and stopping immediately to interfere with China's Macao and internal affairs!" Says Liu Xianfa's office.
Beijing's main diplomatic representative in Macao also stressed "firmly the government of the RAE of Macao in the performance of his duties in accordance with the law", as well as "Macao police in taking law enforcement measures against the anti-china rebels against Macau, in accordance with the law."
Macau defends herself
Also the Macao government has “vehemently” the European Union's statements on “criminal proceedings and preventive enforcement actions”. "The Government of the Special Administrative Region of Macao [Mande] vehemently repudiates and is firmly opposed to the statements made [on Saturday] by the European Union (SEAE) Action (SEAE) [EU) on criminal proceedings and pre-trial execution actions of the law recently triggered by MSAR under the law on the defense of state security." Connecting cabinet.
The SAM Hou Fai Executive stressed that it will be all done according to the law: “Mand's police and judicial authorities have always treated the case scrupulously under the law, and the defendant's procedural law is effectively guaranteed under the law,” was pointed out. "The fundamental rights of MSAR residents, including the right of suffrage and freedom of expression, are fully safeguarded by the Basic Law of MSAR and other relevant legislation, the human rights conventions applicable in the MSAR, and the practice of the administrative, legislative and judicial authorities of Masters," he was added.
Macao also refused “external interference” in his matters by the European Union: “the application of the law relating to the defense of state security by the MSAR is strictly an internal subject of China and its special administrative region”, so “any foreign or abroad organisms, including the European Union, have no right to interference.” "The Special Administrative Region of Macao will continue, as always, to comply with the duties of the defense of state security under the law, in favor of the lasting and stable successful application of the principle" a country, two systems ", the statement concluded.
EU condemned
The reactions of local authorities arose after the European Union condemned the detention of the former deputy, who arises as a citizen of the EU, because it has Portuguese nationality.
"The EU [European Union] condemns the detention of Au Kam San, an EU citizen and former Macao deputy on July 30, on charges of [violating the law of national security," a spokesman for the Brussels diplomatic service in a statement said.
The message stressed that it “constitutes the first application of the National Security Law of the Special Administrative Region of Macao since its adoption in 2009”, and the European service for external action stated that the event “aggravates existing concerns about the continuing erosion of political pluralism and freedom of expression” in the region.
Brussels “recalls that respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms is a central element of the Macao Basic Law and the maxim 'a country, two systems',” he added to the statement.
Portugal to accompany
In turn, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Portugal told Lusa to be following the detention of former Macao Deputy and Portuguese citizen Au Kam San. MNE “is following this subject through the Portuguese Consulate-General in Macao,” the ministry led by Paulo Rangel told Lusa.
"The subject will deserve the best attention of the Portuguese authorities, from the outset at future meetings at the political level, in the spirit of the joint statement," he continued, in reference to the Sino-Portuguese Treaty signed in 1987, where the two countries declared the terms in which Beijing would take over the administration of Macao after 1999.
The reactions in Portugal did not stay here. In Parliament the Liberal Initiative Party will present a vote of conviction of the detention. According to the voting project to which Lusa had access to, the detention "is the first under Macao National Security legislation, approved in 2009 and reviewed in 2023, and occurs in a context of accelerated repression of fundamental freedoms in the Special Administrative Region of Macao."
The document written by IL states that the Portuguese State has the “duty to rigorously follow the case and subsequently guarantee respect for the commitments made in the Luso-Chinese joint statement of 1987, a binding document under International Law.
In pre -trial detention
On Thursday at the end of the day, the Public Prosecution Service confirmed that Au will await the trial in pre-trial detention, considering that there is "strong evidence of the crime of establishing connections with organizations, associations or individuals from outside the masters for the practice of state security." The crime implies a penalty that it can reach 10 years in prison and always requires the application of pre -trial detention as coercion measures.</description><pubDate>2025-08-04 07:44:03</pubDate></item><item><title>One country, two systems | Sam says principle is in a new phase</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/04/um-pais-dois-sistemas-sam-diz-que-principio-esta-numa-nova-fase/</link><description>The chief executive indicated that the principle "one country, two systems" has entered, again, in a new phase due to "drastic and complex mutations" with which Macao is debated in the "internal and external conjuncture".

“At present, major changes, unpublished in the last 100 years, are accelerating the evolution of the world, and the world has entered a new period of turbulence and change. Macau is discussed with drastic and complex mutations that occur in the internal and external conjuncture and the practice of 'one country, two systems' has also entered a new phase.” This is how Sam Hou Fai closed the speech on the occasion of the commemorative reception of the 98th anniversary of the establishment of the people's liberation army (ELP) on Friday.
The ruler assured that, together with the ELP garrison, the executive will "persist on the right track" and "write new chapters of high quality development of the cause" a country, two systems ".
The announcement of entry into a new phase of the principle 'one country, two systems' has been a constant in recent years, as well as the reference to “major changes, unpublished in the last 100 years”, which open doors to “periods of turbulence”.
The Chief Executive has promised that his government "will continue, as always, to maintain the close connection and sincere cooperation with the Macao garrison, to unite and lead Macao compatriots to value further, and safeguard with commitment, stability and social harmony, nothing easy to achieve."
Almost a century
Sam Hou Fai recalled that, over the ninety -eight years, the “honorable and grand liberation army of the Chinese people, always guided by the noble ideals and firm convictions, has accompanied the evolution of times with commitment and innovative spirit, honoring the glorious tradition with the conduct of excellence”.
"The army grows while fighting, innovating and conveys tradition, and progresses in the construction of causes. Narrowly aligned with the steps of the development of the homeland and the people, has made great historical achievements that make it a firm force to safeguard world peace," added the chief executive.
Sam Hou Fai also highlighted the objective of the defined ELP “under the guidance of Xi Jinping's thinking”, which is “transforming the people's armed forces into world -class forces that obey party command, can fight and win and maintain excellent conduct”.
In addition, the Chief Executive said that since the parking lot in Macao, the ELP "has always been persisted in defending sovereignty, security and interests of the country's development, comprehensive and accurate implementation of the principles" a country, two systems "and" Macau governed by their people "with a high degree of autonomy, and in the scrupulous observance of the basic law, the droop parking law."</description><pubDate>2025-08-04 07:41:43</pubDate></item><item><title>Work | Unemployment rate remains at 1.5 percent</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/01/trabalho-taxa-de-desemprego-mantem-se-em-15-por-cento/</link><description>Official data show that between the first and second quarter of this year there are more people employed and more jobs. However, in view of the same period, the unemployment rate is higher and there are fewer jobs
 
In the second quarter of this year the unemployment rate was 1.9 percent and the unemployment rate of 2.5 percent residents, which means that they remained unchanged from the first quarter. The information released yesterday by the Directorate of Statistics and Census Services (DSEC) also reveals that there are now fewer people employed compared to last year.
According to the latest figures, between April and June about 372,700 people were employed, when between January and March the number of people with work was 371,800, ie 900 jobs were created. In terms of resident work, the latest figures show 281,600 jobs, 1,400 more than in the first quarter of 2025.
According to DSEC, the area of transport and storage was responsible for the creation of another 1,600 jobs for residents, while the construction sector hired another 1,500 residents. At the opposite pole, hotel and restoration have fewer residents employed, with less 1,000 jobs.
In the second quarter there were 7,300 unemployed among the active population, that is, people who are old to work and who were looking for a job. The number did not change compared to the previous quarter. "Most of those looking for a new job previously worked in the field of economic activity of retail trade, in the field of construction and in the business and other betting games," DSEC said. "In addition to these, the number of unemployed residents looking for the first employment represented 11 percent of unemployed residents, plus 2.6 percentage points, compared to the preceding period," he was added.
The global sub -unemployment rate was 1.6 percent and among 2.5 percent residents, with the latter to fall 0.1 percentage points compared to the first trimester.
Fewer employees
Although employment figures show an improvement since the beginning of the year, when the comparison is made with the same period, the rate of general unemployment and residents is higher, there are fewer jobs and the number of unemployed is higher.
Between May and June 2024, the general unemployment rate was 1.7 percent, while unemployment among residents was 2.3 percent. At that time, the oldest DSEC data show that there were 376,400 people employed, plus 3,700 workers than in the latest numbers.
However, the biggest difference happens at the employment level of residents, with the reduction of 4,700 jobs, compared to the second quarter of last year, when there was employment to 286,300 residents. This difference can be justified with the fact that some residents have chosen to stop working or actually lost their jobs.
Regarding the number of unemployed between May and June 2024, the amount was encrypted at 6,700 people, 600 less than the most recent period.</description><pubDate>2025-08-01 00:38:45</pubDate></item><item><title>DSEDJ | Condemned use of smaller smuggling network</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/01/dsedj-condenado-uso-de-menor-em-rede-de-contrabando/</link><description>The Directorate of Youth Education and Development Services (DSEDJ) condemned the use that a smuggling network made a minor.

The PJ states that Au Kam San passed “incendiary” and “inaccurate” information to “anti-china organizations” and the media and media to encourage hatred against the central government
 
Former deputy Au Kam San was arrested on Wednesday by the Judicial Police (PJ) and is indicted of violating the National Security Act. This is the first public detention under the National Security Act since the establishment of the MSAR in 1999, and the case was referred to the prosecutor.
In a statement issued yesterday, the PJ only identified the detainee by the nickname Au, which accused of alleged "collusion with external forces" that "endangered national security". According to the Chinese language press, Au Kam San's wife, Virginia Cheang Mio San, 68, was yesterday morning at the Public Prosecution Service (MP), where she was accompanied by other family members, to be heard as a witness.
According to PJ, Au acted in collusion with “an anti-china foreign organization” since 2022, who provided “a large amount of inaccurate and incendiary information” to be disclosed outside China and also on the internet. Police also indicated that this type of activity continued to be practiced despite the approval of changes in the National Security Act in 2023.
Au is also accused of having “longtime connections” with several foreign anti-china foreign entities and having “repeatedly” “inaccurate” information about Macau, as well as the media controlled by these entities.
The PJ accuses the detainee of being aimed at “arousing the hatred of the residents of Macao” and “the uninformed population in general” against central government and the Macao government.
The deputy between 2001 and 2021 is still accused of having tried to “harm the elections to the Chief Executive in 2024” and to incite actions from foreign countries against Macau, which was understood as “seriously calling for national security”.
Establishment of connections
The PJ statement points out that the case was referred to the prosecutor, after "a long investigation" and that Au Kam San is indicted for the crime of "establishment of links with organizations, associations or individuals went from the mashed for the practice of state security."
This type of crime is punished with a minimum penalty of three years in prison, but it can reach 10 years in prison. The prosecution does not allow parole, so AU will have to wait for the trial in prison. There is also no possibility of serving suspended sentence.
Contrary to the accusation for other crimes provided for in the National Security safeguard law, the trials for the crime of “establishment of links with organizations, associations or individuals were from MSAR for the practice of state security” are public, so the open door should be performed. However, the judge of the process may choose to close the door in certain sessions, if it consider that advertising will impair state security.</description><pubDate>2025-08-01 00:25:35</pubDate></item><item><title>TDM | Inês Chan is the best paid administrator</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/31/tdm-ines-chan-e-a-administradora-mais-bem-paga/</link><description>Transferred directly from the Social Communication Office to the position of Administrator at TDM-Macao-Telelding, Inês Chan will have the highest salary among managers, just behind the company's vice president, Lo Song Man.

The numbers were revealed yesterday during a press office of the China State Council's Information Office and concerns the period of the 14th Five -year -old plan, which began in 2021 and ends this year.
Chinese citizens' migration management director Xiong Shuren praised the measure and considered that it benefits the exchange between the interior, Hong Kong and Macau. The official recalled that 59 cities in the interior of China emit individual visas to travel to Hong Kong and Macau. "As for the travel visas of Hengqin and Macau, more than 56,000 residents enjoyed this convenience," he said.
About the services intended for residents of Hong Kong and Macao to travel to China, Xiong Shuren pointed out that during the 14th plan, 394,000 residents renewed the safe conduct that allows residents of Hong Kong and Macau to enter and get out of the inside.
Alternative solutions
Xiong Shuren recalled that during the pandemic, several RAE residents could not request the renewal. As such, he indicated that the authorities “promptly launched a policy to extend the shelf life. Extending the shelf life of the safe conduct covered 4.4 million residents of Hong Kong and Macau.
Xiong Shuren also revealed that since July 2024 the Salvo-Conduct emission policy has been launched for RAE residents with foreign nationality to realize what they said were “great advances” in the management of roads and exits from the interior, according to the “one country, two system” principle of the New Age.

There they are, the fireworks. The fireworks of innovation, demagogy, sloppiness, incompetence, altruism, corruption, criminal incendays, self -interested loggers and absurd legislation. Arouca, Barca Bridge, Gondomar, Nisa, Santarém, Penafiel, Paiva Castle, Cinfães and dozens of villages are the stage for uncontrolled flames, the despair of populations, burning houses, exhausted heroic firefighters, falling aircraft, trying to erase more than 10 meters with some buckets or buckets or buckets or buckets or buckets or buckets or buckets or buckets or buckets or buckets or buckets some blades. There are 131 municipalities at maximum risk. The burning area is already triple 2024. About 30 suspects of fire is already arrested for the excellent work of the Judicial Police. Most of the time paid by loggers who are interested in burnt wood to quickly sell and get income from these crimes. One night one saw a car pass by a forest, after five minutes a huge fire began that still draws in the Ponte da Barca area. Fireworks are initiated by criminal incendays, which most of the time the courts send them free.
We kept contact with a prestigious geologist who told us that there is absurd legislation regarding the cleaning of land around the houses. Legislation that requires cleaning a surrounding area of houses with 50 meters. The geologist explained that 30 meters would be enough and that the 50 meter cleaning obligation is very expensive for people who live from the little they have. Result: Few people clean the land and the fuel there is waiting for the incendays. The same geologist pointed out that the land in Portugal contains an amount of biomass that will lead to fires for at least another decade. The government appeared with a new internal administration minister who may know how to sew socks, but fires is a right zero. He has not even addressed the huge problem of continuing to postpone the purchase of new helicopters that are so lacking.
This year, like other years, we have had injured firefighters, evacuated villages, elderly, women and children sleeping on the ground in multipurpose pavilions, falling aircraft and several burnt houses. By the way of houses, a striking criticism for emigrants who build three -story villas, spending hundreds of thousands of euros in the middle of the forest and then want firefighters everywhere where flames endangers these villas. The situation is tragic for thousands of Portuguese, but every year is the same thing: they allow eucalyptus and pine to plant everywhere, when there should be a global planning with land appropriate to the ordered plantation of pines, oaks, eucalyptus, cork oaks and other trees. The lack of said geological and demographic planning leads to the misfortune we assist. Last Saturday, the day I wrote these words, already more than 20 residents had gone to the hospital and 10 firefighters received hospital treatment. For over a decade we have heard that something has to do anything. Obviously there are solutions, but most projects are in government drawers. And as no one tells him, we emphasize the risky and professional action of reporters who have risked day and night life at a temperature that has been around 45 degrees, running away from the flames, sleeping and eating poorly. I leave you blunt images of this drama that Portugal is living with another global fire scenario.</description><pubDate>2025-08-04 08:00:35</pubDate></item><item><title>The American Pope (I)</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/04/o-papa-americano-i/</link><description>“The Bishop is not supposed to be a little Prince sitting in His Kingdom, but rather called authentilly to be humble, to be close to the people he serves.”
Pope Leo XIV
Leo XIV embodies the double crisis of America and the Catholic Church. Contemporary version of the ancient tension between the empire and the papacy. Subjects incomparable by nature that, by constitution, exclude each other. Born to redeem the world according to its principles. With the weapon of power in all its dimensions expressed today on Earth, the other time before in other planets, America. With the intention of converting humanity to the presence of the kingdom of God incarnate into Christ, the church of Rome, mediator between heaven and earth. Impossible but indispensable missions. The identity itself is at stake. Life. Each, in its plan, lives and suffers from the original chrism of the West, to which both refer differently; the universalism. Part that dreams all over.
Dream that turns into a nightmare for the United States, which fear dying globalized for daring Americanizing the world. On the contrary, the church that, with Francis, outlined the exit to the peripheries find out that sheep is not much attracted to the pastor, often escape from him. Especially in its nucleus of origin, European and western. What if the church disappeared from itself? It is up to the new Pope, we will see whether more hybrid or American, to establish in Synodal Council the trajectory of God's people. It is up to your homeland to discern if and how to take advantage of your treadmill to heal. The current climate informs us that Washington and Rome will not follow parallel, much less solidary paths to heal the disease that seems to assimilate them. The temporal institution endowed with a civil religion, the American way of life, opts with Trump for a geopolitical diet of weight loss of nothing of great and compromising adventures in the vast world, fortification of the American stronghold in Arctic expansion.
Faithful to western tradition disfigured by enlightenment, positivists and communists. The other, of heavenly inspiration and varied inculturation in the mission territories marked by dioceses, late-royal inheritance, has no bark in which he retract without disfiguring. The opening to the ecumine is your raison d'être. To be modulated according to an always updated ecclesiastical geopolitics. Never submitting to the “number one” of the moment. If Trump, enthusiastic about the Vatican's American socket with the advent of Leo XIV, has a post-franciscan Catholicism willing to offer a soul supplement to his rude and unpredictable magisterium, he is wrong. How to delude the Holy Church's High Clergy when he trusts he had awarded a winning ticket when choosing an American successor to Peter. The papal Foundation offer and other promised sponsors across the Atlantic "have conditions", have rigorous restrictions, as they inform "donors" in balance between God and Castor.
Of course, before they ended in the Sistine Chapel, the cardinals spent a lot of time discerning the financial consequences of the inspiration that the Holy Spirit would have granted them, which, paraphrasing ecclesiastical jargon, is a revelation. Vacant headquarters is not time for theological, but cardinal virtues. As he observed in 1997, with Curial irony, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger whom he asked him if the Pope was elected by divine scrutiny said. I would say that the Holy Spirit does not assume exactly the control of the question, but as a good educator who is, leaves us a lot of space and freedom, without completely abandoning us. Thus, the role of the Holy Spirit must be understood in a much more elastic sense, not that the candidate should vote for. Probably the only certainty it offers is that the fact cannot be fully ruined. There are many examples of popes that, of course, the Holy Spirit would not have chosen. We do not know if chance, necessity or providence imposed Robert Francis Prevost on Pedro's throne precisely in the crossroads between the two (their) crises.
It is certainly a sign of the times. Commonly represented in the artificial selfie released by the White House, with which, on the eve of the conclave, the pseudo-rump disguised as Pope invaded the media sphere. Almost as to sanctify communion between the fourth and first Rome, in hierarchical order. It was only missing that the Cesarean pontiff was divided into two to give the actual anointing. Irony of the tale, for in photomontage, Pope Trump dresses totally in white, like Francis. Perhaps also for this reason, by sporting Urbi et Orbi, Leone enriched the white cassock with the classic symbols of the pontificate. But a grain of real exposes this blasphemous image. There is a lot of ecclesiastical in the self -awareness of America. Similarly, there is a lot of imperial in the history of the church.
The United States is born and grows up as a self -centered religion in peculiar Christian declines. Regardless of the sect or confession to which they belong, Americans live starring and striped versions. Catholics included. American Catholicisms, quite worldly, more conscious and conflicting than ever, occupy distinct spaces in the heron of the pastor of Rome. With and against predominant, established or neo-evangelical Protestant branches, profess the American creed. Religion celebrated in its golden age by the self-adhesive nation's apex of humanity. Lighthouse of freedom, therefore, universal. Autochphal and at the same time Catholic in the etymological and therefore ecumenical sense of the word. As a consequence of so many formidable contradictions, the identity crisis of worldly superpower is both its own and worldwide.
The Holy See, the great repository of culture and faith, a geopolitical expression of the Church of Rome and its supreme government of government in the state of the Vatican City, in the middle of urb, born, lives and confronts the imperium sine fine in all its ramifications. The Roman tombs of Peter and Paul, the first drivers of evangelization, confirm the principal potentium, the consistent authority of the world caput in relation to the venerable original patriarchals of Antioch, Alexandria, Ephesus, Corinthian and Thessalonica. The religion of the apostles germinates under Tiberius in Palestine, expands in pars Occidentalis of the first Rome, delimited by the unstable bipartition stipulated in Brindisi between António and Otávio forty years before Christ, sanction of permanent heterogeneity between the East and West. Then Baptizes with Constantine the second Rome, ideal-type of the fully Christian foundation metropolis. There is a millennium that disputes with the orthodoxy of the third Rome, the heart of the Moscovite Empire that is shown Christian, in the utopia of being recognized as the third lung of the West, with Europe and America.
And eighty years ago she has lived with the earthly primacy of fourth Rome, elected by pure Anglo-Involvesse pilgrim parents and erected by former British colonists in love with Hellenistic-Roman tradition, in order to correspond in code through Latin pseudonyms. Ecclesia permixa described by St. Augustine, a reference of Pope Prevost's election, where wheat and chaff, fertility and sterility, love and envy are mixed. The liquid schisms that erode it tend to coagulate. The priority of the pontificate is the sewing of the ruptures that tear the body of the church. Without denying Francis, closing some of the breaches he opened by him, distinguishing those that deserve to be filled from the dangerous or poor, disposable. Waiting for the posthumous to reread their papacy, capturing some prophetic traits too inconsistent with reality, not only ecclesial, so that it can act.
Today the warning of Benedict, the master of Augustinianism, is about the need to protect the extra mission from excessive optimism over faith as an "obvious presupposition of ordinary life" by stating that "we cannot accept that salt becomes disqualified and that light be kept hidden." Even if this means that the Church wants to isolate it for free in the dull world? The Catholic clergy is divided into three. Those who privilege mission, those who privilege the institution and those who sail between the two currents. The touch stone remains the Second Vatican Council. For the former, missionary opening must be developed to the people of God, that is, the Church itself, along with the ecumenical impulse. For the latter, the defense of tradition against submission to the signs of times prevails, which can induce heresy. To go out ad people, therefore, to contaminate to evangelize, or to curb in the name of the "pure" faith?
In history, Pope's charisma leans Peter's boat to one side or the other. Today much more than yesterday, with the Superstar Pontiff, while his people seem to contract, in crisis of internal charity and external attraction. In the vulgate, Francisco is considered an irregular champion of the Church on the way out, for history, doctrine and character. Pastor par excellence. Or excessive for critics. Benedict XVI, his predecessor traumatized by the weight of the petrine, is the eponym of the defender fidei. Insightful theologian. HERR RARE TEACHER OF THE SEMINAR. Claustrophobic. Questionable but powerful simplifications. Leo XIV neither. At least in the intentions of many of its voters. They convert to him from the opposite margins, aware of the latent or active cisions that are fragmenting the ecclesiastical archipelago on self-centered islands and islets. Different Catholics. Certainly not Romans. The biography and some words of the American Pope extol his pastoral vocation, the proximity to the humble. Pontifical gestures and other words mark the recovery of traditional symbols and liturgies. With a political metaphor that would once have placed us in the index of forbidden books, we could see in Prevost a reborn Christian Democrat, anchored in the center, look to the left while being careful not to have many enemies on the right. Or vice versa. «Pedro, Adelante Con Júicio» Expression of the soap opera “The Grooms” used to ask someone to proceed with precaution and discernment in a difficult or complicated situation.
Leo XIV must govern the Church on a mission. Fix the course, keep the rudder right, revitalize the Curia and reconnect it to the often indifferent ecclesial peripheries, if not adverse, to Peter's chair. To keep the world on the edge of the abyss of endless wars. The principles of the Church trusted this quiet monarch and determined the task of healing the wounds that bleed the flock of Christ. So that the end of Catholicism does not anticipate the end of the world. Maybe it's late, maybe not. It is certainly a task that Leo XIV may start, but not consolidate. The disease has long been widespread to give miraculous therapies. It has passed almost half a century since the disappearance of the last (not only) (not only) pontiff to the government of the church that was Paul VI (1963-1978). The four successors did not want or could not dedicate themselves to Peter's machine. John Paul I (1978) for lack of time and firmness, John Paul II (1978-2005) for excess of personality, Bento XVI (2005-2013, died in 2022) for moving inability, Francisco (2013-2025) because he wanted to "make noise" («Hagan Lio!") To save his flock from death by clerical suffocation.
Conservative and/or revolutionary popes, inadequate and/or reluctant to reform in continuity. Catholic tissue decomposition and excitement of its ruling class are such that exclude a Vatican III. Unless you aspire to a liberating implosion, to start over from autocephalic, national or subnational micropatriarchies of neo-orthodox. More easily from emotive spiritualist sects of neo-evangelical nature, faithful to castor. To understand Papa Prevost's challenge, you should go from here. The meaning of the church is at stake. Both spiritual and ground. There has never been or there may be a separated Christianity from the reality of the world. The Holy Roman Church was and continues to be, although wounded, a formidable geopolitical subject who designed universal history.
Two thousand years ago, Catholics and other Christians have envisioned in it various signs and colors. They remove different lessons from it. Doctrinal, pastoral and geopolitical. For many, confirmation of faith in Christ. For less, but influential, announcement of the imminent apocalypse. To scholars of geopolitics, there is an obligation to study the vision and action of the Holy See in the scenario of history, crossing the human factor in its own and figurative sense and religious specificity. We chose as a magna card of the Christian way of being in the world the mysterious “letter to diogneto”, anonymous Greek manuscript of the third century-III found in 1436 in Constantinople by a Latin cleric.</description><pubDate>2025-08-04 07:59:20</pubDate></item><item><title>Yes, China contributed decisively to the 1945 victory</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/01/sim-a-china-contribuiu-de-forma-decisiva-para-a-vitoria-de-1945/</link><description>By Bruno Guigue
On September 3, 2025, the Popular Republic of China will celebrate the 80th anniversary of the Chinese people's War of Resistance War against Japanese aggression. Victory won in the harsh conditions against an adversary endowed with enormous superiority in weaponry, and in the most prolonged combat in the entire World War II: from the beginning of Japanese aggression in July 1937 to the final months of 1945. Western “official” historiography, always committed to rewriting the history of this war - whose main victories do not belong to it - is particularly omitted in relation to these 8 years of heroic resistance. But the Chinese people and all the progressive memory of the world celebrate it.
It is a fact: for decades that Western doctrine has launched a smoke curtain about the reality of a conflict whose effective unfolding has little in common with the reported account in 'democracies'.
If it is true that the historical narrative is often tax of the prejudices of those who make it, the way in which World War II is reported does not escape the rule. Western historiography is indeed characterized by a contestable chronology of events, a very partial counting of the victims and a partial assessment of the contribution of combating nations to the final victory over the axis powers. Of course, this observation applies to the dominant current of historical investigation and not the efforts of the researchers, less numerous, which revealed their gaps precisely. But it is a fact: Westernx has launched, for decades, a curtain of smoke about the reality of a conflict whose effective unfolding has little in common with the report believed in 'democracies'.
World War II started in China
Beginning, as can be imagined, with this monumental error that consists of dating the beginning of the second world conflict in September 1939, when he has plagued the heart of China since July 1937 and, if we pay attention to the latest works of Chinese and Japanese historiography, since September 1931 in the provinces of northeastern China. On this date, a massive invasion of Chinese territory began by Japanese forces, which caused an almost uninterrupted confrontation between the two countries until 1945. And although Chiang Kai-Shek's government negotiated in 1932, fighting never really ceased for fourteen years (1931-1945) between the Japanese occupation troops and the Chinese forces, they were the armies. governmental or communist resistance.
To this argument, it could be answered that the current narrative in the West focuses mainly on the events that affected it, which is, at most, an understandable perspective error, and not a deliberate concealment of the role of other regions of the world in this planetary confrontation. Why not? But in this case, what legitimacy does it have such a historical narrative when it intends to account for the "World War II"? Or the narrative aims to report the course of events in the West, and its focus on this geographical area is legitimate. Or intends to tell the story of a true world war, and this focus is no longer.
The historical fact, said Paul Veyne, does not exist as such, "it is a crossing of itineraries." He was not wrong, but still one must avoid going the wrong way in choosing itineraries and, in this case, taking the West like the whole world. In this regard, the Russian-Soviet account of the conflict has the merit of coherence, since it makes logically coincide the facts mentioned and its denomination: following a valid chronology for the USSR, the "Great Patriotic War" of 1941-1945 designates well the historical experience lived by the Soviet people and does not intend to provide an exhaustive explanation of planetary events during the period.
The oblivion of Chinese victims
If the first distortion of the dominant discourse concerns the dating of its true beginning, the second, of course, concerns the human balance of world conflict. Since the end of the war, Western works are rare that indicate with a minimum of historical accuracy the human losses suffered by China. The profusion of details about the European balance usually contrasts with its minimization and inaccuracy when it comes to Asia. Worse yet, some institutions do not even mention the existence of Chinese victims. On the French website of the very official "Mémorial de L'Armistice", we know, for example, that "the USSR had 21 400,000 killed, Germany 7 060 000, Poland 5 820 000, Japan 2 000 000 and France 541 000. Regarding the total balance, it is between 50 and 60 million dead, ie 22 million military and 31 million civilians."
If Japan is not forgotten, China does not even figure on the list of belligerent countries, despite the enormity of warfare caused by war! As scandalous as it may be, such concealment contaminates the teaching of history in our schools: rarely mentioned, the unfolding of combat in China is relegated to the margins of military history for the benefit of the European theater of operations and the 'Pacific War'. This last expression was imposed by Washington to reduce war in this part of the world to a duel between two aircraft powers by controlling the Pacific Islands, conveniently ignoring the theater of Chinese operations and its vast terrestrial clashes.
The factors of a concealment
Affected by historical myopia, the dominant western narrative usually omits that China has immobilized in its soil most Japanese land forces for fourteen years, that its resistance prevented Tokyo from launching a dangerous flank attack on the USSR, which US forces faced from 1941 to 1945 only a small part of the Japanese land troops, which 70% of Empire's military losses. Japanese were inflicted on the Chinese front that 100 million Chinese were displaced and that 20 million of them lost their lives because of the devastating war waged by the invader: all facts ignored by a western narrative that can be said to take freedoms with historical truth.
Being these facts now clearly established and known to a vast public, at least outside Western circles, the question of knowing why its concealment has resisted so well the progress of the objective knowledge of events: in other words, what are the factors, political or ideological, that explain persistent minimization to today, the role of China during World War II?
The first answer to this question is obvious: influenced by a western -centric view of the conflict, the dominant historiography spontaneously relegates Eastern Asia to the Statute of Secondary Operations Theater. The geographical distance, however, is not the only cause. The minimization of the role of certain populations in the dominant narrative is also inspired by the colonial prejudice that denies them any autonomous ability. Unable to make their own history, how would these passive peoples have contributed to victory over the axis powers? There is more. At the beginning of the conflict, and for the same reason, China was often devalued in relation to Japan, as if the western world unconsciously mourned to have struggled with each other.
“This aroused Japan, burning, warrior, winner, we were western who we created him. Under the impulse of genius emperor Mutsuhito, he throws himself into the industrial age. Arsenal, workshops, factories, he creates everything at the same time. And when, finally, it has this strength, you realize that you are obliged to use it: because, once again thanks to Europe, which brought it its science of medicine and hygiene, the Japanese children no longer die: from 1870 to 1930, the population tripled and is literally stifling in their islands. If you don't want to perish, you have to get out of them.
An essentialist line with colonial features
This is how it expresses itself in August 1937, the prestigious Revue des Deux Mondes. Japanese expansionism appears here as a turbulent shoot for Western modernity, whose ambitions are legitimized by technological advancement and demographic dynamism. The tone is admiring, and no moral or legal consideration stains acquittal for assimilation that Tokyo benefits. For European experts imbued with racialism and eugenism, it is true that the hierarchy of races places the Japanese above the Chinese, and the Japanese territorial ambitions seem dictated by an obscure natural law that would preside over to the fate of nations.
We also observe, in the same essentialist line, that circulated in the Western intellectual circles of the 1930s the commonplace that the Chinese language ignored the word "homeland", while the Japanese language was unaware of the word "peace." If the Japanese want to subdue China, it is due to a kind of biological, medium cultural predestination: the former would be warriors destined to dominate their neighbors, while the Chinese would form a amorphous mass waiting for a gentleman that the western pretended made the mistake of believing that it would necessarily be white man.
Modernized at all costs, rivalry with Europeans in the field of expansionism, pre-war Japan thus awakens ambivalent feelings in the western ones. Oriental replica of European supremacy, its supposed brutality enjoys attenuating circumstances. Too active to be peaceful, too advanced to remain from arms crossed, his spirit of conquest receives the acquittal of realists, who forgive his aggressiveness against China as much easily, as he is considered decaying and chaotic. Is the Chinese language ignoring the word "homeland" is not proof of its intrinsic inferiority? And if she is weak, isn't it as much cowardly and impotence?
The antitotalitarian doxa
If the weight of these imaginary representations contributes to the frequent concealment of China's positive role, it also originates from the anti -communist reflex that, since the beginning of the Cold War in 1947, retrospectively contaminates the western account of World War II. The myth of the "totalitarian twins", invented by Leon Trotsky in 1939, was quickly erected by Doxa as an article of faith that, from 1950, benefited from Hannah Arendt's philosophical approval. Exiled in the United States, the fervent disciple of Nazi Heidegger made him the explanatory model of all the history of the twentieth century, which would be characterized by the relentless struggle between the 'totalitarian regimes' and 'liberal democracies'.
It is this narrative that appears today, in France, in the History Manuals. The minimization of the Soviéto-Chinese contribution to the defeat of Nazism is the logical consequence of this, with television programs experts even suggest that US troops released the extermination camps, while industrial companies on the other side of the Atlantic benefited cynically from their captive labor. As for China, she moved to the evil forces side when she became a communist in 1949, and her role in the anti -fascist fight was quickly forgotten in the West. It took no more than that to reinforce the more twisted anti -communism and, consequently, to credibilize the vulgate of the "just war" waged by "democracies".
The first fascist aggression
However, it was China that suffered the first fascist aggression of the twentieth century. Prior to the invasion of Ethiopia by Mussolini Italy (1935) and the Italian-Aleman intervention to support Franco in Spain (1936), Japan invaded China's three Eastern Provinces in September 1931, taking advantage of Moukden's' incident). And if this aggression can be qualified as "fascist", it is due to the openly racist and warmth of Japanese politics, even before the signing of the very fascist "Anti-Komtern Pact" of 1936 between Berlin, Rome and Tokyo.
For those who are perplexed with this qualification, let us remember that Japan from the late 1930s gathered the main characteristics of a fascism analogous to that of its European counterparts: a mystique of the superior race, an absolute devotion to the emperor as a divine incarnation of the nation, an integral militarization of society, and an irresistible compulsive compulsion by territorial expansion, being the war of sacred conquest to the point of justifying the woers in advance of the worst. brutalities against dehumanized civil populations.
In addition to China's submission, the expansionist ambitions of the Japanese Empire included the domain of all Asia and the Pacific. But it was the Chinese people the first in the world to resist fascist barbarism. With the invasion of Japanese forces throughout the Chinese territory, from 1937, the Chinese resistance gave rise to the first battlefield of World War II. And from July 1937 to the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, for four years, China could only count on herself to face the invader.
An even more difficult struggle, because Japan, industrial power, could make heavy weaponry, of which Chinese troops usually needed: aircraft carrier, war ships, aircraft, tanks, artillery. The Japanese higher officers who invaded China arrogance that at most, would be sufficient to resolve the "Chinese incident", and tried to conquer China mobilizing colossal means: 600,000 men in 1937, increasing to more than one million in 1939, with most of the Japanese military budget being dedicated to the occupation of the continent with incessant with the troops with the troops with the troops. Chinese.
Front battles and guerrillas
Despite their efforts, Japan failed to overcome the resistance of the Chinese people. He gathered his strength to form a barrier against the invader, whether in the front battles of Taiyuan, Songhu, Xuzhou, Nanjing, Wuhan, led by Guomindang, or in the Chinese Communist Party behind enemy lines, such as the 'Battle of Pingxingguan', the 'offensive of the hundred regiments', or the United Army combats. Antijapanese of the Northeast in the heart of Manchuria, not to mention the numerous actions of the communist guerrilla to establish anti-japanese bases and open loopholes in rectangue.
Requiring the formation of a "united front" with the nationalists, the Communist Party made the struggle for national liberation an absolute priority. To fulfill this historical task, Mao understood that it was necessary to "take advantage of the revolutionary character of the resistance war to transform it into a war of the people." Because the war of movement is about to be won by Japan, he explained, and during this first phase, it is the nationalist army that plays the lead role. But when we move to the second phase, on the other hand, it will be the guerrilla war that will take over the command.
By attacking the enemy's flanks, Mao taught, the Red Army would exhaust the enemy. It would take advantage of the stretching of your lines of communication to harass you. He would give him the blow to mercy when the moment came, throwing all his strength into the battle. This anti-japanese guerrilla would be decisive for the outcome of the conflict. Because China is "a large weak country attacked by a small powerful country", and the guerrilla war will have a function not only tactic but strategic: the invader "will eventually be swallowed by the huge Chinese sea" (1).
The decisive role of Chinese resistance
"Japan thought that the conquest of China would solve its economic problems, providing it from raw materials and promising markets," says historian Olivier Wiework. «He also hoped that his crusade would eradicate the influence and way of thinking western in the country of Confucius. Disappointed. In northern China, the Maoist guerrilla prevented him from exploring rural areas, attacked trains and sabotaged trucks. (..) Thus, dreamed Eldorado became a nightmare. An expensive nightmare. On the eve of Pearl Harbor, the Empire had lost more than 180,000 dead and 323,000 wounded on the adventure. These bitter findings then led the Japanese leaders to turn their eyes to the south »(2).
Contributing to seal the fate of world conflict, the stubborn resistance of the Chinese people had two important consequences.
Firstly, he contributed to thwarting the Japanese aggression plan against the USSR, mobilizing most of the Japanese forces on the Chinese front, which allowed Staline to concentrate his troops to Moscow Defense in December 1941. Already shaken by the defeat against Zhukov in Mongolia in December 1939, the Japanese staff began to privilege the offensive to the South (O South (O South ( Southeast Asia and the European Colonies) to the detriment of the anti -dispatches in the north. And in August 1945, it was the Soviet Army, passing to the offensive, which gave the final blow to the Japanese troops parked in northern China.
Secondly, Chinese resistance had to influence US policy, reinforcing Roosevelt's conviction that war could be overcome thanks to China's 'magnificent defensive struggle, which I have reasons to believe it, will gain strength' (May 27, 1941). Therefore, he sent General Stilwell to hold the position of Chief of Staff with Chiang Kai-Chek. The US help allowed to take advantage of China's huge territory to keep Japan in check and immobilize its land forces, which would be cruelly lacking the Japanese state before US forces on the Pacific Islands.
In February 1942, the US President praised Chinese resistance in a telegram sent to Chiang Kai-Chek: “His heroic resistance to the cruel aggressor was worth the Chinese army the most worthy compliments of the American people and all other people-love people. The armed and unarmed Chinese people, who for almost five years it offers a fierce resistance to a much better enemy equipped, as well as the indomitable spirit that demonstrates in the face of such a contrast, are a source of inspiration for all combatants and peoples of the other united nations in resistance »(3).
National pride and unity guarantee
The Chinese contribution to the anti-fascist struggle also explains China's signature alongside the United States, Britain and the Soviet Union when these nations published the United Nations Declaration in the White House on January 1, 1942. Joining 22 countries the next day, this commitment marked the official establishment of a worldwide alliance against fascism and the creation of a diplomatic structure called “four large”, sealing this major coalition Fascist powers defended tirelessly since 1937 by the Chinese government. And it was this decisive contribution from China to the ordinary struggle that also caused the abolition of unequal treaties inherited from the previous century.
This is why Xi Jinping stated on the 70th anniversary of the 1945 victory: “The victory of the Chinese people's resistance to Japanese aggression was a triumph for the whole Chinese nation. Not only frustrated the attempt of Japanese militarism to colonize and enslave China, but also abolished the unequal treaties signed with the imperialist powers since modern times, allowing China to wash a century National Humiliation (..) Victory launched solid foundations for China's independence and liberation, established a historical turning point for the great rebirth of the Chinese nation and provided the essential previous condition for its realization.
On September 3, 2025, the Chinese will celebrate the 80th anniversary of this victory won with a lot of effort, organizing an impressive military parade in the heart of the capital, Beijing. For them, this victory is, in fact, a legitimate source of national pride and an irreplaceable guarantee of national unity. China acknowledges that Chinese nationalists and communists played an important role in the struggle for liberation against the Japanese invader, whether it is the armies of the Nanjing government, after chongqiing, or the guerrilla forces that successfully fought Japanese troops. Celebrated by all the Chinese people, this unity in the victorious struggle against the invader has an exemplary value and is a serious antidote against all the yeasts of division.

In the elections for the 8th Legislative Assembly of 2025, the number of candidacy lists for the election by direct suffrage went from nine to six after analyzed by the Commission of Electoral Affairs of the Legislative Assembly (Caeal). This is the fewer candidacy lists ever to election by direct suffrage since the return of Macau to Chinese sovereignty.
However, after verifying the capacity of the candidates by the State Security Defense Commission, some belonging to two of the eight candidacy lists were excluded by "not defending the basic law or not being faithful to the Forere of the Popular Republic of China." There was no opportunity to replace them, so a new record of fewer candidacy lists ever was established to the election for direct suffrage.
In the elections for the Legislative Assembly in 2021, Caeal added seven criteria to determine whether candidates defend the Basic Law and are loyal to the Mand of the Popular Republic of China. These new criteria have led to the disqualification of five application lists. At that time, the disqualified lists filed a complaint and filed an appeal and the candidates in question were informed of the reasons for their disqualification.
According to the review of the “Electoral Law to the Legislative Assembly of the Special Administrative Region of Macao”, which entered into force in 2024, it is incumbent upon the MSar State Security Defense Commission to determine whether candidates defend the Basic Law and are faithful to the Fasome of the Popular Republic of China, as well as issuing binding opinion for CAEAL on the verification of distress.
In addition, they could no longer file a complaint and appeal the decision of Caeal. Therefore, candidates who are disqualified to run for elections to the Legislative Assembly in 2025 cannot submit a complaint or appeal of Caeal's decision and may never know the reasons for their disqualification. Some of these candidates have reported their opinion on the decision of the State Security Defense Commission to various media.
They consider that the accusation of "not defending the basic law or not being faithful to the Mand of the Popular Republic of China" is absurd and consider it an "anecdote". However, they are aware that these are the rules of the game so they would not intend to appeal the decision, even if there was a mechanism that allowed it.
Besides, a candidate who was disqualified this year but ran for elections for
Legislative Assembly in 2021 and 2017, he stressed that his performance was always fair and transparent and that everything made him made him by Macao. He claimed to be in a quiet conscience and said "" When you want to accuse someone, you can always find any pretext. "
Another disqualified candidate stated that he was dissuaded to run for elections. In response to these statements Caeal expressed its indignation and the right to move a criminal action. Many are eager to see if Caeal will always move the legal action against the above instigator to see if the truth will be determined.
The review of the “Electoral Law to the Legislative Assembly of the Special Administrative Region of Macao” does not require the publication of the opinion on the verification of uncomfortable candidates. However, disqualified candidates should have the right to request Caeal's opinion under the principle of secrecy of justice, to know the reasons for disqualification. Otherwise, it will be like being fined without knowing the reason, but having to pay the fine to respect the law.
Considering the “Electoral Law for the Legislative Assembly of the Special Administrative Region of Macao”, even if a potential candidate signs the commitment to defend the basic law and to be loyal to the MSAR, if it does not obtain the approval of the Safety Defense Commission of the State of MSAR, even if it has been allowed to compete in previous elections, it is not guaranteed to be able to compete for the following elections.
To avoid the occurrence of another misfortune in the Legislative Assembly elections in 2029, which could tarnish the credibility of the Government of MSAR, should the revision of the “Electoral Law to the Legislative Assembly of the Special Administrative Region of Macao”? For example, ask the potential candidate to present the Criminal Registration Certificate to be evaluated by the MSar State Security Defense Commission after the security deposit has been paid.
The candidate could only make the constitution of the candidacy committee after the approval of the State Security Defense Commission, which requires the support of more than 300 voters and their signatures.
If the candidate is removed from the racing to the polls after being evaluated by Caeal, the deposit deposit is not reimbursed. This approach would save the effort and resources necessary for the constitution of the candidacy committee and, above all, avoid the situation where 300 or more voters can be labeled as non -defenders of the basic law and unfair to MSAR, when the list of candidacy in question is disqualified.
Avoiding misfortunes is the responsibility of all. National security is fundamental, but citizens' rights and obligations should not be neglected.</description><pubDate>2025-08-01 01:09:19</pubDate></item><item><title>Joaquim Surumali helps preserve Timorense cultural heritage</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/04/joaquim-surumali-ajuda-a-preservar-patrimonio-cultural-timorense/</link><description>It is in his workshop in Tasi Tolu, Dili, that Joaquim Surumali preserves the cultural heritage of Timor-Leste by replicating in jewelry, for daily use, pieces used in sacred houses and in traditional ceremonies and dances.
In his hands, Kaebauk, an ornament with buffalo horns, which represents the sun, strength, safety, protection and power, traditionally used in the head and on the roofs of sacred houses, gains the shape of earrings and pending to be used in a necklace.
Already the “Belak”, a bronze disc that symbolizes the moon and is used to the chest and inside the sacred houses, can also be bought in earrings.
In Joaquim Sumali's workshop, neither does necklaces, called “Morten”, are normally listed with the orange color, which bring luck and prosperity and push the evil spirits and negative energies.
“I want to do this job. My father also worked with jewelry, shaped Belak and Kaebauk since the time of the Portuguese, and so far my brothers and sisters sometimes still make jewelry like Kaebauk and Belak in Dili,” Lusa Joaquim Surumali told.
The 34 -year -old jeweler stressed that his art is a family tradition, which continues to this day. “I learned to make jewelry with my father and my brothers. But our work comes from our own blood, from our father and the elders who also made jewelry like the ones that are done today,” explained Joaquim Surumali.
Other materials
Joaquim Surumali makes the jewelry in gold, silver or bronze, depending on the preference and money of customers. The material, according to the jeweler, is bought in Timor-Leste, but most come from Indonesia or Singapore, because resources in the country are scarce.
"As people buy in gold to put in holy houses, it is no longer available. So we try to buy abroad. Most of the time, customers are the ones who bring gold and we only charge for our labor," said the jeweler.
Asked about jewelry prices, the craftsman explained that a pure gold "Belak" can cost $ 600 and a $ 100 "death". "Many Timorese buy these jewelry, but also many Portuguese, especially teachers," he said.
Joaquim explained that the Portuguese appreciate these pieces because they see in them something unique and traditional of Timor-Leste. The Timorenses buy them to put them in the sacred houses of families and can be seen in all municipalities of the country. The most bought articles are, above all, the “Belak” of gold.

The Cultural Institute (IC) announced, on Friday, the program of the 23rd edition of the Fringe Festival, scheduled for September 5-28 and with the theme “Urban Ride”. In total, 18 shows and 13 activities will be held in the territory, promising “stages full of creativity”, in which “art spreads according to the paths of each one” reads in the IC press release.
One of the highlights is the “Crème de La Fringe” section, where two events are integrated: “Tomato - Interactive Digital Theater Show”, presented between September 10 and 21; and "Clowns for the" Complicité "festival".
As for “tomato”, it is an Erik Kuong curated event featuring four distinct programs: “The Monster-an immersive and personal adventure theater”; “Diaries to Deriva - Urban Tour Theater”; “Vellada Brightness: Exposure of Installation of Urban Micro Sensações” and “Adventure Book-A Hidden Window in Macao-version with musical accompaniment”.
The aim is that, through a mobile phone application, the “Chito” platform, the public can follow the stories behind these programs, which take place in old Macao areas as is the case of the parishes of Santo António, Sé or São Lourenço. This is an initiative “where digital and physical worlds converge”, highlights the curator, and that allows “the public to follow history and explore hidden corners of the city through an application”, which is a “pioneering theatrical experience that connects communities through digital stories narration”.
Then, inside the “Crème de la fringe” also presents the “clowns for the festival‘ Complicité ’”, which is curated by Chan Lai Nei and includes three events: “Kung Food: Vegetarian Martial Art”, “The Menu of Today” and “You or Me?”, All of them held at the Carmo Fair and with free participation.
With the creation of the theater company, this Fringe series brings “artistic groups from Europe and Asia”, presenting “three culturally diverse and interactive shows and two extension activities”, with the promise of an “conspiracy of joy” and an “accidental hilarity that triggers a reaction in a jail of laughter”.
Chan Lai Nei says his view of the clowns world "changed completely" after a period of study in France. Thus, the “clowns for the‘ Complicité ’festival wants to offer an unexpected theatrical experience, with moments that resonate in your heart,” reads the synopsis of the show.
Comedies and other stories
In addition to the “Crème de La Fringe” there are also other initiatives, namely the performance of the Japanese group Co.Scoopp that presents the show “To Survive in Cities!”, A “comedy full of emotions that combines elements of air acrobatics, interaction and juggling”.
Also noteworthy is for programs such as “oscillating deck”, presented by Ieong Pui San and Zhang Hui, where “augmented reality is adjusted to the real world, allowing participants to experiment with the inner port [otherwise] where memories merge with dream visions”.
Suzuki Cheng presents "thanks for being here", addressing the theme of motherhood in a "temporal and spatial dialogue through an immersive theater." Already the art studio PO presents "Dreaming Machine, Useless Class", where "participants become judges and experience various types of self-service machines in the shopping center."
The company Own Theater brings to Fringe “Wendy and the Wonderland” to tell a story “for the search for child innocence” where “body acrobatics, ride and air dance” are part of. Also emphasizing the inclusion of the “Congregation” show, which is born of a collaboration between British sound artist Ray Lee and “Tempest Projects”. It is "a dynamic experience that combines environment, music and technology", where, with "emission of sounds, the suspended sphere guides participants by paths and alleys that can be familiar or a discovery."
Connection to the story
The IC points out that this edition of Fringe is concerned to bring the festival to older areas, such as the Verde Island neighborhood or the Lai Chi Vun shipyards in Colaane, just to name a few examples. What is intended to do is the mix of “scenographic art with historical charm”, where many local groups participate.
This is the case of the Dirks Theatrical Art Association, which presents “Orchids to the Old House”, telling the story of “piglet traffic” using music.
Then we have the solo show of Chan Si Kei, "a meeting in solitude", which has as its background an old tea hall, where the artist "weaves considerations about evocative vignettes of family dinners."
Casa de Portugal in Macau also joins the Fringe poster with the show “Jazzés &amp; The Blackbird”, where “three musicians sing the jazz classics, on a makeshift stage on the porch of Casa de Portugal headquarters, admitted by an artistic installation of giant birds by Elisa Vilaça”.
If there is already poster, there are no tickets available yet. Ticket sales to Fringe starts on August 10, next Sunday.</description><pubDate>2025-08-04 07:55:36</pubDate></item><item><title>Short Film | Galaxy is associated with the Venice Festival</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/01/curtas-metragens-galaxy-associa-se-a-festival-de-veneza/</link><description>The “2nd International Festival of Macao Shorts of Galaxy Entertainment Group” has just signed a collaboration with the Venice International Film Festival, namely with the “Giornate Degli Author” event section, in order to show the work of local directors at this event.

July revenues reached 22.125 billion patacas, the highest value since the start of the pandemic
 
The game's revenues recorded in July an annual increase of 19 percent and monthly 5 percent, reaching the highest value of the year and also since January 2020, according to the data announced on Friday.
The casinos raised 22.125 billion Patacas in July, compared to 18.595 billion patacas in the same month of 2024, according to data from the Games Inspection and Coordination Directorate (DICJ). In June this year, casinos had recorded revenues of 21.064 billion patacas, and May was so far the month with the highest value of 2025: 21.193 billion patacas.
July is also present as the best month since January 2020, when the revenues of the casinos have reached a very close value: 22.126 billion Patacas. Since late January 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on the game, the engine of Macau's economy, with taxes on the revenue of this industry to fund the overwhelming majority of the government budget.
In terms of accumulated gross revenue, the first seven months of this year registered an increase of 6.5 percent over the previous year, with a total of 140.896 billion of patacas against 132.348 billion patacas between January and July 2024.
Macao closed last year with total revenues of 226.782 billion patacas, 23.9 percent than the previous year.
Budgetary review
The government predicted, in the initial budget for 2025, that the year would close with total revenues of 240 billion patacas, which would represent a 6 percent increase compared to last year.
But on June 11, the Legislative Assembly approved a new budget, proposed by the executive, which reduces the forecast for public revenues by 4.56 billion. The Secretary for Economics and Finance, Tai Kin IP, admitted to the deputies that the cut is due to the fact that the game's gross recipes in the first trimester of 2025 "were slightly below the planned."
Since May this year that monthly revenues have never been below 20 billion and Patacas, a serious three consecutive month. However, until April, even at the time of the Lunar New Year, one of the high peaks of the industry, revenues had never reached 20 billion patacas.</description><pubDate>2025-08-04 07:49:09</pubDate></item><item><title>Chikungunya | The first two local cases registered</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/04/chikungunya-registados-os-dois-primeiros-casos-locais/</link><description>Health services (SS) announced on Saturday the first two local cases of chikungunya fever.

Weight above 6%</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/04/imigracao-menos-portugueses-a-chegar-peso-acima-de-6/</link><description>The latest report on Portuguese emigration indicates that in 2023 they came to live to Macau 53 Portuguese citizens, making this fate with less Portuguese immigration
 
Macau was the destination where the Portuguese least emigrated in 2023, according to the latest report prepared by the Emigration Observatory and Migra Network, Center for Research and Studies of Sociology and ISCTE - University Institute of Lisbon. The study data were released by Lusa on Friday.
According to the same source, in 2023 they lived in Macau another 53 Portuguese citizens. This is a record that is equivalent to practically half of the Portuguese who began living in Australia, the second destination with the lowest emigration in Portugal in 2023, which registered 91 entries.
In 2022, the number of new entrances to Macao from Portugal, according to the previous report, was 20, which means the number rose to more than double. The report does not point to the number of Portuguese immigrants who left the masters.
Despite the changes, the report indicates that Portuguese immigration in Macao continues to take some expression: “Although Portuguese immigration has lost relative importance over the years, the impact of these flows in destination countries remains expressive. In Luxembourg, for example, the Portuguese represented about 13.5 percent of the total immigrant entrances, while in Macau the number was 6 percent and in Switzerland 5. One hundred ”, is pointed out by the authors.
Stabilized exits
Regarding the general trend of immigration, the study points out that in 2023 they left the country about 70 thousand Portuguese, a number that remained stable in relation to the recent past. The main destination was Switzerland.
“It is estimated that 70,000 Portuguese will have come out in 2023, the same number of 2022, thus continuing the recovery of Portuguese emigration to values near the years before the COVID-19 pandemic”, reads in the report of Portuguese emigration 2024, with data for the previous year.
According to the document, there was only a total recovery since emigration to the UK fell more than 40 percent, maintaining the descending trajectory started with ‘Brexit’ and for France down 25 percent.
Still, Portuguese emigration is higher than pre-covid levels in most of its main destinations. In 2023, Switzerland became the main destination country for the Portuguese, accounting for 12,652 entries, followed by Spain, with 11,554.
Also noteworthy are countries such as France (7,426), Germany (6,375), the Netherlands-now Netherlands (4,892), the United Kingdom (4,414), Belgium (3,857) and Luxembourg (3,638). Denmark (1,818), Mozambique (1,439) and Canada (1,005) are followed.
With less than 1,000 entries appear destinations such as USA (890), Austria (778), Norway (709), Italy (702), Sweden (688), Brazil (547), Venezuela (532), Ireland (426) and Angola (381). At the bottom of the table are Australia (91) and Macau (53).

In a statement issued yesterday, DICJ said it had coordinated the closure in “close interdepartal collaboration” to ensure “the compliance of the legal terms and the planning of the process”.
With the closure of the casino door, DICJ indicated that “immediately proceeded to the process of suspension of the operation of the tables, having actively coordinated, with the various public services, the monitoring of the withdrawal of the respective enclosure, among others, having the process elapsed in an orderly manner”.
During the process, the direction of services for labor affairs was also in the casino, to "provide clarification to workers and support them through the open line." The public security police body and the Judicial Police were also present to preserve public order.
Given the closure, DICJ promised to “optimize the inspection mechanism, promoting the normalization, healthy and ordered development of the game sector, creating more favorable conditions for the proper diversification of Macao's economy”.
The casino satellite was the first of 11 casinos to close the doors by the end of the year. The closing dates of the rest are not yet known.

One of the stores, “Tokyo Lifestyle”, is in Kowloon, while the Dondoki Japan chain supermarket, “Don Don Doki”, is located in Macao, in the Fai Chi Kei neighborhood. These contracts would be worth about $ 25 million from Hong Kong, and the companies involved are RNK Design and Engineering Company Limited (RNK) and Flaming Engineering Company Limited (FEL).
According to an ICAC note-Commissioner against Hong Kong's corruption, released on Wednesday, 41-year-old Pian Pang Ka-Shin, was sentenced to just three months for confessing to having received bribes.
"In ordering the sentence, magistrate Philip Chan Chee-Fai noted that the court departed from a sentence of six months in prison, reducing it to three months, taking into account the confession of the defendant's fault, his history and the reimbursement of the amount of the briefs involved in the present process to his former employer [KCL]," he may be.
KCL was, at the time of success, design consulting for the renewal of stores, and the two contracts were signed in 2019. At this stage, it was condemned to the “coordination of the contracted companies and the organization of the competitions”, and it also passed the presentation of budgets and proposals.
According to the ICAC, "Pang admitted that, between June 2019 and January 2022, he accepted bribes of more than $ 230,000 from two representatives of the two contractors of the works, namely RNK and Fel."
Good advice
Pian Pang Ka-Shin “was responsible for KCL to support Donki in the organization of the contest”, having been presented five proposals of selection by Donki.
The Japanese chain of supermarkets chose the gall, paying more than $ 23.4 million. In this context, the convict admitted “to have advised the FEL representative” about the procedures to be in the contest interview.
KCL has received two budgets to renew the Tokyo Lifestyle store in Hong Kong, having awarded this project to RNK, based on Pian Pang Ka-Shin's recommendation. After completing the project, RNK received from KCL $ 1.7 million for project rate.
In this case there are still three co-worms who declared themselves innocent in the accusation of conspiracy and will only be the subject of a prior examination, before the trial, on November 27. They are Li Po-Wah, director and shareholder of RNK, Pang Wai-Yin, former supervisor of RNK's facilities, and Yung Chor-Chi, Fel operator.</description><pubDate>2025-08-01 00:47:37</pubDate></item><item><title>Zelensky vs Zelensky</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/31/zelensky-vs-zelensky/</link><description>10/27/22
A renovated Ukrainian, with the same name of the president, guilty Zelensky about the extension of the conflict that destroyed his village. Zelensky, the village, who has never left his land, now lives mortified because his favorite gravedigger died in the bomber.
This Zelensky, the village, represents half the world that reproves the other Zelensky, the villain, for not wanting to negotiate with Putin.
Negotiate what? The invader enters us through the house, pies us the wife and daughter (cf. recent UN report on Ukraine violations in this “special operation”), an act that forced us to watch, and then we say: Alto there, we are for peace, but we have to negotiate: You have not said the name you want to give to children!
A peace that is not worthy is but a cessation of rights. As severe as Russophobia that Putin inflicts his people.
 
10/28/22
In a lunch with several guests I hear a friend, who declares himself a spiritist, explaining about the particularities of his belief, in a serene and balanced way, would even say, without "irrationalism". He discussed long and serenely, devoid of any fanatical proselytizing. “Here is someone to whom belief brought weighting!” I thought, a rare alliance.
However, at one point a phrase that horrify me. He says, “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!” And I enter the voracious fauces of holism. Because holismo has a pathological aspect like all good things, a side of shadow.
Two examples: In Hinduism there is less sensitivity to existential dramas, if that child suffers in this life this is only an expression of the strict karmic symmetry, an effect of the acts she committed in her previous life. In Africa it is not accepted that death may have been accidental, and many women are accused by the dead family of having caused her husband's death, in an act of manifest dementia, and, in the blatant majority of cases, in a huge injustice to his wife - madness that spreads and infiltrates the social fabric.
Buddhism has introduced compassion and Christianity to Caritas, trying to break with this logic, but in many other beliefs and religions the cage of causalities prevails over sensitivity to experience, the need to respond to the now.
It is a tremendous logic that transforms the world into a platonic stage, where we are just the shadows of something -an inextricable law -in a determinism that calcines all singularities, but strangely fascinates many.
The conquest of modernity has anchored in the conquest of chance and random, subtracting the incidences of a life to this fierce determinism that closed the world in a web. When the Renaissance freed the body from the influence of the stars, at this moment sexuality was relieved of guilt and individualism and their volition could emerge.
There is an unequivocal moral implication in the phrase “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!”, Which should work as a key to self-knowledge and self-judgment, but usually this phrase is managed to seek a reason for things abroad from us in the other. It is an alibi.
There is a holistic temptation in the world today, as in the Middle Ages there was a satanic temptation, without great reflection on its consequences. Because it is not enough we want to connect everything in a resonant chain of affection. Even the most unexpected: affection itself can kill.
I realize, thanks to this cultured, balanced, intelligent woman, that “the combat” moved at the beginning of this century. One of the great misconceptions of the twentieth century was the false dichotomy between "rationalism and irrationalism", a debate that extended to all fields, including art. First, rationality was confused (the positive side of reason) with rationalism (the pathological feature of reason), and articulated in this lack of discernment was confused irrationalism with freedom. Almost all the art of the twentieth century, with surrealism to the head, worked in this error. The fallacy still exists despite having consolidated the emergence of 'irrationalism' and the consequent relativist currents that followed it. Essentially much of what happened in the twentieth century, it turned around this shock between two paradigms: rationalism versus irrationalism.
Now, I see, the indetermination, chance, the random of the terrible temptation of the causal cage. Holism, in its pathological feature, can be the reductionism that is the way it puts the way as a new 'eschatological narrative'.
Is it "by chance" that the holism emerges at the moment when neo-liberalism and its cynical contempt for the human person besides all freedoms, all acquired rights?
Holistic consciousness has brought positively a greater ecological awareness but followed by scholastic rigor drifting reality under the blanket of a determinism that is much more than inconvenience: all great authoritarian ideologies are holistic.
My friend will know how to combine her holistic and transpersonal belief with the freedom and responsibility that every moment asks us - but how many will make the destruction, under a law that explains and encompasses everything?
How many will not be abandoned to what it is?
The awareness of the indeterminate brings tragic conscience, as the Greeks knew, but also brings the will and the courage of the decision. And of this we cannot abdicate.
In addition, as Drummond shows in Carlos Drummond de Andrade's poem “Quadrilha”:
"John loved Teresa who loved Raimundo/ who loved Maria who loved Joaquim who loved Lili/ who did not love anyone./ John went to the United States, Teresa to the convent,/ Raimundo died of disaster, Maria stayed to aunt,/ Joaquim suicide himself and Lili married J. Pinto Fernandes/ who had not entered the story."

Reading many people's reactions when the Nobel Prize in this year's literature was announced, I couldn't help but remind me of this repair of Jean-Pierre Siméon, in relation to another Nobel Prize: “An editor of a large national newspaper wrote five lines of indignation because the Nobel Prize for Literature, a complete stranger. But unknown to whom? How did not occur to this patented and paid literary columnist to do his work, that his apparent ignorance was a matter of incorrect professional conduct? Tranströmer was translated into many languages, it was available in French. »
There is always the choir of those who wait for the announcement of the prize to complain about not being invited to the jury of the prize, there is a subgroup of Irados that professes “never read and I will not bother to read”; It is an uncommon fauna, which inhabits social networks.
I do not always know all the winners-I was unaware of the existence of Louise Glück, who I find a great poet, or the Olga Tokarczuk, for example-but it only brings me the comfort of knowing that the world is not a soap opera where everyone knows each other and the joy of recognizing that the gauge of the world is not measured with my short measure and that on the contrary it gives me a new opportunity to face the unknown.
And perhaps the most cretin of reactions was the smart one who wrote, but there are still those who read French? Confirming only that today there is a new kind of ignorance that fires with a displeasure: the one who only read English.
I would also prefer that, in French, Pascal Quignard, Linda reads, or even Sollers, or, among the new ones, Mathias is awarded, but that does not take dignity to the work of Annie Ernaux (and it would be enough to have written the “Les Années”). There are books of her that I like less, like the vulgar "a simple passion," but this happens with almost every authors, they have a channel books and others that are like intervals in their itinerary. I advise reading a beautiful book of interviews with her, "L'Ecriture Comme un couteau".

Yesterday came an article in Maputo's morning “News”, realizing that the Pen Club narrative prize was assigned to my wife, Teresa Noronha, for her soap opera “Tornado”, which had already had the Maria Velho da Costa award.
The summary they made of the book does not even deserve comments, by pathetic, but what matters to highlight is the note of disqualification about their "Mozambicanity" by calling it Luso-Mozambican. It is not inaccurate, but for those who know the context, it is a dirty touch.
Because finally, following the same logic, Adelino Timóteo should be called Tsonga-Mozambican, to Álvaro Taruma-Mozambican, and Macua-Mozambican to the writers who are from the north, etc., etc. Which is not reported to happen.
At the beyond moment, in the soap opera, she writes:
«Our color has never been dominant. In colonial time we were not white, we were ripped from monories, gone mugs, the pejorative term to speak of a son of Goes and Portuguese. In the postcolonial period, I was not black and if, in Lisbon, they took me by Brazilian or Cape Verdean, already in France were lost in cogitations of where they would be and amazed when they found out it was African. There I had to explain my DNA's wanderings before relying on moorms. It took me a long time to accept that it was so because yes, and that it was no curse that were so; On the contrary, I could even discover intense patterns of fantasy and freedom in this shrewd cloak that is our genealogy… »
In the current Mozambique it is white… and this is overlapping it soon to what it does or what it is.
It is sad, but as Naipaul warned, through these stops the race is everything and is soaked in it as deeply as, elsewhere, in religion.

Bruno Latour, an anthropologist who studied the sciences and their procedures and legitimations, law, technique and religions died and entertained themselves to turn the guts to the dogmas of the “modern”. For him the place, the expert's function, was more defined by the perplexity he embodied than for the supposed truth he would support him.
He proposed, as an alternative to the kinds of multiculturalism and his mistaken password "all different all the same", the return to "diplomacy", given precisely, not from the presupposition that "we are unified because participants of the same nature" but simply reveal that we "do not yet share an ordinary world"; It is necessary to deal frontally with the "abyss of disagreement" that separates us, rather than wanting to delude it.
And about politics said, disassessedly:
«If transparency is required from the politician, we kill him; If one requires fidelity to what the other was or he says, kills him; If a mimetic relationship is required between what the crowd wants and what its representative says, the representation is killed. These must, therefore, by definition, betray, deceive, modify, distort the word. Without this ability to double the word and betray, political language would not exist. I put the perfectly plausible hypothesis that political vocabulary will become as inaccessible as the religious language of the last twenty, three or fifty years. (in “UN Monde Pluriel plus Commun”). I believe it will be missed to decipher this frantically complex world that fit us.</description><pubDate>2022-10-17 02:18:03</pubDate></item><item><title>The yo -yo</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/30/o-fuxi/</link><description>O my friends, companions of these funerals trips to countries as old as the stars and the moon, and as strange as the profound interior of our disgraceful souls, - that startle still awaits us, what secret spells we will have to overcome, what horrors will rise to our dilated pupils of amazement and terror?
Increasingly close to our precarious existences, howling the war monster, which threatens to merge humanity with the earth, incessantly traveled by the squalid spectrum of hunger and the invisible evil of ten thousand pests.
O human human, who cries superior to his own nature, but then reveals to you, once and again, unable to simply order your existence and do not understand that you are possessed by the fickle wrath and are slave to your own ambition! Do not be content with the white jade or the light gold, there is no treasure that gives you your inextinguishable thirst for other men, animals and things; for in you an eternal anguish in you; in you crawl the expelled snakes; For you grows, powerful and impossible, the very fertile ivy of evil!
This is perhaps why on the mound they call the white deer, where one of the eight immortals in sacred mount was evolved through the skies to Penglai, inhabits the fuxa, a bird whose form resembles that of the rooster, although topped by a human head. What strange copulas, what monstrous amplexes, what terrible procedures will have occurred to make the existence of this animal sinister possible? We do not know, but it is enough for our exhausted mind to dare to raise an answer, so we soon feel the skin traveled by horrendous goose bumps and the heart trigger in paraded, which wild horse beaten by the night whip of fear, oblivious to reins and containment.
May men refrain from going through the Mount of the deer, because although there are riches capable of calming the most misunderstanding ambitions, if they have the disgraced fortunate to glimpse a fuxa, it will be immediately triggered the cultivated fields, because it will be beheaded the soft animals, for it will be sacrificed the best young man and destroyed superb from countries.

«Every man morally is one and absolute; But you have to live with your personality to mitigate. (…) Coexistence is only possible among people reduced to a negative or hollow presence, which is constantly giving in. Hence, the emptiness of society, a huge ghost composed of numerous deceased. An upper man is antisocial or criminal. Its destination is jail and desert.
He is in thinking about whether she reflects here about the political-social conditioning that gagging, and worse, in a sad country as Portugal was in the middle of the Estado Novo (and the book is from 1931) where any possibilities of spontaneity and frankness in human relations were coarcet, or only lends the behavior of men (oppressed) a metaphysical frame, a “essence”, from a presumption of each one in the presumption of each one be in isolation “one and absolute”. Sometimes, to an excess of spirituality (or longing), it adds to Pascoaes to lack the world. He is a great poet, but he is a poet who takes gray-Jewish ampoules and is therefore written amiiude on a programmatic furor, ceasing to have pores; There is often a glass between him and the real, the same one who made him wring the Ballet, 1921: “Everything is ghost. There are only clouds, clouds of voices, clouds of souls, afflictions and tragedies! Clouds and more clouds, appearances and more appearances! It is a divine lightning that pierces them, the instant appearance that arises and throws us to the ground, dazzled! »
Sometimes I would like to remind him, as Antonio Sérgio did in the article “Regeneration and Tradition, Moral and Economy”, which dedicated to Easter: “Easter, Easter my dear friend: You are a pure, excellent and noble poet, but also a victim of this social environment, like us all: this horrible isolation that you praise and I”.
"As a child, he stole two melos," says Jacinto do Prado Coelho, stole him from a nest, and throb his lifetime remorse for it. The person, few more mischief is known to him. Only in Álvaro de Campos sprouts a twinge of evil and obscenity: “Oh, and ordinary and dirty people who always seem the same,/ who employs profanity as usual words,/ whose children steal at the grocery door/ and whose daughters at eight years-and I think this is beautiful and I love him! -/ masturbate decent -looking men on the stairs. » (Ode triumphal).
Both poets beaten by a certain idea of holiness, they were identical to the inability of breaking the siege of the skin with the overflow of the dike, the same curse of sublimating Eros's concrete ferocity with the mansuity of the verses.
Of course, they are the two "Bigger Than Life", but sometimes unnerves to watch, from my hostor's post at the Procrastinators Club, to the tantrums between them, just to see who occupies, in the internal organization, the place of president and treasurer.
Although a person has guessed more, for example, this he wrote in the least known martial ode and that is declining in the situation we live today, differently, with the heart in his hands:

Beijing criticizes the decision and accuses the US of not contributing to peace in the region
 
China criticized Washington's decision to impose visa restrictions on members of the organization for the release of Palestine and the Palestinian National Authority, which Washington accuses of "supporting terrorism."
"We are surprised and disappointed by these sanctions. We do not understand that the United States continues to belittle the efforts of the international community for peace. The Palestinian issue is a question where equity and justice should prevail," Foreign Affairs spokesman Guo Jiakun said at a press conference.
Guo added that the United States must "be responsible and implement the United Nations resolutions and make efforts to achieve a proper solution to this issue rather than doing the opposite."
The spokesman reiterated that Beijing will continue to work with the international community "to end the conflict in Gaza, relieve the humanitarian crisis and advance to the implementation of the framework of the two states."
The US State Department indicated on Thursday in a statement that "it is in the interest of US National Security to impose consequences and blame the organization for the release of Palestine and the Palestinian National Authority for not fulfilling their commitments and undermine the prospects of peace."
“In addition, (both entities) continue to support terrorism-including the glorification of violence, especially in school books-and to grant payments and benefits in support of terrorist to Palestinian activities involved in terrorism and their families,” reads in the statement.
High blood pressure
The announcement of sanctions arises in the midst of increasing international pressure on Israel to improve the conditions in the Gaza Strip, which crosses a severe humanitarian crisis and where, in recent days, local authorities have reported a peak of hunger -related deaths.
France, the United Kingdom and Canada, among other countries, expressed their decision to recognize a Palestinian state before the UN in response to the situation, announcements that were received with strong criticism from the Israeli government, which considers this measure a "support for Hamas."
US President Donald Trump defended on Thursday that the “fastest” way of ending the crisis in Gaza is the surrender of the Palestinian Islamist group and the return of Israeli hostages that maintain in their power.</description><pubDate>2025-08-04 07:53:59</pubDate></item><item><title>UN | Request to Thailand and Cambodia Respect for the ceasefire</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/01/onu-pedido-a-tailandia-e-camboja-respeito-pelo-cessar-fogo/</link><description>The United Nations asked Thailand and Cambodia to respect the ceasefire after the two countries of Southeast Asia have been mutually accused of violating the truce agreement.

Bangkok and Phnom Penh agreed with a truce, which began on Monday to Tuesday, after five days of gunfire at its 800 km shared border due to a territorial dispute. However, the Thailand Foreign Ministry has announced that several Thai soldiers from Sisaket's eastern province have been attacked “by Cambodian forces” equipped with “small weapons” and grenades. "This represents a blatant violation of the ceasefire agreement," the ministry said in a statement.
Thai government spokesman Jirayu Huangsab also reported clashes on Wednesday night, stating that "the Thai side maintained the control of the situation" and that the general situation along the border only normalized at 08h local (09h in Macao). For his part, an official from the Cambodian Ministry of Defense also accused Thailand of violating the ceasefire twice.</description><pubDate>2025-08-01 01:06:48</pubDate></item><item><title>Economy | Bank of Japan improves growth forecast for 2025</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/01/economia-banco-do-japao-melhora-previsao-de-crescimento-para-2025/</link><description>Banco do Japan yesterday improved economic forecasts for the 2025 fiscal year, estimating a growth of 0.6 percent, plus a tenth of the previous projection, and maintained the reference interest rate of 0.5 percent
 
The Banco do Japan (Boj) anticipates a slowdown in the economy while assimilating the real impact of the US -launched trade war, but predicts that GDP resumes a moderate growth trajectory as the situation stabilizes.
The Japanese Central Bank also reviewed, in five tenths, to 2.7 percent, the forecast of prices in the 2025 fiscal year, which ends in March 2026, in line with the registered increase in recent months, especially of food, with rice as the main example.
The institution stressed that it took into account risks still present when reviewing the projections included in the quarterly report of economic forecasts, released at the end of the two -day meeting on monetary policy. "It remains very uncertain as trade and other policies will evolve in each jurisdiction and how economic activity and prices will react," said Boj, who considers it necessary to follow the impact of these factors on financial and currency markets.
In this scenario, the Central Bank maintained unchanged GDP growth for 2026 and 2027, at 0.7 and 1 percent, respectively, but revised, in a tenth, the estimated inflation for those years to 1.8 and 2 percent.
Prices and salaries
BOJ closely follows the evolution of prices, which rose 3.7 percent in May, the seventh consecutive month above 3 percent, and sees the general trend of companies to increase wages, although they do not yet follow the pace of inflation.
However, the institution fears that these efforts are committed to tariff uncertainty and the possibility of the business sector choosing to reduce expenses, an indirect reference to protectionist policies such as those adopted by the United States.</description><pubDate>2025-08-01 01:05:16</pubDate></item><item><title>Hebei | Torrential rains cause eight dead in northern China</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/01/hebei-chuvas-torrenciais-causam-oito-mortos-no-norte-da-china/</link><description>Eight people died and another 18 are still missing in Hebei's Chinese province due to the torrential rains that fell in northern China this week, local press said.

The Purchasing Managers Index (PMI, a sector's reference indicator), widespread by the Chinese National Statistics Office (GNE), was in July at about 49.3 points, 0.4 less than the 49.7 recorded in the previous month, being below the analysts' predictions. In this indicator, a value above the 50 -point threshold represents an activity growth in the sector compared to the previous month, while a value below represents a contraction.
Among the five subsidies that make up the industrial PMI, the production and delivery deadlines were the only ones that were above the brand mentioned, while those of new orders -fundamental to measure demand -inventories of raw materials and employment remained in the contraction zone.
Zichun Huang, from British consultant Capital Economics, considered that the indicators released yesterday suggest that the Chinese economy "lost some impetus in July, with slower growth in industrial, service and construction sectors."
"Given the absence of signs of stimulus at the Politburo meeting-the Chinese Communist Party summit-on Wednesday, we see few reasons to expect economic recovery during the second half of the year," he predicted.
Regarding the contraction of the industrial PMI, Huang stressed that, although the GNE has attributed part of the descent to interruptions in production due to meteorological causes, the analysis suggests that the demand has “also weakened”.</description><pubDate>2025-08-01 01:01:35</pubDate></item><item><title>Demography | Weddings rise 3.2% in China after minimum historical</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/01/demografia-casamentos-sobem-32-na-china-apos-minimo-historico/</link><description>About 3.54 million Chinese couples were married in the first half of 2025, representing a 3.2 percent homologous increase and suggests a slight recovery after the historical minimum in 2024. On the other hand, 1.33 million couples divorced during the same period
 
According to the latest statistics of China's Ministry of Civil Affairs, 3.54 million couples married and 1.33 million divorced in the Asian country between January and June this year, which marks a shy recovery compared to the 3.43 million weddings recorded in the same period as 2024.
Experts cited by the local press indicate that if the current trend remains, the total number of marriages in 2025 can slightly exceed 2024 levels, when it reached the lowest level since 1980.
Among those who were married in 2024, according to the same source, at least 1.63 million were people born from 2000. This number illustrates that, despite the general tendency to postpone marriage, a significant part of young adults in the country continues to formalize relationships in the twenty -year -old.
According to the ministry, the age group with more marriages in 2024 was 25 to 29 years old, with 4.29 million people, which represented 35.1 percent of the total. This is the thirteenth consecutive year in which this age group concentrates most marriages, reflecting the progressive postponement of the age of the first marriage that has been observed for over a decade.
In an attempt to reverse the drop in marriages and births, the Chinese authorities have implemented several measures in recent months. Last May, new national rules entered into force for the registration of marriages that eliminate geographical restrictions, allowing couples to marry anywhere in the country without the need to present the registration of residence, known as "Hukou".
Official godfather
In addition, 28 provinces have expanded the duration of marriage license, being Shanxi (center) and Gansu (northwest) those that offer the longest period, with 30 days. Some locations, such as the city of Lüliang in Shanxi, have even begun to offer economic incentives to newlywed couples, with bonuses of up to 1,500 yuan (182 euros) if the woman is 35 or less.
At the 20th Chinese Communist Party Congress, held in 2022, the party in power emphasized that the country needs a system that “increases birth rates and reduces the costs of pregnancy, childbirth, schooling and children”.
China registered a decline in its population in 2022, 2023 and 2024, the first contractions since 1961, when the number of inhabitants decreased as a consequence of the failed policy of industrialization of the great leap in front and consequent hunger.</description><pubDate>2025-08-01 01:00:06</pubDate></item><item><title>Diplomacy | Trump says he can meet with Xi “before the end of the year”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/31/diplomacia-trump-diz-poder-reunir-se-com-xi-antes-do-final-do-ano/</link><description>The president of the United States said yesterday that the meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, may occur "before the end of the year", considering that there was a "positive" commercial dialogue between delegations from both countries in Stockholm. “I look forward to the meeting, I would say that (it may happen) before the end of the year.

The third largest Japanese car manufacturer also had an operational loss of 462 million euros, while sales volume dropped 9.7 percent in homologous terms to 15.824 billion euros, according to the financial report published yesterday.
The registered net loss is lower than expected by analysts consulted by Bloomberg, but reflects a situation still difficult for the Japanese manufacturer, involved in a large restructuring process.
Although the evolution of its offer and fixed cost reductions “has allowed to alleviate losses, the group continues to face contrary winds, namely a decrease in sales volumes, unfavorable fluctuations of exchange rates and the impact of US customs rights,” Nissan says.
The company maintains its predictions for the entire year 2025-2026, by 73 billion euros, but is excused to provide forecasts of profits or losses in a still volatile commercial environment.
Japan's car exports to the United States have been subject to a 25 percent surcharge since April by the Trump administration. Total customs rights to the sector should be reduced to 15 percent, according to a recently completed agreement between Tokyo and Washington.

Today, Beijing seeks “alternative mechanisms” of cooperation in the “global south” and tries to build an alternative model to the World Health Organization
 
 
Let's start with the concept of Global Health Governance (GGS). Is this a more contemporary concept or relating to the post-war period and the Foundation of the World Health Organization (WHO)? What have been the main actors of this governance until China's growth?
GGS is a concept whose prominence and relevance have grown significantly in the 21st century, largely driven by economic globalization and worldwide interconnection. Although global health has always transcended national borders, demanding multidisciplinary approaches and international cooperation, only from the 1990s it was made greater awareness of it. Historically, GGS has been predominantly influenced by western powers and neoliberal values. The main actors of this governance, until China's growth, were historically marked by interventions of entities such as WHO and non-governmental, predominantly American and European organizations.
One of the findings of its doctoral thesis is that China has been progressively positioning itself in this leadership. This position started specifically when and why?
Yes, China has been progressively positioned as a relief actor in the evolution of the GG system. Although it is not possible to point out an exact date of start, China has evolved from a relatively isolated country to a main actor in global political, economic and technological arenas. Its growing economic and political influence also represents a change in GGS's historical dynamics, and in the 1960s China tried to play a humanitarian health care role in neighboring countries and Africa. The thesis points out that China's experience can be seen as an example of what is achievable when a state chooses its own way rather than a pre-established model, aligning itself with the 21st century prediction as the "century of Asia."
Did the pandemic years influence this position? How?
Covid-19 pandemic highlighted the need for global health cooperation, as well as the potential consequences of the failure to prioritize global health. The thesis explores the evolution of the Health Silk Route before and after the pandemic, indicating that the pandemic years allowed greater awareness of the need for instruments such as the Health Silk Route as the most effective cooperation platforms among nations. Although not detailed in this specific section, it is implicit that the pandemic intensified China's performance in health diplomacy and health development assistance.
Looking at the internal reforms that China has carried out in the health area, which highlights as the most important?
I approach, in the thesis, the reforms of the China Health System and I point out that the Chinese governance model is a unique combination of state -oriented economic reforms and development by the state, incorporating elements of neoliberalism and authoritarianism into political issues in general, and the health sector is nothing different from the rest. One of China's mentioned contributions, recognized by WHO, is its primary health care model based on the recognized good practice of “barefoot doctors” (barefoot doctors). In addition, the thesis analyzes the main reform policies and their progress and challenges in the period 2009-2018, which comprise the reforms of primary health care, hospital and pharmaceutical reform. The “Healthy China 2030” program is also an important and ambitious reference of China's domestic reforms in health, also encompassing social determinants.
Is Beijing's intention to create an alternative entity to WHO, or simply create an alternative movement that can coexist with WHO, in the context of the relationship with the global south? How could this work?
The thesis suggests that China adopts a "dual approach": while integrating in existing global structures, forging simultaneously alternative paths, particularly through regional alliances such as BRICS and partnerships with Global South. This indicates an intention to create an alternative movement that can coexist and complement the role of WHO, rather than a direct alternative entity. China demonstrates a clear commitment to align the objectives of the “Belt and Road” initiative with the united nations sustainable development objectives, showing their willingness to present these initiatives as complements to the existing cooperation mechanisms in the international liberal order. President Xi Jinping's view of a “future community shared for humanity”, which includes the notion of a “global health community for all”, also points to a new perspective in international cooperation.
Traditional Chinese Masks, Vaccines and Medicine (MTC): What are China's products or instruments to position itself as an increasingly global actor in GGS?
The thesis points out that China is an indispensable provider of global public health, essential for the product supply chain, such as masks and vaccines. The MTC is also mentioned as one of China's great contributions to global health governance, with its chinese herbal treatments, some of which already recognized by WHO in 2017. In addition, Chinese medical assistance and medical teams sent to other regions of the globe are important instruments of Chinese health diplomacy.
In creating an alternative movement or reality to WHO, China may be taking advantage of the lack of full representativeness in the same WHO, or gaps in its operation?
The thesis does not address directly whether China is taking advantage of a lack of full representativeness in WHO or gaps in its operation. However, it emphasizes that the work aims to fill a gap in scientific knowledge in relation to the paradigm of health governance from a non-western and liberal perspective, emphasizing China as an actor of the global south. This suggests that China seeks to strengthen alternative models that can offer more personalized health challenges, different from those defended by Western countries, positioning itself as a moderate reformist actor.
How has the European Union (EU) foreign policy in relation to China affecting or influenced this position of the country in global health governance?
In the thesis, the fourth publication, entitled "Challenges on the European Union-China Cooperation in Higher Education from" People-To-People Dialogue ’Perspective: The Case of Health-Related Joint Projects," explores cooperation in higher education, in particular that includes health-related projects. Therefore, despite the strategic and economic dialogue, the deterioration of UE-china bilateral relations intensified, with the commission to assume a decline of enthusiasm due to “China's countermeasures to EU human rights sanctions, economic coercion and commercial measures against the single market, and the positioning of China in the war in Ukraine”. Although challenges and tensions are recognized, cooperation in higher education, including health projects, is seen as part of a broader picture of strategic partnership between EU and China. However, it is evident that there is no long tradition of health cooperation between EU and China in higher education, and that there are few joint projects compared to the general panorama. It is suggested that both EU and China should make more efforts to align medical study curricula and promote more joint research in areas related to health, infectious diseases, among others.
In the Trump 2.0 era, and without pandemic, what could be China's role in global health governance?
Although the thesis is published this year, it focuses on the preceding period and includes the pandemic, where it does not speculate directly on a future scenario of “Trump 2.0” without pandemic. However, the thesis argues that China is not just a participant, but a moderate reformist force in the formation of global health standards. Regardless of future political scenarios, their growing economic and political influence, strategic health diplomacy, internal reforms and initiatives such as the Health Silk Route will continue to shape their role in global health governance. The view of a “global health community for all” also remains a guiding principle for China's efforts.
Does this power of China in GGS verify more with bilateral or multilateral agreements?
The thesis suggests that China's power in global health governance manifests itself through both bilateral and multilateral agreements, but with a growing emphasis on certain forms of cooperation that strengthen their role in the global south and through alternative mechanisms. Although the thesis does not explicitly quantify the predominance between bilateral and multilateral, the focus on regional alliances (BRICS) and partnerships with the Global South (which often involve bilateral agreements and group cooperation initiatives) and the Health Silk Route indicate a hybrid approach.</description><pubDate>2025-06-30 23:46:26</pubDate></item><item><title>Macao Forum | Secretary-General says it has never discussed widening to Hispanic countries</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/30/forum-macau-secretario-geral-diz-que-nunca-se-discutiu-alargamento/</link><description>In an interview with Lusa agency, the secretary general of the Macau Forum, Ji Xianzheng, assured that “never discussed” the widening of action to Hispanic countries, but that the willingness already stated by the government of Sam Hou Fai will have to be the authorities to decide a new direction to the cooperation strategy.
 
The Secretary-General of the Macau Forum stated that the institution “never discussed” the creation of an entity to extend to Hispanic countries to promote economic cooperation similar to those that provide the connection between China and Portuguese-speaking countries.
“Within the Macao Forum, we have never discussed this topic,” said the Forum Secretary-General for Economic and Commercial Cooperation between China and Portuguese-speaking countries Ji Xianzheng.
The official acknowledged that, "in society, there were some conversations to discuss or address the possibility of promoting more contact and cooperation with Spanish -language countries, but at the Forum level we have never addressed this theme."
The Macao executive announced in mid -April the intention of creating a center to promote economic services between China and the Portuguese and Spanish languages in the neighboring special Economic Zone of Hengqin.
The idea is to provide companies in Hispanic countries services in the “linguistic, legal, fiscal, verification of compliance with norms, formation, arbitration and mediation”, according to the Secretary for Administration and Justice, André Cheong.
Days earlier, the chief executive, Sam Hou Fai, had also announced the intention of “promoting exchange and cooperation” through Macao between China and the universe of Spanish -speaking countries.
Although Macau wants to widen focus to Castilian -speaking countries, “the forum will remain the forum for China and Lusophony countries,” said Ji Xianzheng. The secretary general clarified that the institution that directs "can contribute contributions to the greater opening of Macao in international cooperation", as is the intention announced by the new government of MSAR.
Complementary forum
Personally, the secretary-general guaranteed to have "all the pleasure of working with all parties," but stressed that this is a "decision that is up to the central governments to make" and that the forum was never contacted in this regard.
"Yes, I worked in Latin America, Spain, nine years in Madrid and Caracas. But this is not a decision of personal interest, it is up to politicians to make the decision," he said, explaining that the idea will be to promote the relationship between Macao and Brazil and then to other Latin American countries, as well as expanding the relationship with Portugal to Spain.
"There is no limit. The Macao Forum is complementary. It does not restrict any promotion of the cooperation of the other parts," he said.
According to the Macao Government Communication Office, Sam Hou Fai admitted on June 21 that he postponed a trip to Portugal, scheduled for July, and should also pass through Spain and the European Union headquarters in Brussels.
Bad interpretations
In the same interview with Lusa, the Secretary-General of the Macao Forum imputed to national governments the responsibility for conducting development and economic cooperation policies, stressing that the institution “has no investment projects”.
Ji Xianzheng attributes criticism to the Macao Forum to an wrong interpretation regarding the body's mission. "The forum is a mechanism of cooperation between central governments. Many people think it is to the secretariat that it is up to the execution of policies, but we have a limited number of people," added Ji.
"The secretariat has no investment projects, it is a mechanism for preparing the ministerial conference, connecting with governments, not a promotion agency. It has not been thought of, connects with the promotion agencies. We are four people sent by China and one delegate for each country," he said.
At the last ministerial conference, in April 2024, then Portuguese Economy Minister Pedro Reis argued that the Portuguese Language China-Parais Cooperation and Development Fund should bet more on small and medium enterprises (SMEs).
The Cooperation Fund was created in 2013 by the China Development Bank and the Macao Industrial and Commercial Development Fund, with a thousand million dollars, of which about 60 percent have already been invested, according to the secretary general.
Action plans
Ji Xianzheng has admitted that SMEs are "a difficult theme for any government" and that "international cooperation for the promotion of development and cooperation of small and medium enterprises is even more difficult. It is a topic that is being debated daily worldwide." But admitted, "here, little."
"But it is stipulated in the action plan [2024-2026]. It is up to central governments and commerce chambers, promotion agents, to work together to do this. The secretariat assumes responsibility as authorized by the central governments, specifically, in the activities program," he said.
Politicians from various countries, including Portugal, Angola and Mozambique, have appealed to a change in the rules of the fund's candidacy. Current rules require, for example, that candidate projects have a minimum investment of five million dollars, and the fund only covers 20 percent of total investment, referring the rest to governments or companies.
Ji Xianzheng said the new fund's new direction "is committed to promoting a broader investment, with better coverage for all forum countries, [relatively] to projects that have a strategic or significant impact on the socioeconomic development of participating countries."
According to the secretary general, "the terms of application [of the rules of access to the background] will be more flexible and the forms of application will also be more diverse." “Instead of being just direct investment, they are also studying ways to apply the fund, in cooperation with other funds or with other financial institutions,” he gave as an example.
"This fund has an operation according to market rules. It is not a humanitarian aid fund. Therefore, it has to guarantee the minimum return of benefit. But, on that, they are very open to study, in this case, the conditions of each project," added Ji Xianzheng, but to give examples of "flexibilization of the rules."
Regarding the approximation of the China universe and countries of the Iberian Peninsula, already cemented in official speeches, economist Maria Fernanda Ilhéu, president of the Seda's New Route Association, told HM, earlier this month, that this intention is “very objective and pragmatic and can be summarized to the Macao economy diversification project, for which companies and investors are not only in Macao, but also from Macao, but also from Macao, but also from countries, but countries Portuguese Language ”.
"But the fact is that companies and institutions from Portuguese-speaking countries are not being effective in responding to this need for Macao. Therefore, widening companies and Spanish-speaking institutions this invitation to cooperation seems logical to me," the economist said.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Isabel Rio Novo, author of the biography of Luís de Camões: “Time in Macau was of tranquility”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/26/isabel-rio-novo-autora-da-biografia-de-luis-de-camoes-tempo-em-macau-foi-de-tranquilidade/</link><description>It will be launched tomorrow, at the Consulate General of Portugal in Macau and Hong Kong, the biography of Luís de Camões, by Isabel Rio Novo.

Why did you decide to get in the writing of another biography of Camões?
It is true that Luis Vaz de Camões has been biographed many times over 500 years. However, 50 years ago there was no biography about him. From my point of view and the editor, Camões deserved a more current biography that revised all kinds of prejudices, seeking known sources, the uncovered information research and where the rereading of all previous works were rereading. This biography is not only a summary, but also the reinterpretation of what has been known, but which had rarely been related. The book also brings some new data with some documentation that was discovered.
How was your relationship with the writing of Camões born?
I fell in love and went to those young readers who was not tormented with Camões. On the contrary, I liked it soon and let myself be seduced by Camões Lyric. I am from the areas of comparative literature and history, and in this sense I always understood the dimension and importance of the work of Camões.
And what are they?
It is a work and an author of its time and its time, which was extraordinary, with the Renaissance, Humanism and the travels of navigation. But at the same time, it is a work that is the product of an outstanding literary genius, one that we can tell a handful in the history of universal literature.
What camões we find in this biography?
I tried to go to the bottom, remove layers of the meaning that these 500 years were adding to Camões, in the sense that each season read its Camões and produced its interpretation. I wanted to discover the substrate, the man of flesh and bone he lived and wrote 500 years ago.
He was a man suffered, with many financial difficulties.
He was a man with a complex and difficult relationship with reality, not only of his time, but also with reality [itself]. The theme of the time, the disconcerting of the world, how society seems to work instead of what should work, being a literary topic of the Renaissance, it was something Camões felt personal and genuinely.
How?
He lived a series of disagreements, of extreme experiences. Suffice it to say that you have been stuck several times and for various reasons. He made great trips at a time when these were absolutely risky, long, and complicated enterprises. Camões was involved in military expeditions, and almost all his life was soldered. But this set of experiences allowed him to be almost everything someone could be at the time he lived.
He was one of the most traveled authors of the time, having been in Brazil, Goa…
Yes. Even the connection to Macau, which is contested by some scholars, but not by me… I am persuaded, given the existing documentation and indirect testimonies, which Camões passed through China with the position of Dead and Missing Provider. When this happened, albeit very incipiently, the Portuguese establishment in China, which was already Macao. It is not known whether Camões held this position assigned to him by Viceroy D. Francisco Coutinho, if he was exactly assigned to be a provider during the trip, or a provider at Macao's establishment. But what he knew from China was surely this little warehouse that Portugal had achieved, at a lot of cost, with great difficulty and after many attempts to obtain in China.
What did a deceased provider?
Whenever a Portuguese died in the East, a soldier or merchant, it was necessary to ensure the rights of the heirs, the families who were normally in Portugal. The provider had to identify the deceased, his naturalness, origin and make the heirs known. He also had to keep the deceased's assets before they were stolen, auction them, keep the coins that would result in, and then take it all to Lisbon. It was a process that, if it went well, took many months, because it was necessary to send this money to the authorities of Goa who later sent him in the career from India to Lisbon.
Can we talk about a period of stability in Camões's life in Macau?
Yes. Until this appointment as a deceased provider, everything Camões knew from the East had been as a soldier. As soon as Goa [1553] arrives weeks later in a first military expedition. We know why: Not because I had some war appeal, but because only participating in expeditions earned your welding. Although everyone said that the soldiers lived very poorly, the welding was what Camões had to survive. The time lived in Macao, when he was free from soldier obligations, was a time of tranquility regarding subsistence, which was assured. He had some time and calm to continue the work with "the Lusíadas." More than that, as much as the sources allow to deduce, Camões met in Macau a phase of balance in terms of personal and loving life, as, on the return trip, he brought with him, according to the testimony of Diogo do Couto, a Chinese girl.
Dinamene.
This was the term used by the chronicler. We don't know if it would be a Chinese or Asian girl. This girl with whom Camões lived maritally was someone who liked it very much, according to the testimony of Diogo do Couto. But Dinamene would certainly not be her name, as it was a mythological name that, by the way, Camões used in her lyric, even before she boarded the East. Chinese girls with whom soldiers and merchants in Macao lived amanced were baptized and received a Christian name. Therefore, Dinamene would even have a Christian and Portuguese name. But as we do not know her name, and if we are aware that we use a kind of metaphor, we can call it Dinamene.
She dies later on a trip and makes Camões very shaken.
On Macao's return trip to Goa, probably at the end of his mandate as a provider, Camões suffers the celebrated wreck, in which he loses the personal assets he had ease, including the assets of the deceased that he was guardian, and this will bring him complications. It also suffers the loss of dynamine. The wreck went with some in the seas of China, probably by the mouth of the Mekong River.
Considers unlikely to have lost part of "the Lusíadas."
The first biographers say Camões was saved from this wreck with a board. It is not unreasonable that he managed to save the manuscript of the Lusíadas on this board. But it is also no excluding that Camões knew his poem by heart. The memory of people in the sixteenth century was different. They were very used to keeping things from memory. And we know, because the proof is obtained in the work of Camões, that it had an extraordinary memory. I have a way to prove it, of course, that Camões is one of the rare authors who knew his poem by heart.
Do you think Camões had a lower life to his true talent?
Undoubtedly. According to a too extensive set of concordant testimonies, he dies poor, even in miserable conditions, and according to an eyewitness, without having a blanket with which he covered himself. On the other hand, Camões was known to follow the publication of the Lusíadas, who were commented and read [in the poet's life time]. We have the testimony of Faria de Sousa, one of the first biographers of Camões, which says that when he passed the streets, people stop and pointed. Camões also had a figure that stood out, with a leaked eye and using a pale. By then, I would be quite sick, using crutches. But there is a set of poets, which is very unreliable that they did not know Camões, who never refer to them. There are, on the other hand, other humanists, such as Pedro Magalhães Gândavo, who from the outset praises him as the prince of Portuguese poets.
But the king gives him a tendency for deeds provided and the publication of "The Lusíadas."
This famous tendency, which should not be a big deal, because all ancient biographers say it was derisive, is attributed to him as a kind of military reform, because of the 17 years of service in the East, and not as a reward for the publication of "The Lusíadas." D. Sebastião's mercy letter, which attributes him the title of nobleman knight, had no repercussion in practice, but gave him 15 thousand reais. [The publication of “the Lusíadas”] was an additional argument [for the letter] and not the main argument. This leads us to believe that D. Sebastião will not even have read or heard “the Lusíadas”, will have received indirect information, favorable about the poem.
How did the process of editing “Os Lusíadas” occurred?
It was an event, because both the press and the books that were published a year were a very small amount. In the year in which “the Lusíadas” are published were the only work of non -religious caress [to be edited]. To fund the edition, it is more than likely that Camões had the support of a patron, probably D. Manuel de Portugal, from the Condes do Vimioso family. Getting the work was a press was a mere and complicated process, as it had to go through the prior examination of the civil authorities, the royal authority and the censorship of the Inquisition. The resident of the Holy Office does not only let the book pass, but to make an amount of almost unprecedented compliments in the license that authorizes the publication of the work. If we go to the opinions emitted by the same rear, there is no other work on which he is as compliments as it was with the epic of Camões.
In Indonesia, he befriended a slave on the island of Java.
Camões was, at least once, on the island of Ternate, Indonesia, in the archipelago of molucas, at a time when there were conflicts motivated by an extremely cruel Portuguese captain towards the king or sultan of Ternate, which originated a kind of war between the Portuguese and the places. Camões has a song that describes the island of Ternate. We do not know if it was at this time, or in another passage to the Far East, that Camões turned on to a Jaú, or Javanese, but could not be exactly from the Far East, but a freed slave who had been linked by friendship to Camões. And this is because in one of the first biographies of Camões it reads that Jaú, with the Christian name António, asked for alms at night. This freedom of movements of a slave indicates that he would probably be a freed slave. He asked for alms to Camões, for himself and the mother of Camões, with whom Camões will have lived in recent years of life.</description><pubDate>2025-06-26 23:30:50</pubDate></item><item><title>Filipe de Saavedra, Teacher: “A Camões Interpretative Center in Macau is missing”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/21/filipe-de-saavedra-docente-falta-um-centro-interpretativo-de-camoes-em-macau/</link><description>Professor at the University of Science and Technology of Macao and a scholar of the presence of Camões in Asia, Philip de Saavedra understands that Macau is missing an interpretative center about the poet's life and work. The academic spoke yesterday at the National Library in Lisbon, about the correspondence written by Luís de Camões in Asia
 
He participated yesterday at the “from Lisbon to Goa: What the Letters of Camões” participated. What path does the East arise portrayed in these letters, and who were directed?
The letters Camões wrote from Asia are in the order of the dozens. There is in them scholarship, philosophy, and also a lot of humor, sarcasm, and satire of humanist nature. Some were written from Ternate, others from Malaca, Macau, probably others from Cambodia, to recipients in India and Portugal. With the exception of the letters of Goa, where the identification of the writing site is generally present, maping those that were written during the rest of it would be a complex task. They are only given as written in Asia.
Can you give examples of written letters in this context?
I mention here two of the first he sent to the kingdom. The epistle whose first line is “The Poet Simony speaking” was written in January 1554, when Camões has just arrived in Goa, destined for his pupil, D. António de Noronha. It is a very emotional letter, giving it the storm that had plagued the Armada in the Cape of Good Hope, "seeing the death of the before me." Camões survived this limit experience aboard the São Bento ship, the only one to arrive that year to Goa, and which was lost in the turn of the Christmas lands, dying in this second bid the Captain Fernão de Álvares Cabral, and many of those who traveled with him. In addition to the news of his salvation, the poet was equally eager to tell his friend the expedition of D. Afonso de Noronha to Malabar, in which he had taken part in the previous month. In Irenal pages, Camões vehemently condemns the massacre of the few native troops by the “thick armed” of the disproportionate vice-king army. In his radical compliment of peace, the poet calls "true remedy" to the early death that cure the war crazes of those who want to live "by knights", for "who will walk by following the fero Mars always brings their eyes to their danger." Cruelly prophetic words: by irony of fate, at the moment the poet wrote these lines and sent them, that recipient diletus, for whose life he feared, already lay, lying during a military foray in Ceuta on April 29, 1553, only 17 years old.
And the second letter?
A year later, in January 1555, he wrote to a friend a different epistle in tone and in purpose, whose first line is "I wished so much", where he evoked the shock he suffered from the death of D. António, gathering a sonnet that had composed to his memory. It is clear that Camões also had great intimacy with this correspondent, who knew D. António and the poetry of Camões, Petrarch and Boscán. Interestingly, the letter includes some male lines, which Camões says they are mandatory in private letters, containing what can be called a resort conversation, so being worship or scholar did not prevent it if it were "bon vivant".
The presence of Camões in Macau is still wrapped in a certain myth. What are the concrete tests of your presence in the territory?
It is necessary to separate the waters. The landing of Camões in Patane's busty, then called “cave”, is surrounded by a beautiful legendary aura. But the presence of Camões in Macao, this is not involved in "myth", is a factual and historical reality, founded on a wide variety of testimonies, all independent of each other. Insisting on a chronology that contained in the sources, but which was flagrantly erroneous, it was deliberately sought to confuse the doubts that could have about his permanence in the sinned, although unjustified, with false doubts about the poet's stay in Macau, which are laughable and devoid of the minimum foundation. The joke ran a swimming, and little by little it was embedded in the collective imagination, to the point that some less informed people take it for a supposed “discovery” recent. However, nonsense was released in 1907, and soon dismantled in 1911 by Jordan de Freitas. Judge Eduardo Ribeiro put more “points in the iis” in this regard. In your time I will publish the full documentation about the presence of Camões in Macao, putting a definitive end to the mythical “myth”.
What life did Camões in Macau?
We can say that these two years were those of the greatest professional, economic and affective in his life. Is it written poetry? Constantly, as the dimension of the work attests. A significant part of “the Lusíadas” was composed here, although the poem had neither began nor ended in Macao. Not least in his life was that it was in Macao who publicly assumed a relationship with a young Chinese, most exactly the Tanka ethnicity of poor fishermen. This asymmetrical connection is not surprising and with a modest young woman: only disadvantaged families would not prevent daughters from relate to foreigners. This explains the fact that she left with Camões in 1565 to Goa, with concubine status. But the private vessel in which they followed, belonging to Chinese merchants, suffered a wreck by Cambodia, and Camões lost there the “kind lamp I loved so much”. It was only after his death that he would come to chrisma as Denamene, a Greek nymph of the waters, so that she could live forever in the ocean. The Chinese of Macao have a special relationship with Camões, such as the Portuguese and the Macanese.
How is this relationship?
It existed in the eighteenth century in Macao the first monument in honor of Camões, something that in Portugal only began to think about the following century. He even received an inscription on Chinese, and even a Chinese pavilion was built on his sanctuary. The Viscount of Juromenha says that in 1845 the Viceroy of Canton and Imperial Commissioner Ki-A there was worshiped Camões as the “Portuguese Confucius”. And rightly, Camões shares many aspects of the sages of Chinese tradition: he established a dialogue with the masters through the recreation of larger works, cultivated a millennial tradition (he gloss two thousand years prior to his own time), practiced itinerary as a source of "sagesse", said the primacy of poetry, conceived the rivers as mythical entities, even personifying them, even personifying them, even He showed a marked tendency to moralize, and epitomously his thinking in masterful sentences.
What connection did Camões have with Goa?
Unlike Macao, Goa raised in Camões mostly negative feelings. As primeiras impressões que dela teve, como uma terra sem lei em que só os videirinhos medravam, não poderiam ter sido piores, como se lê na carta inicial a que aludi: “longa terra, de todo o pobre honrado sepultura”. In the second letter, he goes on, "I can say that it is the mother of bad villains, and stepmother of honorable men." Estas impressões não melhorariam com o tempo, como o corroboram as sátiras que lhe acarretaram a expulsão para Ternate em 1556. Goa, onde ele chegou a ser o protegido dos vice-reis, para cair depois no maior desfavor sob D. Antão de Noronha, foi nos textos dele o espelho invertido do reino, a Babilónia corrupta e corruptora, alfurja da venalidade e da traição a Deus, ao King and the law. No que nem é original, pois há outras fontes que reforçam este retrato jeremíaco e apocalíptico da capital do império português do Oriente. Remember Bocage: "From the land to worst you are, O goa." Isto dito, obviamente que também terá vivido ali horas mais doces, sobretudo sob o vice-reinado dos seus protectores, e no convívio com alguns companheiros das lides poéticas que ali residiam então, e que ele evoca no chamado “Banquete de Trovas”. A um desses espíritos cultos, o poeta Luís Franco, deixou até cópia das suas obras quase completas, incluindo o «Auto de Filodemo» que ali compusera, para que elas se salvassem se outra adversidade sobreviesse na tornada ao reino.

Do you think Portugal should pay more attention to your writings, streamlining your work more? How?
In Lisbon it is necessary to build a great literary museum dedicated to Camões and its creations. The ideal place will be the Convent of St. Bento de Xabregas, where his friend Dom António had a grave at the Pantheon of the Line Chapel. Also in Goa the statue of Camões left for exile in the cruelly called “Archaeological Museum”, which is not the appropriate place to end the poetry or image of a poet. Being the greatest intangible heritage of Macao, Camões has been poorly used in this region. multimedia.
What about Macau? Is Camões studied at higher education?
Two students from the Macao University of Sciences and Technology will now defend their master's theses. The first is an in -depth technical study of the translation of Zhang Weim of the Camões Odes. The second runs through the literary survival of the figure of Dinamene in contemporary Portuguese fiction, and are both excellent, bringing novelty.</description><pubDate>2025-05-21 22:42:45</pubDate></item><item><title>Piménio Ferreira: “Anti-igan rhetoric has always worked in Portugal”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2021/04/26/pimenio-ferreira-a-retorica-anti-cigana-sempre-funcionou-em-portugal/</link><description>Piménio Ferreira, better known as Gitelles Ferreira, anti-racist militant, 34, physical engineer, national Romani.

Gitelles, we live in an intercultural land and the Gypsies - in particular - have lived about five centuries in Portugal. What is going on for Gypsy communities to remain “on the fringes” of the so -called society? 
The model of society remains to be changed. This is extremely stratified by placing people in subordinate places to privilege a violent minority. The white social structure is patriarchal and racist. What is called the "margin" of society is actually an intrinsic place to it, which belongs to it. In other words, Gypsy people have been included in this model of society since they discovered Europe and its kingdoms. The problem is the model of society that is maintained and the place to which they were relegated and how they were relegated: with violence, in inferior status against whites, without the right to human dignity, to constitute a family, to choose one's own language and religion, expropriated from any and all cultural and material law. A place built and maintained to this day by violence and genocidal and ethnicidal persecution. In 1463, a Gitano Vasco was drowned to an estate. In 1521, Gitans, or Gypsies, were already used as a reference for all that is considered bad in the model of society. The "counter-exemple" in the face of the white that would stand out for the positive. The 'angel' and the 'devil'; the 'other', the enemy; That against whom any attack and persecution is legitimate. Including the prohibition of defending, having weapons, any kind of goods, and the right of permanence.
And is this right to permanence that we still have nomadic gypsy communities within the country is denied?
Yes, no doubt. There are many ways to force nomadism: directly, prohibiting permanence and expelling with police or military force; indirectly, refusing public or private housing to Gypsy people, as they are Gypsy; and even through the gentrification process.
I read the result of an inquiry from the European Union Fundamental Rights Agency, which is said to be approximately 80% of the Gypsies responded to the risk threshold of poverty in their country; One in three Gypsies lives in a housing without channeled water; One in three Gypsies belongs to a family where someone hungry at least once the previous month; and 50% of Gypsies aged 6 to 24 do not attend school. Why does this happen like this? 
It is the historical persecution, which continues. There is no impoverishment that has no external cause. In this case, a political system of total expropriation and imposed on the basis of violence. Already in 1648, D John IV, the restorer, prohibited ‘Giving or Rent houses to Gypsies’. The same D John IV who got the kingdom of Portugal thanks to D. Jerónimo da Costa and his 250 knights. The same D. Jerónimo da Costa who had died to defend Portugal's independence from Castile. Gypsy, like his wife and children. Between prohibitions of permanence, “that do not enter Gypsies in the Kingdom and leave those who are” (D John III, 1526), with expulsions, degred to the galleys, expropriation of goods and properties, imposed with stripping, mutilation and death, systematically performed to this day (still in 2011 Faro City Council wanted to ban Gypsies in the municipality).
The prohibition of working on others (no one employs Gypsy workers, and those who accept they do it in total precariousness, for poorly paid positions and without decent rights and conditions). They cannot be dependent on their own work, they cannot get investment means due to extreme expropriation. Are dependent on precariousness. If you want to know what it is like to live in pure neoliberalism, know the lives of Gypsies. Their reality is paradigmatic of the aggression and depletion to which the "gentlemen" are willing to go to their benefit.
What do you talk about is economic and political power?
The group of political, social, cultural and economic power. The owner, the colonizer. This group that has been in power since it established the system of current domination. And that only makes sense within the hierarchically stratified sociopolitical model in which we live. Hence the need to end 'gentlemen' and institute a new model of society, healthy, free, without hierarchies or strata, whether of race, class or gender.
The model we live in leads to the Gypsy (and not only) community to economic exclusion, removing it from access to product consumption or excluding them from its production process; political exclusion associated with lack of access to information; To education and consequently the social exclusion that is seen in inequality of access to quality community areas such as restaurants, libraries, theater, cinema, concerts, health care, etc. How do you feel a gypsy child when you realize that it is not part of a whole? Children who are never represented, neither in movies, nor in books, nor in cartoons, not even in an announcement to eat cereals, for example? Is this a disaster for self-esteem, is a priori condemnation?
The question is that. Gypsy people are not “excluded from society”, by contrast, they are included in it. The problem is the existence of what is cynically called 'social exclusion', which term Orwellian, and there be under coercion, people. Which field of concentration and extermination. Incidentally, Nazi concentration camps are a more visual realization than called 'social exclusion' and, as here, were not a 'excluded' part of Nazi society, but rather its fundamental and characterizing structure. It is a place of violence, where people are maintained by violence, dedicated to their extermination, and designed so that few people can leave. And yet they resist. As in Nazi concentration camps.
And what you have listed as an example of 'consequence' of this 'exclusion', is actually the means by which this exclusion also happens and remains. Gypsy people are out of theaters, both as consumers and producers (but go to the cinema). They are out of school, education and the gym. Either as 'users' or as producers (but go to school and are on the basis of knowledge construction and academic and scientific debates).
Even in attacking Gypsy children's self -confidence, we talk about a maintenance mechanism of this situation. But Gypsy people respond very well: with Gypsy pride. Another resistance, another aggression. Gypsy people are thus included in society. In a place that belongs to this model of modern society. And they resist and contradict the power of domination and make a point of being in the city, in the cinema, in the theater, in the gym, in all spaces. With a lot of struggle and always resisting, but they are there. Social exclusion, more than a “place outside of society”, is part of its social structure.
Do you want to say that there is a collective resistance?
At work, already in a context of absolute precariousness, during the pandemic, Gypsy people rolled up sleeves and showed once again proactivity and creativity in adversity. They learned seeing and doing. And here, it is again the women who jump to the front line, face, learn to use digital tools with their daughters or children, and throw themselves into the network. And so they explore online sales as well as application by application (transportation or rehabs). In housing, in a context of pandemic in which the evictions were not locked - as they owed and dictated the law itself - residents did not fail to organize and fight unjust evictions and claim dignity in housing; associations of allied residents in their action with other housing and anti-racist struggle organizations.
It should also be noted how they reinvented and intensified to raise and distribute dietary goods and kits of masks/alcohol gel to the most expropriated people. Gypsies and non -Gypsies. In the anti-racist struggle, new movements emerged and their actions intensified by social networks. People who had never been organized or militated before began their first steps in activism, thickening this way of the organization and popular gypsy and anti-racist action. People forget, or do not want to value, but Gypsy action has helped determine results in the political dispute. Gypsy citizens mobilized in large and determined electoral results in the municipalities of 2017, both in Alentejo and in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area, even causing electoral earthquakes.
And even in the presidential, second place was resolved by a value equivalent to the estimated number of Gypsy voters. Apart from the non -Gypsy votes that were mobilized by the action of Gypsy voters. Gypsy people are even co-considering power in the spaces of opinion, local media, social networks and party and institutional political dispute. And most importantly, in the popular Ação and alliances with other social movements. We have never stopped fighting for all means and continuing to resist.
In contrast there are more and more hate speeches, from the far right in particular. What do you have to say about it?
To start these speeches are historical and European. Not even current and even less “of the far right”. These speeches have been adopted and rendered for a long time, even in 'democracy and freedom', by several representatives of the center right, conservatives, left center, liberal, liberal left, even representatives of the PCP. Anti-egana rhetoric has always worked in Portugal as it is the whiter rhetoric [white genesis]. That is, it allows you to create and give the "white" as the superior of all. And so please the white electorate who, when feeling well, pays off with his vote. Even if the policies implemented by their elected harm him even more.
Finally, did you like them to talk a little about your personal experience and how did you get to the activist?
I studied, fought for studies, made alliances, graduated, went in the labor market of the “formal precariousness”. I started my militant action and here I am today. We can transform this society a better. This certainty combined with the fact that the current one has so much suffering makes anyone want to have a transformist attitude. I wanted to be 'inventor' (physical engineer) and anti -racist militant. And through study (not necessarily schooling) and organization with others, in turn, with other studies, formations and visions, I learned how the world works and how it can be changed. But before transforming, we need to survive.
Hence two types of actions arise: transformative and survival. The struggle against hate discourse arises as survival, but his defeat will be a transformative victory. There is a lot that - like people who want a better world - we have to do, namely working to criminalize hatred speech; condemn and prohibit organizations with racist discourses and practices; denounce the racist institutional structure and logics that organize power and generate community resources. And in this sense, there have been various types of actions, of petitions, to manifestations. And we need more.
I, besides being a military man in the SOS Racism movement, participate in the “We came to stay” podcast, with Mamadou BA and Joseph da Silva. And if all goes well, we will soon start a new project. With friendly people, we also have the project “Gypsy Initiative”, dedicated to reflecting and promoting transformative movements. Essentially focused on educating against anti-agigarism, denouncing historical and continued genocide and working for a new society project. Also with new projects on the gutter. And finally, there are always voluntary actions without an organization, where I try to share what I found out about anti-egism and Roman history in schools and with interested people. In addition, there is still the struggle for housing, because the evictions did not stop during the pandemic. Due to housing and work precariousness, the subjects racialized especially the Roma nationals are the most vulnerable to COVID-19. There is essential to have actions in this area; Of all the struggles, this is the most structural, as it goes against one of the main enemies of a healthy society: the real estate speculation of this capitalist system, which places profit and goods above people and their humanization.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Lamborghini | Charles Leong returns to the Academy of Young Pilots</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/20/lamborghini-charles-leong-regressa-a-academia-de-jovens-pilotos/</link><description>The Lamborghini Squadra Corso, the Automobili Lamborghini competition division, will give Macau pilot a new opportunity for Macao Charles Leong Hon Chio, who was again selected to join the Italian -brand prestigious youth academy, the “Young Driver Program”
 
Charles Leong, who participates for the second year in a row in the Lamborghini Super Trofeo Asia, by SJM team Theodore Racing, currently leads the Pro category, with four wins in six races already played. This weekend, the territory pilot travels to South Korea to compete in the fourth race of the Sant'Agata Bolognese builder's Asian competition season, a small locality in the Emilia-Romanha region in northern Italy, between Modena and Bologna.
In a statement, the transalpina brand made known that, in all, selodes were pre-selected pilots of the various Super Trofeo championships and five of the various international GT3 championships, including Portuguese Rodrigo Testa, for the annual Lamborghini Squadra Corso program, which focuses on both track and outside performance. The twenty -one pilots will be accompanied and evaluated throughout the season, with specific analysis of their progression, consistency, experience, professionalism and ability to provide technical feedback. In addition, five additional pilots are part of Lamborghini's young professional pilots, receiving direct support from the factory in Sant'Agata Bolognese and Scola Federale ACI Sport, an entity managed by the Italian Federation.
The big news for the 2025 edition of the Young Driver Program is the selection process: it failed to settle only in age criteria, focusing on the most impressive pilots of the first two rounds of the year, based on a classification coefficient covering the three continental championships. The pilots were evaluated by Scoola Federale ACI-Sport chief instructor Niki Cadei, in collaboration with YDP consultants and official Lamborghini drivers Andrea Caldarelli (North America), who has already competed at the Macao Grand Prix, and Marco Mapelli (Europe and Asia), taking into account several performance indicators.
The results of qualification training and racing are thoroughly analyzed, such as track conduct, the pilot's post-end reports and the technical feedback provided to engineers and Squadra corse's technical team. The average score determines the final list of pilots selected for the decisive phase. A group of these young pilots will participate in a dedicated training camp at Lamborghini headquarters in Sant'Agata Bolognese, as well as at the final selection session in Misano. The best of the session will then receive support from Lamborghini Squadra Corso for the 2026 season.
Future is played in Italy
Among Super Trofeo Junior pilots, ten compete in the European series, while the rest come from the American and Asian championships. In addition to Macao's 24 -year -old pilot in Asian representation, Lamborghini also chose Singapore's Ethan Brown and Ireland's Alex Denning, which this year shares the steering wheel with Charles Leong to join this program.
Charles Leong will be evaluated throughout the season, and the final selection - whether or not to integrate Lamborghini's youth professional riders program - will be made in November at the Italian circuit of Misano, after the traditional closing of the Season of the various Super Trofeo, during the Lamborghini world endings. It is recalled that the winner of the Macao Formula 4 Grand Prix in 2020 and 2021 was part of this program last year, but was not selected. At the time, the final assessment took place at the Jerez circuit in Spain - an unknown layout, unlike his opponents.</description><pubDate>2025-07-20 15:23:35</pubDate></item><item><title>Great Bay Race learned more pilots for the GP</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/11/corrida-da-grande-baia-apurou-mais-pilotos-para-o-gp/</link><description>The GT Cup Races - Great Bay Race, integrated at the 72nd edition of the Macao Grand Prix, ended with a double journey at the Pingtan Speed Festival last weekend of June. Of the twenty -eight vacancies assigned by the first two GT Cup races, only one Macao pilot got a direct entrance at the great sports event of November.
Following the success of the two races played under the China Formula 1 Grand Prix, both 30 -minute races of the GT4 Chinese Championship had a total of 21 participants at the event held at the International Circuit of Lago Ruyi in Pingtan. This picturesque track, located in Fujian province, replaced the Zhuhai International Circuit, initially included in the provisional calendar released in January, but did not confirm the holding of his event.
In Pingtan's semiurban layout, Chinese pilot Han Lichao won both races behind his Toyota GR Supra GT4 EVO2. In two very lively races, Kevin Leong Ian Veng (BMW M4 GT4) was the only Macau pilot scoring, having reached a sixth and eighth place, respectively.
Although only one Pilot of the Misrem has guaranteed the direct determination, it is possible that more riders in the territory will align on the GT - Great Bay Race, integrated in the Macao Grand Prix. This is because only 21 pilots scored in these four races, which means that even if all these pilots are signed up for the guide circuit race, seven vacancies will still be filled.
In addition to Kevin Leong, seven other pilots from Macau - Miguel Law, Wong Cheng Tou, Fok Wai Ming, Lao Kim Hou, IP Un Hous, Wong Wai Hong and Law Kit Meng - participated in at least one of the two qualification events and may be repaired for local test if the sports committee's sports committee of the Macau Grand Prix so.
Among the riders are some known names of the region's motorsport, such as Darryl O'Young, double winner of the Macau GT Cup; Chen Weian, 12 -hour separate winner; Liu Kaishun, Chinese F4 runner-up; Daniel Lu, former Champion of the Porsche Carrera Asia Cup; or Luo Kailuo, winner of the GT Cup - Great Bay Race at Macao's 70th Grand Prix.
It's not over yet
This debut season, Sro GT Cup still has two more pointed events, the last, naturally, played in the iconic Guide Circuit. The competition, which has the support of the Macao General Automobile Association - China (AAMC), has reached its intermediate point, and the struggle for the title is in the red. Prior to the mandatory visit to Macau, from 17 to 19 October, the GT4 category cars will compete at the first event held on the streets of Yizhuang, in Beijing.
Beijing's Citadino Circuit is one of the most anticipated auto events in the Popular Republic of China and represents an excellent opportunity for Macao GT4 riders - and not only to prepare for the big challenge that are the curves and countercurns of the territory layout.</description><pubDate>2025-07-11 00:45:06</pubDate></item><item><title>Nürburgring Nordschleife is a new favorite stage of Chinese brands</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/01/nurburgring-nordschleife-e-novo-palco-predilecto-das-marcas-chinesas/</link><description>In the middle of the Eifel forest - in German, Eifelwald - Two cars with Chinese enrollment are parked in front of a hotel unit. The scenario appears to be intriguing at first glance, but it is not.
Nürburgring Nordschleife, in Rhineland-Palatinado, already close to the Belgium and Luxembourg border, has become the favorite stage of new Chinese automobile builders to show the world that they can also measure forces with their European, American and Asian rivals with regard to high performance vehicles.
Chinese automotive industry bet is strongly concentrated in NEVs - “New Energy Vehicles” - as part of the strategy for reducing pollution, reducing dependence on fossil fuels and boosting innovation in the automotive industry. China represented almost two thirds of global electric vehicle sales in 2024, and their builders, all relatively new, discuss Taco the Taco with the large traditional builders a piece of this appetizing market.
It is undisputed that the growth of sales of this type of vehicles in the world has not been accompanied at the same speed by the evolution of technology applicable to automobile sport, especially with regard to electric vehicles (EVs).
The World Formula World Championship and is the only truly global competition for electric vehicles, after the fiasco and the premature death of the FIA - FIA etcouring world cup. With no alternatives to affirm their everyday products on the tracks, Chinese brands headed in weight to Nürburgring Nordschleife, known to be one of the favorite places of European car manufacturers to test high performance cars.
The “green hell”, a name given by the legendary pilot Jackie Stewart due to its difficulty and the density of the surrounding forest, is a circuit with over 20 kilometers and 170 curves, combining fast lines, technical sections and sharp unenforcement. Many return records are measured here for sports and super -sports car cars, making Nordschleife an unavoidable reference to car performance.
Chapters for History
In 2017, Nio became known to the western world when it established a record with its EP9 electric supercar. The vehicle completed a circuit of 20.8 km in 6 minutes and 45.90 seconds, becoming the fastest production car at the time to travel the famous Germanic layout.
This feat has evidenced the ability of Nio and Chinese industry to compete with brands established in the high performance cars segment. Two years later, Lynk &amp; Co, the first Chinese brand to win a race in the guide circuit, with model 03 Cyan Concept, a high performance version of the Sedan 03, reached a time back in 7 minutes and 20,143 seconds, setting a new record for four -door cars.
Brands such as Zeekr, MG and Lotus passed the old stage of the Formula 1 German Grand Prix, until, in 2024, Xiaomi arrived with a crash. With a production version of the SU7 Ultra, it registered a time of 7 minutes and 4.957 seconds, surpassing rivals such as Porsche Taycan Turbo GT and Rimac Snowra. To keep up with the sales success of your car, the electronic technology brand was even further: Last month, the Su7 Ultra Prototype, built in partnership with Prodrive, reached an impressive 6-minute and 22.091 seconds, becoming the third fastest car of all time on the circuit, behind only the Porsche 919 Hybrid and Volkswagen ID.R.R.
These results from Xiaomi had a significant impact, both in the western and home press, as well as proof of the international affirmation of an industry that wants to be an undisputed leader with regard to Nev vehicles. On the other hand, Xiaomi took the opportunity to “surf the wave” and launched in the market a special limited edition of Su7 -all -how.
More will come
Nürburgring Nordschleife is part of the Chinese auto industry vocabulary and the trend is for an even stronger presence of Chinese brands in the coming years on the German track.
"I believe it was the decision of Xiaomi that brought greater attention to the definition of records back in Nürburgring," explained Chinese journalist Bruno Qi to HM. “With a huge media influence in China and a high profile CEO like Jun Law, Xiaomi attracted a significant focus on this scenario. After Nio's success, this was another strong performance of a Nürburgring high -performance electric vehicle.”
Xiaomi, which already names a bend of the German circuit, may want to improve its time back, while other Chinese brands seek to follow the trend - even to show off on a respected and good memories.
"Brands like Yangwang (BYD's luxury brand) have also sent their models for time attempts around," says Chinese publication journalist Bec Motorsport. “I think Chinese auto builders have now found a relevant opportunity to demonstrate the capabilities of their high performance electrical platforms, and this strategy is already helping to boost sales.” Also, at the end of the day, what weighs is what is sold.</description><pubDate>2025-08-01 01:14:03</pubDate></item><item><title>GP | FIA has already defined what the F4 World Cup will be like</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/25/gp-fia-ja-definiu-como-sera-a-taca-do-mundo-de-f4/</link><description>The Macao Grand Prix hosts the first edition of the FIA Formula 4 World Cup, between November 13 and 16 this year. The International Automobile Federation has published the Sports Regulation, which reveals some details about what will be the latest cup in the world integrated into the 72nd Macau Grand Program
 
Registration for the Formula 4 Macao Race - Formula 4 World Cup of the International Automobile Federation (FIA) is open until July 30, and FIA is the selection of the pilots who will participate. FIA responsible will have been pre-selected by the best Formula 4 national championship riders, also encouraging all the pilots interested in directly contacting the FIA and providing details of their sports history to be considered.
The final list of twenty pilots will be confirmed through an official invitation letter, taking into account the current classification of the pilots in the respective championships. The final selection should only be made public in mid -October, as is tradition in the guide circuit test.
At a time when behind the scenes, it is spoken of the possibility of increasing the minimum age of formula 4 to 16 years, the sports regulation stipulates that all pilots must be at least 15 years old, and the birthday is binding. An inscribed pilot may not have participated in more than two races of a championship with any type of monolugar that has been conceived and/or built to achieve a power-to-weight ratio of less than 3.0 kg/hp, which prevents participation in this riders running regional formula seasons or Formula 3.
The sports regulation does not specify technical details, but in previous communications, the FIA had already confirmed that Mintimes - organizer of the F4 Chinese Championship - will be the “unique operator” of the race, together with FFSA (Fédération Française Du Sport Automobile (FFSA), responsible for the world's cup technical support. In practice, all competitors will use Mygale M21-F4 singlesules, recently re-baptized as Ligier JS F422.
These formulas, equipped with 1.3 -liter Turbo Renault engines, will be rented to teams from the interior of China and operated by a single technical team - the same that organizes the French F4 Championship. Pirelli will be the exclusive tire supplier, as is the case with the Macao Grand Prix of Regional Formula and the FIA GT World Cup.
Although the official time of the event has not yet been released, it is known that the World Cup will feature a qualification race played over 8 laps, or at most 60 minutes, most likely on Saturday. The main race will be held on Sunday, with 10 laps or, equally, a maximum of 60 minutes. Prior to that, a 40 -minute free training session will take place, followed by a qualification session with the same duration.
PATACA AND POINTS
About 350,000 patacas in monetary awards will be distributed to the competitors present in this first cup of the world, with the winner of the main race to raise eight thousand US dollars. As a curiosity, all participants will receive three hundred dollars of participation-the same value attributed to the pole-position of Saturday's qualification race and the rider who reaches the highest tip speed during the event.
More important than the monetary awards, the FIA Formula 4 World Cup winner on the streets of Macau will win two points for the super license - points that may be decisive to access the restricted Formula 1 world. The winner will also be forced to attend the FIA awards ceremony, which will take place on December 12 in Tashkentão, USBekistan.</description><pubDate>2025-07-25 05:01:08</pubDate></item><item><title>TCR China | André Couto participated in the Zhejiang race</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/01/tcr-china-andre-couto-participou-na-prova-de-zhejiang/</link><description>Over the weekend, André Couto had an unexpected return to the TCR China Championship, in what was his first race of this season. The rider of the sgas showed that "who knows, never forgets", despite having had a troubled passage through the Zhejiang International Circuit
The Portuguese pilot residing in Macao, who has not competed since November last year-when he played the World Lamborghini Super Trofeo World Finals, having won the title in the Lamborghini Super Trofeo Asia Pro-AM category-received a last-minute invitation from MacPro Racing Team to conduct one of the Honda Civic Fl5 TCR Team in the third race of the Chinese Championship. TCR.
Without any previous workout, André Couto came back to sit in a car he already knew, also with a technical structure that was familiar to him. By 2023, the territory pilot had already played some TCR China events with this set, then at the service of the official team Dongfeng Honda Racing Team, showing a progress right from the beginning.
"Free training did not go wrong, but in qualification a less attentive pilot hit me on my first departure lap to the track. He hit me from behind and did not realize why. Damaged me the rear, dislocated the convergence and the car was crooked. Hm. "Still, I qualified myself in fourth in Q1, five tenths of the first, which, with the car in the conditions it was, was not bad. The car had potential."
In Q2, due to the damage, the Japanese car “became much harder to guide” and Couto ended in tenth. However, this ended up having a positive effect: “With the reversal of the starting grid, the tenth place of Q2 allowed me to start first to the second race.”
The first race, played on Saturday on the shaoxing track, did not go as well as the pilot wanted, not being able to follow the official links, nor the best Honda and Hyundai. "I ended up eighth. The car was not as good as I expected and we found that there was a damaged damper, still from the crash in the qualification, which was exchanged for the Sunday race."
Inglorius Sunday
In the 20 Sunday round race, André Couto had everything to shine as he departed from pole-position and Honda finally seemed in a position to fight for the first places. "On the way back, the car was good. I didn't feel strange anymore and I was optimistic."
The idea was to get well to distance themselves from the fastest competitors in the first laps and then manage the race with new tires. However, it all faded quickly when it was wrapped by Wu Yi Fan right in the brake for the first curve.
“That was my mission, but I couldn't,” acknowledged the winner of the 2000 Macao Grand Prix. “He hit me on the first curve and the car was damaged. Sports commissioners, but that does not change the fact that I have given up. ”
With Honda's damaged direction, André Couto had no choice but to leave. "I was a bit disappointed because I hope to get a good result for MacPro Racing Team that had given me a good car.</description><pubDate>2025-07-01 00:26:00</pubDate></item><item><title>GP | FIA AFINA REGIONAL Formula Rules</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/23/gp-fia-afina-regras-da-formula-regional/</link><description>The International Automobile Federation (FIA) took advantage of the holding of the Extraordinary General Assemblies and its annual conference to publish the Macao Grand Prix Regulation - FIA Regional Formula Cup of 2025. There are not many changes compared to 2024, but the changes introduced aim to browse gaps from the first edition of this competition in Macau
The twelve red flags during last year's qualification session raised the level of pilots at the Guide Circuit, which was the premiere of the FIA regional formula Cup in Macao. This happened after the controversial decision of the FIA to consider that Formula 3 was no longer adequate to the Macao Citadino layout.
Unsurprisingly, the sports regulation is now clear that, to compete in the FIA regional formula world, “all pilots must have participated at least 3 competitions with a monolugar that has been projected and/or built to achieve a weight/power ratio of more than 3.0 kg/hp.”
Emanuele Pirro, a former F1 pilot, winner of the Guide Race and president of the FIA monoligai committee, said during the weekend of the 71st edition that, in the future, the FIA will be more demanding about track discipline. Thus, from now on, “any pilot who, in the opinion of sports commissioners, is solely responsible for the display of a red flag during the qualification training session, will not be able to continue to participate in this session and its best time back can be annulled.” The new regulation also states that “if a qualification training session is interrupted with less than four minutes remaining, it will not be restarted.”
On the other hand, the FIA maintains the limit in the participation of more experienced pilots, except only “pilots who participated in a maximum of 3 FI F2 Championship competitions of 2025.” This measure goes a little against the spirit and history of the Great Prize, which has always gathered pilots from higher categories in its main race. In fact, this was a fervent question between Macao and the International Federation on two previous occasions.
In 1985, Alfredo César Torres, then responsible for Portuguese motorsport, convinced Jean-Marie Balestre, against his will, to allow the participation of F1 pilots in the F3 Intercontinental Cup in the name of the economic viability of the race. In 2016, the controversy returned with the veto da FIA to the participation of Nelsinho Piquet, a decision badly received by the teams and then coordinator Barry Bland, which would eventually abandon the co-organization of the race a year later.
Bet on continuity
In sports terms, registrations for this second edition of the FIA regional formula Cup will remain open until July 30. The grill may include a maximum of 27 Tatuus regional formula monologues, all equipped with Alfa Romeo engines built by the Italian Autotechnic. Pirelli will once again be the official tire supplier.
The identities of the invited teams have not yet been revealed, but some news is expected in this field compared to 2024. To avoid any behind -the -scenes disputes, it has already been defined that “the position on the boxes for the teams that participate in the Macao Grand Prix will be based on the ranking of the previous year” and, in turn, “the position in the roadway for new teams will be attributed based on the order of application.”
Equal awards and more restricted advertising
The values of monetary awards remain unchanged this year, with a total of US $ 68,500 to distribute, the equivalent of just over 550,000 patacas at the current exchange rate. The race winner will receive $ 12,000, an amount that is still far from covering the costs of participation in this nature.
On the other hand, the sports regulation introduces two new prohibitions on advertising into the monoligales. In addition to the existing prohibition of advertising to fortune or bad luck, tobacco or pornography, also the promotion of electronic cigarettes and alcoholic beverages - a measure that follows the legislation in force in the territory.
The 72nd Macao Grand Prix, the largest international sports event of the MSA, will take place between November 13 and 16, 2025.</description><pubDate>2025-06-23 03:31:16</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
