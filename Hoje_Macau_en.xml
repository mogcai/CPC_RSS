The protests began on August 25 in Jakarta, when a salary increase was announced for Indonesia deputies, in a context of serious economic difficulties for much of the population.
The demonstrations intensified after the death of a motorcycle taxi driver in the capital, on Thursday, run over by a police car, and so far have made six dead. International Human Rights Defense Organizations, such as Amnesty International, estimate that at least ten people died during the protests.
At least 20 people are missing, a local human rights organization said on Tuesday. Kontras stated that the 20 people disappeared in Jakarta and in the cities of Bandung, and Deceok, the latter located with the capital, as well as in a "unknown place."
Aposi at dialogue
President Prabowo Subiano announced on Sunday the revocation of various privileges for members of Parliament, including cost aid and a moratorium on business trips abroad. On Monday, the UN Human Rights Office asked the Indonesian authorities to guarantee the right to peaceful meeting and the freedom of information and expression in former state-state protests in the country.
"We emphasize the importance of dialogue to address citizens' concerns," said Cabinet spokesman Ravina Shamdasani, in a statement, stressing that authorities must ensure the maintenance of the order "according to international standards and standards."
Meenakshi Ganguly, the assistant director for Asia of the Human Rights Defense Organization Human Rights Watch, said on Tuesday that the authorities "acted irresponsibly in treating protests as acts of betrayal or terrorism, especially given the long historial of the unnecessary and unnecessary security forces."</description><pubDate>2025-09-04 00:07:40</pubDate></item><item><title>Legal Training | Kou Peng Kuan renovates and leaves leadership</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/03/formacao-juridica-kou-peng-kuan-reforma-se-e-deixa-lideranca/</link><description>Kou Peng Kuan left the position of director of the Legal and Judicial Training Center (CFJJ) on September 1 for being renovated.

The organism that studies the sector, under the raised Ministry of Culture and Tourism of China, estimates that the flow of residents from masters to the inside also increases
 
The Asia Tourism Exchange Center joined the choir of entities that estimate the increase in the flow of tourists between the special administrative regions and China in the second half of this year.
In a study published on Tuesday, the body under the authority of China's Ministry of Culture and Tourism provides for the annual increase of two digits in all forecasts on tourist entries in the second half of 2025.
The new study, which reviews the previous forecasts of the national entity, estimates that Macao will be visited by about 28.5 million tourists in the second half of this year. The new projection represents an increase in half a million tourists compared to the estimate made earlier this year, and a 16.4 percent increase compared to the same period of 2024.
On the other hand, the increase in the number of Macao residents entering China in the second half of 2025 is also foreseen. The central government -linked body points to an increase of 35.5 million to 37.5 million entrances to China, ie a 11.4 percent rise in annual terms.
Regarding the border flow between Hong Kong and the interior of China, an increase of 3.5 million Chinese tourists visiting Raehk is foreseen, compared to the initial estimate for 93.5 million visitors, a total that represents a 13.1 percent increase compared to the second half of 2024.
The Great Photography
Regarding the proportion of tourists per semester, the Asia Tourism Exchange Center estimates that in the general calculation of the tourist movement between the special administrative regions and the interior of China, the second semester occupies between 51 and 54 percent of the total volume of visitors of 2025, “if no sudden incident”. Analysts point out that the evolution of tourist flows follows the growth trend in the first half of 2025.
However, the rise review was justified by the implementation of facilitating measures at the level of border visas and crossings, as well as the performance of activities and attractive festivities in tourist terms. In this chapter, analysts highlight the next national games as another potential factor for the tourist markets of the organizing regions.</description><pubDate>2025-09-03 23:48:09</pubDate></item><item><title>Tourism | Portuguese gastronomy and culture in Wuhan</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/03/turismo-gastronomia-e-cultura-portuguesas-em-wuhan/</link><description>Heads Herlander Fernandes and Pedro Santos do Carmo will prepare a 'buffet' with Portuguese and macanese dishes during the Macau Week Gastronomic Festival in Wuhan
 
Folklore dance and Portuguese gastronomy will be part of a Macao tourist promotion action in downtown China, from 5 to 8 September, the authorities announced.
The Directorate of Tourism Services (STD) has indicated that Macao Week in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, will bring shows to a popular public square in the historic area of ​​Hankou, one of China's first places open to trade with abroad in 1861.
Among the shows will be the Portuguese Folk Dance Group Association of Portuguese Dances and Singing 'Macao na Coração', “to allow more people in Wuhan to feel the culture and hospitality of Macao,” added STD in a statement.
In the historic area of ​​Hankou, several thematic areas will also be installed, one of which will present products from Portuguese -speaking countries. Macao Week in Wuhan will also feature a gastronomic festival, which will take place between September 5 and October 8, in a Chinese city hotel, STD added in the same note.
Kitchen art
Two Portuguese chefs based in Macau, Herlander Fernandes and Pedro Santos do Carmo will prepare a 'buffet' with Portuguese and macanese dishes, indicated the STD, referring to gastronomy, considered the first fusion kitchen in the world, with many Portuguese descendants and roots in the territory.
Even before Macao's Week in Wuhan, STD, the Macao Trade and Investment Institute and the Special Economic Zone authorities of Hengqin (Mountain Island), located with Macao, will also promote cooperation with the province of Hubei.
The three entities will organize a business exchange session and event promotion conference to encourage entrepreneurs from both cities to “deepen the pragmatic exchange” in areas such as tourism, conventions and exhibitions, economics and commerce, STD said.
The Cultural Institute launched in December a public consultation, for 30 days, about the possible registration of 12 demonstrations, including the Portuguese folk dance, on the list of intangible cultural heritage of the territory.
In January, the IC said residents present at a public consultation session on January 7, “agreed, generally with the choice of recommended demonstrations for registration” on the list.
Last Thursday, ICM president and leader of the Cultural Heritage Council, Leong Wai Man, told Lusa that the council had, in a meeting, discussed the final report of the public consultation before the government made a final decision.
The government has advocated the need to bet on the provision of financial services between China and the Lusófono Block, to diversify the economy of the Chinese semi -autonomous region, very dependent on tourism.</description><pubDate>2025-09-03 23:45:05</pubDate></item><item><title>Public function | Song Pek Kei wants voluntary reform program</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/03/funcao-publica-song-pek-kei-quer-programa-de-reforma-voluntaria/</link><description>Given the “workloads and increasing pressures” in public administration, the deputy defends the creation of a pilot program that allows early retirement with greater financial security, in the case of health problems
 
Representative Song Pek Kei intends that the government implements a new experimental voluntary reform program for civil servants with health problems. The subject was approached through a written interpeação, released at the end of August to the Legislative Assembly.
According to the legislator linked to the Fujian community, due to “social development” civil service officials face “workloads and increasing pressures”. Therefore, it considers that there should be an early voluntary retirement option linked to health problems, especially for workers with lower wages and the lower positions of the hierarchy, which at the same time ensures “flexibility and financial security”.
"Even though some civil servants want to retire earlier for health reasons, leaving their positions means losing the security of livelihood," argues the deputy.
In the understanding of Song Pek Kei, the lack of an early retirement option for health reasons that guarantees financial safety "impairs the flexibility of the pension fund system and negatively affects healthy turnover within public service."
“Em resposta ao ritmo acelerado da reforma administrativa, as autoridades irão implementar um programa-piloto de ‘regime de reforma voluntária para funcionários públicos’ nos departamentos onde tal seja necessário, a fim de promover a mobilidade saudável dentro da função pública e aumentar a vitalidade da força de trabalho da função pública”, questionou.
Low reforms
Song Pek Kei also points out that the salaries of various civil servants are low and that they do not allow a reform consistent with a decent level of living. "Because civil servants with fewer length of service have low wages and their monthly contributions are limited, payments they can get from the Social Security Fund are very small, making it difficult to obtain practical protection for their life in reform," he said.
The legislature thus calls for extra protection for these people: "Although authorities have introduced several financial assistance programs for first -rate civil servants with low income, additional improvements in their reform protection are still needed," he justifies. "In this regard, management will reinforce the current reform protection system, for example, granting subsistence subsidies in reform to renovated junior civil servants," he asks.</description><pubDate>2025-09-03 23:37:12</pubDate></item><item><title>Public function | CE says to vote shows fidelity to the Mand</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/03/funcao-publica-ce-diz-que-votar-mostra-fidelidade-a-raem/</link><description>The civil service workers received a letter from the Chief Executive to appeal to the vote in the legislatures, indicating that vote is a demonstration of faithfulness to the MSAR.

The government is betting on reversing record abstention in the last legislative elections, repeating on several occasions the importance of suffrage to the Legislative Assembly (AL) of 14 September to the Macao Political Agenda.
Moreover, in various circumstances it was underlined by rulers and the chairman of the Commission of Electoral Affairs of the Legislative Assembly (Caeal) that this is the first election after the revision of the electoral law, and reinforces the principle "Macao governed by patriots". This was one of the points mentioned in the letter sent by the Chief Executive to all civil servants at MSAR.
According to TDM's Macau channel, Sam Hou Fai launched an appeal to all public administration workers to vote on September 14. “Being part of the governing team of MSAR, workers of services and public entities must actively respond to Caeal's appeal, diligently comply with their voting duty and encouraging family and friends to vote,” reads the taxpayer.
But in addition to the appeal to the vote, the Chief Executive states that “according to the Macao Public Administration Workers Statute (ETAPM), recently reviewed workers and public entities of all levels must defend the Basic Law and be faithful to the Fasome of the Popular Republic of China (RPC)”. Now, Sam Hou Fai adds that the "vote is precisely a relevant demonstration of the defense of the basic law and the faithfulness to the masters."
It should be noted that the statute that regulates the civil service establishes that “the public administration worker who, for proven facts, does not defend the basic law or is not faithful to the RPC MSAR, the penalty of dismissal is necessarily applied”.
Between
Not to mention directly the consequences of not voting, and although the vote is secret and the review of the ETAPM only comes into force on November 1 this year, the chief executive directly connects the vote to loyalty to the MSAR.
HM tried to understand if disciplinary consequences are planned, including dismissal, to civil servants who have not voted, or if there will be any vacation marking that covers election day, but even the closing of the edition were not received any answers.
In the letter, Sam Hou Fai also argues that voting is a contribution to the “stable and lasting implementation” of the “one country, two systems” principle, and that civil servants “must be planned in advance and actively participate on election day.
According to the Macao channel, employees were also asked to sign a document proving that they became aware of the content of the letter sent by Sam Hou Fai.</description><pubDate>2025-09-03 23:34:36</pubDate></item><item><title>Jorge Figueira, architect and academic at the University of Coimbra: “The Heroic Relations” of Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/03/jorge-figueira-arquitecto-e-academico-da-universidade-de-coimbra-as-relacoes-heroicas-de-macau/</link><description>It has long written and thinks architecture, and since time Jorge Figueira, architect, academic at the University of Coimbra, does it in Macau. After a session this week that highlighted the former Fai Chi Kei Public Housing Complex, Manuel Vicente, Jorge Figueira today approaches the Rui Cunha Foundation O Legado de Nuno Portas
 
Today participates in the Conference “Nuno Portas: From Architecture to Urbanism, from man to city”. What legacy did this Portuguese architect have left?
Nuno Portas is someone who in the late 1950s has a critical activity that is totally innovative and pioneering in the Portuguese context. Then, in the 1960s, he had a more international activity, having been the first to publicize the work of Siza Vieira. That's when he had the first contacts with Spanish and Italian architects, fundamentally. Also in these years he wrote two books that were also unusual, such as “Architecture for Today” in 1964, and “City as Architecture” from 1969. They were also an extraordinary way to try to catch what was going on in terms of international currents in architecture. But then there was also a [important] activity as an architect alongside Nuno Teotónio Pereira, namely in the work of the Church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, in Lisbon, and in a house in Vila Viçosa. Then, with April 25, 1974, he was appointed Secretary of State for Housing and Urbanism and launches the Saal - Outpatient Services to Local Support, a completely revolutionary social housing program, according to the spirit of the time. Then Nuno Portas devoted himself more to the issues of urbanism and not so much of architecture. He was linked to the beginning of Expo 98. It turns out to be someone who in the last 20 years of his work has more scientific and sociological concerns, and less artistic. It's something you had from the beginning, but then it becomes the hundred of your activity.
Did Nuno Portas have a relationship with Macau?
I think relationships would not be so intense compared to other architects and contexts, but we know that Nuno Portas was in Macao at the government's invitation to a conference between 2001 and 2002. It is interesting because of this passage we have echoes of what happened, as his surprise when discovering the Ellen Liang orphanage of Manuel Vicente, he did not know. It was the first work of Manuel Vicente in Macau, from the 60s, and we know that Nuno Portas was thrilled to visit this work, especially the small chapel that exists in the orphanage. It is interesting because there was no direct relationship between Manuel Vicente and Nuno Portas, they are very different poles figures, and even opposite. There is also an interesting and positive reference to the Siza [Vieira, Expansion Plan of the city of Macao (Areia Preta and Outdoor Port, 1982], and when Nuno Portas visits Macau is being built. It is interesting to have commented on this plan because in the 60s and 70s the relationship between Nuno Portas and Siza Vieira was no longer the same, and the fact that he had made complimentary references to Siza is very interesting.
He was a student of Nuno Portas. What other aspects of your career or personality can highlight?
I also worked with him. He was a cultured man, very intelligent and with an overwhelming memory. It was someone who liked to provoke, but in a good way, to discuss, to counteract. I was lucky enough to maintain a dialogue with him for decades, and this is my personal knowledge that I will convey. I also notice that it was a man very close to the power of Lisbon, the parties, but always very independent. He was a personal friend of Jorge Sampaio, he was secretary of state, but never had great political protagonism. On the one hand, this is due to his independence, but on the other he was such a controversial and intelligently restless figure that I think power was also startled by him.
This week also spoke at the “Lisbon, Porto, Macau, Maputo: Heroic Collective Housing from the 60s &amp; 70s” conference. How do you describe Macau's public housing projects in those years?
There are many architects that I could talk about, but I focused on Manuel Vicente's work in Macau, namely the public housing complex at Fai Chi Kei, which was demolished and then gave rise to the project of Rui Leão and Carlota Bruni. I did not speak concretely about Portuguese or Macanese architects, we also have names such as José Ways. Also because the Portuguese architects have always been few in Portugal, and from the 1950s there were about 150, then greatly increasing in number. But I made [at the conference] a tribute to the Portuguese architects who built during this period, because in a complex territory and with their vicissitudes, different from those that existed in Portugal, they knew how to do architectural experiences in the field of extraordinary public housing. I tried to demonstrate what was happening in Lisbon, Porto, Macao and Lourenço Marques, currently Maputo, in different ways. In Macao, relations were established, which I call heroic, in the sense that they were relations of experimental architecture, in which people had to adapt, to have their own spirit. These are architectures already with a little history, as it has passed 50 or 60 years, but the examples we find in these cities have continued to be remarkable.
What projects highlight these years?
I talked about Gonçalo Byrne's housing development “Pantera Pantera” in Chelas, Lisbon. I showed the “five fingers”, by Vítor Figueiredo, also from Lisbon, and the “Bouça neighborhood”, from Siza Vieira, in Porto. I showed Manuel Vicente's Fai Chi Kei complex and a Pancho Guedes project in Mozambique. Although they are already distant in time, these are architectures that remain fundamental references of the cultural and architectural points of view. There is a kind of narrative luck to be able to talk about such different sites, and with such different architects, and show how they had this heroic, experienced, even radical, experienced side that had the architecture of this particular period.
Has Macao had a positive evolution with regard to public housing supply?
I arrived in August and have been visiting the territory in recent years, so I have been following this process a little. Macao is obviously an extraordinary territory and from the outset by the coexistence of very different cultures regarding housing, which here has a completely different scale and expression of the Portuguese. In Portugal there is an aversion to public housing towers, it has always been unusual and the results that are known have not been successful for various reasons. But in Macao this is exactly what we see, public housing in towers and with a very strong expression. This has to do with the characteristics of the territory and also with a certain culture of China and Hong Kong. This is not to say that everything that is being built in Macau is good, there are towers and buildings with less interesting solutions or that result from a certain repetition. But there is no city that only has good architecture or good public housing. The challenge is to solve the large -scale housing problem, something that must be studied and thought. It is beautiful and overwhelming to see that Macau is a territory that grows day after day and it is exciting to observe this from the point of view of architecture. This is what I am doing, working on future projects.
Analysis projects, or academic?
Yes, I am a teacher and researcher at the University of Coimbra and columnist for the public newspaper, so my work is very much to analyze and investigate. I already published a lot about Macau and I want to resume some ends that I left to solve, let's say. I am very stimulated with everything I have seen and the people I have spoken with, and maybe I will increase my work on the territory from an academic point of view and at the plan of the investigation.
At a time when Portugal has a chronic housing problem, with a lack of public housing, could Macau be an example?
No directly, because of the typological issue of the housing tower. It might not be a welcome model in the Portuguese context. But no doubt Portugal needs to learn from other experiences and other territories and need to find solutions. Surely what happens in Hong Kong and Macau are experiences that are very interested in knowing, not to replicate, but to realize that this is a global problem [the lack of housing].
Remember Nuno Portas
The Rui Cunha Foundation (FRC) receives today, from 6.30 pm, the Conference “Nuno Portas: From Architecture to Urbanism, from man to city”, with Jorge Figueira. It will be time to talk about a route that the newly failed architect began in 1959, with a text about the new generation of the modern movement in Portugal. Texts followed in the 1960s and 70s with “scientific approaches”, with Nuno doors to a walk between architecture and urbanism, always in a reflective way. Nuno Portas was a “multifaceted figure, better known for launching the Saal Social Housing Program, which is still the target of investigation and an example”, describes Jorge Figueira in a note. The speaker is linked to the Center Social Studies and Department of Architecture of the University of Coimbra.</description><pubDate>2025-09-03 23:33:07</pubDate></item><item><title>Protests in the streets of Indonesia for the tenth consecutive day</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/04/protestos-nas-ruas-da-indonesia-pelo-decimo-dia-consecutivo/</link><description>Civil groups took to the streets yesterday for the tenth consecutive day in Indonesia in protest against the government, after violent demonstrations that have already made at least ten dead, according to human rights defense organizations.

Last weekend of September, the Urban Farm space, in the center of Coloane village, will host the event “Connections - Music.Movement.Nature”. This is a two-day event, taking place on September 27th and 28th, which brings together artistic activities, music and exercise, with yoga and pilates.
This is a “non -profit private initiative that aims to bring together different communities, offering music, family activities, body and holistic workshops, a food and beverage zone and a handicraft market with local breeders,” says a statement from the organization.
Those who are behind this event assume that “Connections” is a “collective creation that combines a conscious way of life with unique experiences”, and has been around since 2018 and 2019, years when the event took place with the Ka-Hó dam, also in Coloane.
However, the “connections” now moves to a larger space, which will allow several activities to be taken throughout seven distinct zones. They are the “Village”, described as “a picturesque area that resembles a traditional Chinese village, with wooden houses in an oriental garden”, which will be the meal and beverage and craft sales zone.
Here will be represented spaces for restoration of Macao, such as Larry’s Place, Concept H, Black Lotus, Cakes by Rose &amp; Muse, Juk and Happy Stand. There will also be 12 artisans to sell their products in the various wooden houses of “Village”: Dreama, Neska, Zarja's Selections, Ceragigi, Ododoodo, Dollfie, Wickd, White Lodge Dreamland, Wutoyeah, Lylon Skincare and Knotme.
"Urban Farm" will also feature "Gypsy Camp", a "zone with pillows and rest places in the shadow that promises to be an interactive offer, where participants will be able to explore musical instruments such as Asalato, participate in a circle of drums, or watch a Handpan concert with duo Nàv, which curates the area."
“It will also be here that one can attend the ritual of the fire, a lecture on spiritual themes and participate in individual sessions of tarot and soul reading,” explains the organization.
Families activities will take place at Family Tent, offering families meditation sessions, mandala drawings, crochet, building masks in cardboard and even interactive reading moments.
The organization intends, with the connections, to bring “the younger ones to participate in any activity that is taking place in the room, provided that it is accompanied by parents, and can also explore the offer of‘ Urban Farm ’, which provides fishing canas to fish and agriculture activities”.
Meditation tree
A zone that deserves prominence is the “Treetop”, a “mezzannine” built in the cup of a tree, and which was the space chosen for all body exploration activities and “more serene moments”, meditation and relaxation. With activities taking place in the morning to dusk, the “Treetop” will host dance sessions, with zumba, backed, conscious dance and insideflow, as well as yoga, gyrokinessis [Movement that mixes principles of yoga, dance and tai chi], and pilates. Sessing Sings of Sound Bath, exploration of mantras and meditations to sunset and connection with nature are also foreseen.
The “Urban Farm” also offers a “Yurte Mongol” [Typical Tent of the Mongolian Nomadic Peoples], a session of the “Quiz Nights”, which already happens regularly in Macao. "This is the first time that Quiz's night will be oriented in English so that more people can participate in the session," explained the organizers.
At the bottom of the Urban Farm property, in the “Concrete” zone, graffiti and urban art sessions are scheduled with the collectives of local artists Outloud International Street Art Festival and Mid Age of Dawn Skateboards (M.A.O.D.).

Wechayachai “filed a decree to dissolve the House,” France-Presse news agency Sorawong Thiienthong, secretary general of Pheu Thai, party of the first-rate minister last week, Paetongtarn Shinawatra.
Paetongtarn Shinawatra, daughter of the powerful tyksin Shinawatra, was deprived of the position of Prime Minister on Friday by the Constitutional Court. The former leader was suspended from office in July, on charges of not defending Thailand during a call with former Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen, who was released on the internet.
Pheu Thai had tried to negotiate the formation of a new government with the main opposition movement, the Popular Party, which has 143 places in Parliament.
This party succeeded the Move Forward Party (MFP), which won the largest number of places in the 2023 elections in Thailand. Move Forward, accused of the crime of Lesa-Majesty, was dissolved after campaigning to reduce military influence and reform the harsh laws of Thailand's Lesa-Majesty.
But the Popular Party announced support to conservative tycoon Anutin Charnvirakul, leader of the Bhumjaithai party to become the country's next prime minister. Bhumjaithai was part of the coalition in power, but withdrew support to Paetongtarn Shinawatra, due to the border dispute with Cambodia.</description><pubDate>2025-09-04 00:06:07</pubDate></item><item><title>Fire-to-Artifice | Contest illuminates skies on Saturday night</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/03/fogo-de-artificio-concurso-ilumina-ceus-na-noite-de-sabado/</link><description>The 33rd Macao International Fire Competition starts on Saturday with the pyrotechnic shows starred by the Australia and South African companies.

It was like this for example in paintings he made on the album Figures in Scenarios (ink and color on silk, 28.6 x 20.3 cm at the Oberlin University Museum, Ohio), such as on the page firing against the tide that refers to the legend that explains the name of a river in the province of Zhejiang, 'The curve of the river'.
In spring and fall, in a famous curve north of Hangzhou, the qiantang waters shock with the strength of the tides causing tidal tidal. To combat the consequent floods, King Qian Liu (852-932) would have ordered five hundred of his best archers who fired at the waves so that the construction of a dike could be finished, from where the qiantang river name, "The Qian Dike".

There are trips that only poetry allows, inner displacements that cross time and space and illuminate zones of our own memory. When we evoke Qui Yuan (屈原), minister and poet of the former state of Chu, in the fourth century BC, the image that rises before us is that of a lonely man walking by the millet river, declaiming verses impregnated with pain and restlessness, in a succession of steps that would inevitably lead him to the extreme gesture of throwing into waters. The legend went through more than two millennia, but it was the word that guaranteed her immortality, inscribing her voice in the deepest texture of Chinese literature.
The history of Chinese poetry is, to a large extent, the history of its response to the world in crisis. De Que Yuan, who sings exile as an ethical gesture and throws himself into the river, the poets Ming and Qing, who seek reunion with tradition in a ruined landscape, poetry emerges as refuge, resistance and reinvention. This essay runs through this crossing - between dragons and wine jars - to show how literary language remains, even in the darker times, a gesture of rescue of dignity and beauty.
Illustrations of "li sao"
In “lioso” (離騷, encounter with suffering), the experience of exile and political abandonment becomes one of the most intense spiritual trips of world literary history, where the poet's inner topography is confused with the mythical geography of the text. Its lament is not just personal: it echoes the tension between individual ethics and collective decay, the attempt to save a homeland by the purity of language. The poem, long and metamorphic, makes imagination a territory of resistance: Qui yuan wears orchids as if they were armor, reaps sacred plants to read fate, rides dragons and summons fenixes to accompany him. Reading li is means accepting the invitation to inhabit an injunction where myth and memory are mutually reflected, a territory where the intimate and cosmic are confused. The ancient illustrations of “Li Sao Tu” (離騷圖), recorded by Xiao Yuncong at the beginning of the Qing Dynasty, extend a well -known crossing of Chinese poetry, between the word and the image. In them, the poet appears immersed in enhanced landscapes, surrounded by rivers, mountains, spirits, dragons and flowers; Each trace of paint seems to respond to the rhythm of the poem's breath, not as a simple visual complement, but as an extension of the poetic experience itself. The engraving gives body to the unspeakable, crystallizing in a visible matter the error of the spirit that the text calls.
Perhaps this is why, more than two thousand years later, the name of Que Yuan continues to be invoked every year at the Dragon Boat Festival (Duanwu Jie 端午節). In the rivers of China, thousands of boats cross the waters, the Zòngzi are prepared and shared, the families gather to remember the poet who chose the word before silence. The rite perpetuates memory, the gesture becomes language, and poetry continues to cross time, calling us to a journey where the human recognizes himself in the Universal, where the wound of loss becomes the beauty of permanence.
駕八龍之婉婉兮 ， 載雲旗之委蛇。
忽臨睨夫舊鄉兮 ， 僕夫悲余馬懷。
“I conduct the eight dragons with soft elegance,
The cloud flags wave like dance snakes.
Suddenly glimpse my land in the distance,
And the coachman saddens, and the horse sighs longing. ” (my translation)
This excerpt from the extensive work is a moment of inflection on the visionary route of the poetic self, when, in the course of an ascension guided by celestial forces and wrapped in an intensely mythical imagery, the look turns - suddenly - to the past, or rather, to the land of origin, the lost homeland, which serves as ancholic identity of the lyrical subject. Even within a trip that, so high, threatens to break the ties with the world of men. The opening of the passage - 駕八龍之婉婉兮 - where the conduct of eight dragons with elegant gesture is affirmed, should not only be read as a representation of the poet's physical or spiritual elevation, but rather as the inscription of the subject in a symbolic matrix that refers to shamanic practices of crossing between worlds of Chu and its archaic ritual practices, where the number eight, associated with the Cardeal Directions and Balance Cosmic, and the figure of the dragon, an injunction par excellence, project the poetic self to one other dimension, beyond the empirical reality and subjected to distinct rules and forms of perception of ordinary logic.
By connecting this trip with the next verse-載雲旗之委蛇-where the “cloud flags” move in a serpenty ripple, the text accentuates the ceremonial and almost processional character of crossing, adding a nonlinear movement element, where the fluidity and the absence of directional rigidity suggest that the poet's path is not governed by a closed teleology, but rather by a form of a form of Intuitive displacement, analogous to ritual dance or the internal unfolding of an consciousness in a state of revelation, in which the material elements - the carriage, the dragons, the flags - cease to function as mere instruments and become full symbols, with poetic agency and metaphorical density.
It is precisely within this cosmic choreography, where the movement seems absolute and the detachment of almost consummated matter, which occurs the rupture described by the third verse - 忽臨睨夫舊鄉兮 - in which the verb “look” (睨), modified by the adverb “suddenly” (忽), returns to the poem a dimension of interiority that until then was dissolved in the grandiose environment of crossing. In turning his eyes on the “homeland” (舊鄉), the lyrical subject interrupts, even momentarily, his ascending progression, reintegrating into the visionary space the memory of an origin that is, at the same time, geographical, affective and political. This gesture of return of look should not be interpreted as sentimental nostalgia, but as a statement of the impossibility of a total separation between the poet's spiritual trajectory and the concrete world where his moral integrity has been wounded, being the same world - degraded, corrupt but unreenivial - that structures the central tension of Li.
The fourth and last verse - 僕夫悲余馬懷 - which describes the stall's commotion and the longing of the horse, completes the picture by subscribing to the poet's accompaniment an emotional echo dimension, in which auxiliary figures, traditionally devoid of interior agency, are affected by the melancholy inflection of the main subject, as if their emotion overflowed to the world around the world. This projection of interiority over the elements of the surroundings is not a mere poetic resource of dramatization, but rather a deeply rooted strategy in the cosmological conception underlying Chuci, according to which the individual's emotional microcosm is in permanent correspondence with the order of the universe, and where there is no true separation between subject and environment, between intention and manifestation.
The work li sao is considered so central that, to this day, it is recited at the Dragon Boat Festival (端午節, Duanwu Jie), in memory of the tragic outcome of Qui Yuan's life, whose legendary death is at the origin of the dragon boat festival. The gesture of launching rice balls into the river, according to tradition, will have emerged as a way to feed the poet's spirit - or distract fish so that they would not devour his body.
粽子 (Zòngzi) is a traditional glutinous rice cake, usually wrapped in bamboo leaves, typical of the dragon boat festival (Duanwu Jie 端午节).
Two thousand years later, the tone of Chinese poetry undergoes a deep transformation, although the memory of Quean continues to echo in the subtext of each verse. The crossing of the centuries leads us to the age of Ming (1368–1644) and Qing (1644–1911), a time when poetry abandons the cosmic and visionary lament of Chu to become increasingly a territory of aesthetic debates and exerts of literary affiliation.
Ming and Qing: poetry as a reflection
If in Que Yuan poetry is a visionary escape before political corruption, in the poets of the Ming era the creative gesture turns inward: the crisis is no longer just moral but literary. The challenge now is another - reinventing language without betraying the inheritance.
In li sao, the poet summoned dragons and fenixes to narrate the impossibility of living among corrupt men. However, late China poets were facing another dilemma: how to support a tradition of over a thousand years without sliding for repetition, how to reinvent the poetic voice in a universe already saturated with symbols, shapes and canons? The creative gesture, then, turns inward and poetry becomes aware of itself, crossed by a constant dialogue with the past, as if every new verse was born in the shadow of all who preceded it.
In this scenario emerges the figure of Li Panlong (李攀龙, 1514–1570), whose writing is built between the weight of inheritance and the need for renewal. Known by the name of courtesy (zi) Yulin (于鱗) and the literary name (hào) Cāngming (滄溟), was born in Lìchéng (歷城), in the province of Shandong, and belonged to a group of intellectuals who sought to restore the lost greatness of the Tang.
In the center of Ming Poetry, one of the most intense debates in Chinese literary history gains shape: on the one hand, the “previous seven masters” (Qiney 前七子), a group of poets led by Li Mengyang and He Jingming, who defended a deliberate return to the models of the Tang dynasty; On the other, the “seven later masters” (Hòu qīzi 後七子), represented by Li Panlong and Wang Shizhen, who, although equally devoted to tradition, sought a freer and more creative approach, where imitation was not simple copy but transformation. This confrontation is not limited to rival schools; In it is drawn a larger dilemma, shared by all the poets of the last China: how to write under the shadow of a monumental canon without getting lost in it, how to make a true voice be reborn in a saturated territory of voices.
The previous seven masters saw in Tang poetry, especially in Du Fu's work, the supreme model of formal and moral perfection. They believed that the revitalization of culture went through the return to the “ancient spirit” (Fugu 复古), an attempt to recover the ethical and aesthetic strength that the Tang had crystallized. The word was conceived as inheritance, and the poet, as guardian of this temple. In Li Mengyang's verses, for example, Du Fu's epic ambition reappears, but in a tone already crossed by a loss of loss, as if the evoked greatness was always a little out of reach, dipped in the bruma of collective memory.
The seven later masters, among whom I read Panlong distinguished, did not reject this dialogue with the past, but sought in repetition a creative gesture, such as an old paint layer to discover the hidden shine of the original trait. In his reading, imitating the classics did not mean repeating their form, but prolonging their vital energy. This tension between reverence and invention produces a poetry of great historical consciousness, in which each word seems to weigh with the memory of centuries and, at the same time, to open itself to the possibility of another future.
This aesthetic turn also translates a deeper transformation in the relationship of poetry with the world. If in Que Yuan the poetic gesture coincided with existential gesture-wearing orchids, setting up dragons, facing gods and monsters, until the last response is found in Rio-in poets poetry becomes, for the first time, a self-reflexive act. It is no longer only the mirror of landscape or politics, but a meditation on itself: the poem writes as it thinks the very act of writing, but, when looking back, each poet discovered not only the greatness of the ancients, but also the awareness that language can never return unscathed to the point of origin.
With the dynastic collapse and foreign invasion, the melancholy of Qing poetry is not just aesthetic nostalgia, but a response to historical displacement. Poetic tradition becomes an enneved mirror where one seeks, once again, sense in the midst of the loss.
It is in this space of travel that the Qing poets, heirs and, in a way, critics of the entire Ming project are also inscribed. Under the weight of the dynastic collapse and the Manchu invasion, Qing poetry carries a tone of even more pronounced melancholy, as if the past were an alive landscape seen from afar, untouchable and at the same time essential. The title-enhanced pavilions become a symbol of an aesthetic of the interval: what one sees is always filtered by the distance, the loss and awareness of historical fragility.
黃河水繞漢邊牆 ，
河上秋風雁幾行。
黃塵古渡迷飛輓 ，
白月橫空冷戰場。
“The yellow river serpes through the walls of the Han border,
On the river, fly autonal geese in vain rows.
In the ancient vau, the golden dust clutches the wagons in the escape / while the moon hangs pale in the cold sky like a battlefield. ”
(my translation)
Here there are no dragons or phoenixes, but dust and cold moon. The epic becomes a historical landscape, as if time had taught the poet to look at not to the heavens, but to the ruins in the ground.
Among his contemporaries was Li Mengyang (李夢陽), one of the famous “seven previous masters” (Qi firezi 前七子), who advocated a deliberate return to classic models, seeing in du Fu an inexhaustible source of inspiration. In his poem “The Look of the Autumn” (秋望), melancholy is projects in the signs of the passage of time and historical decay. They still feel the echoes of the epic grandeur that animated the ancients; However, this resonance is already filtered by a different sensitivity, more aware of the human fragility and the precariousness of the present. Unlike Que Yuan, whose rebellion culminated in absolute dive, Ming and Qing poets seem to write from a more subtle balance between reverence and disenchantment, a place where nostalgia becomes form and poetry itself becomes a dialogue with its own memory:
一瓶一笠一條蓑 ，
善操吳音與楚歌。
野鶴神清因骨老 ，
鴛鴦頭白為情多。
“A jug of wine, a bamboo hat, a straw cover,
I dominate the melodies of Wu and the songs of Chu.
The wild herons keep the spirit clear, for the bones have aged,
The Mandarins ducks clinked together with so much lived love. ”
(my translation)
Here poetry is no longer exile, but everyday pleasure. Qui yuan left for the ends of the world in search of justice, Yuan Hongdao, in turn, finds in the lightness of the instant and in the corner of the birds the poetic truth.
We cannot forget Yuan Mei (袁枚) of the eighteenth century, which defended spontaneity and personal sensitivity against excessive formalism. For him, poetry should be born from genuine emotion and not blind obedience to tradition. There are those who see in him a modern, almost romantic spirit, Avant La Lettre.
The contrast of course: qui yuan is poetry as a visionary trip, while ming-qing poets are poetry as a stylistic reflection. One escapes because there is no place for him; The others find a place in their own tradition and play it, reinventing it. Both, deep down, deal with the same restlessness: what to do when the world is not enough?
For Que Yuan, the answer was the mythical flight. For Yuan Hongdao, it was the wine, the singing, the irony. For Li Mengyang, he went to look at the ruins of the war with autumn eyes. Poetry, in all cases, is the space where the human measures over time, whether rising to heaven, or drinking by the Qinhuai River.
Today, as we read these verses, we feel both the dizziness of the sky of Quean and the melancholy of the ming and Qing minged pavilions. As in a world that also feels in crisis - political, climate, existential - we need both answers: the visionary escape that reminds us that we can still dream dragons, and the daily lightness that reminds us that a jar of wine and a song to resist.

The Dragon Boat Festival (端午節, Duanwujie)
Celebrated on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month, this festival resembles the death of Que Yuan. According to legend, the people of the region launched rice dumplings (粽子, zongzi) to the river to feed the spirit of the poet or distract the fish from his body. Today, besides the dumplings, the dragon-shaped boat race keeps alive the memory of the exiled poet who has become a cultural hero.
Shenyun (神韻) - the “spiritual resonance”
During the Ming and Qing, critics like Wang Shizhen argued that a good poem must have Shenyun, a difficult immaterial quality: something like the “spiritual breath” or the “atmosphere of the soul” that resonates beyond words. It was not just a technique or style, but a vibration that made the poem transcende. We could call him, in a free translation, the invisible music of poetry.
Gong'an's school (公安派)
Founded by brothers Yuan (Yuan Hongdao, Yuan Zongdao and Yuan Zhongdao), Gong'an's school reacted against classic formalism and defended individual expression, simple language and personal experience as a source of poetry. Yuan Hongdao, with his verses on wine, straw hats and wild birds, is perhaps the best example of this search for authenticity.
The fall moon and the heart of China
In numerous Chinese poems - such as Li Mengyang - The Moon of Autumn emerges as a symbol of melancholy, nostalgia and contemplation. It is not just light, but memory: the fall-filled moon coincides with the middle-oversight festival (中秋節), when separate families look at the same moonlight and feel gathered at a distance. To read these verses is to realize how poetry intertwines with rituals that still survive today.
The longevity of qui yuan
Curiosity: Although Qui Yan lived in the fourth century BC, his fame never diminished. In the twentieth century, the poet was recovered as a nationalist symbol in modern China, and is now celebrated as the first great Chinese poet "of individual consciousness." Your li is, in a sense, one of the oldest autobiographical poems in the world.
Between dragons and wine jars, qui yuan and Ming and Qing poets offer them two faces of the same truth: poetry is refuge and resistance, exile and reunion, visionary escape and serene melancholy. Read today, its strength is not exhausted in historical curiosity: it continues to challenge us, remembering that writing poetry is always to try to transform the world's insufficiency into lasting beauty.

There are trips that only poetry allows, inner displacements that cross time and space and illuminate zones of our own memory. When we evoke Qui Yuan (屈原), minister and poet of the former state of Chu, in the fourth century BC, the image that rises before us is that of a lonely man walking by the millet river, declaiming verses impregnated with pain and restlessness, in a succession of steps that would inevitably lead him to the extreme gesture of throwing into waters. The legend went through more than two millennia, but it was the word that guaranteed her immortality, inscribing her voice in the deepest texture of Chinese literature.
The history of Chinese poetry is, to a large extent, the history of its response to the world in crisis. De Que Yuan, who sings exile as an ethical gesture and throws himself into the river, the poets Ming and Qing, who seek reunion with tradition in a ruined landscape, poetry emerges as refuge, resistance and reinvention. This essay runs through this crossing - between dragons and wine jars - to show how literary language remains, even in the darker times, a gesture of rescue of dignity and beauty.
Illustrations of "li sao"
In “lioso” (離騷, encounter with suffering), the experience of exile and political abandonment becomes one of the most intense spiritual trips of world literary history, where the poet's inner topography is confused with the mythical geography of the text. Its lament is not just personal: it echoes the tension between individual ethics and collective decay, the attempt to save a homeland by the purity of language. The poem, long and metamorphic, makes imagination a territory of resistance: Qui yuan wears orchids as if they were armor, reaps sacred plants to read fate, rides dragons and summons fenixes to accompany him. Reading li is means accepting the invitation to inhabit an injunction where myth and memory are mutually reflected, a territory where the intimate and cosmic are confused. The ancient illustrations of “Li Sao Tu” (離騷圖), recorded by Xiao Yuncong at the beginning of the Qing Dynasty, extend a well -known crossing of Chinese poetry, between the word and the image. In them, the poet appears immersed in enhanced landscapes, surrounded by rivers, mountains, spirits, dragons and flowers; Each trace of paint seems to respond to the rhythm of the poem's breath, not as a simple visual complement, but as an extension of the poetic experience itself. The engraving gives body to the unspeakable, crystallizing in a visible matter the error of the spirit that the text calls.
Perhaps this is why, more than two thousand years later, the name of Que Yuan continues to be invoked every year at the Dragon Boat Festival (Duanwu Jie 端午節). In the rivers of China, thousands of boats cross the waters, the Zòngzi are prepared and shared, the families gather to remember the poet who chose the word before silence. The rite perpetuates memory, the gesture becomes language, and poetry continues to cross time, calling us to a journey where the human recognizes himself in the Universal, where the wound of loss becomes the beauty of permanence.
駕八龍之婉婉兮 ， 載雲旗之委蛇。
忽臨睨夫舊鄉兮 ， 僕夫悲余馬懷。
“I conduct the eight dragons with soft elegance,
The cloud flags wave like dance snakes.
Suddenly glimpse my land in the distance,
And the coachman saddens, and the horse sighs longing. ” (my translation)
This excerpt from the extensive work is a moment of inflection on the visionary route of the poetic self, when, in the course of an ascension guided by celestial forces and wrapped in an intensely mythical imagery, the look turns - suddenly - to the past, or rather, to the land of origin, the lost homeland, which serves as ancholic identity of the lyrical subject. Even within a trip that, so high, threatens to break the ties with the world of men. The opening of the passage - 駕八龍之婉婉兮 - where the conduct of eight dragons with elegant gesture is affirmed, should not only be read as a representation of the poet's physical or spiritual elevation, but rather as the inscription of the subject in a symbolic matrix that refers to shamanic practices of crossing between worlds of Chu and its archaic ritual practices, where the number eight, associated with the Cardeal Directions and Balance Cosmic, and the figure of the dragon, an injunction par excellence, project the poetic self to one other dimension, beyond the empirical reality and subjected to distinct rules and forms of perception of ordinary logic.
By connecting this trip with the next verse-載雲旗之委蛇-where the “cloud flags” move in a serpenty ripple, the text accentuates the ceremonial and almost processional character of crossing, adding a nonlinear movement element, where the fluidity and the absence of directional rigidity suggest that the poet's path is not governed by a closed teleology, but rather by a form of a form of Intuitive displacement, analogous to ritual dance or the internal unfolding of an consciousness in a state of revelation, in which the material elements - the carriage, the dragons, the flags - cease to function as mere instruments and become full symbols, with poetic agency and metaphorical density.
It is precisely within this cosmic choreography, where the movement seems absolute and the detachment of almost consummated matter, which occurs the rupture described by the third verse - 忽臨睨夫舊鄉兮 - in which the verb “look” (睨), modified by the adverb “suddenly” (忽), returns to the poem a dimension of interiority that until then was dissolved in the grandiose environment of crossing. In turning his eyes on the “homeland” (舊鄉), the lyrical subject interrupts, even momentarily, his ascending progression, reintegrating into the visionary space the memory of an origin that is, at the same time, geographical, affective and political. This gesture of return of look should not be interpreted as sentimental nostalgia, but as a statement of the impossibility of a total separation between the poet's spiritual trajectory and the concrete world where his moral integrity has been wounded, being the same world - degraded, corrupt but unreenivial - that structures the central tension of Li.
The fourth and last verse - 僕夫悲余馬懷 - which describes the stall's commotion and the longing of the horse, completes the picture by subscribing to the poet's accompaniment an emotional echo dimension, in which auxiliary figures, traditionally devoid of interior agency, are affected by the melancholy inflection of the main subject, as if their emotion overflowed to the world around the world. This projection of interiority over the elements of the surroundings is not a mere poetic resource of dramatization, but rather a deeply rooted strategy in the cosmological conception underlying Chuci, according to which the individual's emotional microcosm is in permanent correspondence with the order of the universe, and where there is no true separation between subject and environment, between intention and manifestation.
The work li sao is considered so central that, to this day, it is recited at the Dragon Boat Festival (端午節, Duanwu Jie), in memory of the tragic outcome of Qui Yuan's life, whose legendary death is at the origin of the dragon boat festival. The gesture of launching rice balls into the river, according to tradition, will have emerged as a way to feed the poet's spirit - or distract fish so that they would not devour his body.
粽子 (Zòngzi) is a traditional glutinous rice cake, usually wrapped in bamboo leaves, typical of the dragon boat festival (Duanwu Jie 端午节).
Two thousand years later, the tone of Chinese poetry undergoes a deep transformation, although the memory of Quean continues to echo in the subtext of each verse. The crossing of the centuries leads us to the age of Ming (1368–1644) and Qing (1644–1911), a time when poetry abandons the cosmic and visionary lament of Chu to become increasingly a territory of aesthetic debates and exerts of literary affiliation.
Ming and Qing: poetry as a reflection
If in Que Yuan poetry is a visionary escape before political corruption, in the poets of the Ming era the creative gesture turns inward: the crisis is no longer just moral but literary. The challenge now is another - reinventing language without betraying the inheritance.
In li sao, the poet summoned dragons and fenixes to narrate the impossibility of living among corrupt men. However, late China poets were facing another dilemma: how to support a tradition of over a thousand years without sliding for repetition, how to reinvent the poetic voice in a universe already saturated with symbols, shapes and canons? The creative gesture, then, turns inward and poetry becomes aware of itself, crossed by a constant dialogue with the past, as if every new verse was born in the shadow of all who preceded it.
In this scenario emerges the figure of Li Panlong (李攀龙, 1514–1570), whose writing is built between the weight of inheritance and the need for renewal. Known by the name of courtesy (zi) Yulin (于鱗) and the literary name (hào) Cāngming (滄溟), was born in Lìchéng (歷城), in the province of Shandong, and belonged to a group of intellectuals who sought to restore the lost greatness of the Tang.
In the center of Ming Poetry, one of the most intense debates in Chinese literary history gains shape: on the one hand, the “previous seven masters” (Qiney 前七子), a group of poets led by Li Mengyang and He Jingming, who defended a deliberate return to the models of the Tang dynasty; On the other, the “seven later masters” (Hòu qīzi 後七子), represented by Li Panlong and Wang Shizhen, who, although equally devoted to tradition, sought a freer and more creative approach, where imitation was not simple copy but transformation. This confrontation is not limited to rival schools; In it is drawn a larger dilemma, shared by all the poets of the last China: how to write under the shadow of a monumental canon without getting lost in it, how to make a true voice be reborn in a saturated territory of voices.
The previous seven masters saw in Tang poetry, especially in Du Fu's work, the supreme model of formal and moral perfection. They believed that the revitalization of culture went through the return to the “ancient spirit” (Fugu 复古), an attempt to recover the ethical and aesthetic strength that the Tang had crystallized. The word was conceived as inheritance, and the poet, as guardian of this temple. In Li Mengyang's verses, for example, Du Fu's epic ambition reappears, but in a tone already crossed by a loss of loss, as if the evoked greatness was always a little out of reach, dipped in the bruma of collective memory.
The seven later masters, among whom I read Panlong distinguished, did not reject this dialogue with the past, but sought in repetition a creative gesture, such as an old paint layer to discover the hidden shine of the original trait. In his reading, imitating the classics did not mean repeating their form, but prolonging their vital energy. This tension between reverence and invention produces a poetry of great historical consciousness, in which each word seems to weigh with the memory of centuries and, at the same time, to open itself to the possibility of another future.
This aesthetic turn also translates a deeper transformation in the relationship of poetry with the world. If in Que Yuan the poetic gesture coincided with existential gesture-wearing orchids, setting up dragons, facing gods and monsters, until the last response is found in Rio-in poets poetry becomes, for the first time, a self-reflexive act. It is no longer only the mirror of landscape or politics, but a meditation on itself: the poem writes as it thinks the very act of writing, but, when looking back, each poet discovered not only the greatness of the ancients, but also the awareness that language can never return unscathed to the point of origin.
With the dynastic collapse and foreign invasion, the melancholy of Qing poetry is not just aesthetic nostalgia, but a response to historical displacement. Poetic tradition becomes an enneved mirror where one seeks, once again, sense in the midst of the loss.
It is in this space of travel that the Qing poets, heirs and, in a way, critics of the entire Ming project are also inscribed. Under the weight of the dynastic collapse and the Manchu invasion, Qing poetry carries a tone of even more pronounced melancholy, as if the past were an alive landscape seen from afar, untouchable and at the same time essential. The title-enhanced pavilions become a symbol of an aesthetic of the interval: what one sees is always filtered by the distance, the loss and awareness of historical fragility.
黃河水繞漢邊牆 ，
河上秋風雁幾行。
黃塵古渡迷飛輓 ，
白月橫空冷戰場。
“The yellow river serpes through the walls of the Han border,
On the river, fly autonal geese in vain rows.
In the ancient vau, the golden dust clutches the wagons in the escape / while the moon hangs pale in the cold sky like a battlefield. ”
(my translation)
Here there are no dragons or phoenixes, but dust and cold moon. The epic becomes a historical landscape, as if time had taught the poet to look at not to the heavens, but to the ruins in the ground.
Among his contemporaries was Li Mengyang (李夢陽), one of the famous “seven previous masters” (Qi firezi 前七子), who advocated a deliberate return to classic models, seeing in du Fu an inexhaustible source of inspiration. In his poem “The Look of the Autumn” (秋望), melancholy is projects in the signs of the passage of time and historical decay. They still feel the echoes of the epic grandeur that animated the ancients; However, this resonance is already filtered by a different sensitivity, more aware of the human fragility and the precariousness of the present. Unlike Que Yuan, whose rebellion culminated in absolute dive, Ming and Qing poets seem to write from a more subtle balance between reverence and disenchantment, a place where nostalgia becomes form and poetry itself becomes a dialogue with its own memory:
一瓶一笠一條蓑 ，
善操吳音與楚歌。
野鶴神清因骨老 ，
鴛鴦頭白為情多。
“A jug of wine, a bamboo hat, a straw cover,
I dominate the melodies of Wu and the songs of Chu.
The wild herons keep the spirit clear, for the bones have aged,
The Mandarins ducks clinked together with so much lived love. ”
(my translation)
Here poetry is no longer exile, but everyday pleasure. Qui yuan left for the ends of the world in search of justice, Yuan Hongdao, in turn, finds in the lightness of the instant and in the corner of the birds the poetic truth.
We cannot forget Yuan Mei (袁枚) of the eighteenth century, which defended spontaneity and personal sensitivity against excessive formalism. For him, poetry should be born from genuine emotion and not blind obedience to tradition. There are those who see in him a modern, almost romantic spirit, Avant La Lettre.
The contrast of course: qui yuan is poetry as a visionary trip, while ming-qing poets are poetry as a stylistic reflection. One escapes because there is no place for him; The others find a place in their own tradition and play it, reinventing it. Both, deep down, deal with the same restlessness: what to do when the world is not enough?
For Que Yuan, the answer was the mythical flight. For Yuan Hongdao, it was the wine, the singing, the irony. For Li Mengyang, he went to look at the ruins of the war with autumn eyes. Poetry, in all cases, is the space where the human measures over time, whether rising to heaven, or drinking by the Qinhuai River.
Today, as we read these verses, we feel both the dizziness of the sky of Quean and the melancholy of the ming and Qing minged pavilions. As in a world that also feels in crisis - political, climate, existential - we need both answers: the visionary escape that reminds us that we can still dream dragons, and the daily lightness that reminds us that a jar of wine and a song to resist.

The Dragon Boat Festival (端午節, Duanwujie)
Celebrated on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month, this festival resembles the death of Que Yuan. According to legend, the people of the region launched rice dumplings (粽子, zongzi) to the river to feed the spirit of the poet or distract the fish from his body. Today, besides the dumplings, the dragon-shaped boat race keeps alive the memory of the exiled poet who has become a cultural hero.
Shenyun (神韻) - the “spiritual resonance”
During the Ming and Qing, critics like Wang Shizhen argued that a good poem must have Shenyun, a difficult immaterial quality: something like the “spiritual breath” or the “atmosphere of the soul” that resonates beyond words. It was not just a technique or style, but a vibration that made the poem transcende. We could call him, in a free translation, the invisible music of poetry.
Gong'an's school (公安派)
Founded by brothers Yuan (Yuan Hongdao, Yuan Zongdao and Yuan Zhongdao), Gong'an's school reacted against classic formalism and defended individual expression, simple language and personal experience as a source of poetry. Yuan Hongdao, with his verses on wine, straw hats and wild birds, is perhaps the best example of this search for authenticity.
The fall moon and the heart of China
In numerous Chinese poems - such as Li Mengyang - The Moon of Autumn emerges as a symbol of melancholy, nostalgia and contemplation. It is not just light, but memory: the fall-filled moon coincides with the middle-oversight festival (中秋節), when separate families look at the same moonlight and feel gathered at a distance. To read these verses is to realize how poetry intertwines with rituals that still survive today.
The longevity of qui yuan
Curiosity: Although Qui Yan lived in the fourth century BC, his fame never diminished. In the twentieth century, the poet was recovered as a nationalist symbol in modern China, and is now celebrated as the first great Chinese poet "of individual consciousness." Your li is, in a sense, one of the oldest autobiographical poems in the world.
Between dragons and wine jars, qui yuan and Ming and Qing poets offer them two faces of the same truth: poetry is refuge and resistance, exile and reunion, visionary escape and serene melancholy. Read today, its strength is not exhausted in historical curiosity: it continues to challenge us, remembering that writing poetry is always to try to transform the world's insufficiency into lasting beauty.

The Australian Institute of Marine Sciences, of the government, documented the condition of 124 reefs between August 2024 and May 2025 to determine the widespread coral lanchament in the three sections of the Greater Barrier.
The impact is higher in the northern areas (Cape York to Cooktown), with a 24.8 percent decline compared to the 2024, and southern levels (proserpine to gladstone), with 30.6 percent, representing these two values ​​“the largest annual decline in coral cover” in 39 years.
In the central region (cooktown to proserpine), the decline recorded is 13.9 percent compared to last year. The last episode of bleaching on site, declared UNESCO's World Heritage Site, has a "high to extreme" prevalence in all three areas, scientists find in the report.
“Individual reefs registered a decline of corals of up to 70.8 percent” near Lizard Island in the North Zone, it refers to the study. The death of the corals, manifested by its bleaching, is caused by the impact of water heating - temperatures were recorded one to 2.5 degrees Celsius above average during the southern summer of 2025 - associated with the climate crisis.
The large coral barrier “experienced unprecedented levels of thermal stress, resulting in the most extensive and severe bleaching that there is registration to date”, read in the document, in reference to the phenomenon that occurred in 2024 and continued during the first months of this year.

This is how the executive in the neighboring region describes the business environment in the region, where they were created in 2024 about 4,700 startups, plus 10 percent of 2023. In the "Report of Hong Kong's Business Environment 2025" it is read that the territory is far from losing economic competitiveness
 
The Hong Kong government released last July 30 the latest report on the neighboring region's economic scene. And one of the highlights is given to the scenario of growth of entrepreneurship.
In the “Report of Hong Kong’s Business Environment 2025” [Hong Kong 2025 Business Environment Report] it is noteworthy that “Startups in Hong Kong are on the rise”, given that last year there were “about 4,700 startups in the city, a historic record and an increase of 10 percent from the previous year”.
The document explains that "more than a quarter of these startups has founders from outside Hong Kong," it is companies that operate in a "broad spectrum of sectors, including Fintech [High Technology], Electronic Trade and Information, Informatics and Technology", having hired more than 17,000 people. This number of human resources also represents an increase of seven percent compared to 2023. "All this is proof of Hong Kong's strong appeal for startup entrepreneurs," the authorities highlight.
But it is not only startups that record growth, with the report to point out that the current government, led by executive head John Lee, "achieved remarkable results in attracting companies, investments and talents."
"For example, in 2024, the number of companies in Hong Kong with headquarters outside the territory increased significantly by about 10 percent, reaching almost 10,000." The “Office for the attraction of strategic companies, created more than two years ago, attracted 84 strategic companies to establish or expand their business in Hong Kong, including companies with market capitalization or valuation of over $ 10 billion, involving cutting -edge technology”, it is added.
The report also points out that between January 2023 and the first half of this year, Invest Hong Kong, linked to the Raehk government's direct foreign investment department, "helped over 1300 foreign and continent companies establishing or expanding their business in Hong Kong, bringing investments of over $ 160 billion."
Still with regard to Invest Hong Kong, the entity helped "539 companies from the continent or foreign to establish or expand their business in Hong Kong, which represents an annual growth of over 40 percent."
At the end of June this year, Hong Kong had 1.5 million local businesses, while the total number of companies not registered in Hong Kong reached 15 509. "Both figures represent historical records," it reads, and for the government of the neighboring territory the data "demonstrate the great confidence that companies in the continent and abroad have in the future of Hong Kong."
Given that Hong Kong also has a talent capture program, the Hong Kong Talent Engage, reads in the report that by June this year "were received about 500,000 candidates in the shelter of various talent admission programs, of which about 330,000 were approved." Of these numbers, Hong Kong actually arrived to work 220,000 qualified frames.
Good scholarship scenario
Quoted on an official press release, a government spokesman stated that "in a complex and volatile external environment, Hong Kong is undergoing a phase of economic update and transformation, but there are more opportunities than challenges."
Given that the territory has always positioned itself as a strong financial market worldwide, this scenario seems to have recorded a recovery in recent years.
“This year Hong Kong's financial market performance has been constantly improving. The Hang SENG Index has a 18 percent increase last year and an increase of more than 25 percent this year so far. The average daily business volume in the first half of the year was about $ 240 billion, with an increase of about 120 percent.”
Authorities highlight the maintenance of the economic competitiveness of the territory, pointing out that "over the years Hong Kong has been constantly classified as a global leader in economic freedom and competitiveness."
Attention to the trade war
In conclusion, Raehk's government clarifies that territory seems to maintain economic stability in times of constant commercial conflicts, with Donald Trump threatening and imposing tariffs on a number of countries.
“As volatile and turbulent as the world may be, we remain firmly committed to the rules -based multilateral commercial system, with the WTO [World Trade Organization] as a nucleus, while actively participating and supporting regional economic cooperation.”
The “numerous advantages of Hong Kong” are referred to, with its “highly internationalized business environment, a flexible and solid financial system, a simple and secure tax regime with low tax rates and a robust and independent legal system”.
However, in the document it is also stressed that the “tariff war caused a global relocation of capital”, and Hong Kong wants to bet on the attraction of “foreign companies and capital” to the region.
The report also tells that "international organizations and foreign trade chambers in Hong Kong are confident in the future perspectives" of the territory, and that for the authorities "there is no reason to worry about some excessively pessimistic feelings."
"In fact, the Raehk government is creating a new momentum and expanding the ability to support Hong Kong's economic growth, thus increasing its overall competitiveness and achieving high quality development," is still added.
The executive spokesman also established a parallelism between good economic situation and political stability. "In recent years, the implementation of the National Security Law has restored a stable social environment in Hong Kong. This not only protected the rights and freedoms of the general public, but also made Hong Kong a safe haven to attract international capital and investment," he concluded. The report was presented by the secretary for Hong Kong finances, Paul Chan.</description><pubDate>2025-08-06 23:29:13</pubDate></item><item><title>Rain | HK alerts and more than 80,000 residents of Beijing removed from home</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/06/chuva-alertas-em-hk-e-mais-de-80-mil-residentes-de-pequim-retirados-de-casa/</link><description>China and Hong Kong have faced periods of heavy rainfall in recent days that have forced extra care and residents' travel. In the Chinese capital 82,000 people had to leave their homes, while in Hong Kong streets and a hospital suffered floods and some subway stations were closed
 
Strong rains continue not to give respite, not only in Macau (see page 7), but in Hong Kong and in the interior of the country. In the case of China, Beijing authorities moved more than 82,000 people from home due to torrential rain, a week after deadly floods that led those responsible for recognizing failures in the response, the official news agency Xinhua said yesterday.
Thus, tens of thousands of residents were removed from the most affected areas by rain until 9 pm on Monday, local time, according to the Municipal Flood Response Center. The center warned of the high risk of floods in the districts of Miyun (northwest), Fangshan (southwest), lied (west) and Huairou (north).
The Chinese capital kept in force the red alert-the highest-until yesterday morning, before predictions of heavy rain between Monday and the morning of Tuesday.
Last week, these same rural districts north of Beijing were the most affected by the weather that caused 44 dead and nine missing, according to official data. Most of the deadly victims were registered in a home of elderly in Miyun.
New measures in agriculture
The severity of the catastrophe led municipal authorities to recognize “gaps” in the preparation of emergency services. Natural disasters are frequent in China during summer, with some regions subject to torrential rainfall and others to severe droughts.
However, the Chinese authorities have reinforced the device to respond to the adverse effects of intense rainfall and heat waves on agricultural crops in various regions of the country, at a crucial time for autumn harvesting.
Since the beginning of the rainy season, east and northern China areas have recorded episodes of extreme precipitation, while provinces such as Henan (Center) and Anhui (East) face prolonged periods of drought and high temperatures.
This combination of meteorological phenomena represents a challenge for farmers, especially when about two months left to harvest the main autumn cereals, yesterday pointed out the Xinhua official news agency.
In the province of Shaanxi (Center), where precipitation recently exceeded 100 millimeters in less than 24 hours, local authorities adopted preventive measures such as channel cleaning and reinforcement of dikes, which allowed to protect most of the cultivated lands.
However, Henan agricultural cooperatives affected by drought opted for gout watering systems and localized application of fertilizers to conserve moisture and minimize losses.
Authorities have given priority to the rehabilitation of water infrastructure and the dissemination of efficient water management techniques in the absence of precipitation in some areas. The autumn campaign represents a fundamental component of China's annual cereal production.
In a statement issued yesterday, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs warned that weather conditions in the coming weeks will be determining and appealed to "all efforts to protect the harvest and give strong support to the country's food security."
Chinese President Xi Jinping said in 2023 that, although “1,400 million Chinese eat well” currently, “the food issue should not be careless”, stressing that the supply of food “is not an insignificant issue”.
China has less than nine percent of the planet's aurable land, although it represents about 18 percent of the world's population. In the last summers, weather disasters have caused significant damage in the country: the 2023 scirred months were marked by flooding in Beijing, which caused more than 30 dead, while by 2022 several extreme and dried heat waves hit the center and east of China.
Hong Kong on Alert
With regard to the panorama of heavy rains in neighboring territory, they have not given respite either. According to public broadcaster RTHK, some hong Kong stations were closed yesterday due to the risk of flooding, given that the Hong Kong Observatory kept the black signal of storm [Black Rainestorm Warning Signal] until around 17 hours.
Winds of about 110 kilometers per hour were recorded in some areas of the territory, and thunderstorms were also registered. The rthk channel also reveals that more than 10,800 lightnings were counted in the territory between midnight and 10 am yesterday, half of them occurred on Lantau Island.
Until 11 am yesterday, the authorities responsible for the drainage systems recorded 21 episodes of flooding, and 180 emergency responses were made in 240 different locations.
Highlight for the occurrence of an episode at Queen Mary Hospital this Tuesday, namely “on some roads” hospital access in Pok Fu Lam, and patients were displaced by firefighters to Ruttonjee Hospital in the Wanchai area. In some zones of the hospital the water reached the knees, and sand bags were placed to stop the flow of the rains. At about 11 am yesterday this scenario was resolved, with the normal one returning to the Queen Mary Hospital near noon.
The rains also led to the large increase in water level in the Lower Shing Mun reservoir in the Shaan area, which led to the notification of nearby housing complexes, such as Mei Lam Estate, May Shing Court, Mei Chung Court and Granville Garden.
Despite the heavy rains, some people went to work normally doing alternative routes. This was the case of Mak, a woman who, to the RTHK channel, said she had to make a deviation to get to the office. “I couldn't go straight to there and had to make a longer route. The metro [mtr] made some warnings [about the storm and closures], but I would like them to do them in the carriages as well, because I only realized that access was closed when I got to the exit,” he described.
The sun
Information provided by the Hong Kong Observatory speaks of the passage of an active "southwest monsoon and high altitude disturbances that are bringing heavy rainfall and violent thunderstorms to the southern coast of China and the northern part of the southern China Sea."
Yesterday the highest daily precipitation record was broken to August since 1884, upon registered, until 14h, 355.7 millimeters of precipitation at the Observatory's headquarters.
For today time should stay unstable in Hong Kong, with “heavy rains at the beginning” of the day. However, these "should gradually decrease" tomorrow, expected "a lot of heat with sunny periods in the next two days."
Also the Meteorological and Geophysical Services (SMG) leave a heavy rain alert to this day with “frequent, sometimes intense, thunderstorm”. The sun is expected to start appearing at the MSAR from tomorrow, still with some clouds, extending this weather scenario until next Monday. Temperatures should reach 33 degrees.</description><pubDate>2025-08-06 00:29:54</pubDate></item><item><title>Green Island | Uncertainties surrounding the recovery of the Jesuit convent</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/02/ilha-verde-incertezas-em-torno-da-recuperacao-do-convento-jesuita/</link><description>Hidden in the middle of the hill, the Verde Island Convent is still waiting for full recovery. The place was recently the scene of an experimental film festival, demonstrating potentialities to add a new cultural space to the city. However, the owner complains of high costs and financial difficulties
 
Speaking of the half -abandoned and empty walls of the Green Island Convent, located in the small hill in the northern zone of the peninsula, implies retreating to the early days of Portuguese presence in Macao and the Jesuits, namely the mid -17th century. By this time, Macau was already a territory of trade between Portuguese, foreigners and Chinese, entering the Asian Route of the Specialty Trade and other raw materials.
Only then can it be understood the importance of this classified building that is on land with private property. The Cultural Institute (IC) wants to see the building renewed in partnership with the owner, after years and years of a lawsuit dragged in the courts between two companies to prove the true property of the land.
Despite the almost abandonment, the Green Island Convent hosted this summer an outdoor movie festival, showing the potential of the place as a new cultural space. The event in question was the Macau Experimental Film Festival, organized by the CUT Audiovisual Association.
At HM, festival curator Keng U Lao explained that “space is currently being the target of renewal works”, and that for the festival the garden zone was used and “some rooms of the building”.
For the official, the Green Island Convent "is a fantastic place for cultural events, and both owners and the team were incredibly welcoming and helpful."  Photo: CUT Association
The curator of the Film Festival understands that the convent is "a jewel that few places have visited", having been "closed for over a decade." "Perhaps this is the reason our audience was so enthusiastic to watch the closing event and explore the space, because we had exhausted capacity," he said.
According to Keng U Lao, and taking into account the experimental nature of the festival, it was sought to “use the spaces available for projections, performances and audiovisual facilities, allowing the intersection with the unique architecture of the site”.
For the curator, the Green Island Convent could be “an excellent place for cultural events, including visual arts exhibitions, shows, musical events and film sessions”.
Conflict with mandarins
In 1618 a conflict began between the Company of Jesus, which was already headquartered on Verde Island in this convent, and the local Chinese authorities, due to the use of space by the Portuguese Jesuits. It is a conflict that, according to the work “Macao: Power and Knowledge-16th and 17th centuries”, only ends on February 3, 1621 when the Senate intervenes, completely remedy on August 14 of the same year, continuing the Jesuits to live on Verde Island without, however, affirming themselves as owners of something.
The historian describes that the Jesuits were able to remain "with authorization from the mandarins and without complaining the possession", and before July 1621 occurred "the demolition of buildings by order of the Chinese district authorities."
More than a handful of old walls, in the Convent of Green Island is part of the activity and presence of the Jesuits in Macao, as well as political issues that always marked the territory, namely those who exerted sovereignty about Macao.
“The episode of Green Island is exemplary to several titles, but above all it serves to show to what extent is the Macao oligarchy and to what extent the Senate can intermediate conflicts between district and regional Chinese powers (…)”, reads in Luís Filipe Barreto's book.
Over the years, the convent and adjacent terrain have been running from hand to hand until they came to those of Jack Fu, who managed to see in court in 2022, the property of the convent by his development company Wui San.
At the time of the judicial victory, Jack Fu regretted that "the process has elapsed so slowly," it is a "dispute that took place for more than ten years." Faced with journalists, Jack Fu promised to find “balance between development and space preservation”.
Financial difficulties
HM sought to know what has been done since then. It is clear that they remain uncertainties about the future of space, with many budgetary issues to the mixture. Some works have already been done entirely supported by the Wui San Development Company, but a long -term strategy is missing.
"The IC requires the restoration of the convent in its original state," said Jack Fu. "We have done our best and in these years [since 2022] the company has done many things. If the convent has to be all restored in its original state I can not evaluate how much money will cost because our company's [financial] capacity is limited. I think it can cost between dozens and up to 100 million [of Patacas]," he said.
Thus, the tasks that the Wui San Development Company has been doing since 2022 have the removal of waste, recovery from some infrastructure and destruction of illegal constructions or that were at risk of falling. It should be noted that the old convent, at a time when his property was defined, came to house construction workers who rented rooms, living in precarious conditions.
"We were maintaining various spaces according to our ability, but we could not restore the convent completely to its original state," he said.
Jack Fu says he spent to date “between 10 and 20 million [Patacas]” in the recovery of some convent zones, unable to advance with a date for the complete restoration. "It all depends on the financial situation and if there is enough capital. It may be within two or three years, but if the government is dependent on the repair only by the private to take this great value is impossible," he warned.
The landowner said that the IC suggested to the company to run for the financial support plan for the benefit of historical buildings to obtain "a two million patacas allowance in a maximum of two years."
"But this value won't relieve the problem," said Jack Fu, who fears that the renewal process has dragged on for years.
"That's why we proposed an exchange for a specific plan or resolution," noting that "the progress of restoration is slow and the authorities just ask for recovery, not worrying about the costs we will have," he adds.
Jack Fu also warns that the legislation and the Macao Director Plan contribute to further delay the renewal. “The government is working at the North Planning and Management Operative Unit - 1 and we don't know more information. As everything has to be according to this plan we can only present opinions. We have proposed several opinions to the authorities who can accept them or take into account in the future.”
Works ending in 2024
On the part of the IC, it was mentioned, in a response sent to HM, that the Green Island Hill where the convent is "is a classified place, being the land of private property." “Over the years, and under the terms of the cultural heritage safeguard law, IC has diligently supervised, coordinated and promoted compliance with the responsibilities inherent to the owners regarding preservation and management, as well as the execution of necessary repairs and maintenance”, is referred to.
Remembering the “illegal occupations that the hill suffered for several, which made it difficult to develop the planned protection actions”, the IC asked “the owners to carry out urgent repair and reordering works”, and they were “completed in early 2024”.
The works of Jack Fu were made “according to the requirements of the IC” and go through the “restoration and renewal of walls, windows, roof and columns of the retreat house”.
As for the future use of space, as it is in the private forum, it will be up to IC to request opinions, and "the body will pronounce within the protection of cultural heritage."
For Jack Fu, the Green Island Convent could be “a basis of sino-widening cultural exchange, according to the country's requirements to Macau and the current situation” of the territory. "What we said to the government is that Macau is a world center of tourism and leisure, but here is a cultural tourism complex where tourists can walk and stay a day or two, so this space can play this role, as it has the advantage of being close to three border posts," he said.
For now, and separate the high costs to rebuild all this, Jack Fu is confident. “The development of the [Green Island] Zone has not started and only now the provisional fuel deposit will change its location. If it is including our land, there are conditions for a large complex of cultural tourism.”</description><pubDate>2025-09-02 00:59:30</pubDate></item><item><title>Portuguese knight bets on the formation of competition horses in China</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/17/cavaleiro-portugues-aposta-na-formacao-de-cavalos-de-competicao-na-china/</link><description>Report by João Pimenta, Agência Lusa
Step, trot and gallop: On a farm outside Beijing, Portuguese João Ruas training six horses daily to the practice of Dressage, an equestrian Olympic discipline that seeks to expose the maximum of the animal's athletic capabilities.
“It's a very very relationship,” he described to Lusa the Knight, a native of Lisbon. "There are days when we are almost like a father to teach the son, others where it is the horse that teaches us to us. But there must always be mutual respect," he said.
Streets, 28, arrived in China a year ago to raise six horses and form Dressage on a farm in Shunyi, the district in northeastern Beijing where the villages and agricultural fields resemble the interior of China than the capital of 22 million.
Ten kilometers from the Huairou reservoir, a 12 -kilometer artificial lake that supplies Beijing and regulates the flow of local rivers, the fifth is surrounded by watercourses, tree -lined slopes, corn fields and natural reserves.
On the horizon, the mountainous chains that rise to the north of the Changing and Huairou districts complete a landscape that contrasts with the tangle of glazed torres and apartments blocks of Beijing's urban network. “When I'm here I don't remember if I'm in China, Portugal or Germany,” explained João Ruas. "I'm in a bubble, let's say, and it's a good bubble."
Without previous experience in the country, the Portuguese was surprised by the sympathy of the Chinese and the reception of the local community. On the day he was interviewed by the Lusa agency, his cargo tricycle advocated on his way to the supermarket. Depressing the neighbors quickly sent to try to fix the vehicle.
“I am the only foreigner here. I communicate for gestures, I am still learning Chinese, but I have always been very well treated. The neighbors help in everything,” he said.
Despite the enthusiasm with life in the countryside, the coach admits difficulties in the exercise of the sport he has been practicing since he was nine years old. "There is a lot of amateurism, little technique, expensive and poorly frequency evidence. And everything that involves horses here is frankly more expensive than in Europe."
The horse “is not dominated by force: it requires patience, knowledge and sensitivity,” he said. "It's like an athlete. There are good days and bad days. And don't talk. We have to know how to read the signs. A small reaction may indicate a serious problem," he noted.
In Portugal, João Ruas studied at the D. Dinis Agricultural Professional School, where he reconciled classes for last weekends with the coach. Since then, it never left the horses. "I started with once a week, then two, then three, until I got to five. I had to insist a lot with my parents to start," he said.
In China, he works with European horses, brought on purpose to compete in Dressage evidence. The goal is to prepare animals since the age of three for competitions that normally start at four. "There is still a tradition of creation with sports focus. Horses have been raised for many years, but not with selective criterion for sport," he said.
Shanghai, the country's economic “capital”, leads the practice of drassage in the country, with more proof and better infrastructure. In Beijing, there is a growing interest, but there is still a long way to go. “It can be good to start like this, almost from scratch. It allows you to do things well. Without addictions,” reflected streets.
With the arrival of another horse soon and the prospect of continuing work in China, João Ruas is said. "I see myself here for many more years. It only costs the distance. But with today's technology, we managed to shorten it," he said. "There are sacrifices that are good for the soul."</description><pubDate>2025-08-17 22:54:44</pubDate></item><item><title>USJ | Researchers discover a new species of bacteria in Portugal</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/08/usj-investigadores-descobrem-nova-especie-de-bacteria-em-portugal/</link><description>A team of local university researchers identified a new species of bacteria in the Salinas of Rio Maior, Portugal. The type of discovered organism, which lives in extreme environments, widens the limits of biological knowledge and may have implications in areas such as biomedicine, pharmacy or even spatial exploration
 
There is news in the field of microbiology thanks to the latest discovery of a team of researchers linked to the University of São José (USJ), led by André Antunes, interim director of the Institute of Sciences and Environment of the same educational institution.
It is the discovery of a new species of bacteria from 12 samples collected in the Salinas of Rio Maior, in Portugal, which led to the establishment of the new species “Fodinibius alkaliphilus”. The species of bacteria previously known as “Alifodinibius salipaludis” for “Fodinibius salipaludis” was also reclassified.
The conclusions appear in the article “Fodinibius alkaliphilus sp. Nov., Moderately halophilic and alkaliphilic bacterium isolated from an Inland Saltern in central and reclassification of aliifodinibius salipaludi as fodinibius salipalis sp. SYSTEMATIC AND EVOLUTIONARY MICROBIOLOGY. The scientific journal is a publication “reference for new macrobial data”, being the official publication of the International Procaryotes Systematic Committee and the Applied Bacteriology and Microbiology Division of the International Union of Microbiological Societies, describes a USJ note.
In addition to André Antunes, the authors team includes researchers from the University of Science and Technology of Macau, coordinated by Marta Filipa Simões; Researchers at the University of Minho and Seville University.
According to the same USJ note, "the new [bacteria] species grows better in salinities about four times higher than those of seawater and also prefers alkaline conditions, combining the ability to grow in different extreme environmental conditions."
The importance of this type of studies, including analyzes to “such extreme environments”, is “future applications in a wide range of fields, including biomedical and pharmaceutical, but also extends to the discovery of new useful materials and the provision of useful information for future space exploration”.
The same team of investigators is not stopped, as "other samples of these places are currently being investigated and new publications describing other new species are expected in the coming months."
“This publication highlights the strengths of Macau in the articulation with partners of Portuguese and Spanish -speaking countries, as well as its growing importance in the fields of biodiversity and biotechnology,” is still described.
The Power of Salinas
The researchers explain that "the species Aliifodinibius Salipaludis has been described, but their name has not yet been validly published." In field work the team isolated these species from “hypersaline environments, including saline, salt mines and saline soils”.
Prior to the field work itself, the team conducted “an investigation to the microbial diversity of hypersaline environments in downtown Portugal”, with samples in the Rio Maior area in July 2019, 12 genera bacteria were isolated from the Rio Maior salines.
Located in the central area of ​​Portugal, in these Salinas there is the “brine, which is about seven times more salty than seawater”, being “pumping from a well and generated by the crossing of a local underground course with an extensive salt deposit”.
The article also gives a historical context of this location. "Although they were first referred to in twelfth-century documents, these places are believed to have been linked to salt extraction from prehistoric times. They offer a single scenario, as they are the only interior saline in Portugal and the only ones in full functioning throughout Europe."
Thus, the study in question “was part of a bioprospecting campaign centered on this place”, resulting in “the isolation of a bacterial strain (N2T) and the discovery of a new putative species within the genus Fodinibius”.
In this work is determined “the taxonomic position of this new isolated based on the phenotypic, chemotaxonos and molecular properties”, is described.
Importance for Science
At HM, André Antunes explained that this discovery is, first of all, interesting to the scientific community, by bringing “additional information” and constituting a discovery “about the biodiversity that exists on our planet, more concretely at the macrobial level”.
"So far, we have been able [general scientific community] to study less than 1 percent of all microbes species on the planet. In over 99 percent we have no idea what they are, what they do and what their abilities, or what impact they have on the environment and our lives," he explained.
The researcher also said that "the microbes that come from extreme environments, and above all from environments with a lot of salt, which is the case of this species we now discover, are very interesting for a large range of biotechnology applications."
"We can include things like the medical area, biomedicine, the production of new pharmaceutical compounds or the production of new biomaterials, such as bioplastics," said André Antunes. The academic even talks about applications in “more exotic areas, which are now beginning to have a little more visibility, such as the potential application in construction, the production of more sustainable cements or concrete structures that have the self -repair capacity”.
This discovery also has some impact "for space exploration, more specifically to better understand what the limits of life are and where to seek life outside our planet." It is also included "very important implications for missions that are exploring Mars, namely as to the type of environments where it may be feasible to find past signs of life or present or other parts of the solar system."
A job that continues
The investigation is not for the Salinas of Rio Maior, and the team led by André Antunes last year, an expedition to Antarctica. “There are antarctic samples that we are currently studying and we have samples taken from the red sea bottom, where salt concentration is also quite high.” Therefore, the saga of discovering new bacteria and potential reclassifications in those that already exist.
André Antunes says that the discovery of a new species of microbes "is quite important to science, not only for the perspective of science at the basic level, but because we can have a better perspective of diversity we have on the planet."
“As we study extreme environments we can have additional information about what the limits of life are and how life adapts to extreme conditions.” Thus, André Antunes advocates investment in science so that there is later “an associated practical component, so it is not always easy to convince the financing entities”, as to this point.
The researcher also points out that the article and the investigation fits “very well in the priorities of Macau and the USJ itself, with regard to the focus in the area of ​​environment, biodiversity and biotechnology, anchored in connection with Lusophony”.</description><pubDate>2025-08-08 00:04:55</pubDate></item><item><title>SCO | China reveals ten -year plan for multipolar world</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/02/sco-china-revela-plano-de-dez-anos-para-mundo-multipolar/</link><description>In Tianjin was presented the initiative of global governance, a Beijing plan that defends multilateralism in the world geopolitical order. From the Shanghai Cooperation Organization came a new Defense Defense of the Multipolar World, as well as new “100 Small and Exemplary Projects” of financial support to the body's member countries
 
The Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) approved a development strategy for the next decade, with the aim of promoting a multipolar world, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi announced yesterday. The global governance initiative (GGI, on the English acronym) comes at a time when the regional bloc recognized, in a joint statement, that the worsening of geopolitical tensions represents a growing threat to the safety of its members.
Speaking after the 25th SCO summit, which took place in Tianjin, in northeastern China, Wang said the development strategy until 2035 “defines the tone and a clear direction for the next decade”, considering it one of the main results of the meeting.
The summit had as its backdrop the increase in friction between some of the main members of SCO and the United States of America (USA), namely due to sanctions and commercial fares applied by Donald Trump administration.
Wang classified the meeting as the “most fruitful” to date, stressing that participants have issued a unified message against unilateral actions, in an implicit reference to Washington. "The summit firmly defended a multilateral trade mechanism centered on the World Trade Organization, rejected unilateral measures that violate the organization's rules and sent a clear message in support of equity against intimidation," said Chinese diplomacy chief.
Wang also announced the creation of four new SCO security centers, focusing on combating regional security, transnational organized crime, drug trafficking and information security.
According to Xinhua agency, Wang Yi also said that GGI has arrived "at the right time," given that "the world faces numerous challenges, including frequent regional turbulences, a slow economic growth and the increase in anti-globalization [ideas and movements."
The GGI has as its principles “respect for sovereign equality, the observation of international law, the practice of multilateralism, the defense of a people centered on concrete actions”, concepts that are “in line with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Letter,” noted Wang Yi.
The Chinese Foreign Minister also recalled that GGI is the “fourth global initiative proposed by President XI Jinping in recent years” after the launch of the global development initiative, the global security initiative and the global civilization initiative.
According to the minister, "these four initiatives bring stability and predictability to a turbulent world, reflecting the active role and meaning of responsibility of China in international affairs."
A new statement
From the summit also came the statement of Tianjin of the Council of Heads of State of SCO, where multilateralism is a watchword. “World politics and economics, as well as other areas of international relations, have undergone profound historical transformations. The international system is heading for a fairer, more egalitarian and representative multipolarity, opening new perspectives for national development and cooperation with mutual benefits,” he can read.
In the same document, SCO Member States commit to “deepening long-term partnerships and further strengthening Shanghai's cooperation organization, in order to jointly preserve regional peace, safety and stability, promoting sustainable development” countries.
In the statement, it is also established that SCO member countries "consider interference in internal affairs in other states under any pretexts, as well as the use of unilateral coercion measures that are not based on international law and harm the interests of other states."
"Member States reaffirm their position of principle against the imposition of extraterritorial unilateral sanctions," was still declared in the document.
Support to countries
President Xi Jinping reaffirmed the view of a new world order that challenges Western rule, appealing to the construction of a fairer and more multipolar international system. "The SCO must oppose the Cold War mindset, the confrontation between blocks and the behaviors of intimidation," Xi said in the main speech of the summit, in an indirect reference to the United States.
The Chinese leader defended a reform in global governance with greater representation to the global south and called for the “equal and uniform” application of international law, without double standards or the hegemony of the few.
Xi also announced a set of concrete measures to face the challenges to development, at a time when the US trade war raises fears of global economic stagnation.
Among the initiatives are 100 “small and exemplary projects” of well-being support in SCO countries, more than two billion Yuan in non-reimburseable aid and ten billion yuan in loans to the SCO Interbank Consortium in the next three years.
XI also revealed plans to accelerate the creation of a SCO development bank to reinforce security and economy cooperation between member states. "We must expand the basis of cooperation and fully use the resources of each country, assuming the responsibility for peace, stability, development and prosperity in the region," he said.
Regarding China's role in the world geopolitical system, Xi Jinping highlighted a series of measures and initiatives in which he considers that the country was a pioneer. In Monday's speech at SCO, he stressed that “we were the first to launch the cooperation of the track and route initiative”, and a large number of signature projects were developed ”. In addition, “cooperation at the level of industrial investment has significantly advanced, providing conducting forces for development and prosperity throughout the region”.
China says it now has data that trade with SCO member countries has surpassed "the objectives that had been set," and the communications and transport network was "widely improved", with a land of land of almost 14,000 kilometers among the Member States.
On Monday, Xi Jinping also pointed out that China was the first country to “present the vision of global governance based on a wide consultation, a joint contribution and benefit sharing,” making an “effort to practice true multilateralism”.
"We deepen cooperation with the United Nations and other international organizations, and play a constructive role in international and regional affairs. We are always alongside international equity and justice, we advocate inclusion and mutual learning between civilizations. We oppose the hegemonism and policy of power, so we become a pro-action for peace and world development," said Chinese President.
Hand in hand
Prior to the official photo shoot on Monday, Russian presidents Vladimir Putin, and India Narendra Modi were seen walking hand in hand in the direction of Xi Jinping, with whom they kept a brief conversation, accompanied by interpreters. According to Modi himself, the two leaders traveled together in the same car for their bilateral meeting.
Created in 2001 as a European-Asian security alliance between China, Russia and four Central Asian countries, SCO has expanded areas such as economic and commercial cooperation. According to Beijing, the organization currently brings together 26 countries in Asia, Europe and Africa, between full members, observers and dialogue partners. Myanmar and Türkiye are among the countries intended to full adhesion.
Despite the growing influence, the group is still affected by internal disputes - such as India and Pakistan, or between Tajiquistan and Kyrguistan - that compromise its global effectiveness.

Although he belonged to the boards of the Directorate of Administration and Public Finance Services (SAFP), where he assumed the position of Director for several years, Kou was in service committee in the lead of the center responsible for the formation of the MGIAN MAGISTRATES.
The information about the renovation of Kou Peng Kuan was published yesterday in the official bulletin, in a order signed by SAFP subdirect, Joana Noronha, and explains that the retirement was voluntary.
According to the official government portal, the CFJJ leadership was thus assumed by Tina Cheng Wai Yan, a subdirector, as a substitute director. This is the second time that Tina Cheng will have the position of director, as a substitute, repeating the situation of 2023, when the departure of the then director Manuel Trigo do CFJJ. Wai Yan performs the duties of subdirecting at CFJJ at least since 2013.
Kou Peng Kuan reaches the end of his career as a civil servant who began in 1991. Throughout a professional course over 30 years old, he took different positions as a superior technician of the Public Administration Training Center, Deputy Training Division, Head of the Training Division and Head of the Administrative Modernization Department of Administration and Public Function.
The high moment of the career arrived EME 2015, when it was promoted to SAFP's director, when the Government of MSAR was led by Chui Sai On. While SAFP director, Kou Peng Kuan was responsible for creating the Macao Single Account application in 2019.</description><pubDate>2025-09-03 23:43:08</pubDate></item><item><title>Public function | Song Pek Kei wants voluntary reform program</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/03/funcao-publica-song-pek-kei-quer-programa-de-reforma-voluntaria/</link><description>Given the “workloads and increasing pressures” in public administration, the deputy defends the creation of a pilot program that allows early retirement with greater financial security, in the case of health problems
 
Representative Song Pek Kei intends that the government implements a new experimental voluntary reform program for civil servants with health problems. The subject was approached through a written interpeação, released at the end of August to the Legislative Assembly.
According to the legislator linked to the Fujian community, due to “social development” civil service officials face “workloads and increasing pressures”. Therefore, it considers that there should be an early voluntary retirement option linked to health problems, especially for workers with lower wages and the lower positions of the hierarchy, which at the same time ensures “flexibility and financial security”.
"Even though some civil servants want to retire earlier for health reasons, leaving their positions means losing the security of livelihood," argues the deputy.
In the understanding of Song Pek Kei, the lack of an early retirement option for health reasons that guarantees financial safety “impairs the flexibility of the pension fund system and negatively affects healthy turnover within public service”.
"In response to the rapid pace of administrative reform, authorities will implement a" voluntary reform regime for civil servants "in the departments where this is necessary to promote healthy mobility within the civil service and increase the vitality of the civil service labor force," he asked.
Low reforms
Song Pek Kei also points out that the salaries of various civil servants are low and that they do not allow a reform consistent with a decent level of living. "Because civil servants with fewer length of service have low wages and their monthly contributions are limited, payments they can get from the Social Security Fund are very small, making it difficult to obtain practical protection for their life in reform," he said.
The legislature thus calls for extra protection for these people: "Although authorities have introduced several financial assistance programs for first -rate civil servants with low income, additional improvements in their reform protection are still needed," he justifies. "In this regard, management will reinforce the current reform protection system, for example, granting subsistence subsidies in reform to renovated junior civil servants," he asks.</description><pubDate>2025-09-03 23:37:12</pubDate></item><item><title>60,000 people watched in Macao at the Beijing Military Parade</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/03/60-mil-pessoas-assistiram-em-macau-a-parada-militar-de-pequim/</link><description>A total of 60,000 people watched yesterday in the broad broadcast of the “commemorative ceremony of the 80th anniversary of the victory of the Chinese people's resistance war against Japanese aggression and the anti -fascist World War”, which took place at the Macao Polytechnic University and the Sports Complex at Macao, as well as other places.
According to an official statement, the 60,000 people include students and civil servants. Several "higher education and non -higher institutions have organized sessions for students to assist in direct transmission in educational institutions." In addition, "several government departments have also organized sessions for civil servants to attend such activity."
The ceremony in question included the military parade that took place in Beijing, in Tiananmen Square, and gathered several heads of state. Thus, it is understood that the 60,000 participants in Macao “joined the homeland and the people to remember history, pay tribute to martyrs, value peace and create a great future”.
Remember the struggles
André Cheong, secretary for administration and justice, recalled that "80 years ago the Chinese people achieved significant victories in the war against Japanese aggression after the persistence and resilience of 14 years of bloody struggles", and the "victories were a historical turning point, in which the Chinese nation went from humiliation to rebirth."
According to the Chinese channel of Rádio Macau, Kong Chi Meng, director of the Directorate of Education and Youth Development Services (DSEDJ), the direct transmission of the military parade in Beijing constituted a kind of “first class of the new school year and a living practice of patriotic education”.
In turn, the game dealers also joined this event. This was the case of MGM China, which in the MGM Macau and MGM Cotai developments organized the broadcast of the parade “in the team's member dining rooms and the backstage” of employees, giving teams “the opportunity to witness this memorable moment together and share pride for the prosperity and strength of the nation”, says the operator in a statement. A stopping zone of the stop on MGM Cotai Grande Salon was also added.
War II | Sam Hou Fai highlights “Macao compatriots”
The chief executive, Sam Hou Fai, highlighted yesterday, regarding the ceremony of commemoration of the 80th anniversary of the victory of the Chinese people's resistance against Japanese aggression and anti -fascist World War, that “all Macau compatriots will remember the story, pay tribute to martyrs and value the stability that was not easy to achieve”.
The event, which took place at Tiananmen Square and featured the organization of a military stop that brought together heads of state from around the world, also had the presence of the head of the Executive of the MSAR. He also recalled, quoted by an official statement, that "during the 14 years of resistance against Japanese aggression, the Communist Party of China defended and always persisted in a united national front against Japanese aggression, playing a fundamental role."</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Public function | CE says to vote shows fidelity to the Mand</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/03/funcao-publica-ce-diz-que-votar-mostra-fidelidade-a-raem/</link><description>The civil service workers received a letter from the Chief Executive to appeal to the vote in the legislatures, indicating that vote is a demonstration of faithfulness to the MSAR. Sam Hou Fai mentioned the revision of the Management Statute that establishes the dismissal as a penalty for employees who are not faithful to
 
The government is betting on reversing record abstention in the last legislative elections, repeating on several occasions the importance of suffrage to the Legislative Assembly (AL) of 14 September to the Macao Political Agenda.
Moreover, in various circumstances it was underlined by rulers and the chairman of the Commission of Electoral Affairs of the Legislative Assembly (Caeal) that this is the first election after the revision of the electoral law, and reinforces the principle "Macao governed by patriots". This was one of the points mentioned in the letter sent by the Chief Executive to all civil servants at MSAR.
According to TDM's Macau channel, Sam Hou Fai launched an appeal to all public administration workers to vote on September 14. “Being part of the governing team of MSAR, workers of services and public entities must actively respond to Caeal's appeal, diligently comply with their voting duty and encouraging family and friends to vote,” reads the taxpayer.
But in addition to the appeal to the vote, the Chief Executive states that “according to the Macao Public Administration Workers Statute (ETAPM), recently reviewed workers and public entities of all levels must defend the Basic Law and be faithful to the Fasome of the Popular Republic of China (RPC)”. Now, Sam Hou Fai adds that the "vote is precisely a relevant demonstration of the defense of the basic law and the faithfulness to the masters."
It should be noted that the statute that regulates the civil service establishes that “the public administration worker who, for proven facts, does not defend the basic law or is not faithful to the RPC MSAR, the penalty of dismissal is necessarily applied”.
Between
Not to mention directly the consequences of not voting, and although the vote is secret and the review of the ETAPM only comes into force on November 1 this year, the chief executive directly connects the vote to loyalty to the MSAR.
HM tried to understand if disciplinary consequences are planned, including dismissal, to civil servants who have not voted, or if there will be any vacation marking that covers election day, but even the closing of the edition were not received any answers.
In the letter, Sam Hou Fai also argues that voting is a contribution to the “stable and lasting implementation” of the “one country, two systems” principle, and that civil servants “must be planned in advance and actively participate on election day.
According to the Macao channel, employees were also asked to sign a document proving that they became aware of the content of the letter sent by Sam Hou Fai.</description><pubDate>2025-09-03 23:34:36</pubDate></item><item><title>Elections | Rita Santos says that the list banner was damaged</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/03/eleicoes-rita-santos-diz-que-banner-da-lista-foi-danificado/</link><description>Rita Santos, president of the General Assembly of the Macao Public Function Association (ATFPM), wrote yesterday on social networks that a poster from the Nova Esperança list, led by José Pereira Coutinho, was intentionally damaged, with a cigarette erased in the image of the candidate's left eye.

Rita Santos, who is a figure close to the Nova Esperança list, led by Coutinho and candidate for elections for the Legislative Assembly, does not integrate the group of candidates, but said Coutinho is concerned about his security after this episode.

In the publication, the official even said that the Nova Esperança list has the right to request legal responsibility after the poster was damaged. Rita Santos has not yet forgotten the fact that, after the television debate in which the list participated, Pereira Coutinho continues to be the subject of defamation, accused of false information and discredited by a competing list.

However, buyers and sellers again saw prices lower
 
In the first half of August the number of housing transactions had an annual growth of 19 percent to a total of 118 businesses. The figures were released yesterday, through the Portal of the Directorate of Finance Services (DSF). In the first half of August last year 99 housing transactions had been registered.
Compared to early August this year, the largest number of housing purchases and sales took place on the peninsula with 96 transactions, which contrast with the 74th of the previous year. In Taipa there were 19 apartments sales, a value that was stabilized, and in Coloane were registered three, three less than in early August last year.
If on the one hand there were more transactions, on the other, the average price of houses sold had a 2.3 percent reduction to an average of 78,990 patacas per square meter. In comparison, in the first half of August last year the average price of the square meter was 80,815 patacas per square meter.
As traditionally it happens, the square meter was more expensive in Coloane, with an average cost of 83,444 patacas, which in annual terms represented an increase compared to the average value of 65,145 patacas per square meter of early August 2024. In the peninsula the latest average price was 82,743 patacas per square meter, an annual reduction of 84,584 previous patacas. Finally, in mud the latest price was 65,219 patacas per square meter, a reduction of almost 10,000 patacas, compared to 75,189 patacas per square meter of the previous year.
Ships
The latest figures confirm that the Macao real estate market is going through a very different situation than before the Covid-19 pandemic.
In the early fifteen days of August 2019 the number of housing fraction transactions reached 443, around three times what happened in the most recently analyzed period. At the beginning of the month there were 289 transactions on the peninsula, 137 in the mud and 17 in Coloane.
Also prices are at a different level than in August 2019. At that time, the average price per square meter was 119,351 patacas, a difference of 40,361 patacas compared to the first half of August 2025. At that time, the average price in the mud was 142,100 patacas per square meter, and 126,883 Patacas in Colaane. In the peninsula the average price of the square meter reached 108,748 patacas.</description><pubDate>2025-09-02 23:51:09</pubDate></item><item><title>The ethical wire of science</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/04/o-fio-etico-da-ciencia/</link><description>"The Sciences Are Unaware That They Lack A Conscience."
Edgar Morin
The year 2025 did not arrive with fanfare, but with fatigue. The world, after a decade marked by pandemics, algorithmic governance, ecological collapses and epistemic fragmentation, is suspended between acceleration and exhaustion. In this climate, Edgar Morin's prophetic warning in his book “Science with conscience” considered as soul ruin not as an outdated aphorism but as a structural diagnosis. Its 1990s lamentation on the split between knowledge and wisdom now requires radical rereading. For in 2025 the crisis is no longer merely moral; It became ontological. The very categories by which we understand reality, truth, life and identity were destabilized by the unbridled expansion of technoscience, the commodification of cognition and the erosion of shared meaning.
Morin's original thesis, rooted in the post-World War I and the rise of nuclear science, warned against the triumph of instrumental rationality dissociated from ethical reflection. He saw in the figure of Faust not only a literary archetype, but a civilizational trajectory in the pursuit of power through knowledge, disagreeed with responsibility. Today, this Faustian impulse has metastized. Artificial intelligence (AI), synthetic biology, neurocapitalism and planetary engineering are no longer speculative domains and are operational realities. However, the awareness that should accompany such power remains conspicuously absent, or worse, outsourced to market logic and predictive algorithms.
Adapting Morin's work to the reality of 2025 demands, first of all, to confront the epistemological rupture that defines our era. Science, once a search for truth, has become a battlefield of competing narratives. Climate models are politicized, instrumentalized epidemiological data, and even the concept of evidence is subjected to tribal fidelities. The Enlightenment promise of universal reason fragmented itself into eco cameras and epistemic silos. Morin's appeal to “complex thinking” capable of integrating uncertainty, contradiction and interdependence is more urgent than ever. But complexity today is not just an intellectual virtue. It is a survival strategy. Consider the domain of AI. In 2025, AI systems govern not only logistics and finance, but also judicial judgments, access to education and even emotional companionship.
These systems, trained in vast data sets, reflect and amplify the prejudices of their creators and the societies from which they learn. However, your authority is rarely questioned. The opacity of automatic learning models, combined with fetishization of efficiency, has created a new technocratic priesthood whose decisions are shielded against democratic scrutiny. Morin's criticism of reductionism and the tendency to isolate variables and ignore the context here is its most unsettling expression. The algorithm does not ask why; Optimizes. And in doing so, erodes the very conditions of ethical deliberation. Biotechnology offers another border where science without conscience threatens to break the human condition. The genetic edition, once confined to laboratories, is now marketed as improvement.
The line between therapy and the increase is blurred, and with it, the concept of normality. Morin's insistence on inseparability between biology and culture becomes a vital corrective. For what is at stake is not just the manipulation of genomes, but the redefinition of what is human being. The temptation to engineering intelligence, emotion and even morality risks reducing a person to a programmable function. In this context, consciousness cannot be a post-criticism but must be the architect. The ecological dimension of Morin's thought equally requires renewal. In 2025, the anthropocene is no longer a theoretical builder to becoming a lived reality. Refugiados climáticos, colapso da biodiversidade e padrões meteorológicos erráticos testemunham as consequências planetárias da arrogância científica.
However, the dominant response remains technocratic because geoengineering schemes, carbon markets and resilience panels. O humanismo ecológico de Morin e a sua visão da Terra como sistema vivo em que os humanos são simultaneamente participantes e guardiões oferece uma contra-narrativa. Appeals to a science that listens, coexiste and healing. Not a science of domination, but of communion. Perhaps more urgently, Morin's work must be reinterpreted in the light of cultural fragmentation. In 2025, identity became simultaneously refuge and weapon. The global village promised by digital connectivity degenerated in tribal enclaves, each with its epistemology, morality and aesthetics. Science, once bridge between cultures, risks becoming a tool for exclusion.
The language of alienic specialization, the pairs review rituals they intimidate, and the impact indicators distort. Morin's appeal to transdisciplinarity and dialogue between science, art, philosophy and experienced experience is not a luxury but a necessity. Only intertwining multiple ways of knowing we can restore the tissue of the shared meaning. This "science without conscience" reimagined must therefore be more than a criticism, must be a manifest. It should appeal to a pedagogy of complexity, a policy of humility and an ethics of care. It must challenge scientific institutions to democratize their processes, to confront their blind points, and embrace uncertainty not as a threat but as a condition of truth.
It should invite scientists to become citizens, and citizens to complain about science as a public good. In this spirit, the university must be reconstituted. It is no longer a silo of specialization, it must become a sanctuary of integration. Curricula must be redesigned to cultivate not only technical competence but moral imagination. Students should be trained to ask not only "like" but "why" and "for whom." Research should be evaluated not only by its novelty, but for its relevance, inclusiveness and ability to illuminate the human condition. Morin's vision of education as a process of awakening and learning to live, understand and coexist must guide this transformation. Likewise, scientific publication should evolve.
The fetishization of impact factors and quotation counts created a culture of performative productivity. Knowledge fragments in hyper specialized articles, inaccessible to the public and often irrelevant to pressing concerns. An editorial ecosystem should prioritize accessibility, interdisciplinarity and public involvement. It must reward synthesis, reflection and the courage to ask foundational questions. The media, too, should recover their role as mediators of consciousness. In 2025, scientific communication is often reduced to sensational titles and polarized debates. The nuance, context and humility that Morin defended are victims of the economy of attention.
Journalists should be formed not only in scientific literacy, but in ethical discernment. They must resist the temptation to simplify and instead cultivate the art of complexity. They must tell stories that enlighten the dilemmas, risks and humanity behind the data. At the geopolitical level, Morin's insights offer a picture to rethink global governance. The pandemic revealed the fragility of international cooperation and the dangers of scientific nationalism. In 2025, vaccination diplomacy, climate negotiations and digital sovereignty continue to be contesting arenas. A science infused of conscience must advocate for planetary solidarity. It must recognize that viruses, carbon molecules and algorithms do not respect borders. It should appeal to agile, inclusive and responsible institutions not only before states, but before future peoples, ecosystems and generations.
This vision requires courage. For the forces that oppose consciousness are formidable because they aim to profit, institutional inertia, and ideological rigidity. But the alternative is unsustainable. A science without conscience leads not only to moral decay, but to civilizational collapse. It generates alienation, injustice and ecological ruin. Reduces the human spirit to a variable in a model, a knot in a net, to a consumer of innovation. To resist this trajectory, we must cultivate what Morin called "Reliance" which is the ability to connect, care and create. We must rediscover the joy of the question, the humility of not knowing and the responsibility of knowing. We must build institutions that honor complexity.</description><pubDate>2025-09-04 00:02:58</pubDate></item><item><title>Robotic rental belly (II)</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/02/barriga-de-aluguer-robotica-ii/</link><description>Last week, we talked about the research that allows a robot to play the role of rental belly and become the first "mother robot". If successful, the mother robot may have babies.
The mother robot costs 100,000 rmb. If a child is born through this method, someone will have to pay the "delivery" expenses. Who is this "someone" and how much the "childbirth expenses" ascend?
At the outset, it will be naturally the parents who will pay. The use of this method is mainly determined by mother's health problems, which prevent her from bringing a pregnancy to good port, so she resorts to the help of the mother robot. In this case there is no controversy. However, if the embryo that grows in the “belly” of the mother robot has not been generated by the couple's genetic material, or if it only results from an egg or sperm of a single person or one of the elements of a homosexual couple, then it will be necessary to resort to the help of third parties and the situation becomes more complicated.
In either case the legislation is essential and will have to regulate the following:
1. Is it cool to use the mother robot as a rental belly?
2. If it is cool, can the robot mother give birth?
3. How should a mother robot company work?
The mother robot is a new health product that helps solve the problem of female infertility, but also raises another question: Can a woman accept that a robot gives birth to her child? Many labor legislations regulate maternity leave and some already include paternity leave. International treaties also clearly regulate women's work rights. However, in reality, and in some companies, only women who are not prepared to have children occupy the highest positions. This conduct has long been harming women. With the help of the mother robot this problem could disappear and the competition between men and women in the workplace would be more equal.
Reality also shows that mothers are more loving and have narrower relationships with their children. These factors are inseparable from pregnancy. Women carry their children for nine months in their befels. The children are the light of their eyes. Taking care of children is a natural right. Women who have given birth can more intensely experience the greatness of life and will undoubtedly have more charitable hearts. Will the mother robot eliminate these virtues?
Children conceived from the sperm and egg of biological parents are believed to be the less controversial. Under these circumstances, the law only needs to regulate the technique of design of the mother robot. However, when it comes to generating a child from a single father or mother or a homosexual couple, we are facing an ethical issue that cannot be easily addressed. Admittedly, the mother robot can only conceive if there is anyone who delivers the babies, otherwise it would be generating orphans, creating another social problem.
The third question that the law should consider is the operability of the companies responsible for the mother robots. Mother robots are simultaneously health products and commercial products. The legal regulation of commercial products is first aimed at the benefit of humanity. Therefore, the storage and use of sperm, eggs and medical records should be the subject of professional and specialized counseling.
The law should not regulate the profits of Mother Robot companies, because the essence of the business is profit. The most important thing about business is to evaluate the market and stay on the wave crest to earn the first “gold pot”. When the technology of the mother robot matures and the legal framework is in force, other commercial considerations will arise. Therefore, if it is cool the mother robot to give birth, the initial costs are expected to be very high. If a product is inaccessible to normal people and can only be purchased by very rich, is it really a health product?
During the 2019 pandemic, the United Nations provided free vaccines to countries with financial difficulties. Later, the United States waived the patents of its vaccine, allowing other countries to produce and use it. In both cases scientific progress has been shared in the area of ​​medicine and avoided the creation of profit at the expense of the weaker. With current technological advances, the development of artificial uteros is imminent and the creation of the mother robot is not a surprise. However, implications for resources, ethics and legislation deserve more careful attention.

Nowadays the electric troties are a plague in almost all over the world. A dangerous plague. Deadly accidents with trotinces follow in Portugal. Last week a Trotinet user died while walking to his job and was hit by a criminal driver because he fled after the two -wheeled vehicle clash. In Paris, the use of trotinces has already been prohibited. In Lisbon, the plague scares the walkers because the “pilots” of three riders walk the tours at great speed and have already clashed against the elderly, children, disabled with wheelchairs, invisuals and baby strollers. Every day there is a trotinel accident. Drivers of them respect nothing, especially traffic signs. They pass with the red light, cross the crosses diagonally, walk two and even three in a trotinet and lead with listeners listening to music. A few days ago, a bus driver was unable to avoid the accident against a trotinel with a couple on board. He broke his arm and leg. She went from ambulance to hospital with head trauma. This is because most trotinists are at great speed through cars without wearing protective helmet. In order to have an idea, in 2024, 1,658 accidents were recorded with electric troties in Portugal, resulting in four deaths, 72 serious injuries and 1,677 minor injured. These data were released in June this year by the Portuguese road prevention, reflecting a tendency to worsen in the sinister involving electric troties in recent years.
In Lisbon, cycle paths were built, some absurd because they have no follow-up. A certain distance is traveled and the bike path ended. However, even in the bike lanes, some with traffic lights, the "trotiners" respect nothing and pack against the bicycles. These numbers of accidents are frightening and worrying for the authorities. Authorities who have to take serious measures on the use of Trotinks, although the compulsory insurance for bicycles and trotinces has already been decided.
In principle, the use of the helmet should be mandatory. It would be the best sense of the total prohibition of the trotinces movement in the city's tours and the ban on the three -time being used by more than one user. These three measures are urgent, adding that Trotinks and Bicycles users should have a circulation license, which would be removed forever as a trotinen user was caught walking on the rides, without a helmet, without insurance or not respecting the red light of the traffic lights. An expert on road safety issues has given us that trotinces are a real danger in the global movement of city traffic, because they do not respect the rules of traffic. More added to us that two crash-tests performed by the Mapfre Foundation in Spain reveal that a collision, even at 25 km/h, from an electric trotinet against a pawn or a vehicle can cause serious injuries to the trotinet and pedestrian driver. Experts from these studies indicate as factors that most influence a fatal accident, it is derived from driving three-helmeted troties (40 percent), recklessness committed by other vehicles (20 percent) and circular on distance roads (20 percent). We have no doubt that accidents can only be reduced if it is mandatory to use the helmet and retro-reflector vest or high visibility clothing, respect traffic signaling, do not use ear-circulating when we get to use troties to speak to mobile ones through these auricular, do not circulate on walks and when crossing a crossing.
Imagine that the electric trotinces have even been a first page subject in the press because one of the incendays of the last devastating flames has been on fire in various places of electric trotinet… This subject of trotinces is more severe than it may seem. It is already worrying for the ordinary citizen who goes out on the street. Visually impaired people are afraid of leaving home to the risk of suffering injuries caused by electric troties and their bad parking on walks and pedestrian passages. The truth is that we can see abandoned trotinces anywhere in the tours. The president of the Blind and Amblyope Association of Portugal (Acapo), Rodrigo Santos, stressed that this means of transportation has "severely impaired a fundamental right of the invisuals, and not only, which is to be able to go out to the street." The same personality said that ACAPO has had contacts with blind citizens who undergo “surreal things”, namely falls that originate from a stumbling over trotinet lying in the middle of the ride or collision after the departure of a stopping of buses, and there are also several cases of broken and invisual canes that have been to the hospital. We also understand that a law should be implemented that limited the speed of electric troties to 30 km/h in areas with high use of micromobility vehicles, because circulation with trotinces has a higher risk of head, face and neck lesions. On the other hand, the majority of users of electric troties are young people who do not have the slightest notion of traffic rules. The paradigm of this problem has to change radically for the benefit and safety of the thousands of pawns that frequent the streets of the country.</description><pubDate>2025-09-01 03:10:05</pubDate></item><item><title>SME survival</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/29/sobrevivencia-das-pme/</link><description>Confronted with the challenges placed by online purchasing platforms and the current trend of Macao residents to fuel themselves in the cities of the Guangdong region, as well as changing the purchasing standard of mainland China tourists, small and medium -sized (SME) in residential areas are increasingly difficult to survive. With the end of the satellite casinos, the stores installed around them are also facing great challenges.
In response to the closing of many more stores, the Government of RAEM recently launched initiatives such as “Zape with Flavors” and the “Great Award for Consumption in Community Zones”. Zape with flavors ended last Sunday (August 24), but how effective was it? I bet only traders from community zones where Zape took place are in a position to respond.
According to the Forbes report in 2025, Macau is the third region of the world with the highest per capita GDP, reaching the $ 134,040 and the first in Asia. Data from the Directorate of Statistics and Census Services indicate that in the second quarter of 2025, the average monthly income of residents employed was 20,000 patacas and the average salary of full-time resident workers (who worked 35 or more hours a week) was in 21,000 patacas, being equivalent to that of the first quarter of this year. Based on these numbers, the purchasing power of Macau residents must be very strong, all businesses and trades should be flourishing and everyone should enjoy a feeling of wealth and happiness. So why didn't you stop the closing wave of commercial stores? Why does there be news of suicide cases?
According to the Directorate of Services for Labor Affairs (DSAL), which cites the data released by the Public Security Police, there were 183,568 workers not residing in Macao in late April this year. In addition, last June, Dsal declared that in February there were 183,222 non -resident workers in Macao, in response to certain written interperations presented by deputies in the Legislative Assembly. Most of these workers are linked to the construction sector and cross the macau-zhuhai land border in the morning and late afternoon. The disparity between the labor market and the consumer market creates difficulties in the survival of SMEs, especially for those located around the North Zone of Macao. Recently, another Chinese restaurant in the North Zone announced the closing after the closure of the Wong Kam restaurant.
Due to the changes in the consumption pattern of tourists visiting Macau and the imbalance of the city's economic structure could short -lived community activities or even the “large award for consumption in community zones” that lasts 13 weeks to be a change factor for small and medium merchants?
As an organism at the service of citizens, the Government of the MSAR must devote itself entirely to public well-being. Under the beginning of “a country, two systems”, and in the capitalist context of the free market, who has the most resources or has more power has the greatest profit opportunities. The government is simultaneously the manager and the social resources distributor.
It is the government's responsibility to effectively use the resources at their disposal to take care of each citizen. A reasonable redistribution of goods is the key to reducing the pit between the rich and the poor. Without a doubt, RAE's current government is perfectly aware of Macao's present economic and financial situation. The relaunch of the “great award for consumption in community zones” and increased subsidies for disabled and elderly demonstrates that he knows the difficulties of those who are at the bottom of the social hierarchy. However, the current relief measures are unfortunately short-lived and are not well defined, and they lack specificity and long-term planning.
Macao's SME salvation is not something that can be achieved in the laboratory. The governmental actions of the economy and finance area contained in the next report of the Government Year of Action for the Financial Year of 2026 will be a crucial test to the capabilities of the Government of the MSAR.</description><pubDate>2025-08-29 00:41:47</pubDate></item><item><title>RPC Anniversary celebrated with “Cisne” show</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/03/aniversario-da-rpc-comemorado-com-espectaculo-cisne/</link><description>On September 30th and October 1st, in time to celebrate the 76th anniversary of the Implementation of the Popular Republic of China (RPC), the “76th Anniversary of the Implementation of the Popular Republic of China and the Haojiang Moonlight Night - New Acrobatic Cisne Show” is held in Macau.

Last weekend of September, the Urban Farm space, in the center of Coloane village, will host the event “Connections - Music.Movement.Nature”. This is a two-day event, taking place on September 27th and 28th, which brings together artistic activities, music and exercise, with yoga and pilates.
This is a “non -profit private initiative that aims to bring together different communities, offering music, family activities, body and holistic workshops, a food and beverage zone and a handicraft market with local breeders,” says a statement from the organization.
Those who are behind this event assume that “Connections” is a “collective creation that combines a conscious way of life with unique experiences”, and has been around since 2018 and 2019, years when the event took place with the Ka-Hó dam, also in Coloane.
However, the “connections” now moves to a larger space, which will allow several activities to be taken throughout seven distinct zones. They are the “Village”, described as “a picturesque area that resembles a traditional Chinese village, with wooden houses in an oriental garden”, which will be the meal and beverage and craft sales zone.

"Urban Farm" will also feature "Gypsy Camp", a "zone with pillows and rest places in the shadow that promises to be an interactive offer, where participants will be able to explore musical instruments such as Asalato, participate in a circle of drums, or watch a Handpan concert with duo Nàv, which curates the area."
“It will also be here that one can attend the ritual of the fire, a lecture on spiritual themes and participate in individual sessions of tarot and soul reading,” explains the organization.
Families activities will take place at Family Tent, offering families meditation sessions, mandala drawings, crochet, building masks in cardboard and even interactive reading moments.
The organization intends, with the connections, to bring “the younger ones to participate in any activity that is taking place in the room, provided that it is accompanied by parents, and can also explore the offer of‘ Urban Farm ’, which provides fishing canas to fish and agriculture activities”.
Meditation tree
A zone that deserves prominence is the “Treetop”, a “mezzannine” built in the cup of a tree, and which was the space chosen for all body exploration activities and “more serene moments”, meditation and relaxation. With activities taking place in the morning to dusk, the “Treetop” will host dance sessions, with zumba, backed, conscious dance and insideflow, as well as yoga, gyrokinessis [Movement that mixes principles of yoga, dance and tai chi], and pilates. Sessing Sings of Sound Bath, exploration of mantras and meditations to sunset and connection with nature are also foreseen.
The “Urban Farm” also offers a “Yurte Mongol” [Typical Tent of the Mongolian Nomadic Peoples], a session of the “Quiz Nights”, which already happens regularly in Macao. "This is the first time that Quiz's night will be oriented in English so that more people can participate in the session," explained the organizers.
At the bottom of the Urban Farm property, in the “Concrete” zone, graffiti and urban art sessions are scheduled with the collectives of local artists Outloud International Street Art Festival and Mid Age of Dawn Skateboards (M.A.O.D.).

It is an initiative integrated in the program of the celebrations of June 10-Portugal, Camões and the Portuguese communities.
The exhibition contains 20 “diptic”, that is, “twenty comparative visual proposals between ancient Macao images, such as photographic and iconographic records of the first half of the nineteenth century, or existing in ancient postcards of the early 20th century, with contemporary images of these spaces, where they can understand not only the presence of the old built or natural elements, but overcoat The continuity of its relevant social and human meaning, ”explained the architect and photographer to HM.
According to Ricarte, what is intended to do in this show is not only "the merely documentary or comparative record of the modifications necessarily occurred in the registered spaces and real estate, but rather to capture as their" spirit ", from the point of view of their presence, urban meaning, or significant human presence, maintain their identity and imagery for the city today."
Past and present
In “Macao: Yesterday and Days” is “introduction of chromatic records in contemporary photographs”, inviting the public to “identify a continuity between the old and the contemporary, finding new identities and meanings in contemporary images presented, thus making another interpretative reading of these photographic records”.
Here, the color “articulates the perpetuity and identity of the places and their meaning, evident in the days yesterday with the contemporaneity of these same spaces, evidenced by their presence and identity in the 'days today',” says Ricarte.
Francisco Ricarte has been an architect of profession, having been in Macao since 2006. He is one of the members of the Halftone Association, dedicated to professional and amateur photography in the territory and outside it, having helped create this project in 2021.

The launch of this work dedicated to the thinking about Confucius takes place on the 10th of this month at the Rui Cunha Foundation
 
In the Chinese confusion of antiquity, the big names that arise in the immediate are Confucius and Mencius. But this list also includes a man born with the name of Xun Kuang, who would be best known in history as Xun Zi and who is considered one of the great Chinese Confucian philosophers of the ancient period of China.
Carlos Morais José's Macao Books editor now prepares an unprecedented release about the writings and the thinking of this philosopher, as they will first be available in Portuguese. The translation was in charge of Rui Cascais, Gong Yuhong and Carlos Morais José himself, who also did the part of the edition and notes.
The edition of “Mestre Xun Writings” featured the co-edition of the Macau Foundation and will be launched on September 10 in Macau, at the Rui Cunha Foundation. According to a press release released by Books do Meio, it is a “cornerstone of Chinese philosophical thinking finally accessible to the Lusophone reader in definitive edition”.
This is the “first Portuguese language translation of all 32 chapters of the Confucian philosopher Xun Zi (c. 310-c. 235 A.E.C)”, which is a “historical edition that fills a crucial gap in philosophical and synological studies in Portuguese”.
According to the publisher's description, the book "has extensive explanatory notes, critical comments and a comprehensive introduction that sites xun Zi in the context of the period of combating kingdoms and traces its influence throughout history."
“The middle books are proud, after having recently published the last of the four books, to make this classic accessible to Portuguese-speaking readers,” he adds.
A long journey
Translating what Xun Zi left constituted "a journey of several years." The philosopher left a thought based on “rationalism, the defense of culture as an antidote to chaos and an analysis of language”, elements that “resonate in a powerful way today”.
In this translation process, we sought to “capture the accuracy and argumentative force of his text, allowing the Portuguese language reader to face, for the first time in all its extent, one of the most lucid and challenging thinkers of humanity”.
If Mencius, contemporary of Xun Zi, "believed in the innate goodness of the human being," the "master xun" defended, in turn, "that human nature is originally evil (xing ER), and that goodness is acquired through conscious effort, ritualized education (LI) and the orientation of the wise and a just government."
Hence to books from the middle understanding that reading and analyzing Xun Zi allows you to have access to a "deep treaty on ethics, politics, education, language and cosmology, offering surprisingly modern perspectives on the nature of society."
“Xun Zi is an intellectual giant, whose thinking is fundamental to understanding not only Confucianism, but the whole Chinese intellectual history. Publishing his complete works in Portuguese is an editorial framework and a gift for students, academics and all readers who seek to understand the foundations of Chinese civilization,” describes the middle books.
The work has 422 pages and a cost of 200 patacas. Books of the middle focuses on the edition of classic Chinese works translated into Portuguese in areas such as poetry, thought, art, history or ethnology, among others.</description><pubDate>2025-09-02 23:57:46</pubDate></item><item><title>Burlas | Two women lose more than 26 thousand patacas</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/03/burlas-duas-mulheres-perdem-mais-de-26-mil-patacas/</link><description>Two “midfielder” women were circumvented at 26,468 patacas, after believing they were in contact with customer services on the Alipay platform.

The organism that studies the sector, under the raised Ministry of Culture and Tourism of China, estimates that the flow of residents from masters to the interior also increases
 
The Asia Tourism Exchange Center joined the choir of entities that estimate the increase in the flow of tourists between the special administrative regions and China in the second half of this year.
In a study published on Tuesday, the body under the authority of China's Ministry of Culture and Tourism provides for the annual increase of two digits in all forecasts on tourist entries in the second half of 2025.
The new study, which reviews the previous forecasts of the national entity, estimates that Macao will be visited by about 28.5 million tourists in the second half of this year. The new projection represents an increase in half a million tourists compared to the estimate made earlier this year, and a 16.4 percent increase compared to the same period of 2024.
On the other hand, the increase in the number of Macao residents entering China in the second half of 2025 is also foreseen. The central government -linked body points to an increase of 35.5 million to 37.5 million entrances to China, ie a 11.4 percent rise in annual terms.
Regarding the border flow between Hong Kong and the interior of China, an increase of 3.5 million Chinese tourists visiting Raehk is foreseen, compared to the initial estimate for 93.5 million visitors, a total that represents a 13.1 percent increase compared to the second half of 2024.
The Great Photography
Regarding the proportion of tourists per semester, the Asia Tourism Exchange Center estimates that in the general calculation of the tourist movement between the special administrative regions and the interior of China, the second semester occupies between 51 and 54 percent of the total volume of visitors of 2025, “if no sudden incident”. Analysts point out that the evolution of tourist flows follows the growth trend in the first half of 2025.
However, the rise review was justified by the implementation of facilitating measures at the level of border visas and crossings, as well as the performance of activities and attractive festivities in tourist terms. In this chapter, analysts highlight the next national games as another potential factor for the tourist markets of the organizing regions.</description><pubDate>2025-09-03 23:48:09</pubDate></item><item><title>Tencent | Recipes in Hong Kong and Macao climbing</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/03/tencent-receitas-em-hong-kong-e-macau-a-subir/</link><description>The technological company Tencent has revealed that in the last six years the cloud business (data storage) in Hong Kong and Macau has increased every year above 10 percent.

Folklore dance and Portuguese gastronomy will be part of a Macao tourist promotion action in downtown China, from 5 to 8 September, the authorities announced.
The Directorate of Tourism Services (STD) has indicated that Macao Week in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, will bring shows to a popular public square in the historic area of ​​Hankou, one of China's first places open to trade with abroad in 1861.
Among the shows will be the Portuguese Folk Dance Group Association of Portuguese Dances and Singing 'Macao na Coração', “to allow more people in Wuhan to feel the culture and hospitality of Macao,” added STD in a statement.
In the historic area of ​​Hankou, several thematic areas will also be installed, one of which will present products from Portuguese -speaking countries. Macao Week in Wuhan will also feature a gastronomic festival, which will take place between September 5 and October 8, in a Chinese city hotel, STD added in the same note.
Kitchen art
Two Portuguese chefs based in Macau, Herlander Fernandes and Pedro Santos do Carmo will prepare a 'buffet' with Portuguese and macanese dishes, indicated the STD, referring to gastronomy, considered the first fusion kitchen in the world, with many Portuguese descendants and roots in the territory.
Even before Macao's Week in Wuhan, STD, the Macao Trade and Investment Institute and the Special Economic Zone authorities of Hengqin (Mountain Island), located with Macao, will also promote cooperation with Hubei Province.
The three entities will organize a business exchange session and event promotion conference to encourage entrepreneurs from both cities to “deepen the pragmatic exchange” in areas such as tourism, conventions and exhibitions, economics and commerce, STD said.
The Cultural Institute launched in December a public consultation, for 30 days, about the possible registration of 12 demonstrations, including the Portuguese folk dance, on the list of intangible cultural heritage of the territory.
In January, the IC said residents present at a public consultation session on January 7, “agreed, generally with the choice of recommended demonstrations for registration” on the list.
Last Thursday, ICM president and leader of the Cultural Heritage Council, Leong Wai Man, told Lusa that the council had, in a meeting, discussed the final report of the public consultation before the government made a final decision.
The government has advocated the need to bet on the provision of financial services between China and the Lusófono Block, to diversify the economy of the Chinese semi -autonomous region, very dependent on tourism.</description><pubDate>2025-09-03 23:45:05</pubDate></item><item><title>Recipes | Analysts foresee 13% rise in September</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/02/receitas-analistas-preveem-subida-de-13-em-setembro/</link><description>With revenues of 17.25 billion patacas, September 2024 was the worst month of the year for casinos. However, analysts believe that this year the scenario will be different, with revenues around 19.69 billion Patacas
 
In September, casinos' revenues should record an annual growth of 13 percent, according to reports issued by analysts cited by the GGR Asia portal. Estimates are based on revenues of 22.16 billion casinos' patacas in August, the highest value since January 2020, height of the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic.
From the perspective of Deutsche Bank Securities, September revenues are expected to be around US $ 2.45 billion (19.69 billion patacas), which represents an annual increase of 13.6 percent. By 2024, September revenues were 17.25 billion patacas, the smallest of the year.
Estimates by Deutsche Bank analyst Steve Pizzella are more optimistic than those of the general analysts on the market, who believe revenues should grow more slowly at the rate of about 10 percent.
The financial institution also pointed out that despite a growth forecast of 13 percent the estimate is considered as conservative in light of game table trends between 2013 and 2019. Steve Pizzella indicated that taking into account the trends of this period the estimate should point to an increase in annual revenues of 17.5 percent.
Notices against Tuffons
In turn, the Seapres Research Partners financial institution believes September will result in annual revenue growth of around 13 percent. However, the report signed by analyst Vitaly Umnsky warns that the number may be below estimates if new tufts are seen.
"Our estimate may be negatively affected in the case of some typhoon in the region affecting travel to Macau," Vitaly Umnsky wrote. "Last year, September was negatively affected by two major tufts, which was partially offset by high VIP retention," he added.
Seaport also foresees a growth of gross revenues of around 13.5 percent in the second half of the year, compared to 4.4 percent growth between January and June.
Umansky pointed out that growth should result from the greater efficacy of marketing concessionaires and greater flexibility of capital circulation and visa emission to visit the territory.
The analyst also pointed out that a possible trade agreement between the United States and China will inject a new confidence in the Chinese economy, which could result in a greater desire for players to move to Macao and bet more on the tables of the territory.</description><pubDate>2025-09-02 23:56:13</pubDate></item><item><title>GP Consumption | More than 37 thousand seniors with immediate discounts</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/02/gp-consumo-mais-de-37-mil-idosos-com-descontos-imediatos/</link><description>The Directorate of Economics and Technological Development Services (DSEDT) revealed that until 10 am yesterday, more than 37,000 seniors had obtained direct discounts on purchases, under the Grand Prix for Community Zones.

A renovated Ukrainian, with the same name of the president, guilty Zelensky about the extension of the conflict that destroyed his village. Zelensky, the village, who has never left his land, now lives mortified because his favorite gravedigger died in the bomber.
This Zelensky, the village, represents half the world that reproves the other Zelensky, the villain, for not wanting to negotiate with Putin.
Negotiate what? The invader enters us through the house, pies us the wife and daughter (cf. recent UN report on Ukraine violations in this “special operation”), an act that forced us to watch, and then we say: Alto there, we are for peace, but we have to negotiate: You have not said the name you want to give to children!
A peace that is not worthy is but a cessation of rights. As severe as Russophobia that Putin inflicts his people.

In a lunch with several guests I hear a friend, who declares himself a spiritist, explaining about the particularities of his belief, in a serene and balanced way, would even say, without "irrationalism". He discussed long and serenely, devoid of any fanatical proselytizing. “Here is someone to whom belief brought weighting!” I thought, a rare alliance.
However, at one point a phrase that horrify me. He says, “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!” And I enter the voracious fauces of holism. Because holismo has a pathological aspect like all good things, a side of shadow.
Two examples: In Hinduism there is less sensitivity to existential dramas, if that child suffers in this life this is only an expression of the strict karmic symmetry, an effect of the acts she committed in her previous life. In Africa it is not accepted that death may have been accidental, and many women are accused by the dead family of having caused her husband's death, in an act of manifest dementia, and, in the blatant majority of cases, in a huge injustice to his wife - madness that spreads and infiltrates the social fabric.
Buddhism has introduced compassion and Christianity to Caritas, trying to break with this logic, but in many other beliefs and religions the cage of causalities prevails over sensitivity to experience, the need to respond to the now.
It is a tremendous logic that transforms the world into a platonic stage, where we are just the shadows of something -an inextricable law -in a determinism that calcines all singularities, but strangely fascinates many.
The conquest of modernity has anchored in the conquest of chance and random, subtracting the incidences of a life to this fierce determinism that closed the world in a web. When the Renaissance freed the body from the influence of the stars, at this moment sexuality was relieved of guilt and individualism and their volition could emerge.
There is an unequivocal moral implication in the phrase “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!”, Which should work as a key to self-knowledge and self-judgment, but usually this phrase is managed to seek a reason for things abroad for us, in the other. It is an alibi.
There is a holistic temptation in the world today, as in the Middle Ages there was a satanic temptation, without great reflection on its consequences. Because it is not enough we want to connect everything in a resonant chain of affection. Even the most unexpected: affection itself can kill.
I realize, thanks to this cultured, balanced, intelligent woman, that “the combat” moved at the beginning of this century. One of the great misconceptions of the twentieth century was the false dichotomy between "rationalism and irrationalism", a debate that extended to all fields, including art. First, rationality was confused (the positive side of reason) with rationalism (the pathological feature of reason), and articulated in this lack of discernment was confused irrationalism with freedom. Almost all the art of the twentieth century, with surrealism to the head, worked in this error. The fallacy still exists despite having consolidated the emergence of 'irrationalism' and the consequent relativist currents that followed it. Essentially much of what happened in the twentieth century, it turned around this shock between two paradigms: rationalism versus irrationalism.
Now, I see, the indetermination, chance, the random of the terrible temptation of the causal cage. Holism, in its pathological feature, can be the reductionism that is the way it puts the way as a new 'eschatological narrative'.
Is it "by chance" that holism emerges at the moment when neo-liberalism and its cynical contempt for the human person besides all freedoms, all acquired rights?
Holistic consciousness has brought positively a greater ecological awareness but followed by scholastic rigor drifting reality under the blanket of a determinism that is much more than inconvenience: all great authoritarian ideologies are holistic.
My friend will know how to combine her holistic and transpersonal belief with the freedom and responsibility that every moment asks us - but how many will make the destruction, under a law that explains and encompasses everything?
How many will not be abandoned to what it is?
The awareness of the indeterminate brings tragic conscience, as the Greeks knew, but also brings the will and the courage of the decision. And of this we cannot abdicate.
In addition, as Drummond shows in Carlos Drummond de Andrade's poem “Quadrilha”:
"John loved Teresa who loved Raimundo/ who loved Maria who loved Joaquim who loved Lili/ who did not love anyone./ John went to the United States, Teresa to the convent,/ Raimundo died of disaster, Maria stayed to aunt,/ Joaquim suicide himself and Lili married J. Pinto Fernandes/ who had not entered the story."
Real always runs outside the track, in full exteriority to our concepts. This is what is worth a J. Pinto Fernandes at the exact moment we thought we had everything under control.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Nobel and others</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/17/do-nobel-e-outros/</link><description>9/10/22
Reading many people's reactions when the Nobel Prize in this year's literature was announced, I couldn't help but remind me of this repair of Jean-Pierre Siméon, in relation to another Nobel Prize: “An editor of a large national newspaper wrote five lines of indignation because the Nobel Prize for Literature, a complete stranger. But unknown to whom? How did not occur to this patented and paid literary columnist to do his work, that his apparent ignorance was a matter of incorrect professional conduct? Tranströmer was translated into many languages, it was available in French. »
There is always the choir of those waiting for the announcement of the prize to complain about not being invited to the jury of it, there is a subgroup of Irados that professes “I never read and I will not bother to read”; It is an uncommon fauna, which inhabits social networks.
I do not always know all the winners-I was unaware of the existence of Louise Glück, who I find a great poet, or the Olga Tokarczuk, for example-but it only brings me the comfort of knowing that the world is not a soap opera where everyone knows each other and the joy of recognizing that the gauge of the world is not measured with my short measure and that on the contrary it gives me a new opportunity to face the unknown.
And perhaps the most cretin of reactions was the smart one who wrote, but there are still those who read French? Confirming only that today there is a new kind of ignorance that fires with a displeasure: the one who only read English.
I would also prefer that, in French, Pascal Quignard, Linda reads, or even Sollers, or, among the new ones, Mathias is awarded, but that does not take dignity to the work of Annie Ernaux (and it would be enough to have written the “Les Années”). There are books of her that I like less, like the vulgar "a simple passion," but this happens with almost every authors, they have a channel books and others that are like intervals in their itinerary. I advise reading a beautiful book of interviews with her, "L'Ecriture Comme un couteau".

The summary they made of the book does not even deserve comments, by pathetic, but what matters to highlight is the note of disqualification about their "Mozambicanity" by calling it Luso-Mozambican. It is not inaccurate, but for those who know the context, it is a dirty touch.
Because finally, following the same logic, Adelino Timóteo should be called Tsonga-Mozambican, to Álvaro Taruma-Mozambican, and Macua-Mozambican to the writers who are from the north, etc., etc. Which is not reported to happen.
At the beyond moment, in the soap opera, she writes:
«Our color has never been dominant. In colonial time we were not white, we were ripped from monories, gone mugs, the pejorative term to speak of a son of Goes and Portuguese. In the postcolonial period, I was not black and if, in Lisbon, they took me by Brazilian or Cape Verdean, already in France were lost in cogitations of where they would be and amazed when they found out it was African. There I had to explain my DNA's wanderings before relying on moorms. It took me a long time to accept that it was so because yes, and that it was no curse that were so; On the contrary, I could even discover intense patterns of fantasy and freedom in this shrewd cloak that is our genealogy… »
In the current Mozambique it is white… and this is overlapping it soon to what it does or what it is.
It is sad, but as Naipaul warned, through these stops the race is everything and is soaked in it as deeply as, elsewhere, in religion.

Bruno Latour, an anthropologist who studied the sciences and their procedures and legitimations, law, technique and religions died and entertained themselves to turn the guts to the dogmas of the “modern”. For him the place, the expert's function, was more defined by the perplexity he embodied than for the supposed truth he would support him.
He proposed, as an alternative to the kinds of multiculturalism and his mistaken password "all different all the same", the return to "diplomacy", given precisely, not from the presupposition that "we are unified because participants of the same nature" but simply reveal that we "do not yet share an ordinary world"; It is necessary to deal frontally with the "abyss of disagreement" that separates us, rather than wanting to delude it.
And about politics said, disassessedly:
«If transparency is required from the politician, we kill him; If one requires fidelity to what the other was or he says, kills him; If a mimetic relationship is required between what the crowd wants and what its representative says, the representation is killed. These must, therefore, by definition, betray, deceive, modify, distort the word. Without this ability to double the word and betray, political language would not exist. I put the perfectly plausible hypothesis that political vocabulary will become as inaccessible as the religious language of the last twenty, three or fifty years. (in “UN Monde Pluriel plus Commun”). I believe it will be missed to decipher this frantically complex world that fit us.</description><pubDate>2022-10-17 02:18:03</pubDate></item><item><title>The yo -yo</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/30/o-fuxi/</link><description>O my friends, companions of these funerals trips to countries as old as the stars and the moon, and as strange as the profound interior of our disgraceful souls, - that startle still awaits us, what secret spells we will have to overcome, what horrors will rise to our dilated pupils of amazement and terror?
Increasingly close to our precarious existences, howling the war monster, which threatens to merge humanity with the earth, incessantly traveled by the squalid spectrum of hunger and the invisible evil of ten thousand pests.
O human human, who cries superior to his own nature, but then reveals to you, once and again, unable to simply order your existence and do not understand that you are possessed by the fickle wrath and are slave to your own ambition! Do not be content with the white jade or the light gold, there is no treasure that gives you your inextinguishable thirst for other men, animals and things; for in you an eternal anguish in you; in you crawl the expelled snakes; For you grows, powerful and impossible, the very fertile ivy of evil!
This is perhaps why on the mound they call the white deer, where one of the eight immortals in sacred mount was evolved through the skies to Penglai, inhabits the fuxa, a bird whose form resembles that of the rooster, although topped by a human head. What strange copulas, what monstrous amplexes, what terrible procedures will have occurred to make the existence of this animal sinister possible? We do not know, but it is enough for our exhausted mind to dare to raise an answer, so we soon feel the skin traveled by horrendous goose bumps and the heart trigger in paraded, which wild horse beaten by the night whip of fear, oblivious to reins and containment.
May men refrain from going through the Mount of the deer, because although there are riches capable of calming the most misunderstanding ambitions, if they have the disgraced fortunate to glimpse a fuxa, it will be immediately triggered the cultivated fields, because it will be beheaded the soft animals, for it will be sacrificed the best young man and destroyed superb from countries.
Fuxi emits a sound that resembles its name. If you hear it, dark night or clear day, goose way, for the path where you find you is the most right of the ways for misfortune!</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Procrastinators Club</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/29/clube-dos-procrastinadores/</link><description>Walking in rereading of Easter, because of an article I prepare, I give this excerpt, extracted from “the universal man”:
«Every man morally is one and absolute; But you have to live with your personality to mitigate. (…) Coexistence is only possible among people reduced to a negative or hollow presence, which is constantly giving in. Hence, the emptiness of society, a huge ghost composed of numerous deceased. An upper man is antisocial or criminal. Its destination is jail and desert.
He is in thinking about whether she reflects here about the political-social conditioning that gagging, and worse, in a sad country as Portugal was in the middle of the Estado Novo (and the book is from 1931) where any possibilities of spontaneity and frankness in human relations were coarcet, or only lends the behavior of men (oppressed) a metaphysical frame, a “essence”, from a presumption of each one in the presumption of each one be in isolation “one and absolute”. Sometimes, to an excess of spirituality (or longing), it adds to Pascoaes to lack the world. He is a great poet, but he is a poet who takes gray-Jewish ampoules and is therefore written amiiude on a programmatic furor, ceasing to have pores; There is often a glass between him and the real, the same one who made him wring the Ballet, 1921: “Everything is ghost. There are only clouds, clouds of voices, clouds of souls, afflictions and tragedies! Clouds and more clouds, appearances and more appearances! It is a divine lightning that pierces them, the instant appearance that arises and throws us to the ground, dazzled! »
Sometimes I would like to remind him, as Antonio Sérgio did in the article “Regeneration and Tradition, Moral and Economy”, which dedicated to Easter: “Easter, Easter my dear friend: You are a pure, excellent and noble poet, but also a victim of this social environment, like us all: this horrible isolation that you praise and I”.
"As a child, he stole two melos," says Jacinto do Prado Coelho, stole him from a nest, and throb his lifetime remorse for it. The person, few more mischief is known to him. Only in Álvaro de Campos sprouts a twinge of evil and obscenity: “Oh, and ordinary and dirty people who always seem the same,/ who employs profanity as usual words,/ whose children steal at the grocery door/ and whose daughters at eight years-and I think this is beautiful and I love him! -/ masturbate decent -looking men on the stairs. » (Ode triumphal).
Both poets beaten by a certain idea of ​​holiness, they were identical to the inability of breaking the siege of the skin with the overflow of the dike, the same curse of sublimating Eros's concrete ferocity with the mansuity of the verses.
Of course, they are the two "Bigger Than Life", but sometimes unnerves to watch, from my rank of hatter at the Procrastinators Club, to the tantrums between them, just to see who occupies, in the internal organization, the place of president and treasurer.
Although a person has guessed more, for example, this he wrote in the least known martial ode and that is declining in the situation we live today, differently, with the heart in his hands:
«Ode martial

The sewing machine of the poor widow killed to the bayonet…

What is clear today, at this disastrous moment when Cristiano &amp; Company failed in their mission in Braga, and where the self-sabotage of Russia pipelines recalls that Putin will even be willing to maintain dominion over referendum zones,

After days of incidents and riots in which nearly 4,000 protesters were arrested and dozens were injured, the Indonesian women's alliance called a new protest yesterday in front of the House of Representatives.
The protests began on August 25 in Jakarta, when a salary increase was announced for Indonesia deputies, in a context of serious economic difficulties for much of the population.
The demonstrations intensified after the death of a motorcycle taxi driver in the capital, on Thursday, run over by a police car, and so far have made six dead. International Human Rights Defense Organizations, such as Amnesty International, estimate that at least ten people died during the protests.
At least 20 people are missing, a local human rights organization said on Tuesday. Kontras stated that the 20 people disappeared in Jakarta and in the cities of Bandung, and Deceok, the latter located with the capital, as well as in a "unknown place."
Aposi at dialogue
President Prabowo Subiano announced on Sunday the revocation of various privileges for members of Parliament, including cost aid and a moratorium on business trips abroad. On Monday, the UN Human Rights Office asked the Indonesian authorities to guarantee the right to peaceful meeting and the freedom of information and expression in former state-state protests in the country.
"We emphasize the importance of dialogue to address citizens' concerns," said Cabinet spokesman Ravina Shamdasani, in a statement, stressing that authorities must ensure the maintenance of the order "according to international standards and standards."
Meenakshi Ganguly, the assistant director for Asia of the Human Rights Defense Organization Human Rights Watch, said on Tuesday that the authorities "acted irresponsibly in treating protests as acts of betrayal or terrorism, especially given the long historial of the unnecessary and unnecessary security forces."</description><pubDate>2025-09-04 00:07:40</pubDate></item><item><title>Thailand | Thailand interim PM starts Parliament dissolution</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/04/tailandia-pm-interino-da-tailandia-inicia-dissolucao-do-parlamento/</link><description>Thailand's interim prime minister Phumtham Wechayachai yesterday began a process to dissolve Parliament after the main opposition party supported a rival candidate for government leadership.
Wechayachai “filed a decree to dissolve the House,” France-Presse news agency Sorawong Thiienthong, secretary general of Pheu Thai, party of the first-rate minister last week, Paetongtarn Shinawatra.
Paetongtarn Shinawatra, daughter of the powerful tyksin Shinawatra, was deprived of the position of Prime Minister on Friday by the Constitutional Court. The former leader was suspended from office in July, on charges of not defending Thailand during a call with former Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen, who was released on the internet.
Pheu Thai had tried to negotiate the formation of a new government with the main opposition movement, the Popular Party, which has 143 places in Parliament.
This party succeeded the Move Forward Party (MFP), which won the largest number of places in the 2023 elections in Thailand. Move Forward, accused of the crime of Lesa-Majesty, was dissolved after campaigning to reduce military influence and reform the harsh laws of Thailand's Lesa-Majesty.
But the Popular Party announced support to conservative tycoon Anutin Charnvirakul, leader of the Bhumjaithai party to become the country's next prime minister. Bhumjaithai was part of the coalition in power, but withdrew support to Paetongtarn Shinawatra, due to the border dispute with Cambodia.</description><pubDate>2025-09-04 00:06:07</pubDate></item><item><title>Russia | Kremlin expects Trump's irony about “conspiracy” with Xi Jinping and Kim Jong-un</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/04/russia-kremlin-espera-ironia-de-trump-sobre-conspiracao-com-xi-jinping-e-kim-jong-un/</link><description>Kremlin said yesterday expecting US President Donald Trump to have been ironic in accusing Chinese, Russian, and North Korean leaders of “conspiring against the United States” during a military parade in Beijing.
"I believe the [US] president said this with a certain deal of irony when he said the three of them would be conspiring against the US," Russian president of Russian president, cited by the Russian state press, said Iuri Uchakov. "I want to clarify that no one conspired or plotted whatever it is," he said.
The comment came after a Trump publication on the Truth Social network, in which he wrote: "I ask you to convey my most warm greetings to Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un while conspiring against the United States," China President Xi Jinping.
The president's statement was made during the Beijing celebrations of the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II in the Pacific, marked by a military stop at Tiananmen Square and the presence of several world leaders, including Putin, Kim and Iran President Masud Pezeshkian.
Trump also accused China of "not recognizing" the sacrifice of US soldiers in the war against Japan. On the eve, XI and Putin gathered during the summit of the Shangoi Cooperation Organization, held in the coastal city of Tianjin, where they reiterated the reinforcement of the Sino-Russian strategic partnership.

According to Chinese economic portal Yicai, the Chinese furniture chain branch has invested approximately 673 million Yuan with this goal over the last two years.
The company plans to launch hundreds of new products and open smaller stores in several Chinese cities, which will also function as order centers and offer personalized 'design' services. Analysts cited by the same medium underline that the Chinese retailer market remains “highly competitive” and that success involves “developing more affordable products”.
"We continue to invest to lower our prices in China compared to other countries. (…) China is one of the countries where we are most investing," Bloomberg director of Ingka Group told Bloomberg, who controls most Ikea stores worldwide.
IKEA currently faces a context marked by the weak demand of consumers, the crisis in the real estate sector and the deceleration of the economy, in an environment where local brands offer similar - often inspired by IKEA - at lower prices and through electronic trade platforms.
Although Ikea has reduced prices globally, discounts in China are particularly relevant, which is one of the company's 10 main markets, representing 3.5 percent of its global sales.

China expressed Tuesday support for Iran in the conflict with Europe because of Tehran's nuclear program at a Beijing Meeting of President XI Jinping with Iranian counterpart, Masoud Pezeshkian.
China “respects the right to use nuclear power for peaceful purposes” and seeks a solution to the Iranian nuclear issue that “take into account the legitimate concerns from all over”, said XI.
The Chinese leader also said that China, who threatens to invade Taiwan if the island declares independence, opposes the use of force to resolve conflict.
"The use of force is not the correct way to solve disputes. Communication and dialogue are the only proper way to achieve lasting peace," Xi told Pezeshkian, according to a report by Chinese state television CCTV.
China, Iran's main commercial partner, said it opposes an initiative of Germany, France and the United Kingdom that could result in the replacement of sanctions against the Islamic Republic. The three European countries launched last week a mechanism that began a 30 -day process to repay the sanctions that were suspended 10 years ago.
The decision came after weeks of warnings about the alleged violations by the 2015 Iran with the great powers, which aimed to limit the Tehran Nuclear Program. The sanctions were suspended under the agreement.
Western countries accuse Iran will intend to provide nuclear weapons, a goal denied by Tehran, who claims to have the right to have a civil nuclear program. "China values ​​the commitment reiterated by Iran not to look for nuclear weapons," Xi told Pezeshkian according to Chinese television, also cited by the Spanish news agency Efe.
Enemy fire
Iran suspended cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (AIEA), the UN nuclear supervision agency, after Israel launched a 12 -day war against the country in June. Israel sought to destroy the nuclear abilities of Iran, which was also attacked by the United States with the same goal.
The Shanghai Cooperation Organization, in which China, Iran and Russia participate, warned Monday against efforts to reinterpret the United Nations Resolution that approves the 2015 Iranian Nuclear Agreement.
“Any attempt to misinterpret or arbitrarily reinterpret this resolution will undermine UN Security Council authority,” said the 10 eurasiatic leaders after a summit held in Tianjin, China.

Marking the 80th anniversary of the victory in the Chinese people's resistance war against Japanese aggression and the World Antifascist War, September 3, 2025 is a solemn day for China and the world honor the history and the dead, and reaffirm the search for peace and justice.
Eighty years ago, facing an extremely difficult environment, the heroic Chinese people fought and won a formidable war against Japanese aggression. More than 35 million Chinese soldiers and civilians were killed or injured in the war, leaving behind a lasting legacy of sacrifice for global peace.
This victory marked a turning point: for the Chinese nation, ended a spiral of decline that lasted a century and opened the doors for rejuvenation; For the world, he guaranteed the defeat of fascism.
An old Chinese saying says, "Do not make others what you do not want to do yourself." Having supported invasions and oppression, the Chinese people began to embrace an even stronger commitment to peace and justice.
At the 1955 Bandung Conference, China promoted the approach to "looking for points in common and setting aside differences", encouraging unity and cooperation between newly independent nations. The conference signaled the world's political awakening and showed China's commitment to promote more egalitarian international relations.
In the following decades, China firmly supported national liberation movements around the world: supporting Algeria's independence, helping Vietname resist US interference, expressing solidarity with the Palestinian people, opposing apartheid in South Africa and so on. All of this gave a practical meaning to the spirit of internationalism.
As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, China actively participates in the mediation of delicate issues, promotes the peaceful resolution of differences and disputes between countries and has always been a world peace builder. China firmly defends the UN -centered international system and actively works for a fairer and more equitable international order.
In recent decades, China's rapid development has also created opportunities for the world in general. Since its renovation and openness, China's economy has grown over 300 times, becoming the second largest economy in the world. For years, China has contributed about 30% to global annual economic growth. In the age of economic globalization, China is not only a beneficiary, but also a key promoter and taxpayer for global prosperity.
However, almost 800 million Chinese came out of poverty, representing three rooms of world poverty reduction in the same period. In 2021, Chinese President Xi Jinping announced that China had reached a "complete victory" in its fight against poverty. Thus, China met the goal of eradication of poverty established on the 2030 Agenda for the UN sustainable development, 10 years ahead of expected.
As the world's largest developing country and a natural member of the Global South, China closely links its own development to the dreams of revitalizing a large number of developing countries.
The Range and Route (IFR) initiative connected Asia, Africa, Latin America, Pacific Islands and other countries with new development opportunities. Roads, railways, ports and energy projects brought tangible benefits, while training programs and digital innovations have paved new paths for modernization.
Today's world is undergoing changes never seen in a century. Global recovery remains fragile, the difference in development increases, environmental challenges get worse, and the Cold War mindset still persists. In this context, an important question that all nations face is: what kind of world we should build and how?
China proposed the vision of building a community with a shared future for humanity. Through initiatives such as IFR, the global development initiative, the global security initiative, the global civilization initiative and the global governance initiative, China promotes growth, peace and safety cooperation, as well as the exchange between peoples. His efforts reflect a commitment to inclusion, mutual benefit and respect for diversity and gained broad international support, especially among developing countries.
China's firm commitment to peaceful development and mutually beneficial cooperation is deeply rooted in its millennial civilization. History shows that the tide of peace and development cannot be reversed. China will remain on the path of peaceful development and work hard to build a brighter common future in conjunction with all nations.</description><pubDate>2025-09-03 23:56:24</pubDate></item><item><title>China celebrates 80th anniversary of the end of World War II with huge military parade</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/03/china-celebra-80o-aniversario-do-fim-da-ii-guerra-mundial-com-enorme-parada-militar/</link><description>Chinese President Xi Jinping said today that the “rejuvenation of the Chinese nation is unstoppable” during a military parade in Beijing that featured Russian leaders Vladimir Putin and North Korea Kim Jong-un.
"The rejuvenation of the Chinese nation is unstoppable and the noble cause of peace and the development of humanity will certainly triumph," Xi said, in a speech before tens of thousands of people in Tiananmen Square.
"The world facing a choice between peace and war, dialogue and confrontation," added the Chinese leader, in a moment of growing geopolitical tensions and challenges to the international postwar order.
In a brief speech, Xi recalled the victims of World War II (1939-1945) and called on the eradication of the causes of war to prevent the repetition of history. The main message, however, was the affirmation of China's role in the world: "The Chinese people are a people who do not fear violence, they are self -sufficient and strong," he said.
"We will follow the path of peaceful development and work hand in hand with the peoples of all countries to build a community of future shared for humanity," he said. The parade began after the Xi speech, with troops marching in a rhythmic step on Chang'an Avenue, for the Head of State magazine, which also chairs the central military commission.
XI traveled the military alignment in a classic black limo, greeting the soldiers and columns of missiles and armored vehicles, while they responded in unison with slogans like "we serve the people."
The event featured the exhibition of missiles, modern fighters and other military equipment, many of which are shown to the public for the first time, in a sign of the growing weight that China wants to take on the international stage. The ceremony began with an 80 artillery shot and the execution of the National Anthem, “Volunteer March”, composed in 1935 during resistance to the Japanese invasion.
Xi arrived at the door of Tiananmen with the guests of honor, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. The three of them climbed together to the Tribune of Honor after individually welcoming five World War II veterans, some over 100 years old.
During the parade, US President Donald Trump questioned on social networks whether Xi would recognize the contribution of US soldiers in the conflict, and mocked: "Transmit my warm greetings to Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un while consuming against the United States of America."
In his speech, Xi did not mention the United States, but thanked the support of foreign countries that helped China in the resistance against the Japanese invasion.
The parade, in addition to showing military strength, also aims to reinforce internal support to the Communist Party and project China as an alternative to the US dominated international order since the postwar.
Thousands of people watched the stop from the delimited areas in Tiananmen Square, waving red flags as they came down patriotic songs such as "defending the Yellow River" and "There is no new China without the Communist Party."</description><pubDate>2025-09-03 20:41:59</pubDate></item><item><title>Ukraine | Putin refuses peace agreement for security reasons</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/03/ucrania-putin-recusa-acordo-de-paz-por-questoes-de-seguranca/</link><description>The Russian President reaffirmed in Beijing yesterday the refusal to compromise Russia's security with a peace agreement with Ukraine, which Moscow invaded in February 2022. "It is a decision by Ukraine to choose how to secure her safety," Vladimir Putin said during a meeting with Slovak Prime Minister Robert, television broadcast.
"But its safety ... It cannot be guaranteed over the security of other countries, including Russia," he added, repeating an argument he has used since he ordered the neighboring country's invasion.
Ukraine, which has called for adhesion to NATO, which Russia opposes itself, aims to obtain security guarantees to dissuade Moscow to again invade the country in the framework of an agreement that allows the end of the ongoing war.
Ukraine received security guarantees in 1994, under the Budapest Memorandum, which signed with Russia, the United States and the United Kingdom in exchange for the Soviet nuclear arsenal parked on its territory. The agreement did not prevent Ukraine's invasion of Russia in 2014, when he attached the Crimea Peninsula and sponsored a separatist movement in Donbass (east), and in February 2022.
Putin and I am in Beijing to watch the military parade that will celebrate the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II (1939-1945), which will preside over the President of the Popular Republic of China, Xi Jinping (see pages 10-11).
He will also watch the parade, among other guests, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, who arrived at Beijing yesterday in a armored train from Pyongyang, in one of his rare trips abroad.
European fantasies
When he met, Putin stated that suspicions that Russia plans to launch an attack on another European country beyond Ukraine are "complete nonsense that has absolutely no foundation."
Putin accused the Europeans, whom he called "horror movies", to try to continually provoke "hysteria about Russia's alleged intention to attack Europe," according to the Spanish news agency Efe.
The Russian leader said that "anyone in their right mind knows perfectly perfectly that Russia has never had, has no and will never have the desire to attack anyone." "This is a provocation or complete incompetence," Putin said, also quoted by the Spanish agency Europa Press.
He again insisted that the conflict in Ukraine did not start with the 2022 invasion, but with an alleged “coup of state” in Kiev in 2014, when pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych was deposed by a pro-European movement.
It also reaffirmed that Ukraine's entry into the NATO is inadmissible, while never opposed the entrance of the neighboring country, something I also supported. Putin accused the Atlantic alliance of trying to absorb “practically the entire post-soviet space”, which includes Ukraine. "We had to react," he said, alluding to the decision to have Ukraine invaded.
Margin of maneuver
Despite the differences, Putin admitted to margin for a consensus on the security guarantees required by Kiev. He said this was one of the points discussed with US homologist Donald Trump at the unprecedented meeting in Alaska on August 15.
Putin was open to collaborating with the United States on other fronts, particularly in the management of the Zaporijia Nuclear Center, considered the largest in Europe and taken by Russian forces for over three years. "If the circumstances allow it, we could cooperate three in the central," he said, with a view to potential alliance between Russia, Ukraine and the United States.</description><pubDate>2025-09-03 00:12:02</pubDate></item><item><title>Seoul says that two thousand North Koreans died in the conflict in Ukraine</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/03/seul-diz-que-dois-mil-norte-coreanos-morreram-no-conflito-na-ucrania/</link><description>About two thousand North Korean soldiers died in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, according to information released yesterday by South Korea's military information services.
In April, "they estimated the death toll in at least 600," but based on updated estimates, "now estimates the number by about two thousand," Deputy Lee Seong-kweun told journalists after a meeting with the National Intelligence Service (NIS, South Korean acronym.
During the meeting at the closed door of the Parliamentary Intelligence Committee, NIS estimated that Pyongyang has so far sent about 15,000 soldiers to Russia.
According to deputies from the two main parties, cited by the South Korean news agency Yonhap, NIS believes that North Korea is preparing a third detachment of about six thousand men, including a thousand sappers who have already come ahead of battle.
North Korean official news agency KCNA reported on Saturday that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un had talked the day before with relatives of soldiers killed in the fight against Ukraine in support of Russia. Kim had already met some of them the week before, in another public ceremony in honor of the military.
Tight ties
Russia and North Korea consolidated bilateral ties by signing a mutual defense pact last year during a visit by Russian President Pyongyang. In April, North Korea confirmed for the first time that it had sent a contingent of soldiers to the front line in Ukraine to fight alongside the Russian troops.
The North Korean leader yesterday crossed the border with China aboard his armored train, heading to Beijing, to participate in an important military parade with Chinese and Russian presidents. The North Korean leader will be in Beijing to participate in the Military Parade, which will be held today and will also be attended by Russian President Vladimir Putin.

After a session this week that highlighted the former Fai Chi Kei Public Housing Complex, Manuel Vicente, Jorge Figueira today approaches the Rui Cunha Foundation O Legado de Nuno Portas
 
Today participates in the Conference “Nuno Portas: From Architecture to Urbanism, from man to city”. What legacy did this Portuguese architect have left?
Nuno Portas is someone who in the late 1950s has a critical activity that is totally innovative and pioneer in the Portuguese context. Then, in the 1960s, he had a more international activity, having been the first to publicize the work of Siza Vieira. That's when he had the first contacts with Spanish and Italian architects, fundamentally. Also in these years he wrote two books that were also unusual, such as “Architecture for Today” in 1964, and “City as Architecture” from 1969. They were also an extraordinary way to try to catch what was going on in terms of international currents in architecture. But then there was also a [important] activity as an architect alongside Nuno Teotónio Pereira, namely in the work of the Church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, in Lisbon, and in a house in Vila Viçosa. Then, with April 25, 1974, he was appointed Secretary of State for Housing and Urbanism and launches the Saal - Outpatient Services to Local Support, a completely revolutionary social housing program, according to the spirit of the time. Then Nuno Portas devoted himself more to the issues of urbanism and not so much of architecture. He was linked to the beginning of Expo 98. It turns out to be someone who in the last 20 years of his work has more scientific and sociological concerns, and less artistic. It's something you had from the beginning, but then it becomes the hundred of your activity.
Did Nuno Portas have a relationship with Macau?
I think relationships would not be so intense compared to other architects and contexts, but we know that Nuno Portas was in Macao at the government's invitation to a conference between 2001 and 2002. It is interesting because of this passage we have echoes of what happened, as his surprise when discovering the Ellen Liang orphanage of Manuel Vicente, he did not know. It was the first work of Manuel Vicente in Macau, from the 60s, and we know that Nuno Portas was thrilled to visit this work, especially the small chapel that exists in the orphanage. It is interesting because there was no direct relationship between Manuel Vicente and Nuno Portas, they are very different poles figures, and even opposite. There is also an interesting and positive reference to the Siza [Vieira, Expansion Plan of the city of Macao (Areia Preta and Outdoor Port, 1982], and when Nuno Portas visits Macau is being built. It is interesting to have commented on this plan because in the 60s and 70s the relationship between Nuno Portas and Siza Vieira was no longer the same, and the fact that he had made complimentary references to Siza is very interesting.
He was a student of Nuno Portas. What other aspects of your career or personality can highlight?
I also worked with him. He was a cultured man, very intelligent and with an overwhelming memory. It was someone who liked to provoke, but in a good way, to discuss, to counteract. I was lucky enough to maintain a dialogue with him for decades, and this is my personal knowledge that I will convey. I also notice that it was a man very close to the power of Lisbon, the parties, but always very independent. He was a personal friend of Jorge Sampaio, he was secretary of state, but never had great political protagonism. On the one hand, this is due to his independence, but on the other he was such a controversial and intelligently restless figure that I think power was also startled by him.
This week also spoke at the “Lisbon, Porto, Macau, Maputo: Heroic Collective Housing from the 60s &amp; 70s” conference. How do you describe Macau's public housing projects in those years?
There are many architects that I could talk about, but I focused on Manuel Vicente's work in Macau, namely the public housing complex at Fai Chi Kei, which was demolished and then gave rise to the project of Rui Leão and Carlota Bruni. I did not speak concretely about Portuguese or Macanese architects, we also have names such as José Ways. Also because the Portuguese architects have always been few in Portugal, and from the 1950s there were about 150, then greatly increasing in number. But I made [at the conference] a tribute to the Portuguese architects who built during this period, because in a complex territory and with their vicissitudes, different from those that existed in Portugal, they knew how to do architectural experiences in the field of extraordinary public housing. I tried to demonstrate what was happening in Lisbon, Porto, Macao and Lourenço Marques, currently Maputo, in different ways. In Macao, relations were established, which I call heroic, in the sense that they were relations of experimental architecture, in which people had to adapt, to have their own spirit. These are architectures already with a little history, as it has passed 50 or 60 years, but the examples we find in these cities have continued to be remarkable.
What projects highlight these years?
I talked about Gonçalo Byrne's housing development “Pantera Pantera” in Chelas, Lisbon. I showed the “five fingers”, by Vítor Figueiredo, also from Lisbon, and the “Bouça neighborhood”, from Siza Vieira, in Porto. I showed Manuel Vicente's Fai Chi Kei complex and a Pancho Guedes project in Mozambique. Although they are already distant in time, these are architectures that remain fundamental references of the cultural and architectural points of view. There is a kind of narrative luck to be able to talk about such different sites, and with such different architects, and show how they had this heroic, experienced, even radical, experienced side that had the architecture of this particular period.
Has Macao had a positive evolution with regard to public housing supply?
I arrived in August and have been visiting the territory in recent years, so I have been following this process a little. Macao is obviously an extraordinary territory and from the outset by the coexistence of very different cultures regarding housing, which here has a completely different scale and expression of the Portuguese. In Portugal there is an aversion to public housing towers, it has always been unusual and the results that are known have not been successful for various reasons. But in Macao this is exactly what we see, public housing in towers and with a very strong expression. This has to do with the characteristics of the territory and also with a certain culture of China and Hong Kong. This is not to say that everything that is being built in Macau is good, there are towers and buildings with less interesting solutions or that result from a certain repetition. But there is no city that only has good architecture or good public housing. The challenge is to solve the large -scale housing problem, something that must be studied and thought. It is beautiful and overwhelming to see that Macau is a territory that grows day after day and it is exciting to observe this from the point of view of architecture. This is what I am doing, working on future projects.
Analysis projects, or academic?
Yes, I am a teacher and researcher at the University of Coimbra and columnist for the public newspaper, so my work is very much to analyze and investigate. I already published a lot about Macau and I want to resume some ends that I left to solve, let's say. I am very stimulated with everything I have seen and the people I have spoken with, and maybe I will increase my work on the territory from an academic point of view and at the plan of the investigation.
At a time when Portugal has a chronic housing problem, with a lack of public housing, could Macau be an example?
No directly, because of the typological issue of the housing tower. It might not be a welcome model in the Portuguese context. But no doubt Portugal needs to learn from other experiences and other territories and need to find solutions. Surely what happens in Hong Kong and Macau are experiences that are very interested in knowing, not to replicate, but to realize that this is a global problem [the lack of housing].
Remember Nuno Portas
The Rui Cunha Foundation (FRC) receives today, from 6.30 pm, the Conference “Nuno Portas: From Architecture to Urbanism, from man to city”, with Jorge Figueira. It will be time to talk about a route that the newly failed architect began in 1959, with a text about the new generation of the modern movement in Portugal. Texts followed in the 1960s and 70s with “scientific approaches”, with Nuno doors to a walk between architecture and urbanism, always in a reflective way. Nuno Portas was a “multifaceted figure, better known for launching the Saal Social Housing Program, which is still the target of investigation and an example”, describes Jorge Figueira in a note. The speaker is linked to the Center Social Studies and Department of Architecture of the University of Coimbra.</description><pubDate>2025-09-03 23:33:07</pubDate></item><item><title>Anabela Santiago, Academic: “China is a reformist and moderate”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/30/anabela-santiago-academica-a-china-e-reformista-e-moderada/</link><description>Anabela Santiago has just defended at the University of Aveiro the doctoral thesis that analyzes how China has been positioned in recent decades as an important actor in the “global health governance”. Today, Beijing seeks “alternative mechanisms” of cooperation in the “global south” and tries to build an alternative model to the World Health Organization
 
 
Let's start with the concept of Global Health Governance (GGS). Is this a more contemporary concept or relating to the post-war period and the Foundation of the World Health Organization (WHO)? What have been the main actors of this governance until China's growth?
GGS is a concept whose prominence and relevance have grown significantly in the 21st century, largely driven by economic globalization and worldwide interconnection. Although global health has always transcended national borders, demanding multidisciplinary approaches and international cooperation, only from the 1990s it was made greater awareness of it. Historically, GGS has been predominantly influenced by western powers and neoliberal values. The main actors of this governance, until China's growth, were historically marked by interventions of entities such as WHO and non-governmental, predominantly American and European organizations.
One of the findings of its doctoral thesis is that China has been progressively positioning itself in this leadership. This position started specifically when and why?
Yes, China has been progressively positioned as a relief actor in the evolution of the GG system. Although it is not possible to point out an exact date of start, China has evolved from a relatively isolated country to a main actor in global political, economic and technological arenas. Its growing economic and political influence also represents a change in GGS's historical dynamics, and in the 1960s China tried to play a humanitarian health care role in neighboring countries and Africa. The thesis points out that China's experience can be seen as an example of what is achievable when a state chooses its own way rather than a pre-established model, aligning itself with the 21st century prediction as the "century of Asia."
Did the pandemic years influence this position? How?
Covid-19 pandemic highlighted the need for global health cooperation, as well as the potential consequences of the failure to prioritize global health. The thesis explores the evolution of the Health Silk Route before and after the pandemic, indicating that the pandemic years allowed greater awareness of the need for instruments such as the Health Silk Route as the most effective cooperation platforms among nations. Although not detailed in this specific section, it is implicit that the pandemic intensified China's performance in health diplomacy and health development assistance.
Looking at the internal reforms that China has carried out in the health area, which highlights as the most important?
I approach, in the thesis, the reforms of the China Health System and I point out that the Chinese governance model is a unique combination of state -oriented economic reforms and development by the state, incorporating elements of neoliberalism and authoritarianism into political issues in general, and the health sector is nothing different from the rest. One of China's mentioned contributions, recognized by WHO, is its primary health care model based on the recognized good practice of “barefoot doctors” (barefoot doctors). In addition, the thesis analyzes the main reform policies and their progress and challenges in the period 2009-2018, which comprise the reforms of primary health care, hospital and pharmaceutical reform. The “Healthy China 2030” program is also an important and ambitious reference of China's domestic reforms in health, also encompassing social determinants.
Is Beijing's intention to create an alternative entity to WHO, or simply create an alternative movement that can coexist with WHO, in the context of the relationship with the global south? How could this work?
The thesis suggests that China adopts a "dual approach": while integrating in existing global structures, forging simultaneously alternative paths, particularly through regional alliances such as BRICS and partnerships with Global South. This indicates an intention to create an alternative movement that can coexist and complement the role of WHO, rather than a direct alternative entity. China demonstrates a clear commitment to align the objectives of the “Belt and Road” initiative with the united nations sustainable development objectives, showing their willingness to present these initiatives as complements to the existing cooperation mechanisms in the international liberal order. President Xi Jinping's view of a “future community shared for humanity”, which includes the notion of a “global health community for all”, also points to a new perspective in international cooperation.
Traditional Chinese Masks, Vaccines and Medicine (MTC): What are China's products or instruments to position itself as an increasingly global actor in GGS?
The thesis points out that China is an indispensable provider of global public health, essential for the product supply chain, such as masks and vaccines. The MTC is also mentioned as one of China's great contributions to global health governance, with its chinese herbal treatments, some of which already recognized by WHO in 2017. In addition, Chinese medical assistance and medical teams sent to other regions of the globe are important instruments of Chinese health diplomacy.
In creating an alternative movement or reality to WHO, China may be taking advantage of the lack of full representativeness in the same WHO, or gaps in its operation?
The thesis does not address directly whether China is taking advantage of a lack of full representativeness in WHO or gaps in its operation. No entanto, ela enfatiza que o trabalho visa preencher uma lacuna no conhecimento científico em relação ao paradigma da governança da saúde de uma perspectiva não-ocidental e liberal, dando ênfase à China como actor do Sul Global. This suggests that China seeks to strengthen alternative models that can offer more personalized health challenges, different from those defended by Western countries, positioning itself as a moderate reformist actor.
How has the European Union (EU) foreign policy in relation to China affecting or influenced this position of the country in global health governance?
In the thesis, the fourth publication, entitled "Challenges on the European Union-China Cooperation in Higher Education from" People-To-People Dialogue ’Perspective: The Case of Health-Related Joint Projects," explores cooperation in higher education, in particular that includes health-related projects. Therefore, despite the strategic and economic dialogue, the deterioration of UE-china bilateral relations intensified, with the commission to assume a decline of enthusiasm due to “China's countermeasures to EU human rights sanctions, economic coercion and commercial measures against the single market, and the positioning of China in the war in Ukraine”. Although challenges and tensions are recognized, cooperation in higher education, including health projects, is seen as part of a broader picture of strategic partnership between EU and China. However, it is evident that there is no long tradition of health cooperation between EU and China in higher education, and that there are few joint projects compared to the general panorama. It is suggested that both EU and China should make more efforts to align medical study curricula and promote more joint research in areas related to health, infectious diseases, among others.
In the Trump 2.0 era, and without pandemic, what could be China's role in global health governance?
Although the thesis is published this year, it focuses on the preceding period and includes the pandemic, where it does not speculate directly on a future scenario of “Trump 2.0” without pandemic. However, the thesis argues that China is not just a participant, but a moderate reformist force in the formation of global health standards. Regardless of future political scenarios, their growing economic and political influence, strategic health diplomacy, internal reforms and initiatives such as the Health Silk Route will continue to shape their role in global health governance. The view of a “global health community for all” also remains a guiding principle for China's efforts.
Does this power of China in GGS verify more with bilateral or multilateral agreements?
The thesis suggests that China's power in global health governance manifests itself through both bilateral and multilateral agreements, but with a growing emphasis on certain forms of cooperation that strengthen their role in the global south and through alternative mechanisms. Although the thesis does not explicitly quantify the predominance between bilateral and multilateral, the focus on regional alliances (BRICS) and partnerships with the Global South (which often involve bilateral agreements and group cooperation initiatives) and the Health Silk Route indicate a hybrid approach.</description><pubDate>2025-06-30 23:46:26</pubDate></item><item><title>Macao Forum | Secretary-General says it has never discussed widening to Hispanic countries</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/30/forum-macau-secretario-geral-diz-que-nunca-se-discutiu-alargamento/</link><description>In an interview with Lusa agency, the secretary general of the Macau Forum, Ji Xianzheng, assured that “never discussed” the widening of action to Hispanic countries, but that the willingness already stated by the government of Sam Hou Fai will have to be the authorities to decide a new direction to the cooperation strategy.
 
The Secretary-General of the Macau Forum stated that the institution “never discussed” the creation of an entity to extend to Hispanic countries to promote economic cooperation similar to those that provide the connection between China and Portuguese-speaking countries.
“Within the Macao Forum, we have never discussed this topic,” said the Forum Secretary-General for Economic and Commercial Cooperation between China and Portuguese-speaking countries Ji Xianzheng.
The official acknowledged that, "in society, there were some conversations to discuss or address the possibility of promoting more contact and cooperation with Spanish -language countries, but at the Forum level we have never addressed this theme."
The Macao executive announced in mid -April the intention of creating a center to promote economic services between China and the Portuguese and Spanish languages ​​in the neighboring special Economic Zone of Hengqin.
The idea is to provide companies in Hispanic countries services in the “linguistic, legal, fiscal, verification of compliance with norms, formation, arbitration and mediation”, according to the Secretary for Administration and Justice, André Cheong.
Days earlier, the chief executive, Sam Hou Fai, had also announced the intention of “promoting exchange and cooperation” through Macao between China and the universe of Spanish -speaking countries.
Although Macau wants to widen focus to Castilian -speaking countries, “the forum will remain the forum for China and Lusophony countries,” said Ji Xianzheng. The secretary general clarified that the institution that directs "can contribute contributions to the greater opening of Macao in international cooperation", as is the intention announced by the new government of MSAR.
Complementary forum
Personally, the secretary general has ensured that he had “pleasing to work with all parties,” but stressed that this is a “decision that is up to central governments to make” and that the forum was never contacted in this regard.
"Yes, I worked in Latin America, Spain, nine years in Madrid and Caracas. But this is not a decision of personal interest, it is up to politicians to make the decision," he said, explaining that the idea will be to promote the relationship between Macao and Brazil and then to other Latin American countries, as well as expanding the relationship with Portugal to Spain.
"There is no limit. The Macao Forum is complementary. It does not restrict any promotion of the cooperation of the other parts," he said.
According to the Macao Government Communication Office, Sam Hou Fai admitted on June 21 that he postponed a trip to Portugal, scheduled for July, and should also pass through Spain and the European Union headquarters in Brussels.
Bad interpretations
In the same interview with Lusa, the Secretary-General of the Macao Forum imputed to national governments the responsibility for conducting development and economic cooperation policies, stressing that the institution “has no investment projects”.
Ji Xianzheng attributes criticism to the Macao Forum to an wrong interpretation regarding the body's mission. "The forum is a mechanism of cooperation between central governments. Many people think it is to the secretariat that it is up to the execution of policies, but we have a limited number of people," added Ji.
"The secretariat has no investment projects, it is a mechanism for preparing the ministerial conference, connecting with governments, not a promotion agency. It has not been thought of, connects with the promotion agencies. We are four people sent by China and one delegate for each country," he said.
At the last ministerial conference, in April 2024, then Portuguese Economy Minister Pedro Reis argued that the Portuguese Language China-Parais Cooperation and Development Fund should bet more on small and medium enterprises (SMEs).
The Cooperation Fund was created in 2013 by the China Development Bank and the Macao Industrial and Commercial Development Fund, with a thousand million dollars, of which about 60 percent have already been invested, according to the secretary general.
Action plans
Ji Xianzheng has admitted that SMEs are "a difficult theme for any government" and that "international cooperation for the promotion of development and cooperation of small and medium enterprises is even more difficult. It is a topic that is being debated daily worldwide." But admitted, "here, little."
"But it is stipulated in the action plan [2024-2026]. It is up to central governments and commerce chambers, promotion agents, to work together to do this. The secretariat assumes responsibility as authorized by the central governments, specifically, in the activities program," he said.
Politicians from various countries, including Portugal, Angola and Mozambique, have appealed to a change in the rules of the fund's candidacy. Current rules require, for example, that candidate projects have a minimum investment of five million dollars, and the fund only covers 20 percent of total investment, referring the rest to governments or companies.
Ji Xianzheng said the new fund's new direction "is committed to promoting a broader investment, with better coverage for all forum countries, [relatively] to projects that have a strategic or significant impact on the socioeconomic development of participating countries."
According to the secretary general, "the terms of application [of the rules of access to the background] will be more flexible and the forms of application will also be more diverse." “Instead of being just direct investment, they are also studying ways to apply the fund, in cooperation with other funds or with other financial institutions,” he gave as an example.
"This fund has an operation according to market rules. It is not a humanitarian aid fund. Therefore, it has to guarantee the minimum return of benefit. But, on that, they are very open to study, if by case the conditions of each project," added Ji Xianzheng, but to give examples of "flexibility of rules."
Regarding the approximation of the China universe and countries of the Iberian Peninsula, already cemented in official speeches, economist Maria Fernanda Ilhéu, president of the Seda's New Route Association, told HM, earlier this month, that this intention is “very objective and pragmatic and can be summarized to the Macao economy diversification project, for which companies and investors are not only in Macao, but also from Macao, but also from Macao, but also from countries, but countries Portuguese Language ”.
"But the fact is that companies and institutions from Portuguese-speaking countries are not being effective in responding to this need for Macao. Therefore, widening companies and Spanish-speaking institutions this invitation to cooperation seems logical to me," the economist said.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Isabel Rio Novo, author of the biography of Luís de Camões: “Time in Macau was of tranquility”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/26/isabel-rio-novo-autora-da-biografia-de-luis-de-camoes-tempo-em-macau-foi-de-tranquilidade/</link><description>It will be launched tomorrow, at the Consulate General of Portugal in Macau and Hong Kong, the biography of Luís de Camões, by Isabel Rio Novo.

Why did you decide to get in the writing of another biography of Camões?
It is true that Luis Vaz de Camões has been biographed many times over 500 years. However, 50 years ago there was no biography about him. From my point of view and the editor, Camões deserved a more current biography that revised all kinds of prejudices, seeking known sources, the uncovered information research and where the rereading of all previous works were rereading. This biography is not only a summary, but also the reinterpretation of what has been known, but which had rarely been related. The book also brings some new data with some documentation that was discovered.
How was your relationship with the writing of Camões born?
I fell in love and went to those young readers who was not tormented with Camões. On the contrary, I liked it soon and let myself be seduced by Camões Lyric. I am from the areas of comparative literature and history, and in this sense I always understood the dimension and importance of the work of Camões.
And what are they?
It is a work and an author of its time and its time, which was extraordinary, with the Renaissance, Humanism and the travels of navigation. But at the same time, it is a work that is the product of an outstanding literary genius, one that we can tell a handful in the history of universal literature.
What camões we find in this biography?
I tried to go to the bottom, remove layers of the meaning that these 500 years were adding to Camões, in the sense that each season read its Camões and produced its interpretation. I wanted to discover the substrate, the man of flesh and bone he lived and wrote 500 years ago.
He was a man suffered, with many financial difficulties.
He was a man with a complex and difficult relationship with reality, not only of his time, but also with reality [itself]. The theme of the time, the disconcerting of the world, how society seems to work instead of what should work, being a literary topic of the Renaissance, it was something Camões felt personal and genuinely.
How?
He lived a series of disagreements, of extreme experiences. Suffice it to say that you have been stuck several times and for various reasons. He made great trips at a time when these were absolutely risky, long, and complicated enterprises. Camões was involved in military expeditions, and almost all his life was soldered. But this set of experiences allowed him to be almost everything that someone could be at the time he lived.
He was one of the most traveled authors of the time, having been in Brazil, Goa…
Yes. Even the connection to Macau, which is contested by some scholars, but not by me… I am persuaded, given the existing documentation and indirect testimonies, which Camões passed through China with the position of Dead and Missing Provider. When this happened, albeit very incipiently, the Portuguese establishment in China, which was already Macao. It is not known whether Camões held this position assigned to him by Viceroy D. Francisco Coutinho, if he was exactly assigned to be a provider during the trip, or a provider at Macao's establishment. But what he knew from China was surely this little warehouse that Portugal had achieved, at a lot of cost, with great difficulty and after many attempts to obtain in China.
What did a deceased provider?
Whenever a Portuguese died in the East, a soldier or merchant, it was necessary to ensure the rights of the heirs, the families who were normally in Portugal. The provider had to identify the deceased, his naturalness, origin and make the heirs known. He also had to keep the deceased's assets before they were stolen, auction them, keep the coins that would result in, and then take it all to Lisbon. It was a process that, if it went well, took many months, because it was necessary to send this money to the authorities of Goa who later sent him in the career from India to Lisbon.
Can we talk about a period of stability in Camões's life in Macau?
Yes. Until this appointment as a deceased provider, everything Camões knew from the East had been as a soldier. As soon as Goa [1553] arrives weeks later in a first military expedition. We know why: Not because I had some war appeal, but because only participating in expeditions earned your welding. Although everyone said that the soldiers lived very poorly, the welding was what Camões had to survive. The time lived in Macao, when he was free from soldier obligations, was a time of tranquility regarding subsistence, which was assured. He had some time and calm to continue the work with "the Lusíadas." More than that, as much as the sources allow to deduce, Camões met in Macau a phase of balance in terms of personal and loving life, as, on the return trip, he brought with him, according to the testimony of Diogo do Couto, a Chinese girl.
Dinamene.
This was the term used by the chronicler. We don't know if it would be a Chinese or Asian girl. This girl with whom Camões lived maritally was someone who liked it very much, according to the testimony of Diogo do Couto. But Dinamene would certainly not be her name, as it was a mythological name that, by the way, Camões used in her lyric, even before she boarded the East. Chinese girls with whom soldiers and merchants in Macao lived amanced were baptized and received a Christian name. Therefore, Dinamene would even have a Christian and Portuguese name. But as we do not know her name, and if we are aware that we use a kind of metaphor, we can call it Dinamene.
She dies later on a trip and makes Camões very shaken.
On Macao's return trip to Goa, probably at the end of his mandate as a provider, Camões suffers the celebrated wreck, in which he loses the personal assets he had ease, including the assets of the deceased that he was guardian, and this will bring him complications. It also suffers the loss of dynamine. The wreck went with some in the seas of China, probably by the mouth of the Mekong River.
Considers unlikely to have lost part of "the Lusíadas."
The first biographers say Camões was saved from this wreck with a board. It is not unreasonable that he managed to save the manuscript of the Lusíadas on this board. But it is also no excluding that Camões knew his poem by heart. The memory of people in the sixteenth century was different. They were very used to keeping things from memory. And we know, because the proof is obtained in the work of Camões, that it had an extraordinary memory. I have a way to prove it, of course, that Camões is one of the rare authors who knew his poem by heart.
Do you think Camões had a lower life to his true talent?
Undoubtedly. According to a too extensive set of concordant testimonies, he dies poor, even in miserable conditions, and according to an eyewitness, without having a blanket with which he covered himself. On the other hand, Camões was known to follow the publication of the Lusíadas, who were commented and read [in the poet's life time]. We have the testimony of Faria de Sousa, one of the first biographers of Camões, which says that when he passed the streets, people stop and pointed. Camões also had a figure that stood out, with a leaked eye and using a pale. By then, I would be quite sick, using crutches. But there is a set of poets, which is very unreliable that they did not know Camões, who never refer to them. There are, on the other hand, other humanists, such as Pedro Magalhães Gândavo, who from the outset praises him as the prince of Portuguese poets.
But the king gives him a tendency for deeds provided and the publication of "The Lusíadas."
This famous tendency, which should not be a big deal, because all ancient biographers say it was derisive, is attributed to him as a kind of military reform, because of the 17 years of service in the East, and not as a reward for the publication of "The Lusíadas." D. Sebastião's mercy letter, which attributes him the title of nobleman knight, had no repercussion in practice, but gave him 15 thousand reais. [The publication of “the Lusíadas”] was an additional argument [for the letter] and not the main argument. This leads us to believe that D. Sebastião will not even have read or heard “the Lusíadas”, will have received indirect information, favorable about the poem.
How did the process of editing “Os Lusíadas” occurred?
It was an event, because both the press and the books that were published a year were a very small amount. In the year in which “the Lusíadas” are published were the only work of non -religious caress [to be edited]. To fund the edition, it is more than likely that Camões had the support of a patron, probably D. Manuel de Portugal, from the Condes do Vimioso family. Getting the work was a press was a mere and complicated process, as it had to go through the prior examination of the civil authorities, the royal authority and the censorship of the Inquisition. The resident of the Holy Office does not only let the book pass, but to make an amount of almost unprecedented compliments in the license that authorizes the publication of the work. If we go to the opinions emitted by the same rear, there is no other work on which he is as compliments as it was with the epic of Camões.
In Indonesia, he befriended a slave on the island of Java.
Camões was, at least once, on the island of Ternate, Indonesia, in the archipelago of molucas, at a time when there were conflicts motivated by an extremely cruel Portuguese captain towards the king or sultan of Ternate, which originated a kind of war between the Portuguese and the places. Camões has a song that describes the island of Ternate. We do not know if it was at this time, or in another passage to the Far East, that Camões turned on to a Jaú, or Javanese, but could not be exactly from the Far East, but a freed slave who had been linked by friendship to Camões. And this is because in one of the first biographies of Camões it reads that Jaú, with the Christian name António, asked for alms at night. This freedom of movements of a slave indicates that he would probably be a freed slave. He asked for alms to Camões, for himself and the mother of Camões, with whom Camões will have lived in recent years of life.</description><pubDate>2025-06-26 23:30:50</pubDate></item><item><title>Piménio Ferreira: “Anti-igan rhetoric has always worked in Portugal”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2021/04/26/pimenio-ferreira-a-retorica-anti-cigana-sempre-funcionou-em-portugal/</link><description>Piménio Ferreira, better known as Gitelles Ferreira, anti-racist militant, 34, physical engineer, national Romani. He is a man with a provocative speech, a corrosive, kind mood and a smile that leaves no one indifferent
Gitelles, we live in an intercultural land and the Gypsies - in particular - have lived about five centuries in Portugal. What is going on for Gypsy communities to remain “on the fringes” of the so -called society? 
The model of society remains to be changed. This is extremely stratified by placing people in subordinate places to privilege a violent minority. The white social structure is patriarchal and racist. What is called the "margin" of society is actually an intrinsic place to it, which belongs to it. In other words, Gypsy people have been included in this model of society since they discovered Europe and its kingdoms. The problem is the model of society that is maintained and the place to which they were relegated and how they were relegated: with violence, in inferior status against whites, without the right to human dignity, to constitute a family, to choose one's own language and religion, expropriated from any and all cultural and material law. A place built and maintained to this day by violence and genocidal and ethnicidal persecution. In 1463, a Gitano Vasco was drowned to an estate. In 1521, Gitans, or Gypsies, were already used as a reference for all that is considered bad in the model of society. The "counter-exemple" in the face of the white that would stand out for the positive. The 'angel' and the 'devil'; the 'other', the enemy; That against whom any attack and persecution is legitimate. Including the prohibition of defending, having weapons, any kind of goods, and the right of permanence.
And is this right to permanence that we still have nomadic gypsy communities within the country is denied?
Yes, no doubt. There are many ways to force nomadism: directly, prohibiting permanence and expelling with police or military force; indirectly, refusing public or private housing to Gypsy people, as they are Gypsy; and even through the gentrification process.
I read the result of an inquiry from the European Union Fundamental Rights Agency, which is said to be approximately 80% of the Gypsies responded to the risk threshold of poverty in their country; One in three Gypsies lives in a housing without channeled water; One in three Gypsies belongs to a family where someone hungry at least once the previous month; and 50% of Gypsies aged 6 to 24 do not attend school. Why does this happen like this? 
It is the historical persecution, which continues. There is no impoverishment that has no external cause. In this case, a political system of total expropriation and imposed on the basis of violence. Already in 1648, D John IV, the restorer, prohibited ‘Giving or Rent houses to Gypsies’. The same D John IV who got the kingdom of Portugal thanks to D. Jerónimo da Costa and his 250 knights. The same D. Jerónimo da Costa who had died to defend Portugal's independence from Castile. Gypsy, like his wife and children. Between prohibitions of permanence, “that do not enter Gypsies in the kingdom and leave those who are” (D John III, 1526), ​​with expulsions, degred to the galleys, expropriation of goods and properties, imposed with stripping, mutilation and death, systematically carried out to this day (still in 2011 Faro City Council wanted to ban Gypsies in the municipality).
The prohibition of working on others (no one employs Gypsy workers, and those who accept they do it in total precariousness, for poorly paid positions and without decent rights and conditions). They cannot be dependent on their own work, they cannot get investment means due to extreme expropriation. Are dependent on precariousness. If you want to know what it is like to live in pure neoliberalism, know the lives of Gypsies. Their reality is paradigmatic of the aggression and depletion to which the "gentlemen" are willing to go to their benefit.
What do you talk about is economic and political power?
The group of political, social, cultural and economic power. The owner, the colonizer. This group that has been in power since it established the system of current domination. And that only makes sense within the hierarchically stratified sociopolitical model in which we live. Hence the need to end 'gentlemen' and institute a new model of society, healthy, free, without hierarchies or strata, whether of race, class or gender.
The model we live in leads to the Gypsy (and not only) community to economic exclusion, removing it from access to product consumption or excluding them from its production process; political exclusion associated with lack of access to information; To education and consequently the social exclusion that is seen in inequality of access to quality community areas such as restaurants, libraries, theater, cinema, concerts, health care, etc. How do you feel a gypsy child when you realize that it is not part of a whole? Children who are never represented, neither in movies, nor in books, nor in cartoons, not even in an announcement to eat cereals, for example? Is this a disaster for self-esteem, is a priori condemnation?
The question is that. Gypsy people are not “excluded from society”, by contrast, they are included in it. The problem is the existence of what is cynically called 'social exclusion', which term Orwellian, and there be under coercion, people. Which field of concentration and extermination. Incidentally, Nazi concentration camps are a more visual realization than called 'social exclusion' and, as here, were not a 'excluded' part of Nazi society, but rather its fundamental and characterizing structure. It is a place of violence, where people are maintained by violence, dedicated to their extermination, and designed so that few people can leave. And yet they resist. As in Nazi concentration camps.
And what you have listed as an example of 'consequence' of this 'exclusion', is actually the means by which this exclusion also happens and remains. Gypsy people are out of theaters, both as consumers and producers (but go to the cinema). They are out of school, education and the gym. Either as 'users' or as producers (but go to school and are on the basis of knowledge construction and academic and scientific debates).
Even in attacking Gypsy children's self -confidence, we talk about a maintenance mechanism of this situation. But Gypsy people respond very well: with Gypsy pride. Another resistance, another aggression. Gypsy people are thus included in society. In a place that belongs to this model of modern society. And they resist and contradict the power of domination and make a point of being in the city, in the cinema, in the theater, in the gym, in all spaces. With a lot of struggle and always resisting, but they are there. Social exclusion, more than a “place outside of society”, is part of its social structure.
Do you want to say that there is a collective resistance?
At work, already in a context of absolute precariousness, during the pandemic, Gypsy people rolled up sleeves and showed once again proactivity and creativity in adversity. They learned seeing and doing. And here, it is again the women who jump to the front line, face, learn to use digital tools with their daughters or children, and throw themselves into the network. And so they explore online sales as well as application by application (transportation or rehabs). In housing, in a context of pandemic in which the evictions were not locked - as they owed and dictated the law itself - residents did not fail to organize and fight unjust evictions and claim dignity in housing; associations of allied residents in their action with other housing and anti-racist struggle organizations.
It should also be noted how they reinvented and intensified to raise and distribute dietary goods and kits of masks/alcohol gel to the most expropriated people. Gypsies and non -Gypsies. In the anti-racist struggle, new movements emerged and their actions intensified by social networks. People who had never been organized or militated before began their first steps in activism, thickening this way of the organization and popular gypsy and anti-racist action. People forget, or do not want to value, but Gypsy action has helped determine results in the political dispute. Gypsy citizens mobilized in large and determined electoral results in the municipalities of 2017, both in Alentejo and in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area, even causing electoral earthquakes.
And even in the presidential, second place was resolved by a value equivalent to the estimated number of Gypsy voters. Apart from the non -Gypsy votes that were mobilized by the action of Gypsy voters. Gypsy people are even co-considering power in the spaces of opinion, local media, social networks and party and institutional political dispute. And most importantly, in the popular Ação and alliances with other social movements. We have never stopped fighting for all means and continuing to resist.
In contrast there are more and more hate speeches, from the far right in particular. What do you have to say about it?
To start these speeches are historical and European. Not even current and even less “of the far right”. These speeches have been adopted and rendered for a long time, even in 'democracy and freedom', by several representatives of the center right, conservatives, left center, liberal, liberal left, even representatives of the PCP. Anti-egana rhetoric has always worked in Portugal as it is the whiter rhetoric [white genesis]. That is, it allows you to create and give the "white" as the superior of all. And so please the white electorate who, when feeling well, pays off with his vote. Even if the policies implemented by their elected harm him even more.
Finally, did you like them to talk a little about your personal experience and how did you get to the activist?
I studied, fought for studies, made alliances, graduated, went in the labor market of the “formal precariousness”. I started my militant action and here I am today. We can transform this society a better. This certainty combined with the fact that the current one has so much suffering makes anyone want to have a transformist attitude. I wanted to be 'inventor' (physical engineer) and anti -racist militant. And through study (not necessarily schooling) and organization with others, in turn, with other studies, formations and visions, I learned how the world works and how it can be changed. But before transforming, we need to survive.
Hence two types of actions arise: transformative and survival. The struggle against hate discourse arises as survival, but his defeat will be a transformative victory. There is a lot that - like people who want a better world - we have to do, namely working to criminalize hatred speech; condemn and prohibit organizations with racist discourses and practices; denounce the racist institutional structure and logics that organize power and generate community resources. And in this sense, there have been various types of actions, of petitions, to manifestations. And we need more.
I, besides being a military man in the SOS Racism movement, participate in the “We came to stay” podcast, with Mamadou BA and Joseph da Silva. And if all goes well, we will soon start a new project. With friendly people, we also have the project “Gypsy Initiative”, dedicated to reflecting and promoting transformative movements. Essentially focused on educating against anti-agigarism, denouncing historical and continued genocide and working for a new society project. Also with new projects on the gutter. And finally, there are always voluntary actions without an organization, where I try to share what I found out about anti-egism and Roman history in schools and with interested people. In addition, there is still the struggle for housing, because the evictions did not stop during the pandemic. Due to housing and work precariousness, the subjects racialized especially the Roma nationals are the most vulnerable to COVID-19. There is essential to have actions in this area; Of all the struggles, this is the most structural, as it goes against one of the main enemies of a healthy society: the real estate speculation of this capitalist system, which places profit and goods above people and their humanization.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Philippines | Carlos Barreto takes the experience of Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/20/filipinas-carlos-barreto-leva-a-experiencia-de-macau/</link><description>Carlos Barreto, former racing director of the Macao de Motorcycle Grand Prix, is still active in the motorized sports of the Asian continent, more precisely in the Philippines, where he has been putting into practice the experience of more than three decades in the service of Macau's motorsport and motorcycling
 
“I was invited in 2024 to help develop National Track Motorcycle Championships-Underbone, Scooters and Superbikes-organized by Morac and Fetap,” Macau's former Macau-China General Association (AAMC) told HM. “The experience gained over three dozen years helps. I have done several motorcycle and karting championships on temporary circuits, mud and nape, then in the coloane karting, trials with local riders (motorcycles and karts) and international (karts). several motorcycle championships. ”
With a strong connection to the Macao Grand Prix, Carlos Barreto was a test director in the Karting and Motorcycle Championships between 1991 and 1996, and later, between 2004 and 2008. He was also president of the College of Sports Commissioners between 2009 and 2010. This vast experience allows him today to face this new reality in a different country, but always showed great passion for motorized sports, ease of “some aspects. that deserved more attention to the level of the tests. ” Among them, it highlights “sports regulations, the application of the rules, the dissemination of official documentation, some infrastructure equipment, as well as the structure and functional organization of the team that generates these championships, from the secretariat to track commissioners and proof direction”.
This collaboration began in November last year and, by 2024, already extended to three rounds of the championships. The contribution of Portuguese, born in Mozambique, has been significant: “The various suggestions I presented to each of the two circuits I know, the Clark International Speedway and the Racing Circuit Batangas, some have already been implemented and the rest will be resolved by the end of the year.
The competition itself is also growing: “The pandemia, in a way, delayed the development of these championships, but the number of pilots has been increasing, there are teams with financial capacity and good equipment. Clark tests sometimes come together to gather close to 80 pilots, while Batangas have about 60. The prospects are encouraging.”
Contribution to Karting
The Philippines is a country with a long tradition in Karting, dating back to the 1960s and the enthusiasm generated by Arsenio “Dodjie” Laurel, a pilot who lost his life on the Guide Circuit in 1967. The presence of Philippine Teams and Pilots in the Asian continent is common and, internally, the discipline has always followed what has been done worldwide.
“At Karting level, national tests have a local and functional structure - for years it was Akoc,” recalls Carlos Barreto, adding: “My collaboration has been a sports commissioner at two international events. I did one in 2024 and another recently, the Fifth Rok Cup Asia Philippines, organized by Kilton Motors Corporation (KMC) and performed in Clark. ”
Also there, the former director of the Macao International Kart Prize (2004-2016), the 46th SKF World Championship of CIK-Sfi (2009) and the 49th Cik-Cia World Championship (2012), had the task of “auscultation of people and answering the questions that put me, as well as having suggestions for improvement”.
As for the future, Carlos Barreto believes that “the seed is launched, and now it remains to be expected to grow and that the results will become visible in the medium term.”
Macao a step ahead
For the author of the book “History of Karting in Macao”, written in co -authorship with Pedro Dá Mesquita, the MSar remains a step forward with the sports organization of this nature. “Macau has a clear advantage, but it must be borne in mind that events in Macao have the precious support of government entities, while in the Philippines it is an organization without these supports,” says Carlos Barreto.
Still, the evidence in the Philippines, a country with a vast history in the motorized Southeast Asia sport, are nothing to do with what is done in the territory in terms of competitiveness. "At the event level, scooter races are often very excited and competitive, with six to eight riders fighting every lap in the first place, numerous overtaking and suspense until cutting the goal. In superbike events, they compete for ducatis and enclosures and there is always a spectacle.</description><pubDate>2025-08-20 00:55:21</pubDate></item><item><title>Motorsport: FIA continues to dream of a Chinese team at F1</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/15/automobilismo-fia-continua-a-sonhar-com-uma-equipa-chinesa-na-f1/</link><description>It's no secret to anyone: the International Automobile Federation (FIA) would like to have a Chinese team in the F1 World Championship. FIA President Mohammed Ben Suulaym is the first to demonstrate this will.
For the first time since 2015, F1 will receive a 11th team on the starting grid next season, with Cadillac's entry, putting an end to a three-year wait since the US team presented its candidacy following the FIA ​​appeal for demonstrations of interest. As there will be a margin for a 12th team, Ben Suulayem is willing to launch a new process of manifestation of interest, making it clear that an application from China would be welcome.
The entry of a Chinese team would be aligned with F1's strategic efforts to expand its presence in key markets. China's Grand Prix has recently renewed its contract by 2030, consolidating the country's role in the long -term view of the sport.
"We have a 11th team [Cadillac]. I believe we should analyze the performance of this 11th team and then if there is a Chinese [candidacy]-and I will now speak on behalf of Fom [Formula One Management]-they will approve it, because it is about sustaining the business," said the FIA ​​president in a joint interview with several journalists from the automobile sector.
Ben Suulayem made it clear that there is no urgent need to have a 12th team. However, given F1's upward trajectory in recent years, the addition of another team to the starting grid, especially one from China, would further increase the call of the sport in the largest business market on the planet. "If there is a team from China, let's say, and the first to approve - and I'm 100% sure that it will approve it - would no longer make money with China's entry? I believe yes," he said.
A huge market for exploring
The Chinese automotive market is incomparable, producing more than 30 million vehicles a year - more than the United States of America, Japan and India together. In addition, China has contributed to the increase in the fan base in sports, with over 150 million fans and more than 1 million new followers on Chinese social networks, increasing the total to 4.3 million. F1 fan segmentation analysis itself has revealed that more than half of fans in the country have started following the sport in the last four years. Interestingly, the audience is younger than the average F1 supporters and more diverse, with a 50% female demography.
For Ben Sulayem, it is more than just increasing the number of teams: it is to unite the main global markets under the F1 flag, because the number of Chinese sponsors and partners in the “Queen Class” of motor sport is currently limited, boiling down to the official Aston Martin Content Creation Partner, and Sauber's Sensetime. The presence of the Chinese brand Yili, which in the meantime came out, and the Sensetime in the Sauber universe was undoubtedly linked to the fact that Zhou Guanyu, the first full -time Chinese driver at F1, running the Swiss team at the time the agreements were signed.

Geely in pole-position
The dream of a Chinese team may still be in an embryonic phase, but with the support of the president of FIA and the growing focus of the sport in China, the view of a Chinese brand on F1's starting grids may be getting closer to reality. A Chinese brand like Geely could naturally fit into F1, taking into account its global presence and the fact that it stops international brands reputed such as Volvo or Lotus, appearances as a shareholder at Aston Martin and Mercedes-Benz Group, and Joint Ventures with Renault.
It is also worth mentioning that, recently, Lotus Cars, owned by Geely, recovered the name Team Lotus, bringing together its competition programs with official support, partner teams, lotus coup championships and drivers development programs. According to the company, the Renaissance of Team Lotus "means our commitment to global competition and the culture of motorized sport." For now, this is limited to GT cars, but one cannot help but imagine where it may evolve in the future.
Lotus Group has been the property of Geely since 2017. Team Lotus team was a constant presence in Formula 1 between 1954 and 1994, and there were some attempts to reactivate the name linked to their historic past in F1, attempts that ended just over nine years ago. In addition to the Lotus Sports Program and others of regional or national work, Geely is also present in Auto Sport with Lynk &amp; Co, at FIA TCR World Tour, and through its partnership with Renault, as a engine supplier, in the Chinese F4 Championship.</description><pubDate>2025-08-15 16:34:43</pubDate></item><item><title>GP | Event literature is expected to grow in the coming years</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/01/gp-literatura-do-evento-devera-crescer-nos-proximos-anos/</link><description>The literature on the Macau Grand Prix could continue to grow in the coming years. The release of the Macao Grand Prix-Personal Collection of Victor H. de Lemos, 1954-1978, volume II (1967-1978), by Macaense Carlos Lemos, residing in Toronto since 1974, will take place in November, not in October as initially expected, while a new book on motorcycling provies is forming form.
This change in the date is not related to any delay, but to the date of visit to the territory by the author. Following the success of Volume I, the second part of a book that aims to honor the author's father, Victor Hugo Lemos - an enthusiast of the Macao Grand Prix who, in life, collected a vast number of photographs and everything that was related to the Automobile and Motorcycle Races in Macau since 1954, the date of the first edition of the event.
“This second volume completes a significant part of my father's Macao Grand Prix Collection, Victor H. de Lemos. It is a 356 pages hardcover book, ie 100 more than the first volume,” says Carlos Lemos. “Content and composition are very identical to those of the first volume. Includes more chinese newspaper clippings and documents the first fatal accident, the failed attempt to create the Extreme Orient Automobile Association Circuit, the first edition of the Guide Race, the Giant Race and the gradual evolution of the Macao Grand Prix, from amateur races to a world -class event, recognized by the International Federation. of the car (FIA). ”
Also according to the author, “The book contains about 471 photographs, as well as an introduction to the other collection of my father, World of Motor Racing, composed of over 1900 autographed pilots photographs, car owners and international renowned designers, such as Il Commendatore Enzo Ferrari, Sir Stirling Moss, Michael Schumacher, Roy Salvadori, Dan Gurney, Sir Jack Brabham, Juan Manuel Fangio, Helmut Marko, Colin Chapman, Sir Jackie Stewart, Janet Guthrie, Professor Sid Walkins, Tony and Mary Hulman (owners of the Indianapolis circuit), Frank Williams, Charlie Whiting, Louis Meyer, among others. ”
The first volume sales exceeded expectations and therefore 550 copies will be sold. The cover price will be 400 patacas, but will be marketed for 350 patacas during the promotion period. Part of the liquid product from the sale will revert to the institution IC2 Association - “I Can Too”, which supports people with autism or disability, as well as Apomac. The presentation should take place at the headquarters of the Macao Retirees, Reformed and Pensioners Association (Apomac), at date and time to reveal.
A book about motorcycles
The literature on the Macau Grand Prix could continue to grow in the coming years. Carlos Barreto, the author of the book Karting History in Macau, written in co -authorship with Pedro Dá Mesquita, is considering writing a book about motorcycling in the Macao Grand Prix, a discipline that sometimes ends up in the background in terms of literary coverage of the more than seventy years of the Guide Circuit event.
"The idea is to gather the testimonials of pilots from Macao who participated in the proof of motorcycles of the Macao Grand Prix," Carlos Barreto told HM. “We already have some material collected; there is still a lot of collection of collecting, compiling and writing the story, selecting the images, etc… We are in a hurry!”
The Macao Grand Prix today has only one motorcycle test on the program, the Macao de Motorcycle History, but it wasn't always like that. The event even had more than three motorcycle races, and even scooter races took place at the Citadino Circuito da MSA, always with a very strong presence of local pilots.</description><pubDate>2025-09-01 03:08:38</pubDate></item><item><title>GP | Invitations for TCR Asia pilots who participate in Korea and Zhuzhou</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/27/gp-convites-para-pilotos-tcr-asia-que-participem-na-coreia-e-zhuzhou/</link><description>The 72nd Macao Grand Prix Race will again be the stage of the final test of Kumho Fia TCR World Tour, the largest tourist cars competition worldwide under the seal of the International Automobile Federation (FIA). The test will be equally open to the participation of competitors from other supplies
 
Being the last stage of the TCR worldwide competition season, the Macao race will bring together the fastest tour pilots in the world, also crowning the absolute champion of the TCR World Tour. The unique format of the competition promoted by WSC Group will allow local and regional riders of TCR to face international stars, creating an unforgettable show on the streets of the territory.
Prior to the final in Macao, the resurrected TCR Asia Series will share the track with the TCR World Tour from October 17-19, at the Inje, South Korea circuit, and from October 31 to November 2 at the Zhuzhou International Circuit in China. Participation in this race will be mandatory for riders who wish to obtain an invitation to the Guide Circuit event, also providing an opportunity for Macao riders, who did not qualify in other competitions, ensure a place at the big holiday party.
"In 2025, Wildcard registrations will be available to competitors who participated in TCR Asia events. To be eligible to sign up for Macao, competitors will be able to participate in the next races in South Korea and China, where TCR Asia will also share the grid with TCR World Tour," wrote TCR Asia Series on social networks, stressing that: “It's a unique opportunity for life: measuring forces with the best in the world in one of the most legendary strokes of motorized sport.”
On the subject, WSC Group president Marcello Lotti, the father of the TCR concept, added: “We are proud that TCR Asia added two events in conjunction with Kumho Fia tcr world tour. WSC is pleased to confirm that we will assign 'Wildcards' to competitors who want to join us in the final of the season in Macau.”
TCR Asia Series has been competing with Chinese Sailun tires, but in this race the pilots will have to adapt to Kumho compounds, required in the FIA ​​-sanctioned competition. Sean Chang Chien Shang, Taiwan's pilot, leads the four -point lead ranking about Chinese Liu Zhi Chen, both at the Audi RS 3 LMS steering wheel.
GUARANTEED QUALITY
TCR Asia Series will not be the only competition to compose the FIA ​​TCR World Tour subscribers list at the MSA, as the 2025 season of TCR Australia will end in style when joining the Macao's 72nd guide race grid, which will take place from 13 to 16 November. TCR Australia's first international participation was possible thanks to the Global Championship rights holder, the WSC Group, which will ensure the full coverage of transportation costs to Australian teams traveling to Macao.
TCR Australia announced in June that it will focus on the proprietary of the competition at the event “The Bend 500”, from 12 to 14 September, in conjunction with the Australian round of Kumho Fia TCR World Tour, a competition with more than a dozen-time competitors. The Australian competition, which once had starting grids with about two dozen cars, will no longer run this year, beyond this and that scheduled for the Macao Grand Prix.
With evidence to compete in Australia, South Korea, China and Macao, the title champion of Kumho Fia World Tour, Yann Ehrlacher of Lynk &amp; Co, leads the 250 -point classification, followed by Esteban Guerrieri, the wheel of a Honda, with 223, while Santiago Urrutia, also to the command of a Lynk &amp; Co, occupies a Lynk &amp; Co.

Initially baptized by FIA as F3 Regional, the now designated regional formula (FR) is above the Formula 4 Formula 4 National Competitions and FIA Championship, which, in turn, supports the FIA ​​Formula 2 Championship and Formula 1. Last year, the FIA ​​decided that this category was the one that best filed the Guide Circuit, thus ending four decades of Formula 3 Macao Award.
Last week, the regulator of world motorsport and the Italian national sports association has jointly presented the future monoligue that will compete in the European regional FIA (FREC in English) regional formula championship and will succeed the current freka. The fact that the acronym has lost the letter “A” is due to the exit of the Alpine brand as a partner and engine supplier to the championship. FRECA premiered in 2019, succeeding the Formula Renault Eurocup. In recent seasons, more than 160 pilots, representing 44 nationalities and 22 teams, participated in the championship. This category has gained importance in the FIA ​​monologene pyramid, having as old pilots former champion Andrea Kimi Antonelli, Isack Hadjar, Gabriel Bortoleto and Franco Colapinto-all of them now militate in Formula 1.
The competition will have the FIA ​​support seal and should be the largest supplier of teams and pilots for the FR World Cup of the Macao Grand Prix from next year. FIA involvement in the competition is intended to generate more revenues for it, something that may have reflexes on the price scale. The FR championships in the Americas and Japan, as well as the FIA ​​-certified trophies in the Middle East and Oceania will continue, and progressively will introduce the new car produced in Italy.
FIA President Mohammed Ben Suulayem believes this project "will create a stronger and more support for young pilots. With the full support of the FIA ​​regions and a clear progression vision, we are taking an important step to ensure the future of junior monoliga pyramid." Former Ralis pilot and today maximum leader of automobile sports, who was recently in the territory for the FIA ​​general assembly, said that “accessibility, international credibility and cost efficiency are at the center of this initiative.”
New car promises more
The new Tatuus T-326, the second-generation FR monolugar, is equipped with a 3-cylinder and 1.6 liter Toyota engine, which debits 270 horsepower and 360 Nm of torque, specially adapted and prepared by ATM-Autotechnic Motori. The T-326 represents a natural evolution of the T-318 model, the Tatuus monolugar that defined most FR championships worldwide and says goodbye to the big stages next November, during the weekend of the Macao Grand Prix. The second edition of FR's FR World Cup will continue to use the Tatuus T-318 Monolugar, motorized by a 1.75-liter Turbo Alpha Romeo block, also prepared by ATM-Autotechnic Motori, but the Italian brand has failed to manufacture.
The future car, which will use a new special tire built by Pirelli, will have a fully redesigned aerodynamic profile, shaped by the new FIA technical regulations for the category and inspired by the latest trends in the top categories of single -molding. The result is a general increase in performance, better aerodynamic efficiency and reduction of turbulence effect, which will facilitate overtaking.
Main improvements include weight reduction, optimized direction rack and magazine suspension, offering greater lightness and ease of driving.
