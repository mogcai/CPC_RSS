About 100 former military recruited in Macao between 1936 and 1975 were gathered on Tuesday night at a fraternization dinner that took place at the fishermen's dock. The second event in the five -year space aimed to bring together colleagues, miss other times, featured speeches for video conferencing and until a moment to sing the Portugal Anthem.
One of those present at the event was 86-year-old Mario Lemos, and being the oldest recruit at the ceremony of 1959, he was entitled to sit at the table of the organizing committee, led by Francisco Marnhão.
From the troop, Lemos recalls other times, more agitated: "The troop was a youth adventure, where I spent a year and a half. The recruit was six months and then passed to take office at the headquarters' office," he recalled. "I did practically everything because I had completed the second cycle, I did a lot of different things. I also translated because people from Portugal came and did not dominate the Chinese language. It often served with the guys of Portugal. At the time there were many people of Chinese ethnicity and many of them did not speak Portuguese," he said.
Cantonese's dominion also led to that Mário Lemos often had to deal with the population's complaints in the face of the behavior of some troops, although highlighting that they were not very frequent things. "Sometimes there were even problems out there, people came to complain and I served as a translator to solve the subjects. For me it was a very excited time," he said. "But there were not many complaints. They were youth things," he said. And among the complaints, it was not uncommon for the population to complain about the harassment of the military to some younger girls.
The former military man admitted to miss the troops and shows the military ballot proudly, where there is a praise received at the end of the time served in the army: "At the end of the troop I received a praise from the head of state of the military in Macau. It was not easy," he said. “I was very proud,” he confessed.
The busiest times as a military contrast with retirement. After more than 30 years in the civil service, Lemos lived in Canada for 12 years before returning to Macao. Now life is calmer. "I am a person who always stays very at home, I do not have much social life," he acknowledged. Still admitted to like the environment of this type of dinners.
 
Rigorous
José Madeira, at the age of 73, was recruited in 1974 in Macao, where he was born and lives. It is currently renovated after a civil service career, and took advantage of the conviviality to review some friends and put the conversation up to date.
“It was a good occasion to be with friends. I know people almost all, because most are macanese, Macau is a small land and we know almost everyone. It's easy,” said Madeira, dressed in the alternative nightgown of the national football team. "For me it is not a matter of not seeing people, I regularly see these friends, because we have groups and we find ourselves regulate," he explained.
However, the former recruit dinner is nonetheless different, recognizes Macaense, because it ends up making the conversations turn more around the troops. “At this dinner we remembered our times of youth and troops,” he said.
During the period in the army, José Madeira performed the functions of nurse. "I didn't have much work, I usually dealt with routine daily consultations," he recalled. The most common cases implied allergies, especially among the military coming from Portugal. "The metropolitan military did not usually adapt to moisture and most of them suffered from skin allergies," he recalled.
About the troop experience, Macaense recalls “a period of conviviality”, “friendship”, “solidarity” and “teamwork”. The recruit was the most complicated period, because in a macao when winter was more rigorous, it was necessary to get into the sea on the beaches, without the possibility of the military if they bathe or dry, so as to learn to deal with the adversities of combat.
 
Mandatory paths
Recruited in 1970, 75 -year -old Mário Sin recruits from recruiting the impact caused by winter cold. "The weather was a little different, when it arrived in January it was very cold. Now not, the weather is always warmer," he recalled. "So the Malta suffered when it entered the recruit, because we were in winter," he shot.
However, even if there was no desire, Sin pointed out that the recruit was mandatory, and without compliance with military service, professional opportunities were very limited: “At the time we had no alternative, we had to fulfill military service. Without the fulfillment of military service, it was not possible to work for the civil service, and we were not accepted in other work,” he said.
However, Sin admits that the times as military were very happy: “The Malta enjoyed a little with that, every day were very happy. But there were very pulled exercises, the exercises were always pulled. But as the malta came from school had good energy to deal with it. "If it were now, there was no strength," he added to laugh.
For Mário Sin dinner was another opportunity to live with several colleagues, with whom he admitted himself regularly.</description><pubDate>2025-07-17 18:12:48</pubDate></item><item><title>Spain | Right -wing extremists chased journalists in Torre Pacheco</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/17/espanha-extremistas-de-direita-perseguiram-jornalistas-em-torre-pacheco/</link><description>About a hundred elements of the far right pursued and insulted journalists during the demonstration on Tuesday night to the Torre Pacheco Chamber in the Spanish region of Murcia, which was accompanied by security forces.

Lao Nga Wong applauded justice and legitimacy of the decision of the Commission of Electoral Affairs to the Legislative Assembly (Caeal) and argued that the disqualifications were necessary to prevent the entry of "liars who say to love the homeland and Macao" in the "government structure."
The member of the permanent committee of the Chinese people's political advisory conference, and President General Association of the Overseas Chinese of Macao, said that the exclusion of candidates eliminates risks to the interests of the country of Macao.
In turn, the president of the Macao General Association of Macao, Lau Kam Ling, argued that deputies have to be “honest patriots”, otherwise it will harm the interests, sovereignty and national security, as well as Macao's prosperity and stability.

Ron Lam believes that “the sun always comes after the storm”
 
Candidates vetoed by the Legislative Assembly Electoral Affairs Committee (Cael), which thus denies them the right to participate in the elections for the Legislative Assembly, respond with different voices to their exclusion, but all underline the same point: the unfailing love to Macau and the Fatherland.
 
One of the affected, Deputy Ron Lam from the Macao Synergy list, admitted that his exclusion "was very sudden." However, Lam remains optimistic: "I'm in a quiet conscience. My initial intention to Macau will not change. I believe the sun always comes after the storm," he added.
Already Johnson Ian, also from the list of Macau synergy, began by following line previously presented Ron Lam that is, that the news of his disqualification fell as a surprise. Ian began by characterizing “sudden” the novelty and revealed that he became aware of the fact through the Caeal press conference.
However, because it has now been disqualified, this does not mean that Ian alter his perception of the work done. "Looking at the years behind, regardless of the subject or position I took, I never diverted the original intention to serve Macao's society. I always felt that Macau could improve and this feeling became central to my goals. All my work was for the country and Macau," said the excluded candidate.
Johnson Ian also assumed that his route was not made only of success, but is in a quiet conscience.

This is how environmentalist Joe Chan, who was the fifth candidate of the disqualified list led by Ron Lam, reacted yesterday to the decision of the Commission of Electoral Affairs of the Legislative Assembly (Caeal).
Shortly after the announcement that the list led by Ron Lam had been excluded after the political scrutiny of the State Security Defense Commission, Joe Chan proved to be "speechless." "I learned today that, apparently I do not support the basic law. I think it's time to fight for something that is worth it. I'm speechless, I was quietly disqualified," he said on social networks.
 
Security imposes silence
However, political commentator Sonny Lo Shiu-Hing yesterday told Lusa that with the disqualification of 12 candidates for deputies in Macau, for lack of patriotism, a parliament with "many more loyal than opponents" is foreseen in the future.
The disqualification of 12 deputies, announced on Tuesday by the Legislative Assembly Electoral Affairs Commission (Caeal), "means deputies have to be more politically correct and there are many more loyal than opponents," said Sonny Lo Shiu-Hing. "Changes to deputies' rules and regulations seem to point out in this direction," he added.
Sonny Lo referred to approval, a week ago, in the Legislative Assembly (al) of amendments to the laws of the Deputies Statute and the normative of the Parliamentary Regiment, which reinforces the powers of the President of the Assembly and plasma in legal documents the “Macau governed by patriots” and the State Security Defense Law.

The president of Caeal explained that 12 candidates from both lists "do not defend the basic law and are faithful to the Special Administrative Region of Macau of the Popular Republic of China."
Exclusion covers six candidates from the Liveliod Popular Strength list in Macao, led by social worker Alberto Wong, who first competed in AL.
The other list is the power of the synergy, led by the current deputy Ron Lam U Tou, who, in the last elections, in 2021, had been the seventh most voted, with 8,764 votes.
Seng Ioi Man has ensured that the binding opinions of the CDSE, of which it is not possible to appeal, "have a clear and sufficient legal foundation" and have been elaborated "taking into account the facts." However, the judge refused to reveal the facts that led to exclusion, arguing that "the works and documents of the State Security Defense Commission are confidential."
 
All for one
"We don't really know the reasons, because the electoral law and the National Security Act include a number of possible reasons," Sonny Lo told Lusa.
On Tuesday, the president of Caeal had assured that the binding opinions of the CDSE, of which it is not possible to appeal, "have a clear and sufficient legal foundation" and were elaborated "taking into account the facts."
However, the judge refused to reveal the facts that led to exclusion, arguing that "the works and documents of the State Security Defense Commission are confidential."
The dissemination of these "may represent certain risks to national security, and should not even be published their content," he added.
 
Shortly after the announcement of the Electoral Commission, CDSE stressed in a statement that when a candidate is excluded for lack of patriotism, all other candidates from the same line are also removed.
The government demonstrated, in another statement, "strong support" to the decision of the CDSE, which described as "a correct measure for the full implementation of the fundamental principle" Macao governed by patriots ".

"China's judicial authorities treat cases with strict respect for the legislation, ensuring the legitimate rights and interests of the parties involved. In accordance with international conventions and the consular agreement between China and Japan, we facilitated the consular work of the Japanese party," the Ministry of Foreign Ministry Lin Jian said at a press conference.
The spokesman also stressed that China "has always supported economic and commercial cooperation with Japan" and ensured that it has provided "a favorable environment for the legal work of Japanese companies and citizens in the country."
"We welcome foreign companies that want to develop economic and commercial cooperation in China. As long as foreign citizens comply with the law and act under the legislation, there is no reason for concerns," he added.
Chinese authorities had not yet officially confirmed the conviction, reported yesterday by the Japan ambassador to Beijing, Kenji Kanasugi, after the trial.
"The Japanese citizen was sentenced to three and a half years in prison on suspicion of espionage. We consider this sentence extremely unfortunate," said the diplomat, quoted by the Japanese press.
According to NHK public television, Kanasugi has assured that the Japanese government will continue to press for various ways so that the citizen will be released "as soon as possible" and will provide "all the necessary support."
The case dates back to March 2023, when the man, Japanese pharmacist's employee Astellas Pharma, was arrested by the Chinese authorities while preparing to return to Japan. The suspect was accused of violating counter -espionage laws, but few details were made public.</description><pubDate>2025-07-17 18:20:00</pubDate></item><item><title>SMG | Typhoon leads authorities to warn of intense heat</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/17/smg-tufao-leva-autoridades-a-alertarem-para-calor-intenso/</link><description>Meteorological and Geophysical Services (SMG) predict the formation of a tropical storm that is expected to enter the Southern Sea of China during the weekend and may then affect the territory, although the trajectory is still uncertain.

A mode of representation that sought communication between the author's spirit and that of the invited observer to discern the purpose of creation through the exposure of the process.
A demanding discipline, recognized until centuries later by illustrious theorists such as Dong Qichang (1555-1635), which put the barrier very high from which this painting could be exercised: no less than in Wang Wei (701-61) mode, the recognized founder of the painting of the literate: 'Only after someone was like Wang Wei can use the Wang Qia Pomo way'.
Examples from the brush of this creator are today hardly observable and the termination of it preserved, there is almost only the seductive echo of a name that refers the listener to the expression of the substance of the Spirit. However, there is another name that in the stories of painting is often associated with him, that of Gu Kuang (727-821), of whom the paintings today are also rare but from whom they have been stored poems that indicate an imponderable presence.
In a palace poem, it is noted the availability to feel the abundant but subtle torrent of beauty captured by the senses, like the one in the wind or in a sound: «In a tower of jade, halfway to the sky, a song blown to the flute begins,/ The wind delivers in the palace the harmonious sound of the Palreo and the laughter of the girls who dwell. Drinking in the clepsidra,/ the waters, redrillants as crystals, would say a curtain unfolded over the Rio do Autumn. » But the poet and painter, disillusioned with the intrigues that embarrassed his duties at the service of the palace, removes the public service and will use the name well daoist buweng, the "old reclusive".
Gu Kuang had obtained the Jinshi degree, which allowed him to be an imperial employee in 757, in the unstable time of Emperor Tang Suzong, whose reign (756-62) would be marked by the concern to calm the revolt of An Lushan who had spread like a forest fire. Revolt that had forced his father to abdicate, Emperor Xuanzong and the consequent condemnation of the death of his favorite concubine, a fact reported in Ba Juyi's plangent poem (722-846), corner of perpetual remorse.
Born in Yunyang (current Danyang, Jiangsu) after a life saddened by the death of a son, he moves with his family in 792 to the mountainous chain of Maoshan, south of Jurong, where he will receive the grace of a new son at the age of seventy. When he goes there, he writes a purpose: «Hidden in Maoshan; To make basic gold metals,/ to make the body light as a pity.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>ANA CRISTINA ALVES</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/autor/ana-cristina-alves/</link><description>Ana Cristina Alves - Assistant researcher and coordinator of the Educational Service of the Macao Scientific and Culture Center
They have been running ink rivers on the founding of Macao, as well as the foundation of Lisbon. The latter the academics consider it more prudent, after properly analyzed the etymologies, to be due to Phoenicians or Tartassi (Rocha, 2007), but that the legend is poetically reminiscent of Ulysses, from Luís Vaz Camões to Fernando Pessoa.  Thus it reads at the beginning of the eighth corner of Os Lusíadas, which the beginnings of Portugal find their mythical roots in Luso, son and companion of Bacchus, and those of Lisbon in Ulysses (Camões, 1997, VIII.5):
Ulisses is the one who makes the Santa Casa
To the goddess who gives her Facunda language;
That if there in Asia Trojan insigne abrasa,
Here in Europe Lisbon Imparty Funda.
Nothing more about the illustrious Lusitanians descended from gods, as well as their geographical spaces were founded by Greek heroes of unparalleled value such as Ulysses, whose ingenuity warrior and marear art exceeded. Hence, some centuries became Fernando Pessoa, in the second epic poem that the Portuguese value most, the message refer to Ulysses pointing to their mythological dimension and the unavoidable reality that it sustains, since “myth is nothing that is everything” (Pessoa, 1986, 24):
 Thus the legend
To come into reality
And fertilizing it takes place.
Below, life, half
Nothing, dies.
Myths and legends offer reality often the best it has, in its quality of projection reveal ideas and ideals, providing an important source where the unconscious manifests itself, but also the collective conscious of a people. Ulysses Warrior and Navigator is the patriarch found to the measure to found the capital of a country of indomitable warriors who faced powerful empires, such as Muslim, the Roman, and later the Spanish and who had to discover the sea path to India, beyond the Extrema Asia, without ever losing its Cavalheresque facet.
This would be masterfully praised in the corner VI of Os Lusíadas in the episode of the twelve of England, among which figured Magriço. They would know how to defend the honor of their ladies to the sword, revealing a huge bravery, narrated by Veloso (Camões, 1997, VI. 48):
This one, who helps him I didn't want to
 For not causing intestinal discord,
 Tells you: when the law intended
 From the kingdom there from the Iberian lands,
 In Lusitanians I saw so much boldness,
 Both prime and such divine parts,
 That they alone could, if not error,
 Support your part to fire and iron.
This chivalry had to be a constant in the Portuguese imagination, not just with ladies, but with all those who saw each other in trouble. This happened in England, so it would succeed in southern China, when the Portuguese helped the Chinese to clean the pirate seas and in reward were allowed a quiet existence in Macao.
In fact, even if only a myth or a legend, it would only have its reason for being, because it reveals a certain collective image that the Portuguese have of themselves and that greatly contributes, in terms of existential value, to guide the conduct of the population: they are where they are accurate, in helping the most unprotected, in one hand the heart, the heart. This is an image that once mitigated, it may be that "nothing that is everything."
Regarding the founding of Macao, the scholar, faces an interesting mix between myth and reality: first comes reality, then the legend comes, and the latter will have infinitely more weight, but be aware of the following information of unsuspected thinkers and historians.
Luís Gonzaga Gomes, in Macau - A Municipality with History (1997) in the chapter “Divergent Theses on the Origin of Macao”, argues that there are several theses on the foundation of Macao as a Chinese space governed by Portuguese from 1557, and this date does not exclude that the Portuguese had already walked through those stops since 1555, the height of Fernão Mendes Pinto, where the name of the name of the first time appears. Macao related to the Portuguese.
As for theses there are three most credible:
“1) Macao was donated to the Portuguese; 2) This donation was made in rewarding the services provided by Portuguese in the destruction of pirates; and 3) the occurrence took place in 1577” (GOMES, 1997, 26) later, after presenting several points of view, linked to remarkable liters, including Álvaro Semedo, as Chinese, argues that “Macau outside the Portuguese reason Exposed, what is to reward the valuable feat of the destruction of piracy in the seas of southern China ”(GOMES, 1997, 37). In this sense, it is mentioned by several authors, and as a misrepresented as expectable, the name of the fearsome chief of the pirates, which will have valid the famous imperial edict or plate, is called Tchang Si Lao, or Sam Chislao, or Charempum, Litauquiem, or Similao (Gomes, 1997, 37).
This finding does not exclude other more commercial readings from obtaining this platform, which was also commercial in China, and a price for the payment of the ground forum in Da Ming Shi (大明史 History of the Ming Dynasty) quoted by A.J. H. Chargignon, of 20,000 rights in Macau. (GOMES, 1997, 34).
The coexistence of both chronology versions of the history of Macao will be found. XVI-XVII centuries organized by historian Beatriz Basto da Silva (1992), who reassembles an important episode of annihilation of a certain and dangerous pirate Lam Chin at 1547, in a description of Chinese employee Lam Hei-Yuen, who shot the following way “and so the pirates who had acted comfortable for 20 years were won in one day. contrary they protect us against them, they did not do any harm to our people, but they even did the Chinese well ”(Yuen apud Silva, 1992, 33), being presented in the same chronology the year 1554 as the first verbal agreement by Leonel Sousa, which legalizes the situation of payment of commercial rights and“ Portuguese are allowed to be freely trade in the area that would become Macao ”. (SILVA, 1992, 39), dating from 1557 in this chronology the establishment of the first Portuguese in Macao, a date that agrees with the advanced by Luís Gonzaga Gomes, as well as in the suicide of the Chan-Si-Lau pirate and the defeat of the pirates of Rio das Pearls, as well as Leonel Sousa “obtain authorization to establish the previous settlement of the Portuguese in Macau (…) from Macau. ” (SILVA, 1992, 43).
In fact, there is the coexistence of the two most likely origins for the founding of Macau in the chronology of Beatriz Basto da Silva. It was asked: It would have been the verbal agreement and the subsequent settlement, with the payment of the floor of the ground, possible if the effective help of the Portuguese gentlemen and warriors had not been verified to the Chinese authorities, through concrete help to local traders who were constantly pressured by coans who then abounded in the seas of China and southern China?
The cleaning of maritime ground, provided by developed technology, at the best in the world, greatly contributed to helping if it had made it concrete and real, slowly deserving of a western people of the far east of Asia and only because it was really useful in combating pirates could make a legend, since from the beginning either readings was valid but partial. In order to obtain a correct and impartial reading of what has happened, it is believed that it is necessary to combine them, understanding how decisive it was in the good relationship of the two peoples to combat pirates, without them, there would not have been Macao, flushed by foreigners in Chinese territory.

After buying the map, we realize the green spots that this city is filled with gardens. From Tricycle we arrived at a two -star hotel, despite the offering of the four -star accommodation, with discounts, just for some more exchanges allow us to enjoy superior quality of comfort. With the bags already in the room, it is at the reception that we learn about the existence in the city of a brush museum.
Considered the capital of brushes, because according to a saying, the huzhou brushes, the role of Xuan de Xuanzhou rice (Anhui), the paint from China de Huizhou (also in Anhui) and the Duan Stone for the Zhaoqing (Guangdong) paint, are the four treasures of Chinese painting.
Right on the trip to the hotel I could see it is the small town because, from the bus terminal, in ten minutes we are in the center, traveling half the main avenue that longitudinally divides it. Now walking, we will have a channel with terrace on the banks. It looks like a good place to in the shadow, quietly refreshing from the noon. We are in the Hebin Garden. Still sitting and then wave us with a glass and a bottle. After an affirmative gesture, they bring a glass full of green tea leaves and hot water in a thermal container, which on the table is to serve.
Soon appearances appear that for a Reminbi they remove the dust in their shoes, giving them a small polydela. Glasses quickly tormented rest and an EHRU player experiences, with amplifier sounds, captivating us to enjoy a few songs. But his little introduction to the song of “Yue Liang Wo Di Chin” (the moon represents my heart) proves to be more annoying than cultural.
Studying a bustling but narrow pedestrian street where, despite the surrounding buildings, they are unmistakable from the environment, a recent Dragon door gives access to the part of the city where a long time is perpetuated. Another longmen, this old and made of wood, gives the smoke temple, which will be from the same period and where the floor is arranged. Abroad, a number of antique sellers spread the articles on the floor.
We went through clothing stores and between two of these stores, a cubicle with a counter where some people expect that from the coal grill on the ember to be ready for the skewers of different pieces of meat stuck in a long toothpick. We snack on Carneiro to deceive the stomach because they start to be hours of dinner. We are walking attentive to the restaurants, which in the distance are distinguished, as marked by red round lanterns.
Hotel Avenue
It is on Hongqi Lu Street, where most hotels are found, which due to the appearance we chose the restaurant, after going through many fast food, both Chinese and the two main foreign brands. At the entrance, a part of sales abroad with a lot of demand, we refer to being in a good place. Thoughts disguise the waiting time, when they tell us to be the pre-payment restaurant and there is no list to choose the dishes. Meats already cooked are mostly barbecue and are exposed in the sales sector, behind glass.
Five in the afternoon and already with the passwords bought for the meal, chosen by the dishes of the tables of customers there for dinner. We are served to tofu soaked in soy sauce and a halted hazeln ease with meat stuffing, floating in a soup. Cheap food to serve as dinner after the job.
Smoken in flavor, we are interrupted by a corcovered beggar of a certain age that seems to ask for money. Offering what we are eating, so all the food is emptied for the bowl and not even the sauce. Faced with such hunger, found later when we saw her in the stairs to eat, we still offer you money to another meal.
Mendicity is a recent phenomenon in China, although there have always been two types of people who walk through the streets and seem beggars. Those who vague live their fate, indifferent and whose people offer them food and those who in poorer places migrate to cities. Of course there are already beggars as well.
The sound of music comes out of stores and the foreign fast food restaurant uses a powerful column where a young maid dances to the sound of children for children, waiting for them to accompany her.
We tried to prove the specialties of the land and therefore, at the Huzhou Hotel restaurant, of two stars, tasted referenced dishes as local kitchen. We were served a fish flower, fish dish that, after baking in a bittersweet sauce, is twisted with his skin to serve as a flower-shaped chalice and thus presented. But it is at the four -star Hotel Zhebei that an exquisite kitchen gives us a tofu we miss.
The price is cheaper than the previous one. This restaurant had been recommended by two young women, who were waiting for their friends and whom a maid asks for help communicating with us, when we one day we climbed to the second floor of a cooked food restaurant at the table, the vulgar Hot-Pot. Realizing that they only serve vegetables, meat or seafood, to be cooked in the heated pan over a gas nozzle in the center of the table, we get up and prepare to leave.
Requestly ask us in English the reason we leave. Then comes the two young college students in Hangzhou, who lived at the family home. Explaining this is not the food that feels like us, we took the opportunity to ask for other regional food restaurants. Since apologizing to Huzhou for not having many restaurants, they present the best and cheap price the restaurant of the Zhebei Hotel.
After a harrowing and as it is early, as in China starts dinner at five in the afternoon, we returned to the avenue and then the hotel from where we saw another, also four stars, the International Huzhou. Continuing on the same ride, we found the Tian Yun silk store. Then a brush store, where there is for all sizes and prices, reaching porcelain or bamboo cable brushes, costing thousands of yuans.
Brushes Museum
Diving into Huzhou's past, entering one of the city's most picturesque streets. A Christian church dominates the street and around, stores occupy the part under the two -story houses. By the solidoes in the heads of some people, we realize that some of the business belong to Muslims. After refusing to be photographed, a tangerine salesman offers us a delicious fruit piece. Continuing, curiosity leads us to meet the stone bridge with three arches built in 1539, with some embedded ornamental stones.
Hence and to southwest, we go to the garden of the painter and calciple Zhao Mengfu (1254-1322) Painter Museum. This was native of Wuxing (today Huzhou), named after courtesy and pseudonyms Songxue, Oubo and Shuijinggong Daoren. He was a descendant prince of the Song Dynasty, but he served the Mongols Yuan Dynasty as an official at the Hanlin Academy.
As a painter, he specializes in the representation of horses and used recreating themes and styles of the old masters, with simple colors to make the landscapes. In addition to being a master of Tang Dynasty techniques, he was an excellent Caligraph, considered one of the main four in the history of Chinese calligraphy.
Already in the garden, the serenity with which the green of the vegetation is combined in the lake with the brown of the rest pavilions, or in the woods of the tea houses, it takes us there a long time, recreating figures with the reflection in the waters of the ornamental stones. We have to leave the garden to visit the Brushes Museum which, despite being encompassed in the same room, has an autonomous entrance. Huzhou brushes are referenced as the best in the country and so you have to see how they are made.
In chronological terms, the brush was invented in the late 3rd century A.N.E. By Meng Tian, a military commander of the Qin Dynasty. However, it is perceived by the painted vessels of different neolithic cultures, which must have existed for at least five thousand years. Therefore, Meng Tian will be linked, not to the invention, but to the improvement of brushes. Also the city of Huzhou is not the real place of production of the best brushes, but has won this title since in ancient times Shanlian, in the municipality of Wuxing, province of Zhejiang, was over his jurisdiction. The handwriting brushes made had their heyday during the Yuan Dynasty and are still considered among the best in all of China.
Four steps are required to manufacture the HU brush, and the coat of the rabbit, the fingernail and the goat hair is used. After the fat is removed with tire juice, the hair is cut into equal sizes and enter a solution to clean them. They are then united at the base with arabic gum and after drying, united with a tile that unites them to the bamboo.
With the brush made in its structure, the other phase of the process is passed. The hair is bumped to a porridge made of algae to put them together and with the wire wrapped a tip is created, the most important part of the brush. This wire that goes through the hair, on a lap gives the cone shape and also serves to remove the excess of the agglutinator papa.
With extreme patience and skill, the brushes are clean, rounded, creating a tip, with good elasticity. Then the brush, ready, passes to the hands of another employee, where in the bamboo cable are recorded the characters Tian Kuan Trade Mark, which replaced the old “double goat” brand.
The goat hair (HAO) brushes (HAO) are soft and serve to write small characters, rabbit hair are hard and those of the fingernail are between the two, with great elasticity for the handwriting of large characters. Sometimes a mixture of different hair is made, using those of other animals.
There are brushes of all kinds of sizes, serving some to paint and others to call. The best for Chinese handwriting are the rabbit and goat hair mix. HU brushes were widely used in the imperial court.
In the other part of the museum is the painter's room Zhao Mengfu with its utensils and some works, where the recorded stones are not lacking. Although the museum has a sales section, after leaving the museum enclosure and already on the street, a set of stores is dedicated to the sale of products for Chinese painting.
Leaving the brushes, we visited the market and crossing a wooden bridge in Zig-Zag, we traveled another old part of the city. Clothing extenders hide salespeople with bags full of tea leaves finished spoon that belong to the first harvest of the year, the best.
Our stay in Huzhou also serves to visit places at an hour of bus, such as Anji, to see the Bamboo Museum and already outside Zhejiang province in Jiangsu, Dingshan, referenced as the place of production of the best tea services. The southern bank of Taihu is the border line between the Huzhou district in Zhejiang province and Jiangsu province, where Lake Tai expands.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Coloane | Government canceled project of the Museum of Paladers 9 years ago</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/11/coloane-governo-cancelou-projecto-do-museu-das-palafitas-ha-9-anos/</link><description>Long before the authorities were part of the 85 square kilometers of maritime areas, there was the idea of lifting a stilts museum to consecrate this type of existing housing in Coloane. However, years later, the direction of tourism services says that the project will not even move forward, having been suspended in 2016
 
Between 2016 and 2017, the government planned to raise a museum about Coloane's stalps to tell the story of these peculiar houses of Macao. However, after news was published in the press to convey the inauguration of the project in 2017, the Directorate of Tourism Services (STD) confirmed to HM that no museum will be born. More: not only will it not be built, but the plan was aborted nine years ago.
“Due to the inclusion of the area where stilts are located in the government's urban planning plan for the coloane riverside, Lai Chi Vun shipyards and Navegantes Street, STD ended the 'Museum of the Museum of House Museum' in 2016, and subsequently completed the Return Procedure. Canceled ”, was referred to in the answer.
The cancellation in 2016 is still surprising, given that on June 14 of the same year the Jornal Tribuna de Macao (JTM) reported that the inauguration of the museum would take place in 2017. In this article, statements were cited by the director of STD, Helena de Senna Fernandes, made to the newspaper or Mun, explaining that the “project was in the [conception] phase of design”. They would have been held, including “several consultations to collect opinions from the residents of that area, expecting to improve the proposal of construction”.
According to JTM, the project should “be completed by the end of the year” in 2016, so that the work will be “started early 2017”, and STD expected “that the construction was completed in the same year”.
After the promise, in 2018 there was still “legal fundamentals” to build the Museum in Coloane, as also reported the JTM. The justification given by the STD was that Macau has not yet had the 85 square kilometers of maritime areas under his jurisdiction, something that has been legislated, precisely, since 2018.
A matter of priorities
HM sought to know the state of the designer of the Museum of Palafites following the recent launch of a book on the collage of Colaane, by Filipe Afonso, coordinator of the degree in Architecture of the University of São José. Now confronted with the official cancellation of the museum project, the official lamented the decision of the authorities.
"The cancellation of the Museum of Slacinas project is not just news about a project that has not advanced, but a starting point to equate Macao's development priorities, the way the heritage is managed and what means for collective memory, in this case of Coloane," he said. In the opinion of the author of “The Colaane Grammar”, “The Plan for the Marginal of Rua dos Navegantes should include proposals for new buildings that use and reinterpret Madeira as the main and essential element of construction”, and the connection of this street with the Lai Chi Vun shipyards, “especially with regard to the sea front, is a unique opportunity to create a coastal corridor that celebrates Colona's seafront history”.
Thus, and “given the richness of context and cancellation of the stilts museum, the focus should be on integrating the memory of these structures into the new plane”, so the existing structures of the shipyards, stilts should be restored, maintaining their original and material characteristics, but adapting them to new uses ”.
Still on the patrimonial value, Filipe Afonso described, in the interview with HM, the proposal to “classify stilts as heritage to give them legal protection”.
"By cataloging existing stilts, the book contributes to preserving the memory of this type of architecture and a broader discussion about its possible protection," he argued, adding that dwellings, many of them left to abandonment, "could be reused for experience tourism, or cultural interpretation centers, valuing local history."
They could also “be transformed into creative and artistic spaces or in fact propose new wood buildings along the waterline, with various uses and that can generate value to the Coloane community, contributing to Macao's cultural and economic diversification”.
Hopes
Filipe Afonso highlights the process of revitalization and recovery of the Lai Chi Vun shipyard zone as a “initiative with immense historical and cultural value, which refers to the rich tradition of the region's shipbuilding”. In fact, the Lai Chi Vun shipyard zone is one of the “six zones” to recover by the government and operators, which also include places such as the pier in the interior port or Avenida Almeida Ribeiro, among others.
In the area of Lai Chi Vun there is already a leisure zone where cultural initiatives have been carried out, with a museum area that tells the history of the Junos construction industry in the territory.
In this sense, Filipe Afonso asks that “the Macao government does not limit the design of these projects to a restricted range of‘ short-listed companions ””, ie a restricted group of companies.
Also, in his opinion, "Macau has a new generation of talented architects and creative ready to make his contribution." "I believe that through more open ideas contests, these professionals could offer innovative perspectives for the city's urban and cultural challenges. Deleting them from such crucial processes for Macao's urban and cultural development is a waste," he added.
The HM contacted other architects to get reactions to the cancellation of the museum project, but did not get answers.
What the law says
Between the suspension of the project and today a lot has changed. In 2018, Macao arranged from the maritime management bases law, which includes 85 square kilometers of area, and whose principles provides for the environmental preservation of spaces such as those that stilts are inserted.
The legislation introduced concepts such as “functional maritime zoning”, in the sense of delimiting zones “with fundamental and specific maritime functions according to location, natural resources, environmental conditions and exploration and use needs”.
In the list of principles to be complied with, the legislation speaks of something like “protection of the environment of maritime areas”, in order to “protect natural resources and the environment of the sea, realizing the planning of protection and promotion of the marine ecosystem, and marine protection should be taken into account”.
It should also be “conserving the sustainability of use and development” of these areas, and their use should be done “scientifically”, according to functional maritime zoning ”.
In addition to the concrete legislation that tied the paddle museum in 2016, there was also a direct planning plan to MSAR, something that was implemented in 2022 and also brings new directives for the exploration of maritime zones.
Coloane now has its own UOPG-Operative Planning and Management Unit, where a “rational organization of public infrastructures and collective use equipment” should apply, as well as “appropriate use of soils” in order to create a “coordinated space structure”.
Coloane's UOPG is part of the “ecological conservation zone”, which aims to “protect areas with ecological value” and “contribute to the greater protection of natural resources with ecological value”. Here it will not be allowed “to allocate soils for housing, commercial, industrial, tourist and amusement uses”, reads in the director of the masket.
Coloane's UOPG is also integrated into the “green or open public spaces”, and here should be “maintaining the current use for green spaces and outdoor activities, integrating it [Coloane's UOPG] into the green zone or open public spaces”.
Specifically, Coloane's UOPG should “promote the development of ecotourism and cultural tourism, with the creation of a tours of nature and the 'green and resilient waist', based on the combination of natural resources, namely hills, sea and coastal lines”. It should also “conserve and optimize existing industrial zones, build the 'waist of knowledge - industry - science' and the 'waist of cooperation of a river, two margins' and, simultaneously, rationally plan the housing zones in adequate location, according to the principle of balance between professional and residential functions”, and these points interconnect with the paradise zone, Navigantes Street and Savings Lai chi vun.
The Director Plan also explains that "the predominant use of soils at UOPG Coloane is an ecological conservation zone."</description><pubDate>2025-07-11 00:11:09</pubDate></item><item><title>AL | New Regiment prohibits deputies from disseminating content of the commissions</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/09/al-novo-regimento-proibe-deputados-de-divulgar-conteudos-das-comissoes/</link><description>With the new Hemiciclo Regiment approved yesterday, the deputies are prohibited from publicizing the subjects discussed in the meetings of the permanent committees, except for their presidents and secretaries. The subject generated debate yesterday in the Assembly regarding the limits of what may or may not be said. Pereira Coutinho voted against this article
 
The deputies of the Legislative Assembly (AL) are now prohibited from disseminating what is discussed at the Hemiciclo Commission meetings, "anyway," with the exception of its president and secretary. These usually disclose the content of the meetings at a press conference after their holding, and this will keep up.
This new regulation arises after the vote and discussion, in general and specialty, the alteration to the al. It was one of the most discussed topics in yesterday's debate, with the deputies arguing on what may or can not be said, having José Pereira Coutinho voted against this concrete article.
The disclosure of information from the meetings, which serves to analyze in the specialty proposals of law and always steering at the closed door, was something that was not yet regulated.
Coutinho began by asking if he could disclose the information "during the plenary meeting", for example, having said that "he never heard of any deputy who had violated that duty." "There have been meetings in the past where the secretaries warned about the information that should not be disclosed and nothing has been said. We are only 33 deputies and we should think of the possibility of revealing what was discussed, because it is difficult to define borders about what can or can not be revealed and this will give rise to many discussions later," he said.
The legislator also pointed out that "it can be difficult to execute this norm" and that "the principle of transparency" should be followed.
Ho Ion Sang, who presided over to the commission that analyzed the new Al Regiment, explained that "the content of the meetings is subject to the duty of confidentiality and this matter was clarified." "The content can be said by the president of the commissions after the meetings, at the press conferences, and journalists can ask questions. In practice remains as always happened and that has given good results," he said.
Meet the meetings
Another point addressed, whether or not the permanent committees were held at the closed door, and Pereira Coutinho defended the opening to the public like what happens in Hong Kong. The AL regiment does not prohibit open meetings, but this always depends on a prior deliberation.
But iau Teng Pio, deputy, advised against the opening of the meetings. "The purpose of the closed -door meetings is so that members of the government, advisors and deputies can argue at ease even if there is no final decision.
Kou Hoi In, president of AL, recalled that “the spirit of the norm has not been changed” and that everything will remain in it, only the ban on what deputies cannot refer outside the commissions.
"The reserved character of permanent committees is so that everyone can speak freely and if any deputy says this or that can spoil sensations of injustice in society to deputies and this cannot happen. We have to protect deputies and ensure confidentiality."
At yesterday's meeting, there was also the discussion of the duty of the deputy to participate in all permanent committees, even in those to which he does not belong. Several deputies spoke of the need for better coordination of meetings agendas.
"In the future there may be more practical coordination because there are many meetings and proposals of law. We can schedule the meetings so that there are more deputies," he said.
Moreover, the new Al regiment prohibits deputies by "clothing or signs, banners, signs or other objects that have offensive content or political provocation, or undermine the dignity of the AL".</description><pubDate>2025-07-09 23:47:53</pubDate></item><item><title>About 97 percent of Spanish adolescents victim of sexual aggression on the internet</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/09/cerca-de-97-por-cento-dos-adolescentes-espanhois-vitima-de-agressao-sexual-na-internet/</link><description>About 97 percent of teenagers in Spain is the victim of some kind of sexual violence on the internet, warned yesterday the Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) Save the Children.
The NGO released a report yesterday with the title “Networks that hold. Sexual exploitation of childhood and adolescence in digital environments”, which elaborated with the European Association for Digital Transition and which includes official data and an inquiry to over 1,000 Spanish young people aged 18 and 21.
According to the study, 97 percent of these young people said they were victims of some kind of sexual violence on the Internet during adolescence, including contacts from adults for sexual purposes, unauthorized diffusion of intimate images or blackmail and threats to send intimate and sexual content.
Another type of violence enhanced in the report is the use of artificial intelligence tools to create sexual content from a real image of adolescents or children (content known as 'Deepfake' or 'Ultra counterfeits').
According to the study, one in five young Spaniards was the victim of the creation and diffusion of these 'Deepfake' during adolescence, namely with sharing by another person, to third parties, and without consent, of their own nudity images, elaborated through artificial intelligence.
"The internet, social networks and technologies not only facilitate capture and exposure to sexual exploitation -related risks, but can be the means by which these violence against boys and girls are committed and allow their perpetuation," said Save the Children, in a statement released from the study published yesterday.
Starter
Social networks are the most frequent way for aggressors to start contacts with the teenage victims, with the study also highlighting online video games in the case of boys. After this first contact, they move to applications and messages of messages such as WhatsApp, Telegram or Discord.
Girls are the ones that most denounce to be pressured to send intimate content (28.5 percent of 18.4 percent of boys), with the study that all victims had shared personal or intimate information on the Internet during childhood and adolescence.
According to the study, only 50 percent of young people when they were smaller considered contact with unknown people one of the main risks of the internet and only 32.9 percent mentioned as dangerous the consented send of intimate images to adults.
On the other hand, 70 percent states that it has not seen as a risk, in adolescence, the manipulation of photographs and videos with artificial intelligence. Asked the reasons why they sent intimate or sexual images of themselves, 48 percent says it did not know it was something potentially dangerous, 46 percent weighed that it was normal and 42 percent sought attention, affection or some kind of validation.
Alone at home
In this context, Save the Children warns, in the study, for the lack of follow -up of minors; The scarce digital formation, in cybersecurity, privacy and recognition of danger situations and the intensive use of technologies by children and adolescents.
According to data from the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Spain, cited in the NGO report, in 2023 there were 4,896 complaints for offenses on the Internet against children and adolescents, 1,068 of which were sexual crimes.
"These numbers represent only the tip of the iceberg, as most cases do not know, in part, for the absence of denunciation and, in part, for the difficulties in detection, which increases when these facts take place in an online environment," said Save the Children Catalina Perazzo, quoted in the NGO statement.</description><pubDate>2025-07-09 01:11:37</pubDate></item><item><title>Sao Tome and Prince | Relationship with China is discreet, but strategic</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/14/sao-tome-e-principe-relacao-com-china-e-discreta-mas-estrategica/</link><description>On Saturday, 50 years of the independence of Sao Tome and Principe were celebrated. The future advances to the rhythm of diplomatic relations with other Portuguese speaking countries. For academic Cátia Miriam Costa, the African country and China are strategic partners, despite the description of the relationship between both
 
Researcher Cátia Miriam Costa considers that the relationship between Sao Tome and Principe and China remains discreet, despite being almost celebrating a decade, with a growing strategic interest of Beijing in the position of the archipelago in the South Atlantic.
"Since neither country nor another talks much about the subject, we end up not realizing the depth of the relationship well. But I believe it is not yet a very deep relationship," the researcher at the Center for International Studies of ISCTE - University Institute of Lisbon, noted to Lusa.
The geostrategic position of the archipelago, located in the Gulf of Guinea, feeds, however, the interest of Beijing, namely in the context of the Chinese bet on the expansion of logistics and sea corridors in the South Atlantic.
"Sao Tome, if it is not a very important port in logistical terms, is a relevant port for control, for example, of piracy, threats. Therefore, this position also certainly reflected by Beijing," he explained.
The restoration of formal ties in 2016, after two decades of Taiwan's recognition by Sao Tome, was a “pragmatic” decision of the African country, and a trump card for Beijing Diplomacy, which always maintained “open channels”, even during the period of removal, Cátia Miriam Costa explained.
"The relationship with China is more fruitful because it brings other counterparts," explained the researcher. "It was also for these counterparts that [in 1997] Sao Tome exchanged the Popular Republic of China for Taiwan, because at that time the Popular Republic of China was a developing country. So it didn't have to offer what Taiwan had, which was perfectly integrated into the international market," he said.
A VOLTE-FACE
In December 2016, Sao Tome officially announced the establishment of relations with the Popular Republic of China, ending the recognition of Taiwan.
The decision caused the immediate cancellation of the scholarships offered by Taiwan to St.-Tome students, many of whom were eventually integrated into the other Chinese universities. China has quickly become one of the main cooperation partners in São Tomé, with promises of investment and support in areas such as education, technical training, agriculture and infrastructure.
The researcher recalled that even before formal relations, Beijing never completely broke with Sao Tome, keeping the country involved in the activities of the Macao Forum, albeit only as an observer, a strategy he considers "typical of Chinese diplomacy." "China does not fully close the doors. It can suspend relationships, but if it is something of national interest, it is usually renegotiated again," he said.
“Limited Results”
Nevertheless, Cátia Miriam Costa acknowledged that the concrete results of cooperation are still limited. “There are more projects in the role than properly ongoing works,” he said, attributing part of the responsibility to the weak institutional capacity of São Tomé, which only recently began to create structures to attract and negotiate foreign investment.
Among the sectors with the potential for the deepening of cooperation, the researcher highlighted the fishing, the marine resources and eventually the cocoa. Oil exploration raises “high risks”, both for technical complexity and environmental limitations.
"China is interested in the region, but it is not because Sao Tome is an attractive market -because it is not -yes, for its location, stability and integration capacity in a broader regional project," he said.
The researcher also stressed Chinese investment in Chinese language teaching in Sao Tome, which also aims to "create a network of people with language dominance, familiar with culture and potentially useful for the future of bilateral relations." "China maintains a strategic interest in the relationship, even if it does not express it with great visibility. And for a country like Sao Tome, any small help can have a significant impact," he concluded.
Reports of four Sao Tomers who followed courses in China
Denise, Lucineidy, Reginaldo, and Aithysa grew up under the sign of an alliance with Taiwan, until life and academic path were redefined by the rupture of diplomatic ties between Sao Tome and Taipei in 2016.
Denise Aragão Fortes still remembers her hand to Tsai Ing-Wen. It was November 2016, the day of Africa in Taiwan was celebrated, and the official was attended at the time.
It is very likely that behind the scenes would already outline the end of diplomacy between Taiwan and Sao Tome and Principe, but for this student of International Relations at the University of Ming Chuan, in Taoyuan, North Taiwanese, the news, who arrived a month after these celebrations, on December 21, was a surprise.
“There was no rumors, nothing,” recalls Lusa Denise, now 29, working in marketing and living in Almada, Portugal.
When the secondary finished, also the bonds between the island and the African nation, agreed in 1997, had just reached the age of adult. There was “very closeness” between the parts, with Taiwanese friendships in the family.
Normality shaken this December 2016. Studying with a scholarship granted by Taipei, Denise and other St.-Tome students in Taiwan was given the option of continuing studies, without financial assistance, or being transferred to China as scholarships. Being at the end of the academic course, Denise remained in Taoyuan. Most, however, changed geography, university and life.
Country “full of opportunities”
Lucineidy Almeida, now 28, saw the arrival in Tianjin, northern China, as "a new restart" in a "country full of opportunities." Attending the second year of biotechnology in Taichung, this native of Santo António had some difficulty in following the degree in Mandarin. A limitation that would eventually surpass, evaluates today, but in China, had the possibility of studying in English pharmaceutical sciences.
He says he learned of the diplomatic break through social networks and, like all students who spoke to Lusa, left criticism of conducting the process, with “many uncertainties”, information given “on time”, “a feeling of disrespect”, and, in the middle, the suspension of the bags.
Two months after the announcement, he landed in Hong Kong, where he treated his visa, although he still unaware of what his final destination. Only upon arrival in Beijing was he told that he went to Tianjin, recalls Lucineidy, living today in Portugal, in Cacém, and working as an English and Portuguese interpreter in the medical field.
Regarding the diplomatic interruption, it notes that "from what was realized at the time", it was "a monetary question": "in the sense that China offered more [to Sao Tomé] than Taiwan at the time could provide."
The São Tome Prime Minister of the time, Patrice Trovoada, considered the unilateral break of relations as “the right”, taking into account the authorities' view of the country's development. "We decided the principle of joining one China and when adhering implies the cut of relations with Taiwan. The international scenario 20 years ago, not the same as today," he added.
But the new political order did not take students to advance in the academic career. Aithysa Ramos, 32, is still in Beijing, where, after leaving Taiwan, she concluded the master's degree in business management.
If this morning of 2016, the story had not taken this course, would probably have been in Taiwan, where he had lived seven years ago. At the time, it now remembers the English education teacher, was “devastated and angry”: “It was like my second home, I passed [part of] my adolescence, growth phases”.
Reginaldo was in the second year of Business Management at the University of Yuan Ze, Taoyuan, when he stayed to the news. He realized that he “had no power” to change the course of history.
The initial shock, assumes today, was really the cold. Despite admitting "it was" always a process of doubt, "China, where he moved two months after the cutting cut," it was a surprise for the better. " “Because I was still here, not coming back, I can say yes, it was the best thing that happened,” he says.</description><pubDate>2025-07-14 01:35:35</pubDate></item><item><title>Works | Revitalization of the pier 23-25 and Patio of eternal happiness later this year</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/09/obras-revitalizacao-dos-cais-23-25-e-patio-da-eterna-felicidade-ainda-este-ano/</link><description>There are six historical areas to revitalize with the support and investment of the six game operators, but the deputies question the absence of news about what is being done and the slowness of the projects. The government assured that between the end of the third quarter and beginning of the fourth will be released more data and completed revitalizations of old zones
 
The revitalization of the 23-25 quay in the interior port area and the eternal happiness courtyard should be completed later this year, being interconnected with the projects designed and funded between the executive and the six game operators for six ancient Macao zones.
The warranty was given yesterday by the secretary for the economy and finance, Tai Kin IP. "The revitalization of the six zones is a priority task for the government, because we have to rely on the investments of the dealers. We have done studies, made an arrangement of resources and now we know what we have. We want, at the end of the third quarter, the beginning of the four quarter, to be able to advance with more details."
More concretely, it was up to a representative of the Cultural Institute to confirm that the rehabilitation of the eternal happiness courtyard and pier 23-25 is completed at the same time.
Tai Kin IP has ensured that the government “is not stopped” while analyzing and studies. “We have already given instructions [to concessionaires] for the work that can be adjusted. We ask dealers to do the analysis depending on the characteristics of the zones. We will complete the structures [this year], with remodeling and restoration works, and we are working.”
The secretary stressed that the type of consumption is also being analyzed in these six zones, according to the type of tourists, with "two categories of consumption, the traditional and new generations."
“I ask you to accelerate”
Despite the promises of more detail, the deputies regretted the lack of more detailed information. “The essentials is to publicize the projects, because the government has to conduct certain investments and guide the market. Can the government have time to do the studies, but will small and medium -sized businesses take this time on studies? Will stores that are in the six zones continue to explore the activity?” Asked Deputy Ron Lam.
According to the deputy, the ideas for the six zones should result in a “transparent and publicized project to the public”, because “the whole society [has to be heard] so that all projects can reflect the market panorama”.
Another critical voice was that of IP Sio Kai, who asked for a comprehensive revitalization. “Everyone expects changes in the community economy. Concessionaires are committed to the six zones, but have passed two and a half years [since the announcement of the projects]. Of course there has been transition work, but there are new conception plans and everything should be done at the same time. For example, there may be obstacles to the conception of plans, because we have the street of happiness very close to the courtyard of eternal happiness, and it can be revitalized the surrounding areas. Of the six zones?
It should be noted that the six zones concerned include Rua da Felicidade, Pier No. 23 and 25 of the Inner Port; the surrounding area of Avenida Almeida Ribeiro and Rua de Cinco de Outubro; the bar area near the dock D. Carlos I; Lai Chi Vun's shipyards in Coloane, and the Zone of Fortaleza do Monte.</description><pubDate>2025-07-09 00:38:44</pubDate></item><item><title>BRICS | Seventh Cimeira ends today with focus on Trump's fares</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/07/brics-setima-cimeira-termina-hoje-com-foco-nas-tarifas-de-trump/</link><description>Since Saturday, leaders in the countries that are part of the BRICS Group have been gathered in Rio de Janeiro for another summit designed to think about the reform of institutions and the inclusion of more emerging economies, as well as the fight against Trump's rates. Highlight for the absences of Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin
 
Since Saturday, Rio de Janeiro hosts the BRICS Group leaders, which ends today. The first day was based on the dialogue around the ambition of emerging economies to reform international institutions and the defense of multilateralism.
"I think the main message is this: at the time of so many international crises, conflicts, we are experiencing a succession of conflicts that only increase from year to year, having a set of countries reaffirming the power of diplomacy, cooperation, the need to act jointly, to solve the problems of the population and not to generate more destruction, such as conflicts, it is an opportunity that we always have to take advantage of," Lyrio, guide of discussions and agreements of heads of state at the conference, designated by the Brazilian presidency of the BRICS.
In all, about 30 countries and nine international organizations have been present, with the Brazilian head of state, Lula da Silva leading the meeting, which has Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, Angola President and African Union, Secretary-General of United Nations, António Guterres.
The main absences are Russian and Chinese heads of state, two BRICS founding countries. Vladimir Putin, the target of a warrant of detention issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC), on suspicion of illegal deportation of Ukrainian children to Russia, will only participate in video conferencing.
Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov will be the representatives of the two founding countries of the group, which represents more than 40 percent of the global population and more than 35 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) worldwide.
From China with Love
According to Chinese state agency Xinhua, Chinese prime minister promised to “expand cooperation with Brazil” in the areas of “digital and aerospace economy”. Li Qiang spoke on Saturday, as part of a meeting with Lula da Silva, noting that the country intends to “work with Brazil to take advantage of each other and expand cooperation in areas such as digital economy, green economy, scientific and technological and aerospace innovation”.
Xinhua quotes words from Li Qiang, who referred to the fact that “China is ready to work with Brazil to continue efforts to enrich the dimensions of bilateral relations and achieve more concrete results in cooperation in order to provide more benefits to both peoples”.
One of the points out of this meeting was the realization in 2026 of the year of China-Brazil culture, which provides for an intensification in cooperation in areas such as “education, youth and health”, in order to facilitate “more exchanges between peoples and strengthen public support to China-Brazil's friendship and cooperation”.
“China is willing to work with Brazil to further consolidate and deepen bilateral cooperation in trade, finance and infrastructure development within the high quality cooperation of Belt And Road [track and route]”, the Chinese prime minister, who did not forget the great flag of this BRICS Summit: multilateralism.
Thus, I read Qiang considered “the two countries as fierce defenders of multilateralism and free trade”, saying that “China is willing to improve communication and coordination with Brazil in multilateral structures such as the United Nations, BRICS and G20, work in union with developing countries to promote an equal and ordered multipolar world and universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization, and provide more certainty and stability to the world. ”
On the other hand, Lula da Silva said that "Brazil is willing to deepen communication and multilateral coordination with China, to oppose unilateralism and defend multilateralism and free trade in order to promote peace and world development." After the meeting between the two leaders, “cooperation documents in areas such as tax and financial matters, artificial intelligence, alignment of development strategies and aerospace” were signed.

Cuba's debut
Cuba President Miguel Díaz-Canel also participates in the 17th BRICS Summit, being the first time Cuba has associated with this geopolitical and economic cooperation group.
Under the motto “reinforcing cooperation in the global south for more inclusive and sustainable governance”, the BRICS Summit's agenda comprises two central axes: the consolidation of cooperation between the global southern countries and the promotion of reforms in international governance mechanisms.
Created in 2009 throughout Brazil, Russia, India and China, BRICS admitted South Africa two years later and, since last year, integrates six new effective members: Egypt, United Arab Emirates, Ethiopia, Iran, Indonesia and Saudi Arabia. Brazil invited to this summit leaders from various Latin American countries, including Mexico, Colombia, Uruguay and Chile.
The statute of associate, which takes Cuba to Rio de Janeiro, was approved in October 2024 during the summit of the group held in the Russian city of Kazan, which was made official in 2025, recalled the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Caribbean country.
In addition to geopolitical issues, BRICS have sought in Rio de Janeiro in the organization's economic weight, namely in the financial domain, in which they have been looking for a dollar for years for trade in the group.
The host president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, president of Brazil, stressed last Friday the importance of a mechanism with these characteristics, recognizing, however, that the current international political context is "complicated".
What is on the agenda
On the first day, the heads of state and government of the BRICS participated in two plenary sessions, particularly on "peace and safety and reform of global governance" and the second relative to the strengthening of multilateralism, economic and financial affairs and artificial intelligence. "
In the latter, the revision of the ACCIORARY participation in the World Bank, the realignment of IMF shares [International Monetary Fund] and the increase in the representation of developing countries in leadership positions in international financial institutions and the importance of reforming the UN Security Council.
In addition, as it has been happening during the BRICS ministerial meetings over the past few months, a complaint should be made to the increase in unilateral unilateral unilateral protectionist measures, in reference to the measures announced by the President of the United States, Donald Trump; as well as an appeal to reinforce the use of local currencies in trade between the bloc countries. Today the plenary session will be on “Environment, COP30 and Global Health”.
The term BRIC was created by a Goldman Sachs analyst to refer to emerging economies who began to stand out worldwide beyond the US, with the BRICS first gathered at the level of heads in 2009. This is the first meeting that brings together the new group configuration with 11 member countries.
Brazil has mobilized about 20,000 military personnel, as well as fighters with missiles, anti-drug systems and elite shooters to ensure the safety of the event. The safety operation, called Operational Command Redeemer Set, also provides for the use of 300 vehicles, 38 armored vehicles, 18 boats and eight helicopters.</description><pubDate>2025-07-07 04:58:58</pubDate></item><item><title>Cape Verde | Évora family, between Macau and the rest of the world</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/03/cabo-verde-familia-evora-entre-macau-e-o-resto-do-mundo/</link><description>Tomorrow are 50 years of Cape Verde's independence, the country from which the first levada of the Évora family came out in the 1940s, towards Macao, where he won roots. Nowadays, only one member of the family remains in the territory, the cardiologist Mário Évora
 
There were once a dozen Évoras in Macao, where they arrived in the 1940s, but only Mario Évora resists, with the family repeating the migrations that mark both Cape Verde and the Macanese.
"We have been between eight and ten Évoras in Macau," Sports Medicine expert Humberto Évora told Lusa from Lisbon, where he has lived since he renovated. The maternal grandparents of Humberto (the last of the family to be born in Cape Verde) and Mário (the first to be born in Macau) arrived in the east in the late 1940s, with five of the couple's six children.
A year later, the daughter who had stayed with her husband in Cape Verde came to Macau, already with baby Humberto. The initial plan was for two years, but the couple ended up three decades and have three more children: Mario, Rui and Maria Helena.
In 1971, it was the turn of Humberto and Mário to leave to study medicine in Lisbon, but not without a great fright linked to the colonial war that had lasted a decade ago.
"As we went to the university we could postpone military inspection, but the papers did not come from Macao and we risk being considered refractory," said Humberto. The situation resolved, but Mario admitted to Lusa the fear of the mobilization. "We had this persecution, we had to go through the year not to go with the sides in the war," he explained.
“The Shock” in Lisbon
Upon arrival in Lisbon, “we were soon welcomed and integrated into the Cape Verdean student community,” said Humberto, at a time of student agitation and politics. "There were periods when it was almost daily, manifestations of students against the regime, the shock police enter the canteen inside and give some suckling," said Mario.
Humberto admitted that "it was a shock, for those who came from Macau, where there was little political culture and the colonial war was seen as a struggle against terrorists." In a summer, the young man, who was integrated into a Cape Verdean group of intervention music, left with a friend "to the overseas ride out of guitar on his back."
“I always remember the first time in France, that I saw the colonial war described on the contrary on television, the struggle for the liberation of a colonial power of occupation,” said Humberto.
Independence
When the two brothers finished the medical course, the independence of Cape Verde, on July 5, 1975, led them to the root return. "There was a movement of many of our colleagues to contribute to a new country, which was beginning to take the first steps," said Mario, then a formed cardiologist.
Also because, recalled Humberto, some of the friends of Lisbon had, however, became members of the Government of Cape Verde. "There was this possibility, but the return to Macao, a place where it had spent so long, was natural," he explained. “I was born in Cape Verde, I spent part of my life in Portugal, I grew up in Macao, I am also Macaense. I am a citizen of the world,” said Humberto.
Macanese are a Euro-Asian community, most of which Lusodescendants, with roots in Macau, although many have emigrated, due to the economic situation or fear created by the transition from Portugal Administration to China in 1999.
From the Évora brothers, Rui, engineer, left before the transition to Cape Verde, where he even worked on the project of the Macao Hotel David Chow built on the beach, but was inaugurated.
The younger sister, Maria Helena, a documentary science expert who has even worked in the Macao Historical Archive, is currently in the City Council of Oeiras. The children “are all out” between the United Kingdom, Cape Verde and Portugal, said Mario. "Now the world is smaller and it is going where there are opportunities," he said.
Humberto also faces migrations "as a natural process, not only for Cape Verdeans, but even to the Macanese."
Nothing that has prevented the two brothers from keeping their ties with the archipelago. Humberto divides the time between Portugal and Cape Verde, and has been the official doctor of Cape Verdean sports for decades to the main international competitions.
Mario was one of the founders-and president for ten years-of the Macau-Cabo Green Friendship Association. "We had here Ildo Lobo, Tito Paris, and my cousin," said the cardiologist, before taking a break and adds, with a smile: "Cesaria Évora."</description><pubDate>2025-07-03 23:18:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Traditional associations support exclusions</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/17/associacoes-tradicionais-apoiam-exclusoes/</link><description>The reaction of traditional associations to the disqualification of two lists for the upcoming legislative elections was not expected, either through communications or statements to the newspaper or Mun, aligning with the position of the government and the central government's connection cabinet in the MSAR.
Lao Nga Wong applauded justice and legitimacy of the decision of the Commission of Electoral Affairs to the Legislative Assembly (Caeal) and argued that the disqualifications were necessary to prevent the entry of "liars who say to love the homeland and Macao" in the "government structure."
The member of the permanent committee of the Chinese people's political advisory conference, and President General Association of the Overseas Chinese of Macao, said that the exclusion of candidates eliminates risks to the interests of the country of Macao.
In turn, the president of the General Association of Macao Women, Lau Kam Ling, argued that the deputies must be “sincere patriots”, otherwise it will harm the interests, sovereignty and national security, as well as Macao's prosperity and stability.
Deputies Chui Sai Peng and Chui Sai Cheong praised that checking the ability of candidates who dismissed their colleague from Hemiciclo Ron Lam for ensuring the political stability and safety of the Macao regime.
The president of the General Union of Macao residents' associations, NG Siu Lai, said that this type of candidate's ability verification is common practice worldwide, including Hong Kong.
Also the President of the Federation of Macao Workers' Associations, Ho Sut Heng, applauded the work of the State Security Defense Commission, because it ensures the governance controlled exclusively by Patriots.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Elections | Disqualified candidates bind loyalty to masters and the country</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/17/eleicoes-candidatos-desqualificados-vincam-lealdade-a-raem-e-ao-pais/</link><description>In the aftermath of the disqualifications of the two lists to the legislatures, the vetoed candidates underline their love for the homeland and the macao and the loyalty to the masters. Ron Lam believes that “the sun always comes after the storm”
 
Candidates vetoed by the Legislative Assembly Electoral Affairs Committee (Cael), which thus denies them the right to participate in the elections for the Legislative Assembly, respond with different voices to their exclusion, but all underline the same point: the unfailing love to Macau and the Fatherland.
 
One of the affected, Deputy Ron Lam from the Macao Synergy list, admitted that his exclusion "was very sudden." However, Lam remains optimistic: "I'm in a quiet conscience. My initial intention to Macau will not change. I believe the sun always comes after the storm," he added.
Already Johnson Ian, also from the list of Macau synergy, began by following line previously presented Ron Lam that is, that the news of his disqualification fell as a surprise. Ian began by characterizing “sudden” the novelty and revealed that he became aware of the fact through the Caeal press conference.
However, because it has now been disqualified, this does not mean that Ian alter his perception of the work done. "Looking at the years behind, regardless of the subject or position I took, I never diverted from the original intention to serve Macau's society. I always felt that Macau could improve and this feeling became central to my goals. All my work was for the country and Macao," said the excluded candidate.
Johnson Ian also assumed that his route was not made only of success, but is in a quiet conscience.
After thanking the Macao synergy team and residents for the support shown after disqualification, Johnson Ian asked for a moment to reflect on what appears in the future. "But I will continue to love Macau, I will always be the person you know," he said.
 
Environmentalist “without words”
"What anecdote! The last hope in this small town died, never wanted to be a deputy, but only helping a member of the Legislative Assembly who wanted to give voice to the population, did not expect this city, which used to be multicultural and inclusive, would degenerate in a" dictatorship "." This is how environmentalist Joe Chan, who was the fifth candidate of the disqualified list led by Ron Lam, reacted yesterday to the decision of the Commission of Electoral Affairs of the Legislative Assembly (Caeal).
Shortly after the announcement that the list led by Ron Lam had been excluded after the political scrutiny of the State Security Defense Commission, Joe Chan proved to be "speechless." "I learned today that, apparently I do not support the basic law. I think it's time to fight for something that is worth it. I'm speechless, I was quietly disqualified," he said on social networks.
 
Security imposes silence
However, political commentator Sonny Lo Shiu-Hing yesterday told Lusa that with the disqualification of 12 candidates for deputies in Macau, for lack of patriotism, a parliament with "many more loyal than opponents" is foreseen in the future.
The disqualification of 12 deputies, announced on Tuesday by the Commission of Electoral Affairs of the Legislative Assembly (Caeal), "means that deputies have to be more politically correct and it is expected that there are many more loyal than opponents," said Sonny Lo Shiu-Hing. "Changes to deputies' rules and regulations seem to point out in this direction," he added.
Sonny Lo referred to the approval, a week ago, in the Legislative Assembly (al) of amendments to the laws of the Deputies Statute and the normative of the Parliamentary Regiment, which reinforces the powers of the President of the Assembly and plasma in the legal documents “Macao governed by patriots” and the State Security Defense Law.
The Macao Electoral Commission said on Tuesday that the State Security Defense Commission (CDSE) excluded, for lack of patriotism, two lists candidates for the elections for AL.
The president of Caeal explained that 12 candidates from both lists "do not defend the basic law and are faithful to the Special Administrative Region of Macau of the Popular Republic of China."
Exclusion covers six candidates from the Liveliod Popular Strength list in Macao, led by social worker Alberto Wong, who first competed in AL.
The other list is the power of the synergy, led by the current deputy Ron Lam U Tou, who, in the last elections, in 2021, had been the seventh most voted, with 8,764 votes.
Seng Ioi Man has ensured that the binding opinions of the CDSE, of which it is not possible to appeal, "have a clear and sufficient legal foundation" and have been elaborated "taking into account the facts." However, the judge refused to reveal the facts that led to exclusion, arguing that "the works and documents of the State Security Defense Commission are confidential."
 
All for one
"We don't really know the reasons, because the electoral law and the National Security Act include a number of possible reasons," Sonny Lo told Lusa.
On Tuesday, the president of Caeal had assured that the binding opinions of the CDSE, of which it is not possible to appeal, "have a clear and sufficient legal foundation" and were elaborated "taking into account the facts."
However, the judge refused to reveal the facts that led to exclusion, arguing that "the works and documents of the State Security Defense Commission are confidential."
The disclosure of these "may represent certain risks to national security, and should not even be published their content," he added.
 
Shortly after the announcement of the Electoral Commission, CDSE stressed, in a statement, that when a candidate is excluded for lack of patriotism, all other candidates from the same line are also removed.
The government demonstrated, in another statement, "strong support" to the decision of the CDSE, which described as "a correct measure for the full implementation of the fundamental principle" Macao governed by patriots ".
Thus, they will compete for the elections of September 14, six lists for direct suffrage, eight less than in 2021.
Thirty -three deputies are part of AL, 14 of which are elected by direct suffrage, 12 for indirect suffrage through associations, and seven are later appointed by the chief executive.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Investigated connection between 34 missing gamblers and anti -drug war in the Philippines</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/16/investigada-ligacao-entre-34-apostadores-desaparecidos-e-guerra-antidroga-nas-filipinas/</link><description>Philippines are investigating a possible relationship between the disappearance of 34 men linked to bets on rooster fights and extrajudicial executions during former President Duterte's anti-drug war, a lawyer of the victims said yesterday.
The connection between the disappearance and executions within the Anti-Drug War, carried out by Rodrigo Duterte, would reinforce the case before the International Criminal Court against the former president, told the broadcaster Filipina ABS-CBN Kristina Conti, one of the representatives of the victims' families.
"It would be an additional evidence. The police, or in particular these death squads were involved in assassinations of activists and other directed murders," he said.
The case of the 34 Sabungos -as they are known in the Philippines the fans of the struggles of the roosters -missing in 2021, has made headlines since one of the accused, Julie Padidongan, said they were killed and then thrown into the lake surrounding the Taal volcano.
Padidongan accused businessman Charlie Ang, involved in lucrative online bets and for those who worked as security, to have ordered the murders, carried out by police officers.
Philippine coastal diver teams continue to search the turbulent volcanic waters, a process that may take months, and so far recovered several bags with human and animal remains that authorities are analyzing.
 
Other investigations
The Secretary of Justice, Jesus Crispin Remulla, said on Monday that he was investigating whether police accused of the disappearances were also involved in extrajudicial executions during the Duterte War against the drug.
"There are people involved in the murders of the war against drugs and e-sabong [online bets], that's all we can mention for now, but we have to establish clearer connections," he said.
For its part, the presidential palace stressed that it will proceed to an exhaustive investigation into the disappearances, despite the criticism of family members for years of inaction in this case.
"This will not be neglected, there will be no cover-up and the investigation will continue; this is what the president [Ferdinand Marcos Jr.] wants," said presidential spokesman Claire Castro at a press conference on Friday.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Caeal | Government expresses “strong support” to exclusions</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/16/caeal-governo-manifesta-forte-apoio-as-exclusoes/</link><description>Moments after the exclusions of the elections were made public due to the decision of the State Security Defense Commission, the government issued a statement to express the “strong support” to exclusions.

The news was announced yesterday at a press conference by the President of the Electoral Affairs Commission of the Legislative Assembly (Caeal), Judge Seng Ioi Man, in which the expressions “according to the law” and “confidential for state security reasons” were the most used.
"In response to the opinion of the State Security Defense Commission that candidates do not defend the basic law or are not faithful to MSAR, Caeal has decided that candidates are unable to be candidates," said Seng Ioi Man yesterday.
After another wave of exclusions, the opinions of agreement to the decision were not expected (see hybrid text), with the government and the central government's connecting office in the MSar to demonstrate full support for Caeal's decision.
Ron Lam also reacted after the revelation that he would not be able to renew his mandate as a deputy, in a publication on social networks. "Thanks for your concerns and united response. I have not received any notification, I only saw the news in direct like all you. It was very sudden. I am very calm and with quiet conscience, my dedication to Macau will not change, but I believe the sun always shines after the storm," he said. "I can only apologize to everyone for not being able to continue to serve you. I sincerely want to thank all the team that accompanied me in the service to Macau, all you," concluded Ron Lam.
Purity tests
It is recalled that in the legislative elections of 2021, in which 21 candidates were excluded by Caeal, the analysis of the patriotism of the lists left out the power of synergy and Ron Lam, which was considered patriotic and faithful to masters and the basic law.
Between the two suffrage, the electoral law has been amended to ensure that only patriotic deputies and people faithful to MSAR and Basic Law can be an assessment made by the State Security Defense Commission. Ron Lam was one of the deputies who helped pass the law that would justify his exclusion from the elections about a year and a half after unanimous approval.
The unanimous approval of the changes to the electoral law was mentioned yesterday by Caeal in a statement published by the Social Communication Office after the press conference: “The law proposal was voted and approved in the specialty in the Legislative Assembly unanimously from the present deputies. CAEAL fully trusts in the determination of the State Security Defense Commission which was performed under the law and has a high level of specialization.
The body is chaired by the Chief Executive and constituted by the Secretaries for Administration and Justice and Security, the Commander General of Unit Police Services, the Directors of Justice and Judicial Police Services, as well as the heads of the Chief Executive and Secretary for Security.
In addition, the Central Government created, with the commission, a place of advisor to national security issues, to whom it is up to supervision, guidance, coordination and support for masters in the development of state security defense work, and three other technical advisors.

The magistrate who chairs Caeal also stressed that the binding opinions of the State Security Defense Commission, of which it is not possible to appeal, "have a clear and sufficient legal foundation" and have been elaborated "taking into account the facts", which cannot reveal.
Seng Ioi Man stated that its disclosure "may represent certain risks to national security and should not even be published its content."

Throughout his career as a deputy, Ella Lei was an arguer of the reduction of TNR in the mashed work market. The workers' legislator has launched a series of suggestions to the working group for the coordination of employment promotion, created by the government of Sam Hou Fai, starting with an analysis of the aspirations and plans of the unemployed in the return to the active. Ella Lei understands that knowing the intentions of candidates, especially newly educated and unemployed medium and long term, can help create specific support measures.
Speaking to Jornal do Citizen, the deputy cited data from inquiries that revealed that residents more often seek retail work and selling work and argued that the government should analyze the requirements of positions that do not require special qualifications and that are occupied by TNR. The idea is to replace this workforce with local professionals, including newcomers and young people.
The deputy recalled that the government estimates the replacement of 200 TNR in the financial sector, something that does not consider sufficient, since the management of the number of TNR should articulate with the search for employment by residents.
Two realities
In the trade sector, the more than 21,000 TNR who work in retail sales are another target of the deputy, who understands that, especially, in stores of large chains opened in the resorts integrated to replace TNR should be a priority, as well as professional training of residents.
Another aspect to improve is progression in the professional career. The deputy wants the proportion of 85 percent of heads occupied by residents of residents in the game companies to be extended to other sectors, but it was no use how this goal could be achieved.
Despite the scenario outlined, not only by Ella Law, data from the Statistics and Census Services Directorate show that the number of TNR has remained stable in the last decade and that this year's resident unemployment rate is among the lower three of the last 10 years.</description><pubDate>2025-07-15 13:30:24</pubDate></item><item><title>Aviation | Deputy wants subsidy for flights between Macau and Lisbon</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/15/aviacao-deputado-quer-subsidio-para-voos-entre-macau-e-lisboa/</link><description>Deputy IP Sio Kai defends the need for the government to subsidize the initial exploitation of a direct flight between Macau and Lisbon. The position was taken yesterday at the Legislative Assembly, with the deputy warning that the lack of direct links to Europe compromises the role of MSAR as a platform between China and Portuguese -speaking countries.
In the intervention before the agenda, IP pointed to official October data last year, indicating that “Macao International Airport had 40 regular direct routes to the interior of China and other regions of Asia”. However, he pointed out the absence of "direct medium and long course flights to Europe and Portuguese -speaking countries."
The legislator considered that this failure "to some extent compromises Macao's connection role in the international network", and "the contribution and influence of Macao, as a platform between these countries."
At the same time, IP stated that the direct connection between Macau and Portugal can function as a center with the other countries of the platform: “I think the opening of direct flights between Macau and Lisbon is the basis of a platform, which serves to connect, through the Portuguese airline, Brazil and Portuguese -speaking countries in Africa, which will further promote trade, tourism and the flow of people between Macau and European countries,” he said.
In addition, for IP the lack of connections makes travel more inconvenient: “Due to the lack of direct flights to Lisbon, Macao residents and visitors have to travel through Hong Kong, Dubai, Istanbul, Shanghai, etc., which represents a long trip, having to change the airport or wait for connection flights, which makes the air traffic considerably inconvenient and not favored promotion and promotion. The normalization of Sino-Portuguese commercial and business activities, nor the attraction of more international tourists to Macao, ”he said.
Cord
Despite the suggestion, IP Sio Kai acknowledged that "this type of long -range routes have high operating costs and challenges such as the long period of clientele development." As the main costs pointed out the price of fuel, the salaries of flight and maintenance staff, the maintenance of the plane, the expenses of dropping and landing at the airport or the rates of use of the route.
Given that the costs and initial difficulty of profitability tend to remove interested parties from the exploitation of direct connections, the deputy considers that the executive can assume part of the costs. "The government must study the creation of a specific subsidy to support the high costs of the initial exploitation of airline routes, for example, the expenses of traffic rights, airport rates, as well as the costs of personnel and fuel, assigning phased financial subsidies," he suggested. These subsidies can be attributed through a fixed amount according to the number of flights or, more flexible, through the gradual and phase reduction of an initially assigned amount of years of exploration of routes, in order to help airlines reduce initial risks and promote the entry into operation of these routes, ”he added.
IP also asked to negotiate with Portugal's authorities to try to reduce part of the costs of flying to Europe, in aspects such as the tariffs charged at the airport.</description><pubDate>2025-07-15 13:25:37</pubDate></item><item><title>The American Pope</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/17/o-papa-americano/</link><description>“The Bishop is not supposed to be a little Prince sitting in His Kingdom, but rather called authentilly to be humble, to be close to the people he serves.”
Pope Leo XIV

Leo XIV embodies the double crisis of America and the Catholic Church. Contemporary version of the ancient tension between the empire and the papacy. Subjects incomparable by nature that, by constitution, exclude each other. Born to redeem the world according to its principles. With the weapon of power in all its dimensions expressed today on Earth, the other time before in other planets, America. With the intention of converting humanity to the presence of the kingdom of God incarnate into Christ, the church of Rome, mediator between heaven and earth. Impossible but indispensable missions. The identity itself is at stake. Life. Each, in its plan, lives and suffers from the original chrism of the West, to which both refer differently; the universalism. Part that dreams all over.
Dream that turns into a nightmare for the United States, which fear dying globalized for daring Americanizing the world. On the contrary, the church that, with Francis, outlined the exit to the peripheries find out that sheep is not much attracted to the pastor, often escape from him. Especially in its nucleus of origin, European and western. What if the church disappeared from itself? It is up to the new Pope, we will see whether more hybrid or American, to establish in Synodal Council the trajectory of God's people. It is up to your homeland to discern if and how to take advantage of your treadmill to heal. The current climate informs us that Washington and Rome will not follow parallel, much less solidary paths to heal the disease that seems to assimilate them. The temporal institution endowed with a civil religion, the American way of life, opts with Trump for a geopolitical diet of weight loss of nothing of great and compromising adventures in the vast world, fortification of the American stronghold in Arctic expansion.
Faithful to western tradition disfigured by enlightenment, positivists and communists. The other, of heavenly inspiration and varied inculturation in the mission territories marked by dioceses, late-royal inheritance, has no bark in which he retract without disfiguring. The opening to the ecumine is your raison d'être. To be modulated according to an always updated ecclesiastical geopolitics. Never submitting to the “number one” of the moment. If Trump, enthusiastic about the Vatican's American socket with the advent of Leo XIV, has a post-franciscan Catholicism willing to offer a soul supplement to his rude and unpredictable magisterium, he is wrong. How to delude the Holy Church's High Clergy when he trusts he had awarded a winning ticket when choosing an American successor to Peter. The papal Foundation offer and other promised sponsors across the Atlantic "have conditions", have rigorous restrictions, as they inform "donors" in balance between God and Castor.
Of course, before they ended in the Sistine Chapel, the cardinals spent a lot of time discerning the financial consequences of the inspiration that the Holy Spirit would have granted them, which, paraphrasing ecclesiastical jargon, is a revelation. Vacant headquarters is not time for theological, but cardinal virtues. As he observed in 1997, with Curial irony, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger whom he asked him if the Pope was elected by divine scrutiny said. I would say that the Holy Spirit does not assume exactly the control of the question, but as a good educator who is, leaves us a lot of space and freedom, without completely abandoning us. Thus, the role of the Holy Spirit must be understood in a much more elastic sense, not that the candidate should vote for. Probably the only certainty it offers is that the fact cannot be fully ruined. There are many examples of popes that, of course, the Holy Spirit would not have chosen. We do not know if chance, necessity or providence imposed Robert Francis Prevost on Pedro's throne precisely in the crossroads between the two (their) crises.
It is certainly a sign of the times. Commonly represented in the artificial selfie released by the White House, with which, on the eve of the conclave, the pseudo-rump disguised as Pope invaded the media sphere. Almost as to sanctify communion between the fourth and first Rome, in hierarchical order. It was only missing that the Cesarean pontiff was divided into two to give the actual anointing. Irony of the tale, for in photomontage, Pope Trump dresses totally in white, like Francis. Perhaps also for this reason, by sporting Urbi et Orbi, Leone enriched the white cassock with the classic symbols of the pontificate. But a grain of real exposes this blasphemous image. There is a lot of ecclesiastical in the self -awareness of America. Similarly, there is a lot of imperial in the history of the church.
The United States is born and grows up as a self -centered religion in peculiar Christian declines. Regardless of the sect or confession to which they belong, Americans live starring and striped versions. Catholics included. American Catholicisms, quite worldly, more conscious and conflicting than ever, occupy distinct spaces in the heron of the pastor of Rome. With and against predominant, established or neo-evangelical Protestant branches, profess the American creed. Religion celebrated in its golden age by the self-adhesive nation's apex of humanity. Lighthouse of freedom, therefore, universal. Autochphal and at the same time Catholic in the etymological and therefore ecumenical sense of the word. As a consequence of so many formidable contradictions, the identity crisis of worldly superpower is both its own and worldwide.
The Holy See, the great repository of culture and faith, a geopolitical expression of the Church of Rome and its supreme government of government in the state of the Vatican City, in the middle of urb, born, lives and confronts the imperium sine fine in all its ramifications. The Roman tombs of Peter and Paul, the first drivers of evangelization, confirm the principal potentium, the consistent authority of the world caput in relation to the venerable original patriarchals of Antioch, Alexandria, Ephesus, Corinthian and Thessalonica. The religion of the apostles germinates under Tiberius in Palestine, expands in pars Occidentalis of the first Rome, delimited by the unstable bipartition stipulated in Brindisi between António and Otávio forty years before Christ, sanction of permanent heterogeneity between the East and West. Then Baptizes with Constantine the second Rome, ideal-type of the fully Christian foundation metropolis. There is a millennium that disputes with the orthodoxy of the third Rome, the heart of the Moscovite Empire that is shown Christian, in the utopia of being recognized as the third lung of the West, with Europe and America.
And eighty years ago she has lived with the earthly primacy of fourth Rome, elected by pure Anglo-Involvesse pilgrim parents and erected by former British colonists in love with Hellenistic-Roman tradition, in order to correspond in code through Latin pseudonyms. Ecclesia permixa described by St. Augustine, a reference of Pope Prevost's election, where wheat and chaff, fertility and sterility, love and envy are mixed. The liquid schisms that erode it tend to coagulate. The priority of the pontificate is the sewing of the ruptures that tear the body of the church. Without denying Francis, closing some of the breaches he opened by him, distinguishing those that deserve to be filled from the dangerous or poor, disposable. Waiting for the posthumous to reread their papacy, capturing some prophetic traits too inconsistent with reality, not only ecclesial, so that it can act.
Today the warning of Benedict, the master of Augustinianism, is about the need to protect the extra mission from excessive optimism over faith as an "obvious presupposition of ordinary life" by stating that "we cannot accept that salt becomes disqualified and that light be kept hidden." Even if this means that the Church wants to isolate it for free in the dull world? The Catholic clergy is divided into three. Those who privilege mission, those who privilege the institution and those who sail between the two currents. The touch stone remains the Second Vatican Council. For the former, missionary opening must be developed to the people of God, that is, the Church itself, along with the ecumenical impulse. For the latter, the defense of tradition against submission to the signs of times prevails, which can induce heresy. To go out ad people, therefore, to contaminate to evangelize, or to curb in the name of the "pure" faith?
In history, Pope's charisma leans Peter's boat to one side or the other. Today much more than yesterday, with the Superstar Pontiff, while his people seem to contract, in crisis of internal charity and external attraction. In the vulgate, Francisco is considered an irregular champion of the Church on the way out, for history, doctrine and character. Pastor par excellence. Or excessive for critics. Benedict XVI, his predecessor traumatized by the weight of the petrine, is the eponym of the defender fidei. Insightful theologian. HERR RARE TEACHER OF THE SEMINAR. Claustrophobic. Questionable but powerful simplifications. Leo XIV neither. At least in the intentions of many of its voters. They convert to him from the opposite margins, aware of the latent or active cisions that are fragmenting the ecclesiastical archipelago on self-centered islands and islets. Different Catholics. Certainly not Romans. The biography and some words of the American Pope extol his pastoral vocation, the proximity to the humble. Pontifical gestures and other words mark the recovery of traditional symbols and liturgies. With a political metaphor that would once have placed us in the index of forbidden books, we could see in Prevost a reborn Christian Democrat, anchored in the center, look to the left while being careful not to have many enemies on the right. Or vice versa. «Pedro, Adelante Con Júicio» Expression of the soap opera “The Grooms” used to ask someone to proceed with precaution and discernment in a difficult or complicated situation.
Leo XIV must govern the Church on a mission. Fix the course, keep the rudder right, revitalize the Curia and reconnect it to the often indifferent ecclesial peripheries, if not adverse, to Peter's chair. To keep the world on the edge of the abyss of endless wars. The principles of the Church trusted this quiet monarch and determined the task of healing the wounds that bleed the flock of Christ. So that the end of Catholicism does not anticipate the end of the world. Maybe it's late, maybe not. It is certainly a task that Leo XIV may start, but not consolidate. The disease has long been widespread to give miraculous therapies. It has passed almost half a century since the disappearance of the last (not only) (not only) pontiff to the government of the church that was Paul VI (1963-1978). The four successors did not want or could not dedicate themselves to Peter's machine. John Paul I (1978) for lack of time and firmness, John Paul II (1978-2005) for excess of personality, Bento XVI (2005-2013, died in 2022) for moving inability, Francisco (2013-2025) because he wanted to "make noise" («Hagan Lio!") To save his flock from death by clerical suffocation.
Conservative and/or revolutionary popes, inadequate and/or reluctant to reform in continuity. Catholic tissue decomposition and excitement of its ruling class are such that exclude a Vatican III. Unless it is aspired to a liberating implosion, to start over from autocephalic, national or subnational micropatriarchies of neo-orthodox. More easily from emotive spiritualist sects of neo-evangelical nature, faithful to castor. To understand Papa Prevost's challenge, you should go from here. The meaning of the church is at stake. Both spiritual and ground. There has never been or there may be a separated Christianity from the reality of the world. The Holy Roman Church was and continues to be, although wounded, a formidable geopolitical subject who designed universal history.
Two thousand years ago, Catholics and other Christians have envisioned in it various signs and colors. They remove different lessons from it. Doctrinal, pastoral and geopolitical. For many, confirmation of faith in Christ. For less, but influential, announcement of the imminent apocalypse. To scholars of geopolitics, there is an obligation to study the vision and action of the Holy See in the scenario of history, crossing the human factor in its own and figurative sense and religious specificity. We chose as a magna card of the Christian way of being in the world the mysterious “letter to diogneto”, anonymous Greek manuscript of the third century-III found in 1436 in Constantinople by a Latin cleric.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Macau Boys: The Microhistory of Poetry in English between us</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/16/macau-boys-a-micro-historia-da-poesia-em-lingua-inglesa-entre-nos/</link><description>A few years ago, researcher Rogério Puga drew attention to something few of us knew: a small lineage of poets writing in English about Macau. The story begins early in Hong Kong, when this colony founded and the English who walked there were. Already in the 1840s, Sir John Francis Davis, one of the first governors of Hong Kong, walked through Macau to Valeriscar Camões, and composed a Latin Sonnet, which was published in Canton Repository, Canton Breton newspaper, and then inscribed in the cave itself. Decades later, W.H. Auden passed here and was fascinated with this Catholic weed. On the one hand, the Hong Kong Frente Business; On the other, this sleepy macao where saints baroque held the chin of players and opioles. Its contemporary, a fat British military resident at the Boa Vista Hotel, G.H. Jollie (1921-1950), poorly published “The Edge of the World: Translations from the Chinese and Some AddiTeal Poms” (1949), over the territory.
In 2006, the Association of Stories in Macao (ASM) was born, a small organization that proposed to promote writing about Macau. The name behind the transformation was that of Kit Kelen, an Australian who decided to make Macau his literary home. For thirteen years, this poet and professor at the University of Macao conducted the Shiptra do Trato.
The three anthologies that ASM published between 2008 and 2009 are proof of this. The first, I Roll The Dice, Contemporary Macau Poetry, gathered by K. Kelen and Agnes Vong, gathered more than 100 contemporary English -speaking poets from Macao, original and translated, which shows how the English language literature is a hidden vertex of a triangulation that only has the Chinese and Portuguese as beginning (S). And who says English, does not only say English and Australians. See the beautiful “Pan Chai: Filipino Boy in Macau”, by Pope Osmubal, of the most interesting poetry that has been published in Macao, precisely by ASM Poetry, in 2011.
Macau is the land of poets, said Kelen elsewhere. Somehow the themes are repeated: chance, luck, the game. ASM did not stop here. He created partnerships, edited online magazines, published Chinese poets translated into English. Kelen became editor of Poetry Macao magazine and collaborated with local publications.
Macao is indeed the door, the passage, as it is inscribed in its caligraph so well known to us, and that every day we see, on the street. Fortunately not just to Expatian networks, pass neologism. Also for the Filipino Boys of this Macao.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Highly qualified investigator delivers food (II)</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/15/investigador-altamente-qualificado-entrega-comida-ii/</link><description>Last week we discussed the story of Ding Yuanzhao (丁遠昭), a highly qualified Chinese student. Ding Yuanzhao has a doctorate and worked as a researcher at a university. After his contract was not renewed, he began to deliver food. When his story spread on the internet, he became a close attention in mainland China. They were all concerned about the transformation that their life had undergone. The reason is simple. In Chinese culture, study is believed to grow character. In past times, it was the way to access high official positions. Therefore, the study is admired and appreciated by all. Even in the current Chinese society, parents do everything to make their children academic success and later a well -paid job. Ding's experience is incompatible with the traditional Chinese culture and naturally attracted everyone's attention.
Ding made a video where he tells his story and carried it on the internet, stating that students who have good grades and those who have bad grades will not have future professionals; This is certainly a pessimistic statement.  In society rich in information of our day, we must know that universities transmit knowledge to students to inherit them. Only when students inherit knowledge and produce innovation can society progress. And this is precisely what any society needs. Therefore, there will undoubtedly be a difference between the careers of the students who received university education and those who did not receive. It is impossible that “there is not much difference in future work.”
Secondly, from an economic point of view, a university researcher working as a food delivery demonstrates that society has not yet completely recovered after the pandemic. It is estimated that there are more people with stories similar to Ding. Only when the economy recovers completely can problems be solved gradually such as unemployment and the disparity between academic background and work done.
Perhaps Ding may consider asking the local work department to help you find a job suitable for your formation. Ding is a highly qualified person and human resources companies in the job market in general may not be able to find a compatible function. It will be beneficial for DING to seek help from government departments. In short, looking for work suitable for their formation of people to “take the biggest party from their talents”, is beneficial to society, employers and workers.
Third, with the advancement of society and the democratization of education, more and more people receive university education and we can find doctorates everywhere. The increase of people with this academic degree is not accompanied by the increase of jobs suitable for their training, and therefore a situation is created in which there will be “more sailors than tides”, that is, in which demand exceeds the offer. A typical example is the place of university professor. In the past, it was easy to find placement as a university professor, as long as if he had a doctorate, but this is no longer the case; It is the result of the proliferation of academic qualifications. Therefore, even if those who seek jobs have a high formation, they have to be psychologically prepared to face difficulties. If you cannot find the work you are looking for, you should accept a second option and continue to search instead of lowering your arms; That is, to do nothing. This is the correct attitude when we are confronted with adversity.
To get a advantage in searching for work, highly qualified people must continue to study and learn to have in many more skills. For the same salary, is it better to hire someone with multiple skills or only one? The answer is obvious. Only by constantly adding value to ourselves can we find the ideal work.
Fourth, although the values are correct, we will understand that the skills needed to deliver food are not high and the development of this career is limited. Instead of getting more skills and continuing to study, Ding filmed his experience and published it online to reach the public's knowledge. This will undoubtedly transform your negative experience into an opportunity. As he is graduated by several prestigious, national and international universities, if he wants to be a consultant to international university studies, his academic qualifications and his international experience will easily open his business opportunities.
Fifth, Ding made the decision to work to deliver food after losing his job, which shows that he has a positive and malleable attitude. When he came across unemployment, he changed his life instead of pouring his towel to the ground, but even more important is to have chosen a job in which society serves, he is sustained himself, strives and is rewarded. ” In short, it works hard, it is supported by itself and serves society. ”Also in Macau there are many university students who work as drivers of buses and taxi drivers. These positive values must be encouraged.
Ding's story reminds us that young people must understand that they need to receive higher education and what the purpose of university education should be. If there is an economic recession, young people must accept reality calmly, maintain a positive attitude, strive and ponder various exits. If we download our arms, that's all lost.</description><pubDate>2025-07-15 17:03:49</pubDate></item><item><title>Totourgencies</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/14/totourgencias/</link><description>Before, we had Totobola and Totoloto. Now we have Totourgencies. Nothing more, nothing less, than the hospitals of hospitals in the country. There is always more than an urgency closed. On weekends the pour is crazy, especially pregnant women. The scandal is installed when we were shocked that a pregnant woman lost her son because he walked from hospital to hospital to see which one had the urgency of open obstetrics.
At the very least, each weekend are six urgency closed and have been ten. There is no understanding for the Ministry of Health to spend millions of euros and does not solve a pressing problem and of vital importance in a country where birth has only lowered. Pregnant women should be the only citizens who should not have an urgency not even closed.
To the point that many pregnant women have delivery inside the ambulances, because Totourgencies is to walk hospital in a hospital to see which one falls in luck to appear with an open obstetric urgency. The increase is remarkable due to the closure of obstetric emergency services and pediatrics in various hospitals.
In some cases, pregnant women are transported to more distant hospitals due to these unavailability, and delivery occurs during transportation. In the last year, about half a hundred babies were born in ambulances. And because we talk about ambulances, we are facing another serious problem because a large number of ambulances are in a high risk of accident risk. There are ambulances without review and maintenance, with tires requesting replacement and with drivers protesting with INEM responsible that it is no longer possible to conduct ambulances in such a poor condition. Once again, guardianship makes merchant ears and government propaganda only knows how to announce that it is spending a lot more money on health.
What? In dermatologists who earn a day 50 thousand euros? In managers who are dismissed on suspicion of corruption in the acquisition of hospital material? In miserable salaries to good surgeons who eventually move to the private?… The millions disappear and help to citizens is becoming worse and worse. Inquiries are continuing on the deaths of people without relief during an INEM strike. When in our opinion, Inem, doctors and nurses could never strike. A few days ago, in Bragança, a 69 -year -old woman died of alleged fault in the help of INEM after suffering a stroke.
The patient took more than two hours to enter the hospital, because there were no ambulances available in Customs of Faith, in the district of Bragança, and the patient dying. Still last Thursday, a pregnant woman waited 40 minutes for help from INEM, when the pregnant woman was taken to the hospital the baby was born in the ambulance, but would die. The cases succeed and the Minister of Health is not fired and was reappointed in the new government by Luís Montenegro. This, when the last scandalous case of lack of help has to do with the lack of helicopters in the service of INEM. A public tender announced last year has not yet led to the purchase of any aircraft. Currently, it is only a heli of operational INEM in the country, something unbelievable.
And what did the minister do? He agreed with his defense colleague that there was an agreement with the Air Force so that military helicopters could transport the sick. In principle it could be a provisional solution. But the incompetence and the lack of knowledge of reality reigns. A military helicopter raised a flight, rescued a sick and headed for the nearest hospital, arrived there did not land because the heliport was small, built to the small helicopters that INEM had. The military heli went to another hospital and the scene repeated until it landed in a place near a hospital and an ambulance transported the patient. Imagine how long it has been lost with all this maneuver and can no longer count on the Air Force Helis. And this is not shameful? Isn't it reason for the minister's resignation?
To get an idea of Totourgencies last weekend, seven urgencies were closed on Saturday and eight on Sunday, being one of pediatrics and the remaining gynecology and obstetrics, indicated the Portal of the National Health Service (NHS). The urgencies of obstetrics and gynecology of the hospitals of Barreiro, Setúbal, Vila Franca de Xira, Santarém, Aveiro and Leiria were closed on Saturday and Sunday, while those of Hospital de Abrantes closed on Sunday. In the hospitals of Amadora-Sintra, Loures, São Francisco Xavier-Lisboa and Braga ended the emergencies of the specialties referred to at night to the weekend.
With this national scene, government concern remains the sale of TAP, Alcochete Airport and TGV to Spain. There is no ass already to take it…

S. - The weekly "Expresso" published headline in its last Saturday edition, precisely what today Macao announced here two weeks ago, which military personnel gave instruction to a NeoNazi group with the end of very violent and terrorist actions in the country.</description><pubDate>2025-07-14 02:18:13</pubDate></item><item><title>Encounter | Dinner brought together more than 100 former military man recruited in Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/17/encontro-jantar-reuniu-mais-de-100-ex-militares-recrutados-em-macau/</link><description>More than 100 military personnel recruited in Macao by Portugal were gathered at a fishermen's dock dinner to remember the "joyful" times on the troop
About 100 former military recruited in Macao between 1936 and 1975 were gathered on Tuesday night at a fraternization dinner that took place at the fishermen's dock. The second event in the five -year space aimed to bring together colleagues, miss other times, featured speeches for video conferencing and until a moment to sing the Portugal Anthem.
One of those present at the event was 86-year-old Mario Lemos, and being the oldest recruit at the ceremony of 1959, he was entitled to sit at the table of the organizing committee, led by Francisco Marnhão.
From the troop, Lemos recalls other times, more agitated: "The troop was a youth adventure, where I spent a year and a half. The recruit was six months and then passed to take office at the headquarters' office," he recalled. "I did practically everything because I had completed the second cycle, I did a lot of different things. I also translated because people from Portugal came and did not dominate the Chinese language. It often served with the guys of Portugal. At the time there were many people of Chinese ethnicity and many of them did not speak Portuguese," he said.
Cantonese's dominion also led to that Mário Lemos often had to deal with the population's complaints in the face of the behavior of some troops, although highlighting that they were not very frequent things. "Sometimes there were even problems out there, people came to complain and I served as a translator to solve the subjects. For me it was a very excited time," he said. "But there were not many complaints. They were youth things," he said. And among the complaints, it was not uncommon for the population to complain about the harassment of the military to some younger girls.
The former military man admitted to miss the troops and shows the military ballot proudly, where there is a praise received at the end of the time served in the army: "At the end of the troop I received a praise from the head of state of the military in Macau. It was not easy," he said. “I was very proud,” he confessed.
The busiest times as a military contrast with retirement. After more than 30 years in the civil service, Lemos lived in Canada for 12 years before returning to Macao. Now life is calmer. "I am a person who always stays very at home, I do not have much social life," he acknowledged. Still admitted to like the environment of this type of dinners.
 
Rigorous
José Madeira, at the age of 73, was recruited in 1974 in Macao, where he was born and lives. It is currently renovated after a civil service career, and took advantage of the conviviality to review some friends and put the conversation up to date.
“It was a good occasion to be with friends. I know people almost all, because most are macanese, Macau is a small land and we know almost everyone. It's easy,” said Madeira, dressed in the alternative nightgown of the national football team. "For me it is not a matter of not seeing people, I regularly see these friends, because we have groups and we find ourselves regulate," he explained.
However, the former recruit dinner is nonetheless different, recognizes Macaense, because it ends up making the conversations turn more around the troops. “At this dinner we remembered our times of youth and troops,” he said.
During the period in the army, José Madeira performed the functions of nurse. "I didn't have much work, I usually dealt with routine daily consultations," he recalled. The most common cases implied allergies, especially among the military coming from Portugal. "The metropolitan military did not usually adapt to moisture and most of them suffered from skin allergies," he recalled.
About the troop experience, Macaense recalls “a period of conviviality”, “friendship”, “solidarity” and “teamwork”. The recruit was the most complicated period, because in a macao when winter was more rigorous, it was necessary to get into the sea on the beaches, without the possibility of the military if they bathe or dry, so as to learn to deal with the adversities of combat.
 
Mandatory paths
Recruited in 1970, 75 -year -old Mário Sin recruits from recruiting the impact caused by winter cold. "The weather was a little different, when it arrived in January it was very cold. Now not, the weather is always warmer," he recalled. "So the Malta suffered when it entered the recruit, because we were in winter," he shot.
However, even if there was no desire, Sin pointed out that the recruit was mandatory, and without compliance with military service, professional opportunities were very limited: “At the time we had no alternative, we had to fulfill military service. Without the fulfillment of military service, it was not possible to work for the civil service, and we were not accepted in other work,” he said.
However, Sin admits that the times as military were very happy: “Malta enjoyed a little with that, every day were very happy. But there were very pulled exercises, the exercises were always pulled. But as the malta came from school had good energy to deal with it. "If it were now, there was no strength," he added to laugh.
For Mário Sin dinner was another opportunity to live with several colleagues, with whom he admitted himself regularly.</description><pubDate>2025-07-17 18:12:48</pubDate></item><item><title>“Goodbye, My Concubine” ends season of the Chinese Orchestra</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/16/adeus-minha-concubina-encerra-temporada-da-orquestra-chinesa/</link><description>The concert that will end the season of the Macau Chinese Orchestra is scheduled for Saturday on July 26, at 8 pm, at the Great Auditorium at the Macao Cultural Center.

At a time when the portable fans have become an omnipresent object, Chao Iok Leng's artistic expression is a refreshing approach to the tradition of Chinese folding fan paintings with an undeniably skilled technique using China ink.
The collection of painted fans represents a “rare intersection of function and beauty, in which the cooling function is accentuated by the artistic impression in its delicate role”, says the organization of the show. “This exhibition seeks to replenish our daily lives with an exotic object rooted in ancient Chinese culture and the assessment of the sublime,” is added by the organization of the exhibition.
In this show, Chao Iok Leng adorned the fan of the fans with images inspired by floral motives (with hosts, glycies, peonies, magnolia, plums and lotus), fruits (pomegranate and lichia) and vegetables (kale, pepper, lenshades). Also appearing of animals, with insects and some birds, highlights the curator of the João Ó show.
Each painting is accompanied by an inscription or a small poem that adds an additional context, revealing the artist's emotional view during creation.
In the statement of the organization that presents the exhibition, the artist is mentioned explaining that "these are not genres of" dead natures ", but portray living elements that we see in our daily lives, but rarely enjoyed."

The actress's wide acceptance between the interior audiences was demonstrated in May 2012, during a greater tension between China and Japan due to the arrival of Hong Kong activities on the Diaoyu/Senkuku Islands. With the high tension between the two countries, and the inflamed internet with nationalist speeches, Chinese netizens have made the phrase famous: "The Diaoyu islands belong to China, but Sora Aoi belongs to the world."
The actress's great popularity was also demonstrated by the fact that in 2014 he had more than 15 million followers of the Weibo social network, although this type of films are banned.

Between January and June, the number of suspicious financial transactions reported by casinos had a 15.0 percent break compared to the same period. The number was released by the Financial Information Office (GIF) of the Unit Police Services on Tuesday.
The most updated figures show that in the first half of this year game operators reported 1,856 suspicious transactions. In the same period last year the number of suspicious financial transactions had been 2,181.
The reduction by operators of the number of suspicious financial transactions communicated is pointed out as responsible for the general trend, in which there was a 12.6 percent reduction in the number of suspicious financial transactions reported in the territory.
The total number of suspicious financial transactions received by the Financial Information Office of Unit Police Services during the first half of 2025 was 2.515, which means a 12.6 percent decrease over the same period as 2024, ”the information was mainly read.
At the same time, the proportion of suspicious financial transactions reported by the operators descended from 75.8 percent of total transactions to 73.8 percent. "The suspicious financial transactions received from the financial sector and the game sector were 19.9 percent and 73.8 percent of the total number of suspicious financial transactions received, while those received from other institutions constituted 6.3 percent," was revealed.
 
Opposite Trends
Regarding financial institutions and insurance companies, there was also a reduction in suspicious communicated transactions, from 556 in the first half of 2024 to 500. This decrease represented a 10.1 percent difference.
The only area where the number of suspicious transactions has increased by the “other institutions”, which do not appear discriminated against on Tuesday's data by the financial information cabinet, but involving businesses such as pledge, jewelery, real estate or auction houses. In this area, within one year there were another 17 transactions, from 142 in the first half from 2025 to 159 for the latest period. The difference of 17 communicated transactions implies an increase of almost 12 percent.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>STD | Promised speed in low -cost hotels licensing</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/17/dst-prometida-celeridade-no-licenciamento-de-hoteis-de-baixo-custo/</link><description>The director of tourism services ensures that authorities continue to accelerate the licensing process of “youth inns” and “capsule hotels”. The goal is to increase and diversify the range of choices of various types of accommodation for investors and consumers
 
The government wants to widen the variety of Macao's hotel offer, a goal that has been maintained since the legislation has been changed to promote low cost accommodation for four years.
The position was underlined by the Director of Tourism Services (STD), Helena de Senna Fernandes, in response to a interpellation of Deputy Leong Hong Sai. In addition to listing the approval of administrative legislation and regulations on the subject, the official stated that STD continues to “optimize licensing procedures” to “further accelerate the work of appreciation and permission of licenses”.
The STD director gives an example of “creating a data interconnection mechanism with other public services to obtain information in the licensing process”, as well as “integrating more application services” on an electronic platform to treat the necessary bureaucracy.
The idea of the government is to facilitate the “installation of accommodation establishments commonly designated by youth inns and capsule hotels, to create more conditions and favorable spaces for the sector, help the diversification of tourist accommodation and increase the range of choices in the types of accommodation for investors and consumers”.
 
Quality and experience
Helena de Senna Fernandes also indicated that in all phases of the low -cost hotel licensing process, STD maintains “good communication with the applicant and the technical services” responsible for the surveys and technical opinions. The objective is to rigorously inform applicants who want to open low -cost hotel units, also through working meetings with the services involved, and “raise the efficiency of the licensing procedure”.
In addition, the official stresses the clarity with which the requirements and criteria relative “to the facilities and services of low -cost accommodation establishments to ensure that visitors can obtain good services and accommodation experiences” have been defined.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>New loans for real estate activities sink 80.2%</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/16/novos-emprestimos-para-actividades-imobiliarias-afundam-802/</link><description>In May, the new commercial loans for real estate activities sank 80.2 percent to 573.6 million patacas, compared to May 2024.

A renovated Ukrainian, with the same name of the president, guilty Zelensky about the extension of the conflict that destroyed his village. Zelensky, the village, who has never left his land, now lives mortified because his favorite gravedigger died in the bomber.
This Zelensky, the village, represents half the world that reproves the other Zelensky, the villain, for not wanting to negotiate with Putin.
Negotiate what? The invader enters us through the house, pies us the wife and daughter (cf. recent UN report on Ukraine violations in this “special operation”), an act that forced us to watch, and then we say: Alto there, we are for peace, but we have to negotiate: You have not said the name you want to give to children!
A peace that is not worthy is but a cessation of rights. As severe as Russophobia that Putin inflicts his people.

In a lunch with several guests I hear a friend, who declares himself a spiritist, explaining about the particularities of his belief, in a serene and balanced way, would even say, without "irrationalism". He discussed long and serenely, devoid of any fanatical proselytizing. “Here is someone to whom belief brought weighting!” I thought, a rare alliance.
However, at one point a phrase that horrify me. He says, “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!” And I enter the voracious fauces of holism. Because holismo has a pathological aspect like all good things, a side of shadow.
Two examples: In Hinduism there is less sensitivity to existential dramas, if that child suffers in this life this is only an expression of the strict karmic symmetry, an effect of the acts she committed in her previous life. In Africa it is not accepted that death may have been accidental, and many women are accused by the dead family of having caused her husband's death, in an act of manifest dementia, and, in the blatant majority of cases, in a huge injustice to his wife - madness that spreads and infiltrates the social fabric.
Buddhism has introduced compassion and Christianity to Caritas, trying to break with this logic, but in many other beliefs and religions the cage of causalities prevails over sensitivity to experience, the need to respond to the now.
It is a tremendous logic that transforms the world into a platonic stage, where we are just the shadows of something -an inextricable law -in a determinism that calcines all singularities, but strangely fascinates many.
The conquest of modernity has anchored in the conquest of chance and random, subtracting the incidences of a life to this fierce determinism that closed the world in a web. When the Renaissance freed the body from the influence of the stars, at this moment sexuality was relieved of guilt and individualism and their volition could emerge.
There is an unequivocal moral implication in the phrase “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!”, Which should work as a key to self-knowledge and self-judgment, but usually this phrase is managed to seek a reason for things abroad from us in the other. It is an alibi.
There is a holistic temptation in the world today, as in the Middle Ages there was a satanic temptation, without great reflection on its consequences. Because it is not enough we want to connect everything in a resonant chain of affection. Even the most unexpected: affection itself can kill.
I realize, thanks to this cultured, balanced, intelligent woman, that “the combat” moved at the beginning of this century. One of the great misconceptions of the twentieth century was the false dichotomy between "rationalism and irrationalism", a debate that extended to all fields, including art. First, rationality was confused (the positive side of reason) with rationalism (the pathological feature of reason), and articulated in this lack of discernment was confused irrationalism with freedom. Almost all the art of the twentieth century, with surrealism to the head, worked in this error. The fallacy still exists despite having consolidated the emergence of 'irrationalism' and the consequent relativist currents that followed it. Essentially much of what happened in the twentieth century, it turned around this shock between two paradigms: rationalism versus irrationalism.
Now, I see, the indetermination, chance, the random of the terrible temptation of the causal cage. Holism, in its pathological feature, can be the reductionism that is the way it puts the way as a new 'eschatological narrative'.
Is it "by chance" that the holism emerges at the moment when neo-liberalism and its cynical contempt for the human person besides all freedoms, all acquired rights?
Holistic consciousness has brought positively a greater ecological awareness but followed by scholastic rigor drifting reality under the blanket of a determinism that is much more than inconvenience: all great authoritarian ideologies are holistic.
My friend will know how to combine her holistic and transpersonal belief with the freedom and responsibility that every moment asks us - but how many will make the destruction, under a law that explains and encompasses?
How many will not be abandoned to what it is?
The awareness of the indeterminate brings tragic conscience, as the Greeks knew, but also brings the will and the courage of the decision. And of this we cannot abdicate.
In addition, as Drummond shows in Carlos Drummond de Andrade's poem “Quadrilha”:
"John loved Teresa who loved Raimundo/ who loved Maria who loved Joaquim who loved Lili/ who did not love anyone./ John went to the United States, Teresa to the convent,/ Raimundo died of disaster, Maria stayed to aunt,/ Joaquim suicide himself and Lili married J. Pinto Fernandes/ who had not entered the story."
Real always runs outside the track, in full exteriority to our concepts. This is what is worth a J. Pinto Fernandes at the exact moment we thought we had everything under control.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Nobel and others</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/17/do-nobel-e-outros/</link><description>9/10/22
Reading many people's reactions when the Nobel Prize in this year's literature was announced, I couldn't help but remind me of this repair of Jean-Pierre Siméon, in relation to another Nobel Prize: “An editor of a large national newspaper wrote five lines of indignation because the Nobel Prize for Literature, a complete stranger. But unknown to whom? How did not occur to this patented and paid literary columnist to do his work, that his apparent ignorance was a matter of incorrect professional conduct? Tranströmer was translated into many languages, it was available in French. »
There is always the choir of those who wait for the announcement of the prize to complain about not being invited to the jury of the prize, there is a subgroup of Irados that professes “never read and I will not bother to read”; It is an uncommon fauna, which inhabits social networks.
I don't always know all the winners-I was unaware of the existence of Louise Glück, who I find a great poet, or the Olga Tokarczuk, for example-but it only brings me the comfort of knowing that the world is not a soap opera where everyone knows each other and the joy of recognizing that the gauge of the world is not measured with my short measure and that on the contrary it gives me a new opportunity to face the unknown.
And perhaps the most cretin of reactions was the smart one who wrote, but there are still those who read French? Confirming only that today there is a new kind of ignorance that fires with a displeasure: the one who only read English.
I would also prefer that, in French, Pascal Quignard, Linda reads, or even Sollers, or, among the new ones, Mathias is awarded, but that does not take dignity to the work of Annie Ernaux (and it would be enough to have written the “Les Années”). There are books of her that I like less, like the vulgar "a simple passion," but this happens with almost every authors, they have a channel books and others that are like intervals in their itinerary. I advise reading a beautiful book of interviews with her, "L'Ecriture Comme un couteau".

Yesterday came an article in Maputo's morning “News”, realizing that the Pen Club narrative prize was assigned to my wife, Teresa Noronha, for her soap opera “Tornado”, which had already had the Maria Velho da Costa award.
The summary they made of the book does not even deserve comments, by pathetic, but what matters to highlight is the note of disqualification about their "Mozambicanity" by calling it Luso-Mozambican. It is not inaccurate, but for those who know the context, it is a dirty touch.
Because finally, following the same logic, Adelino Timóteo should be called Tsonga-Mozambican, to Álvaro Taruma-Mozambican, and Macua-Mozambican to the writers who are from the north, etc., etc. Which is not reported to happen.
At the beyond moment, in the soap opera, she writes:
«Our color has never been dominant. In colonial time we were not white, we were ripped from monories, gone mugs, the pejorative term to speak of a son of Goes and Portuguese. In the postcolonial period, I was not black and if, in Lisbon, they took me by Brazilian or Cape Verdean, already in France were lost in cogitations of where they would be and amazed when they found out it was African. There I had to explain my DNA's wanderings before relying on moorms. It took me a long time to accept that it was so because yes, and that it was no curse that were so; On the contrary, I could even discover intense patterns of fantasy and freedom in this shrewd cloak that is our genealogy… »
In the current Mozambique it is white… and this is overlapping it soon to what it does or what it is.
It is sad, but as Naipaul warned, through these stops the race is everything and is soaked in it as deeply as, elsewhere, in religion.

Bruno Latour, an anthropologist who studied the sciences and their procedures and legitimations, law, technique and religions died and entertained themselves to turn the guts to the dogmas of the “modern”. For him the place, the expert's function, was more defined by the perplexity he embodied than for the supposed truth he would support him.
He proposed, as an alternative to the kinds of multiculturalism and his mistaken password "all different all the same", the return to "diplomacy", given precisely, not from the presupposition that "we are unified because participants of the same nature" but simply reveal that we "do not yet share an ordinary world"; It is necessary to deal frontally with the "abyss of disagreement" that separates us, rather than wanting to delude it.
And about politics said, disassessedly:
«If transparency is required from the politician, we kill him; If one requires fidelity to what the other was or he says, kills him; If a mimetic relationship is required between what the crowd wants and what its representative says, the representation is killed. These must, therefore, by definition, betray, deceive, modify, distort the word. Without this ability to double the word and betray, political language would not exist. I put the perfectly plausible hypothesis that political vocabulary will become as inaccessible as the religious language of the last twenty, three or fifty years. (in “UN Monde Pluriel plus Commun”). I believe it will be missed to decipher this frantically complex world that fit us.</description><pubDate>2022-10-17 02:18:03</pubDate></item><item><title>The yo -yo</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/30/o-fuxi/</link><description>O my friends, companions of these funerals trips to countries as old as the stars and the moon, and as strange as the profound interior of our disgraceful souls, - that startle still awaits us, what secret spells we will have to overcome, what horrors will rise to our dilated pupils of amazement and terror?
Increasingly close to our precarious existences, howling the war monster, which threatens to merge humanity with the earth, incessantly traveled by the squalid spectrum of hunger and the invisible evil of ten thousand pests.
O human human, who cries superior to his own nature, but then reveals to you, once and again, unable to simply order your existence and do not understand that you are possessed by the fickle wrath and are slave to your own ambition! Do not be content with the white jade or the light gold, there is no treasure that gives you your inextinguishable thirst for other men, animals and things; for in you an eternal anguish in you; in you crawl the expelled snakes; For you grows, powerful and impossible, the very fertile ivy of evil!
This is perhaps why on the mound they call the white deer, where one of the eight immortals in sacred mount was evolved through the skies to Penglai, inhabits the fuxa, a bird whose form resembles that of the rooster, although topped by a human head. What strange copulas, what monstrous amplexes, what terrible procedures will have occurred to make the existence of this animal sinister possible? We do not know, but it is enough for our exhausted mind to dare to raise an answer, so we soon feel the skin traveled by horrendous goose bumps and the heart trigger in paraded, which wild horse beaten by the night whip of fear, oblivious to reins and containment.
May men refrain from going through the Mount of the deer, because although there are riches capable of calming the most misunderstanding ambitions, if they have the disgraced fortunate to glimpse a fuxa, it will be immediately triggered the cultivated fields, because it will be beheaded the soft animals, for it will be sacrificed the best young man and destroyed superb from countries.

«Every man morally is one and absolute; But you have to live with your personality to mitigate. (…) Coexistence is only possible among people reduced to a negative or hollow presence, which is constantly giving in. Hence, the emptiness of society, a huge ghost composed of numerous deceased. An upper man is antisocial or criminal. Its destination is jail and desert.
He is in thinking about whether she reflects here about the political-social conditioning that gagging, and worse, in a sad country as Portugal was in the middle of the Estado Novo (and the book is from 1931) where any possibilities of spontaneity and frankness in human relations were coarcet, or only lends the behavior of men (oppressed) a metaphysical frame, a “essence”, from a presumption of each one in the presumption of each one be in isolation “one and absolute”. Sometimes, to an excess of spirituality (or longing), it adds to Pascoaes to lack the world. He is a great poet, but he is a poet who takes gray-Jewish ampoules and is therefore written amiiude on a programmatic furor, ceasing to have pores; There is often a glass between him and the real, the same one who made him wring the Ballet, 1921: “Everything is ghost. There are only clouds, clouds of voices, clouds of souls, afflictions and tragedies! Clouds and more clouds, appearances and more appearances! It is a divine lightning that pierces them, the instant appearance that arises and throws us to the ground, dazzled! »
Sometimes I would like to remind him, as Antonio Sérgio did in the article “Regeneration and Tradition, Moral and Economy”, which dedicated to Easter: “Easter, Easter my dear friend: You are a pure, excellent and noble poet, but also a victim of this social environment, like us all: this horrible isolation that you praise and I”.
"As a child, he stole two melos," says Jacinto do Prado Coelho, stole him from a nest, and throb his lifetime remorse for it. The person, few more mischief is known to him. Only in Álvaro de Campos sprouts a twinge of evil and obscenity: “Oh, and ordinary and dirty people who always seem the same,/ who employs profanity as usual words,/ whose children steal at the grocery door/ and whose daughters at eight years-and I think this is beautiful and I love him! -/ masturbate decent -looking men on the stairs. » (Ode triumphal).
Both poets beaten by a certain idea of holiness, they were identical to the inability of breaking the siege of the skin with the overflow of the dike, the same curse of sublimating Eros's concrete ferocity with the mansuity of the verses.
Of course, they are the two "Bigger Than Life", but sometimes unnerves to watch, from my hostor's post at the Procrastinators Club, to the tantrums between them, just to see who occupies, in the internal organization, the place of president and treasurer.
Although a person has guessed more, for example, this he wrote in the least known martial ode and that is declining in the situation we live today, differently, with the heart in his hands:

“My 'turban tornado' no longer exists, rest in peace, my dear Fauja,” said Khushwant Singh.
The Athletics and Charity Institution, London -based Sikhs in the City, confirmed his death, adding that after the accident he was transported to the hospital where he died.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi paid tribute to Singh, noting that it was "extraordinary for his unique personality and the way he inspired India's young people on such an important theme: Fitness."
Fauja Singh never managed to present a birth certificate, but her family says she was born on April 1, 1911, when India was still part of the British Empire.

"China's judicial authorities treat cases with strict respect for the legislation, ensuring the legitimate rights and interests of the parties involved. In accordance with international conventions and the consular agreement between China and Japan, we facilitated the consular work of the Japanese party," the Ministry of Foreign Ministry Lin Jian said at a press conference.

"We welcome foreign companies that want to develop economic and commercial cooperation in China. As long as foreign citizens comply with the law and act under the legislation, there is no reason for concerns," he added.
Chinese authorities had not yet officially confirmed the conviction, reported yesterday by the Japan ambassador to Beijing, Kenji Kanasugi, after the trial.
"The Japanese citizen was sentenced to three and a half years in prison on suspicion of espionage. We consider this sentence extremely unfortunate," said the diplomat, quoted by the Japanese press.

During the head of the members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (OCX), held in the Chinese city of Tianjin, Wang appealed to “greater consensus” among OCX Member States in the face of “advancement of protection” and the intensification of “regional conflicts”, according to a statement issued by Chinese diplomacy.
Chinese minister warned of a “complex and severe” international security context, marked by the “constant emergence of new threats and challenges”.
Wang also condemned the recent Israeli attacks against Iran - a member country of OCX - which he classified as a “violation of sovereignty” Iranian.
In an appeal to the “good neighborhood” among members of the organization, Wang Yi recalled that OCX includes countries with tense relations such as India and Pakistan, which in May exchanged air attacks, causing dozens of dead.
"OCX should take advantage of the 80th anniversary of the United Nations Foundation as an opportunity to defend a multipolar, equitable and ordered world, as well as inclusive economic globalization," the minister added, underlining the need to build a "more fair and more rational global governance system."
China currently exercises OCX's rotary presidency, often nicknamed "Asian Nato." Wang announced that the organization's annual summit will take place between August 31 and September 1 this year.

Parallel to the meeting of foreign ministers, Chinese President Xi Jinping received OCX diplomatic officials in Beijing, appealing to a reinforcement of “response mechanisms” to “global security threats and challenges”.
"We must unite efforts and lead the global south to promote the creation of a fairer and more reasonable international governance system," said Xi, cited by the official press.
OCX is made up of China, Russia, India, Iran, Pakistan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Quirguizistan, Tajiquistan and Uzbekistan, representing the world's largest regional block in terms of population and geographical extension - about 40 percent of the world's population.
Although its members insist that it is not a military alliance, and that its objective is to protect member states against threats such as terrorism, extremism and separatism, analysts consider that OCX acts, in fact, as a strategic counterweight to NATO.</description><pubDate>2025-07-17 18:18:57</pubDate></item><item><title>Air India | Resumed part of the international routes</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/17/air-india-retomadas-parte-das-rotas-internacionais/</link><description>After the accident that made 260 deadly victims and left only one survivor, the Indian airline again wears cut routes to Europe, the United States and Pacific Asia
Air India airline announced the partial resuming of the international routes suspended after the AI171 flight accident, which left 260 dead in June, falling seconds after taking off from Ahmedabad's Indian city.
Air India has announced "the partial replacement of the reduced hours under its" security break ", adopted after the tragic AI171 accident on June 12, 2025," said the carrier in a statement released on Tuesday night.
The company foresees to restart part of the international calls from August 1, with the aim of completely restoring its network until October 1st.
The changes include the operation of three weekly flights between Ahmedabad and London-Heathrow airport, between August 1 and September 30, replacing the previous five connections to Gatwick-the route where the accident occurred.
During this break, the company made additional inspections to its Boeing 787 aircraft and adjusted operations compared to the closing of airspace over Pakistan and the Middle East.
 
Tragic trip
The accident involved a Boeing 787 Dreamliner to London, which lost power shortly after offspring in Ahmedabad and drew it, causing the death of 241 out of 242 people on board, plus 19 victims on land.
Following the disaster, Air India has reduced several international routes, including frequencies for Europe, the United States and Pacific Asia.
In an internal note addressed to employees on Monday, the company's executive president, Campbell Wilson, called on to caution and rejection of “premature conclusions”, ensuring that the initial investigation “confirms that there were no problems with fuel, maintenance or technical or mechanical failures”.
The message helped calm strategic markets and partners such as Boeing, whose actions went up after the preliminary report, which did not point to conception defects.
According to the Air Accident Investigation Authority (AAIB), all mandatory maintenance were up to date, although it was identified that Air India did not perform recommended inspections in 2018 by the US Aviation Agency (FAA) to the fuel cutting mechanism - a system that will have failed after takeoff.
The company's mother company, the Tata Conglomerate, is trying to contain reputational damage while the official investigation is due, whose final report is expected within one year.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>China/ Iran | Chinese MNE guarantees support to the country in a meeting with Iranian homologous</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/17/china-irao-mne-chines-garante-apoio-ao-pais-em-encontro-com-homologo-iraniano/</link><description>Chinese and Iranian diplomacy heads were on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization meeting. Beijing again expressed all his support to Tehran in defense of his dignity
China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi yesterday assured his Iranian counterpart, Araqchi Abás, that Beijing will continue to support Tehran in defense of his "national sovereignty and dignity."
The meeting took place yesterday in the Chinese town of Tianjin, on the sidelines of the meeting of Foreign Ministers of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (OCX), according to a statement issued by Chinese diplomacy.
"China and they will have diplomatic relations for over half a century, having resisted international vicissitudes with stable and healthy development," said Wang Yi, adding that, as an integral strategic partner, China "will continue to support Iran in defense of their rights and interests through dialogue."
Chinese diplomacy head has also expressed availability to “deepen mutual trust, reinforce cooperation, expand exchanges, and promote stable and long -term development” of bilateral relations.
Araqchí thanked Beijing's “valuable support”, stressing that “Iran's willingness to develop relations with China is even firmer”.

On the nuclear issue, Araqchí reiterated that Iran "does not develop nuclear weapons," but also "does not resign its legitimate right to peaceful use of nuclear energy."
"We are willing to resume negotiations and consultations with all parties as soon as possible, provided there is mutual respect, with a view to a political solution," he said.
 
Dialogue Via
Wang Yi reiterated that China "opposes the use of strength or threat of use of force" and argued that "differences must be resolved through dialogue and consultation."
"We give importance to Iran's commitment not to develop nuclear weapons and respect their right to peaceful use of nuclear energy. We appreciate Iranian efforts to achieve peace by diplomatic means," said Chinese minister, ensuring that Beijing will continue to "play a constructive role in solving nuclear issue and promoting stability in the Middle East."
The meeting between Wang and Araqchí takes place after a 12 -day conflict between Iran and Israel, which began on 13 June with an Israeli offensive against Iranian targets.

The Chinese head of state met with Lavrov at a time when the United States hardens the tone against Moscow.
US President Donald Trump threatened on Monday to impose additional tariffs if a peace agreement in Ukraine is not reached within the next 50 days.
The meeting occurred a day after Trump signaled a retreat in his posture against Kremlin, after expressing publicly frustration with Russian President Vladimir Putin, for the continuity of bombing in Ukraine.
During the meeting, Xi called for the continuation of the implementation of the consensus achieved between the two leaders, in the context of an increasingly narrow relationship between China and Russia.
According to XI, the Foreign Ministries of both countries should “continue this joint work effectively”.
The meeting also served to discuss “various topics related to high -level bilateral political contacts,” including Putin's next visit to China, Sputnik told.

The connection between the disappearance and executions within the Anti-Drug War, carried out by Rodrigo Duterte, would reinforce the case before the International Criminal Court against the former president, told the broadcaster Filipina ABS-CBN Kristina Conti, one of the representatives of the victims' families.
"It would be an additional evidence. The police, or in particular these death squads were involved in assassinations of activists and other directed murders," he said.
The case of the 34 Sabungos -as they are known in the Philippines the fans of the struggles of the roosters -missing in 2021, has made headlines since one of the accused, Julie Padidongan, said they were killed and then thrown into the lake surrounding the Taal volcano.
Padidongan accused businessman Charlie Ang, involved in lucrative online bets and for those who worked as security, to have ordered the murders, carried out by police officers.
Philippine coastal diver teams continue to search the turbulent volcanic waters, a process that can take months, and has so far recovered several bags with human and animal remains that authorities are analyzing.
 
Other investigations
The Secretary of Justice, Jesus Crispin Remulla, said on Monday that he was investigating whether police accused of the disappearances were also involved in extrajudicial executions during the Duterte War against the drug.
"There are people involved in the murders of the war against drugs and e-sabong [online bets], that's all we can mention for now, but we have to establish clearer connections," he said.
For its part, the presidential palace stressed that it will proceed to an exhaustive investigation into the disappearances, despite the criticism of family members for years of inaction in this case.
"This will not be neglected, there will be no cover-up and the investigation will continue; this is what the president [Ferdinand Marcos Jr.] wants," said presidential spokeswoman Claire Castro at a press conference on Friday.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Economy | Growth of 5.2 % in the second quarter although commercial tension with USA</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/16/economia-crescimento-de-52-no-segundo-trimestre-apesar-de-tensao-comercial-com-eua/</link><description>The Chinese economy grew 5.2 percent in the second quarter of the year, in homologous terms, according to official data released yesterday, in a context of climbing the trade war with the United States.
In the face of the previous quarter, the world's second largest economy expanded 1.1 by one hundred, according to data released by the National Statistics Office (GNE).
In the first semester, China's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew 5.3 by year, in homologous terms.
One of the main engines of growth was exports. On Monday, Chinese authorities announced that foreign sales increased 5.8 percent in June, compared to the same month of the previous year, accelerating the 4.8 percent recorded in May.
The temporary relief of punitive tariffs on Chinese products in the US, as part of the resumption of commercial negotiations between the two countries, led to a sudden increase in orders by companies and consumers.
Chinese companies have also sought to diversify export destinations and reinforce production in other countries as a way to mitigate the impact of the tariffs imposed by Washington.
“Generally speaking, with the application of more proactive and effective macroeconomic policies, the national economy maintained stable growth, with good dynamics, demonstrating resilience and vitality,” reads the GNE report.
Despite growth, the data show signs of fragility in internal demand: consumer prices fell 0.1 percent in the first half of 2025, which shows persistent deflationary risks in the country.
Chinese leaders set a 5 percent growth target for this year, in line with the expansion recorded in 2024.</description><pubDate>2025-07-16 20:02:29</pubDate></item><item><title>Pyongyang | Direct flights from and to Moscow later this month</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/16/pyongyang-voos-directos-de-e-para-moscovo-ainda-este-mes/</link><description>Russia and North Korea continue to strengthen cooperation. Direct flights between the two capitals will be a reality from the 27th, with a frequency of one flight per month in a first phase
North Korea and Russia will inaugurate direct flights between Moscow and Pyongyang from July 27 in a reinforcement of cooperation between the two countries, the Russian government announced yesterday.
This is the first direct air service between the two capitals and the flight will last approximately eight hours, the Russian Ministry of Transport, quoted by the country's news agency Tass.
In the first phase, calls will be made once a month to generate a stable demand and ensure flight occupation.
The announcement of the date comes five days after Russia's federal air transport agency authorized Moscow -based Nordwind to regular flights between the two cities, with a maximum frequency of two calls per week.
So far, the only direct air connection between the two countries was the route between Vladivostok (East Russian) and Pyongyang.
 
Good partners
The announcement follows the visit of Russian Foreign Minister, Serguei Lavrov, North Korea last week, which included a meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, who reaffirmed "unconditional support" to Russia in the war against Ukraine.
Lavrov also had a meeting with North Korean counterpart, Choe Son-hui, in which both reaffirmed the desire to advance to a “long-term strategic partnership” through the bilateral treaty signed in 2024, which includes a mutual defense clause in case of aggression.
The ties between Russia and North Korea were narrowed after this treaty's signing and Pyongyang is believed to have sent troops, rockets and ammunition to support Ukraine's Russian invasion in exchange for anti-aircraft weapon systems.
 
By land
The restoration of direct flights follows other recent developments in the transport sector.
On June 17, Russia and North Korea restored the direct rail service between Moscow and Pyongyang, suspended since 2020 due to Covid-19 pandemic and considered the longest worldwide train trip, covering more than 10,000 kilometers in just eight days.
The two nations also agreed to resume the railway route between Pyongyang and Khabarovsk (Far East Russian), as well as increasing the frequency of flights between the two countries and starting the joint construction of a bridge for vehicle circulation over the Tumen River, in line with strategic commitments to reinforce transport cooperation.</description><pubDate>2025-07-16 20:00:25</pubDate></item><item><title>Anabela Santiago, Academic: “China is a reformist and moderate”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/30/anabela-santiago-academica-a-china-e-reformista-e-moderada/</link><description>Anabela Santiago has just defended at the University of Aveiro the doctoral thesis that analyzes how China has been positioned in recent decades as an important actor in the “global health governance”. Today, Beijing seeks “alternative mechanisms” of cooperation in the “global south” and tries to build an alternative model to the World Health Organization
 
 
Let's start with the concept of Global Health Governance (GGS). Is this a more contemporary concept or relating to the post-war period and the Foundation of the World Health Organization (WHO)? What have been the main actors of this governance until China's growth?
GGS is a concept whose prominence and relevance have grown significantly in the 21st century, largely driven by economic globalization and worldwide interconnection. Although global health has always transcended national borders, demanding multidisciplinary approaches and international cooperation, only from the 1990s it was made greater awareness of it. Historically, GGS has been predominantly influenced by western powers and neoliberal values. The main actors of this governance, until China's growth, were historically marked by interventions of entities such as WHO and non-governmental, predominantly American and European organizations.
One of the findings of its doctoral thesis is that China has been progressively positioning itself in this leadership. This position started specifically when and why?
Yes, China has been progressively positioned as a relief actor in the evolution of the GG system. Although it is not possible to point out an exact date of start, China has evolved from a relatively isolated country to a main actor in global political, economic and technological arenas. Its growing economic and political influence also represents a change in GGS's historical dynamics, and in the 1960s China tried to play a humanitarian health care role in neighboring countries and Africa. The thesis points out that China's experience can be seen as an example of what is achievable when a state chooses its own way rather than a pre-established model, aligning itself with the 21st century prediction as the "century of Asia."
Did the pandemic years influence this position? How?
Covid-19 pandemic highlighted the need for global health cooperation, as well as the potential consequences of the failure to prioritize global health. The thesis explores the evolution of the Health Silk Route before and after the pandemic, indicating that the pandemic years allowed greater awareness of the need for instruments such as the Health Silk Route as the most effective cooperation platforms among nations. Although not detailed in this specific section, it is implicit that the pandemic intensified China's performance in health diplomacy and health development assistance.
Looking at the internal reforms that China has carried out in the health area, which highlights as the most important?
I approach, in the thesis, the reforms of the China Health System and I point out that the Chinese governance model is a unique combination of state -oriented economic reforms and development by the state, incorporating elements of neoliberalism and authoritarianism into political issues in general, and the health sector is nothing different from the rest. One of China's mentioned contributions, recognized by WHO, is its primary health care model based on the recognized good practice of “barefoot doctors” (barefoot doctors). In addition, the thesis analyzes the main reform policies and their progress and challenges in the period 2009-2018, which comprise the reforms of primary health care, hospital and pharmaceutical reform. The “Healthy China 2030” program is also an important and ambitious reference of China's domestic reforms in health, also encompassing social determinants.
Is Beijing's intention to create an alternative entity to WHO, or simply create an alternative movement that can coexist with WHO, in the context of the relationship with the global south? How could this work?
The thesis suggests that China adopts a "dual approach": while integrating in existing global structures, forging simultaneously alternative paths, particularly through regional alliances such as BRICS and partnerships with Global South. This indicates an intention to create an alternative movement that can coexist and complement the role of WHO, rather than a direct alternative entity. China demonstrates a clear commitment to align the objectives of the “Belt and Road” initiative with the united nations sustainable development objectives, showing their willingness to present these initiatives as complements to the existing cooperation mechanisms in the international liberal order. President Xi Jinping's view of a “future community shared for humanity”, which includes the notion of a “global health community for all”, also points to a new perspective in international cooperation.
Traditional Chinese Masks, Vaccines and Medicine (MTC): What are China's products or instruments to position itself as an increasingly global actor in GGS?
The thesis points out that China is an indispensable provider of global public health, essential for the product supply chain, such as masks and vaccines. The MTC is also mentioned as one of China's great contributions to global health governance, with its chinese herbal treatments, some of which already recognized by WHO in 2017. In addition, Chinese medical assistance and medical teams sent to other regions of the globe are important instruments of Chinese health diplomacy.
In creating an alternative movement or reality to WHO, China may be taking advantage of the lack of full representativeness in the same WHO, or gaps in its operation?
The thesis does not address directly whether China is taking advantage of a lack of full representativeness in WHO or gaps in its operation. However, it emphasizes that the work aims to fill a gap in scientific knowledge in relation to the paradigm of health governance from a non-western and liberal perspective, emphasizing China as an actor of the global south. This suggests that China seeks to strengthen alternative models that can offer more personalized health challenges, different from those defended by Western countries, positioning itself as a moderate reformist actor.
How has the European Union (EU) foreign policy in relation to China affecting or influenced this position of the country in global health governance?
In the thesis, the fourth publication, entitled "Challenges on the European Union-China Cooperation in Higher Education from" People-To-People Dialogue ’Perspective: The Case of Health-Related Joint Projects," explores cooperation in higher education, in particular that includes health-related projects. Therefore, despite the strategic and economic dialogue, the deterioration of UE-china bilateral relations intensified, with the commission to assume a decline of enthusiasm due to “China's countermeasures to EU human rights sanctions, economic coercion and commercial measures against the single market, and the positioning of China in the war in Ukraine”. Although challenges and tensions are recognized, cooperation in higher education, including health projects, is seen as part of a broader picture of strategic partnership between EU and China. However, it is evident that there is no long tradition of health cooperation between EU and China in higher education, and that there are few joint projects compared to the general panorama. It is suggested that both EU and China should make more efforts to align medical study curricula and promote more joint research in areas related to health, infectious diseases, among others.
In the Trump 2.0 era, and without pandemic, what could be China's role in global health governance?
Although the thesis is published this year, it focuses on the preceding period and includes the pandemic, where it does not speculate directly on a future scenario of “Trump 2.0” without pandemic. However, the thesis argues that China is not just a participant, but a moderate reformist force in the formation of global health standards. Regardless of future political scenarios, their growing economic and political influence, strategic health diplomacy, internal reforms and initiatives such as the Health Silk Route will continue to shape their role in global health governance. The view of a “global health community for all” also remains a guiding principle for China's efforts.
Does this power of China in GGS verify more with bilateral or multilateral agreements?
The thesis suggests that China's power in global health governance manifests itself through both bilateral and multilateral agreements, but with a growing emphasis on certain forms of cooperation that strengthen their role in the global south and through alternative mechanisms. Although the thesis does not explicitly quantify the predominance between bilateral and multilateral, the focus on regional alliances (BRICS) and partnerships with the Global South (which often involve bilateral agreements and group cooperation initiatives) and the Health Silk Route indicate a hybrid approach.</description><pubDate>2025-06-30 23:46:26</pubDate></item><item><title>Fórum Macau | Secretário-geral diz que nunca se discutiu alargamento a países hispânicos</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/30/forum-macau-secretario-geral-diz-que-nunca-se-discutiu-alargamento/</link><description>In an interview with Lusa agency, the secretary general of the Macau Forum, Ji Xianzheng, assured that “never discussed” the widening of action to Hispanic countries, but that the willingness already stated by the government of Sam Hou Fai will have to be the authorities to decide a new direction to the cooperation strategy.
 
The Secretary-General of the Macau Forum stated that the institution “never discussed” the creation of an entity to extend to Hispanic countries to promote economic cooperation similar to those that provide the connection between China and Portuguese-speaking countries.
“Within the Macao Forum, we have never discussed this topic,” said the Forum Secretary-General for Economic and Commercial Cooperation between China and Portuguese-speaking countries Ji Xianzheng.
The official acknowledged that, "in society, there were some conversations to discuss or address the possibility of promoting more contact and cooperation with Spanish -language countries, but at the Forum level we have never addressed this theme."
The Macao executive announced in mid -April the intention of creating a center to promote economic services between China and the Portuguese and Spanish languages in the neighboring special Economic Zone of Hengqin.
The idea is to provide companies in Hispanic countries services in the “linguistic, legal, fiscal, verification of compliance with norms, formation, arbitration and mediation”, according to the Secretary for Administration and Justice, André Cheong.
Days earlier, the chief executive, Sam Hou Fai, had also announced the intention of “promoting exchange and cooperation” through Macao between China and the universe of Spanish -speaking countries.
Although Macau wants to widen focus to Castilian -speaking countries, “the forum will remain the forum for China and Lusophony countries,” said Ji Xianzheng. The secretary general clarified that the institution that directs "can contribute contributions to the greater opening of Macao in international cooperation", as is the intention announced by the new government of MSAR.
Complementary forum
Personally, the secretary general has ensured that he had “pleasing to work with all parties,” but stressed that this is a “decision that is up to central governments to make” and that the forum was never contacted in this regard.
"Yes, I worked in Latin America, Spain, nine years in Madrid and Caracas. But this is not a decision of personal interest, it is up to politicians to make the decision," he said, explaining that the idea will be to promote the relationship between Macao and Brazil and then to other Latin American countries, as well as expanding the relationship with Portugal to Spain.
"There is no limit. The Macao Forum is complementary. It does not restrict any promotion of the cooperation of the other parts," he said.
According to the Macao Government Communication Office, Sam Hou Fai admitted on June 21 that he postponed a trip to Portugal, scheduled for July, and should also pass through Spain and the European Union headquarters in Brussels.
Bad interpretations
In the same interview with Lusa, the Secretary-General of the Macao Forum imputed to national governments the responsibility for conducting development and economic cooperation policies, stressing that the institution “has no investment projects”.
Ji Xianzheng attributes criticism to the Macao Forum to an wrong interpretation regarding the body's mission. "The forum is a mechanism of cooperation between central governments. Many people think it is to the secretariat that it is up to the execution of policies, but we have a limited number of people," added Ji.
"The secretariat has no investment projects, it is a mechanism for preparing the ministerial conference, connecting with governments, not a promotion agency. It has not been thought of, connects with the promotion agencies. We are four people sent by China and one delegate for each country," he said.
At the last ministerial conference, in April 2024, then Portuguese Economy Minister Pedro Reis argued that the Portuguese Language China-Parais Cooperation and Development Fund should bet more on small and medium enterprises (SMEs).
The Cooperation Fund was created in 2013 by the China Development Bank and the Macao Industrial and Commercial Development Fund, with a thousand million dollars, of which about 60 percent have already been invested, according to the secretary general.
Action plans
Ji Xianzheng has admitted that SMEs are "a difficult theme for any government" and that "international cooperation for the promotion of development and cooperation of small and medium enterprises is even more difficult. It is a topic that is being debated daily worldwide." But admitted, "here, little."
"But it is stipulated in the action plan [2024-2026]. It is up to central governments and commerce chambers, promotion agents, to work together to do this. The secretariat assumes responsibility as authorized by the central governments, specifically, in the activities program," he said.
Politicians from various countries, including Portugal, Angola and Mozambique, have appealed to a change in the rules of the fund's candidacy. Current rules require, for example, that candidate projects have a minimum investment of five million dollars, and the fund only covers 20 percent of total investment, referring the rest to governments or companies.
Ji Xianzheng said the new direction of the fund "is committed to promoting a broader investment, with better coverage for all forum countries, [relatively] to projects that have a strategic or significant impact on the socioeconomic development of participating countries."
According to the secretary general, "the terms of application [of the rules of access to the background] will be more flexible and the forms of application will also be more diverse." “Instead of being just direct investment, they are also studying ways to apply the fund, in cooperation with other funds or with other financial institutions,” he gave as an example.
"This fund has an operation according to market rules. It is not a humanitarian aid fund. Therefore, it has to guarantee the minimum return of benefit. But, on that, they are very open to study, in this case, the conditions of each project," added Ji Xianzheng, but to give examples of "flexibilization of the rules."
Regarding the approximation of the China universe and countries of the Iberian Peninsula, already cemented in official speeches, economist Maria Fernanda Ilhéu, president of the Seda's New Route Association, told HM, earlier this month, that this intention is “very objective and pragmatic and can be summarized to the Macao economy diversification project, for which companies and investors are not only in Macao, but also from Macao, but also from Macao, but also from countries, but countries Portuguese Language ”.
"But the fact is that companies and institutions from Portuguese-speaking countries are not being effective in responding to this need for Macao. Therefore, widening companies and Spanish-speaking institutions this invitation to cooperation seems logical to me," the economist said.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Isabel Rio Novo, author of the biography of Luís de Camões: “Time in Macau was of tranquility”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/26/isabel-rio-novo-autora-da-biografia-de-luis-de-camoes-tempo-em-macau-foi-de-tranquilidade/</link><description>It will be launched tomorrow, at the Consulate General of Portugal in Macau and Hong Kong, the biography of Luís de Camões, by Isabel Rio Novo. In an interview with HM, the author unravels some secrets about the poet's life in Macau, a period of relative calm in the middle of a almost always turbulent life
 
Why did you decide to get in the writing of another biography of Camões?
It is true that Luis Vaz de Camões has been biographed many times over 500 years. However, 50 years ago there was no biography about him. From my point of view and the editor, Camões deserved a more current biography that revised all kinds of prejudices, seeking known sources, the uncovered information research and where the rereading of all previous works were rereading. This biography is not only a summary, but also the reinterpretation of what has been known, but which had rarely been related. The book also brings some new data with some documentation that was discovered.
How was your relationship with the writing of Camões born?
I fell in love and went to those young readers who was not tormented with Camões. On the contrary, I liked it soon and let myself be seduced by Camões Lyric. I am from the areas of comparative literature and history, and in this sense I always understood the dimension and importance of the work of Camões.
And what are they?
It is a work and an author of its time and its time, which was extraordinary, with the Renaissance, Humanism and the travels of navigation. But at the same time, it is a work that is the product of an outstanding literary genius, one that we can tell a handful in the history of universal literature.
What camões we find in this biography?
I tried to go to the bottom, remove layers of the meaning that these 500 years were adding to Camões, in the sense that each season read its Camões and produced its interpretation. I wanted to discover the substrate, the man of flesh and bone he lived and wrote 500 years ago.
He was a man suffered, with many financial difficulties.
He was a man with a complex and difficult relationship with reality, not only of his time, but also with reality [itself]. The theme of the time, the disconcerting of the world, how society seems to work instead of what should work, being a literary topic of the Renaissance, it was something Camões felt personal and genuinely.
How?
He lived a series of disagreements, of extreme experiences. Suffice it to say that you have been stuck several times and for various reasons. He made great trips at a time when these were absolutely risky, long, and complicated enterprises. Camões was involved in military expeditions, and almost all his life was soldered. But this set of experiences allowed him to be almost everything someone could be at the time he lived.
He was one of the most traveled authors of the time, having been in Brazil, Goa…
Yes. Even the connection to Macau, which is contested by some scholars, but not by me… I am persuaded, given the existing documentation and indirect testimonies, which Camões passed through China with the position of Dead and Missing Provider. When this happened, albeit very incipiently, the Portuguese establishment in China, which was already Macao. It is not known whether Camões held this position assigned to him by Viceroy D. Francisco Coutinho, if he was exactly assigned to be a provider during the trip, or a provider at Macao's establishment. But what he knew from China was surely this little warehouse that Portugal had achieved, at a lot of cost, with great difficulty and after many attempts to obtain in China.
What did a deceased provider?
Whenever a Portuguese died in the East, a soldier or merchant, it was necessary to ensure the rights of the heirs, the families who were normally in Portugal. The provider had to identify the deceased, his naturalness, origin and make the heirs known. He also had to keep the deceased's assets before they were stolen, auction them, keep the coins that would result in, and then take it all to Lisbon. It was a process that, if it went well, took many months, because it was necessary to send this money to the authorities of Goa who later sent him in the career from India to Lisbon.
Can we talk about a period of stability in Camões's life in Macau?
Yes. Until this appointment as a deceased provider, everything Camões knew from the East had been as a soldier. As soon as Goa [1553] arrives weeks later in a first military expedition. We know why: Not because I had some war appeal, but because only participating in expeditions earned your welding. Although everyone said that the soldiers lived very poorly, the welding was what Camões had to survive. The time lived in Macao, when he was free from soldier obligations, was a time of tranquility regarding subsistence, which was assured. He had some time and calm to continue the work with "the Lusíadas." More than that, as much as the sources allow to deduce, Camões met in Macau a phase of balance in terms of personal and loving life, as, on the return trip, he brought with him, according to the testimony of Diogo do Couto, a Chinese girl.
Dinamene.
This was the term used by the chronicler. We don't know if it would be a Chinese or Asian girl. This girl with whom Camões lived maritally was someone who liked it very much, according to the testimony of Diogo do Couto. But Dinamene would certainly not be her name, as it was a mythological name that, by the way, Camões used in her lyric, even before she boarded the East. Chinese girls with whom soldiers and merchants in Macao lived amanced were baptized and received a Christian name. Therefore, Dinamene would even have a Christian and Portuguese name. But as we do not know her name, and if we are aware that we use a kind of metaphor, we can call it Dinamene.
She dies later on a trip and makes Camões very shaken.
On Macao's return trip to Goa, probably at the end of his mandate as a provider, Camões suffers the celebrated wreck, in which he loses the personal assets he had ease, including the assets of the deceased that he was guardian, and this will bring him complications. It also suffers the loss of dynamine. The wreck went with some in the seas of China, probably by the mouth of the Mekong River.
Considers unlikely to have lost part of "the Lusíadas."
The first biographers say Camões was saved from this wreck with a board. It is not unreasonable that he managed to save the manuscript of the Lusíadas on this board. But it is also no excluding that Camões knew his poem by heart. The memory of people in the sixteenth century was different. They were very used to keeping things from memory. And we know, because the proof is obtained in the work of Camões, that it had an extraordinary memory. I have a way to prove it, of course, that Camões is one of the rare authors who knew his poem by heart.
Do you think Camões had a lower life to his true talent?
Undoubtedly. According to a too extensive set of concordant testimonies, he dies poor, even in miserable conditions, and according to an eyewitness, without having a blanket with which he covered himself. On the other hand, Camões was known to follow the publication of the Lusíadas, who were commented and read [in the poet's life time]. We have the testimony of Faria de Sousa, one of the first biographers of Camões, which says that when he passed the streets, people stop and pointed. Camões also had a figure that stood out, with a leaked eye and using a pale. By then, I would be quite sick, using crutches. But there is a set of poets, which is very unreliable that they did not know Camões, who never refer to them. There are, on the other hand, other humanists, such as Pedro Magalhães Gândavo, who from the outset praises him as the prince of Portuguese poets.
But the king gives him a tendency for deeds provided and the publication of "The Lusíadas."
This famous tendency, which should not be a big deal, because all ancient biographers say it was derisive, is attributed to him as a kind of military reform, because of the 17 years of service in the East, and not as a reward for the publication of "The Lusíadas." D. Sebastião's mercy letter, which attributes him the title of nobleman knight, had no repercussion in practice, but gave him 15 thousand reais. [The publication of “the Lusíadas”] was an additional argument [for the letter] and not the main argument. This leads us to believe that D. Sebastião will not even have read or heard “the Lusíadas”, will have received indirect information, favorable about the poem.
How did the process of editing “Os Lusíadas” occurred?
It was an event, because both the press and the books that were published a year were a very small amount. In the year in which “the Lusíadas” are published were the only work of non -religious caress [to be edited]. To fund the edition, it is more than likely that Camões had the support of a patron, probably D. Manuel de Portugal, from the Condes do Vimioso family. Getting the work was a press was a mere and complicated process, as it had to go through the prior examination of the civil authorities, the royal authority and the censorship of the Inquisition. The resident of the Holy Office does not only let the book pass, but to make an amount of almost unprecedented compliments in the license that authorizes the publication of the work. If we go to the opinions emitted by the same rear, there is no other work on which he is as compliments as it was with the epic of Camões.
In Indonesia, he befriended a slave on the island of Java.
Camões was, at least once, on the island of Ternate, Indonesia, in the archipelago of molucas, at a time when there were conflicts motivated by an extremely cruel Portuguese captain towards the king or sultan of Ternate, which originated a kind of war between the Portuguese and the places. Camões has a song that describes the island of Ternate. We do not know if it was at this time, or in another passage to the Far East, that Camões turned on to a Jaú, or Javanese, but could not be exactly from the Far East, but a freed slave who had been linked by friendship to Camões. And this is because in one of the first biographies of Camões it reads that Jaú, with the Christian name António, asked for alms at night. This freedom of movements of a slave indicates that he would probably be a freed slave. He asked for alms to Camões, for himself and the mother of Camões, with whom Camões will have lived in recent years of life.</description><pubDate>2025-06-26 23:30:50</pubDate></item><item><title>Filipe de Saavedra, Teacher: “A Camões Interpretative Center in Macau is missing”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/21/filipe-de-saavedra-docente-falta-um-centro-interpretativo-de-camoes-em-macau/</link><description>Professor at the University of Science and Technology of Macao and a scholar of the presence of Camões in Asia, Philip de Saavedra understands that Macau is missing an interpretative center about the poet's life and work. The academic spoke yesterday at the National Library in Lisbon, about the correspondence written by Luís de Camões in Asia
 
He participated yesterday at the “from Lisbon to Goa: What the Letters of Camões” participated. What path does the East arise portrayed in these letters, and who were directed?
The letters Camões wrote from Asia are in the order of the dozens. There is in them scholarship, philosophy, and also a lot of humor, sarcasm, and satire of humanist nature. Some were written from Ternate, others from Malaca, Macau, probably others from Cambodia, to recipients in India and Portugal. With the exception of the letters of Goa, where the identification of the writing site is generally present, maping those that were written during the rest of it would be a complex task. They are only given as written in Asia.
Can you give examples of written letters in this context?
I mention here two of the first he sent to the kingdom. The epistle whose first line is “The Poet Simony speaking” was written in January 1554, when Camões has just arrived in Goa, destined for his pupil, D. António de Noronha. It is a very emotional letter, giving it the storm that had plagued the Armada in the Cape of Good Hope, "seeing the death of the before me." Camões survived this limit experience aboard the São Bento ship, the only one to arrive that year to Goa, and which was lost in the turn of the Christmas lands, dying in this second bid the Captain Fernão de Álvares Cabral, and many of those who traveled with him. In addition to the news of his salvation, the poet was equally eager to tell his friend the expedition of D. Afonso de Noronha to Malabar, in which he had taken part in the previous month. In Irenal pages, Camões vehemently condemns the massacre of the few native troops by the “thick armed” of the disproportionate vice-king army. In his radical compliment of peace, the poet calls "true remedy" to the early death that cure the war crazes of those who want to live "by knights", for "who will walk by following the fero Mars always brings their eyes to their danger." Cruelly prophetic words: by irony of fate, at the moment the poet wrote these lines and sent them, that recipient diletus, for whose life he feared, already lay, lying during a military foray in Ceuta on April 29, 1553, only 17 years old.
And the second letter?
A year later, in January 1555, he wrote to a friend a different epistle in tone and in purpose, whose first line is "I wished so much", where he evoked the shock he suffered from the death of D. António, gathering a sonnet that had composed to his memory. It is clear that Camões also had great intimacy with this correspondent, who knew D. António and the poetry of Camões, Petrarch and Boscán. Interestingly, the letter includes some male lines, which Camões says they are mandatory in private letters, containing what can be called a resort conversation, so being worship or scholar did not prevent it if it were "bon vivant".
The presence of Camões in Macau is still wrapped in a certain myth. What are the concrete tests of your presence in the territory?
It is necessary to separate the waters. The landing of Camões in Patane's busty, then called “cave”, is surrounded by a beautiful legendary aura. But the presence of Camões in Macao, this is not involved in "myth", is a factual and historical reality, founded on a wide variety of testimonies, all independent of each other. Insisting on a chronology that contained in the sources, but which was flagrantly erroneous, it was deliberately sought to confuse the doubts that could have about his permanence in the sinned, although unjustified, with false doubts about the poet's stay in Macau, which are laughable and devoid of the minimum foundation. The joke ran a swimming, and little by little it was embedded in the collective imagination, to the point that some less informed people take it for a supposed “discovery” recent. However, nonsense was released in 1907, and soon dismantled in 1911 by Jordan de Freitas. Judge Eduardo Ribeiro put more “points in the iis” in this regard. In your time I will publish the full documentation about the presence of Camões in Macao, putting a definitive end to the mythical “myth”.
What life did Camões in Macau?
We can say that these two years were those of the greatest professional, economic and affective in his life. Is it written poetry? Constantly, as the dimension of the work attests. A significant part of “the Lusíadas” was composed here, although the poem had neither began nor ended in Macao. Not least in his life was that it was in Macao who publicly assumed a relationship with a young Chinese, most exactly the Tanka ethnicity of poor fishermen. This asymmetrical connection is not surprising and with a modest young woman: only disadvantaged families would not prevent daughters from relate to foreigners. This explains the fact that she left with Camões in 1565 to Goa, with concubine status. But the private vessel in which they followed, belonging to Chinese merchants, suffered a wreck by Cambodia, and Camões lost there the “kind lamp I loved so much”. It was only after his death that he would come to chrisma as Denamene, a Greek nymph of the waters, so that she could live forever in the ocean. The Chinese of Macao have a special relationship with Camões, such as the Portuguese and the Macanese.
How is this relationship?
It existed in the eighteenth century in Macao the first monument in honor of Camões, something that in Portugal only began to think about the following century. He even received an inscription on Chinese, and even a Chinese pavilion was built on his sanctuary. The Viscount of Juromenha says that in 1845 the Viceroy of Canton and Imperial Commissioner Ki-A there was worshiped Camões as the “Portuguese Confucius”. And rightly, Camões shares many aspects of the sages of Chinese tradition: he established a dialogue with the masters through the recreation of larger works, cultivated a millennial tradition (he gloss two thousand years prior to his own time), practiced itinerary as a source of "sagesse", said the primacy of poetry, conceived the rivers as mythical entities, even personifying them, even personifying them, even He showed a marked tendency to moralize, and epitomously his thinking in masterful sentences.
What connection did Camões have with Goa?
Unlike Macao, Goa raised in Camões mostly negative feelings. The first impressions he had, like a lawless land in which only the little turns were worse, could not have been worse, as read in the initial letter to which he alluded: "long land, from all the poor honorable grave." In the second letter, he goes on, "I can say that it is the mother of bad villains, and stepmother of honorable men." These impressions would not improve over time, as corroborated the satire that led to the expulsion to Ternate in 1556. Goa, where he became the deputy protected, to fall later in the greatest disfavor under D. Antão de Noronha, was in his texts the inverted mirror of the Kingdom, the corrupt and corrupt Babylon, theil of God, and the betrayal of God, King and the law. In what is not original, as there are other sources that reinforce this Jeremiac and apocalyptic portrait of the capital of the Portuguese East Empire. Remember Bocage: "From the land to worst you are, O goa." This said, obviously that he will also have lived there sweethearts, especially under the viceroyalty of his protectors, and in living with some companions of the poetic lines that then lived there, and which he evokes in the so-called “feast of trovas”. To one of these cultured spirits, the poet Luís Franco, even a copy of his almost complete works, including the 'self of filodemo' that had composed there, that they could be saved if another adversity survived in the kingdom to the kingdom.

Do you think Portugal should pay more attention to your writings, streamlining your work more? How?
In Lisbon it is necessary to build a great literary museum dedicated to Camões and its creations. The ideal place will be the Convent of St. Bento de Xabregas, where his friend Dom António had a grave at the Pantheon of the Line Chapel. Also in Goa the statue of Camões left for exile in the cruelly called “Archaeological Museum”, which is not the right place to end the poetry or image of a poet. Being the greatest intangible heritage of Macao, Camões has been poorly used in this region. multimedia.
What about Macau? Is Camões studied at higher education?
Two students from the Macao University of Sciences and Technology will now defend their master's theses. The first is an in -depth technical study of the translation of Zhang Weim of the Camões Odes. The second runs through the literary survival of the figure of Dinamene in contemporary Portuguese fiction, and are both excellent, bringing novelty.</description><pubDate>2025-05-21 22:42:45</pubDate></item><item><title>Piménio Ferreira: “Anti-igan rhetoric has always worked in Portugal”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2021/04/26/pimenio-ferreira-a-retorica-anti-cigana-sempre-funcionou-em-portugal/</link><description>Piménio Ferreira, better known as Gitelles Ferreira, anti-racist militant, 34, physical engineer, national Romani. He is a man with a provocative speech, a corrosive, kind mood and a smile that leaves no one indifferent
Gitelles, we live in an intercultural land and the Gypsies - in particular - have lived about five centuries in Portugal. What is going on for Gypsy communities to remain “on the fringes” of the so -called society? 
The model of society remains to be changed. This is extremely stratified by placing people in subordinate places to privilege a violent minority. The white social structure is patriarchal and racist. What is called the "margin" of society is actually an intrinsic place to it, which belongs to it. In other words, Gypsy people have been included in this model of society since they discovered Europe and its kingdoms. The problem is the model of society that is maintained and the place to which they were relegated and how they were relegated: with violence, in inferior status against whites, without the right to human dignity, to constitute a family, to choose one's own language and religion, expropriated from any and all cultural and material law. A place built and maintained to this day by violence and genocidal and ethnicidal persecution. In 1463, a Gitano Vasco was drowned to an estate. In 1521, Gitans, or Gypsies, were already used as a reference for all that is considered bad in the model of society. The "counter-exemple" in the face of the white that would stand out for the positive. The 'angel' and the 'devil'; the 'other', the enemy; That against whom any attack and persecution is legitimate. Including the prohibition of defending, having weapons, any kind of goods, and the right of permanence.
And is this right to permanence that we still have nomadic gypsy communities within the country is denied?
Yes, no doubt. There are many ways to force nomadism: directly, prohibiting permanence and expelling with police or military force; indirectly, refusing public or private housing to Gypsy people, as they are Gypsy; and even through the gentrification process.
I read the result of an inquiry from the European Union Fundamental Rights Agency, which is said to be approximately 80% of the Gypsies responded to the risk threshold of poverty in their country; One in three Gypsies lives in a housing without channeled water; One in three Gypsies belongs to a family where someone hungry at least once the previous month; and 50% of Gypsies aged 6 to 24 do not attend school. Why does this happen like this? 
It is the historical persecution, which continues. There is no impoverishment that has no external cause. In this case, a political system of total expropriation and imposed on the basis of violence. Already in 1648, D John IV, the restorer, prohibited ‘Giving or Rent houses to Gypsies’. The same D John IV who got the kingdom of Portugal thanks to D. Jerónimo da Costa and his 250 knights. The same D. Jerónimo da Costa who had died to defend Portugal's independence from Castile. Gypsy, like his wife and children. Between prohibitions of permanence, “that do not enter Gypsies in the Kingdom and leave those who are” (D John III, 1526), with expulsions, degred to the galleys, expropriation of goods and properties, imposed with stripping, mutilation and death, systematically performed to this day (still in 2011 Faro City Council wanted to ban Gypsies in the municipality).
The prohibition of working on others (no one employs Gypsy workers, and those who accept they do it in total precariousness, for poorly paid positions and without decent rights and conditions). They cannot be dependent on their own work, they cannot get investment means due to extreme expropriation. Are dependent on precariousness. If you want to know what it is like to live in pure neoliberalism, know the lives of Gypsies. Their reality is paradigmatic of the aggression and depletion to which the "gentlemen" are willing to go to their benefit.
What do you talk about is economic and political power?
The group of political, social, cultural and economic power. The owner, the colonizer. This group that has been in power since it established the system of current domination. And that only makes sense within the hierarchically stratified sociopolitical model in which we live. Hence the need to end 'gentlemen' and institute a new model of society, healthy, free, without hierarchies or strata, whether of race, class or gender.
The model we live in leads to the Gypsy (and not only) community to economic exclusion, removing it from access to product consumption or excluding them from its production process; political exclusion associated with lack of access to information; To education and consequently the social exclusion that is seen in inequality of access to quality community areas such as restaurants, libraries, theater, cinema, concerts, health care, etc. How do you feel a gypsy child when you realize that it is not part of a whole? Children who are never represented, neither in movies, nor in books, nor in cartoons, not even in an announcement to eat cereals, for example? Is this a disaster for self-esteem, is a priori condemnation?
The question is that. Gypsy people are not “excluded from society”, by contrast, they are included in it. The problem is the existence of what is cynically called 'social exclusion', which term Orwellian, and there be under coercion, people. Which field of concentration and extermination. Incidentally, Nazi concentration camps are a more visual realization than called 'social exclusion' and, as here, were not a 'excluded' part of Nazi society, but rather its fundamental and characterizing structure. It is a place of violence, where people are maintained by violence, dedicated to their extermination, and designed so that few people can leave. And yet they resist. As in Nazi concentration camps.
And what you have listed as an example of 'consequence' of this 'exclusion', is actually the means by which this exclusion also happens and remains. Gypsy people are out of theaters, both as consumers and producers (but go to the cinema). They are out of school, education and the gym. Either as 'users' or as producers (but go to school and are on the basis of knowledge construction and academic and scientific debates).
Even in attacking Gypsy children's self -confidence, we talk about a maintenance mechanism of this situation. But Gypsy people respond very well: with Gypsy pride. Another resistance, another aggression. Gypsy people are thus included in society. In a place that belongs to this model of modern society. And they resist and contradict the power of domination and make a point of being in the city, in the cinema, in the theater, in the gym, in all spaces. With a lot of struggle and always resisting, but they are there. Social exclusion, more than a “place outside of society”, is part of its social structure.
Do you want to say that there is a collective resistance?
At work, already in a context of absolute precariousness, during the pandemic, Gypsy people rolled up sleeves and showed once again proactivity and creativity in adversity. They learned seeing and doing. And here, it is again the women who jump to the front line, face, learn to use digital tools with their daughters or children, and throw themselves into the network. And so they explore online sales as well as application by application (transportation or rehabs). In housing, in a context of pandemic in which the evictions were not locked - as they owed and dictated the law itself - residents did not fail to organize and fight unjust evictions and claim dignity in housing; associations of allied residents in their action with other housing and anti-racist struggle organizations.
It should also be noted how they reinvented and intensified to raise and distribute dietary goods and kits of masks/alcohol gel to the most expropriated people. Gypsies and non -Gypsies. In the anti-racist struggle, new movements emerged and their actions intensified by social networks. People who had never been organized or militated before began their first steps in activism, thickening this way of the organization and popular gypsy and anti-racist action. People forget, or do not want to value, but Gypsy action has helped determine results in the political dispute. Gypsy citizens mobilized in large and determined electoral results in the municipalities of 2017, both in Alentejo and in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area, even causing electoral earthquakes.
And even in the presidential, second place was resolved by a value equivalent to the estimated number of Gypsy voters. Apart from the non -Gypsy votes that were mobilized by the action of Gypsy voters. Gypsy people are even co-considering power in the spaces of opinion, local media, social networks and party and institutional political dispute. And most importantly, in the popular Ação and alliances with other social movements. We have never stopped fighting for all means and continuing to resist.
In contrast there are more and more hate speeches, from the far right in particular. What do you have to say about it?
To start these speeches are historical and European. Not even current and even less “of the far right”. These speeches have been adopted and rendered for a long time, even in 'democracy and freedom', by several representatives of the center right, conservatives, left center, liberal, liberal left, even representatives of the PCP. Anti-egana rhetoric has always worked in Portugal as it is the whiter rhetoric [white genesis]. That is, it allows you to create and give the "white" as the superior of all. And so please the white electorate who, when feeling well, pays off with his vote. Even if the policies implemented by their elected harm him even more.
Finally, did you like them to talk a little about your personal experience and how did you get to the activist?
I studied, fought for studies, made alliances, graduated, went in the labor market of the “formal precariousness”. I started my militant action and here I am today. We can transform this society a better. This certainty combined with the fact that the current one has so much suffering makes anyone want to have a transformist attitude. I wanted to be 'inventor' (physical engineer) and anti -racist militant. And through study (not necessarily schooling) and organization with others, in turn, with other studies, formations and visions, I learned how the world works and how it can be changed. But before transforming, we need to survive.
Hence two types of actions arise: transformative and survival. The struggle against hate discourse arises as survival, but his defeat will be a transformative victory. There is a lot that - like people who want a better world - we have to do, namely working to criminalize hatred speech; condemn and prohibit organizations with racist discourses and practices; denounce the racist institutional structure and logics that organize power and generate community resources. And in this sense, there have been various types of actions, of petitions, to manifestations. And we need more.
I, besides being a military man in the SOS Racism movement, participate in the “We came to stay” podcast, with Mamadou BA and Joseph da Silva. And if all goes well, we will soon start a new project. With friendly people, we also have the project “Gypsy Initiative”, dedicated to reflecting and promoting transformative movements. Essentially focused on educating against anti-agigarism, denouncing historical and continued genocide and working for a new society project. Also with new projects on the gutter. And finally, there are always voluntary actions without an organization, where I try to share what I found out about anti-egism and Roman history in schools and with interested people. In addition, there is still the struggle for housing, because the evictions did not stop during the pandemic. Due to housing and work precariousness, the subjects racialized especially the Roma nationals are the most vulnerable to COVID-19. There is essential to have actions in this area; Of all the struggles, this is the most structural, as it goes against one of the main enemies of a healthy society: the real estate speculation of this capitalist system, which places profit and goods above people and their humanization.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>GP | FIA AFINA REGIONAL Formula Rules</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/23/gp-fia-afina-regras-da-formula-regional/</link><description>The International Automobile Federation (FIA) took advantage of the holding of the Extraordinary General Assemblies and its annual conference to publish the Macao Grand Prix Regulation - FIA Regional Formula Cup of 2025. There are not many changes compared to 2024, but the changes introduced aim to browse gaps from the first edition of this competition in Macau
The twelve red flags during last year's qualification session called for the level of pilots at the Guide Circuit, which was the premiere of the FIA regional formula in Macau regional formula. This happened after the controversial decision of the FIA to consider that Formula 3 was no longer adequate to the Macao Citadino layout.
Unsurprisingly, the sports regulation is now clear that, to compete in the FIA regional formula world, “all pilots must have participated at least 3 competitions with a monolugar that has been projected and/or built to achieve a weight/power ratio of more than 3.0 kg/hp.”
Emanuele Pirro, a former F1 pilot, winner of the Guide Race and president of the FIA monoligai committee, said during the weekend of the 71st edition that, in the future, the FIA will be more demanding about track discipline. Thus, from now on, “any pilot who, in the opinion of sports commissioners, is solely responsible for the display of a red flag during the qualification training session, will not be able to continue to participate in this session and its best time back can be annulled.” The new regulation also states that “if a qualification training session is interrupted with less than four minutes remaining, it will not be restarted.”
On the other hand, the FIA maintains the limit in the participation of more experienced pilots, except only “pilots who participated in a maximum of 3 FI F2 Championship competitions of 2025.” This measure goes a little against the spirit and history of the Great Prize, which has always gathered pilots from higher categories in its main race. In fact, this was a fervent question between Macao and the International Federation on two previous occasions.
In 1985, Alfredo César Torres, then responsible for Portuguese motorsport, convinced Jean-Marie Balestre, against his will, to allow the participation of F1 pilots in the F3 Intercontinental Cup in the name of the economic viability of the race. In 2016, the controversy returned with the veto da FIA to the participation of Nelsinho Piquet, a decision badly received by the teams and then coordinator Barry Bland, which would eventually abandon the co-organization of the race a year later.
Bet on continuity
In sports terms, registrations for this second edition of the FIA regional formula Cup will remain open until July 30. The grill may include a maximum of 27 Tatuus regional formula monologues, all equipped with Alfa Romeo engines built by the Italian Autotechnic. Pirelli will once again be the official tire supplier.
The identities of the invited teams have not yet been revealed, but some news is expected in this field compared to 2024. To avoid any behind -the -scenes disputes, it has already been defined that “the position on the boxes for the teams that participate in the Macao Grand Prix will be based on the ranking of the previous year” and, in turn, “the position in the roadway for new teams will be attributed based on the order of application.”
Equal awards and more restricted advertising
The values of monetary awards remain unchanged this year, with a total of US $ 68,500 to distribute, the equivalent of just over 550,000 patacas at the current exchange rate. The race winner will receive $ 12,000, an amount that is still far from covering the costs of participation in this nature.
On the other hand, the sports regulation introduces two new prohibitions on advertising into the monoligales. In addition to the existing prohibition of advertising to fortune or bad luck, tobacco or pornography, also the promotion of electronic cigarettes and alcoholic beverages - a measure that follows the legislation in force in the territory.
The 72nd Macao Grand Prix, the largest international sports event of the MSA, will take place between November 13 and 16, 2025.</description><pubDate>2025-06-23 03:31:16</pubDate></item><item><title>FIA | Conference helped perceive future of motorsport</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/13/fia-conferencia-ajudou-a-perceber-futuro-do-automobilismo/</link><description>For the first time in its history, in 2025, Macau welcomed the Extraordinary General Assemblies and Conference of the International Automobile Federation (FIA). Organized in partnership with the Macau-China General Association (AAMC), the FIA-affiliated sports territory, and the Galaxy Entertainment Group, this event brought together more than five dozen FIA senior delegates from 147 countries in the field.
 
In the Galaxy International Convention Center, to this day, the future of motoring and mobility worldwide is discussed. However, some details about the future of sport in the territory have already been revealed between the lines. Focused on obtaining information about the growth of motorsport and promoting safe, sustainable and accessible mobility to everyone in the Asia Pacific region, the FIA conference opening session highlighted the importance of communication and collaboration, as well as the region's ability to innovate and create solutions that respond to specific questions it faces.
Roberto Carlos Osório, president of the Macau-China General Automotive Association (AAMC), said the association has a strong tradition in motor racing and that following FIA's guidelines is being able to grow rapidly competition at the base level in the region.
“We organized the first GT Macau Cup in 2008,” said the AAMC leader. "Currently, we also have the GT Cup - Great Bay Race for GT4 cars. In addition, in 2008, we created Road Sport Challenge," he explained. “And today, in 2025, we are proud to announce that we have 68 tourism cars in the region to compete in the qualification race to enter the 72nd Macao Grand Prix.”
In a year when AAMC celebrates 30 years of existence - was born as Macao Automobile Club - we also learned that the association's bet for the future will be in the basic disciplines of motor sport. Roberto Carlos Osorio also revealed a curious fact: Macau has 135 pilots with sports license from the territory.
“This growth was achieved following FIA's guidelines to promote grassroots motorsport and create accessible races for riders in the region,” added the manager of the territory. “With the interest of pilots, teams and promoters in developing state-of-the-art activities in Macau, we will focus even more on base competitions and affordable races, not only to support tourism, but also to make Macau in a Karting international center of international events, where champions can be selected for F4 and, later, for regional formula.”
Confirmed GP program
The Macao Grand Prix Organizing Committee (COGPM) held a press conference last June 8 at the Macao Grand Prix Museum to confirm the 72nd Macao Grande Prize races, which will take place from November 13 to 16 this year.
As last year, there will be seven races in total, respectively, the Macao Grand Prix - FR da Fia World Cup, the GT Macau Cup - GT da Fia World Cup, the Macau Guide Race - Kumho Fia tcr World Tour Event of Macau, the Formula 4 Formula 4 World Cup, the 57th Macao Motor Motor Prize, GT Cup - Great Bay Race (GT4) and Macao Roadsport Challenge. For the first time, the guide circuit receives four different cups under the FIA seal on the same weekend.
Other news
Between meetings and communications, other information was revealed about the November edition of the Macao Grand Prix. The FIA World Council approved in Macao that the winner of the first Formula 4 World Cup of the FIA will receive two points for the super license. We have also noticed that Pirelli will equip all the monologes that participate in both the FIA Formula 4 World Cup and the FIA regional formula World Formula Cup.

Of the twenty -eight vacancies assigned by the first two GT Cup races, only one Macao pilot got a direct entrance at the great sports event of November.
Following the success of the two races played under the China Formula 1 Grand Prix, both 30 -minute races of the GT4 Chinese Championship had a total of 21 participants at the event held at the International Circuit of Lago Ruyi in Pingtan. This picturesque track, located in Fujian province, replaced the Zhuhai International Circuit, initially included in the provisional calendar released in January, but did not confirm the holding of his event.
In Pingtan's semiurban layout, Chinese pilot Han Lichao won both races behind his Toyota GR Supra GT4 EVO2. In two very lively races, Kevin Leong Ian Veng (BMW M4 GT4) was the only Macau pilot scoring, having reached a sixth and eighth place, respectively.
Although only one Pilot of the Misrem has guaranteed the direct determination, it is possible that more riders in the territory will align on the GT - Great Bay Race, integrated in the Macao Grand Prix. This is because only 21 pilots scored in these four races, which means that even if all these pilots are signed up for the guide circuit race, seven vacancies will still be filled.
In addition to Kevin Leong, seven other pilots from Macau - Miguel Law, Wong Cheng Tou, Fok Wai Ming, Lao Kim Hou, IP Un Hous, Wong Wai Hong and Law Kit Meng - participated in at least one of the two qualification events and may be repaired for local test if the sports committee's sports committee of the Macau Grand Prix so.
Among the riders are some known names of the region's motorsport, such as Darryl O'Young, double winner of the Macau GT Cup; Chen Weian, 12 -hour separate winner; Liu Kaishun, Chinese F4 runner-up; Daniel Lu, former Champion of the Porsche Carrera Asia Cup; or Luo Kailuo, winner of the GT Cup - Great Bay Race at Macao's 70th Grand Prix.
It's not over yet
This debut season, Sro GT Cup still has two more pointed events, the last, naturally, played in the iconic Guide Circuit. The competition, which has the support of the Macao General Automobile Association - China (AAMC), has reached its intermediate point, and the struggle for the title is in the red. Prior to the mandatory visit to Macau, from 17 to 19 October, the GT4 category cars will compete at the first event held on the streets of Yizhuang, in Beijing.
Beijing's Citadino Circuit is one of the most anticipated auto events in the Popular Republic of China and represents an excellent opportunity for Macao GT4 riders - and not only to prepare for the big challenge that are the curves and countercurns of the territory layout.</description><pubDate>2025-07-11 00:45:06</pubDate></item><item><title>TCR China | André Couto participated in the Zhejiang race</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/01/tcr-china-andre-couto-participou-na-prova-de-zhejiang/</link><description>Over the weekend, André Couto had an unexpected return to the TCR China Championship, in what was his first race of this season. The rider of the sgas showed that "who knows, never forgets", despite having had a troubled passage through the Zhejiang International Circuit
The Portuguese pilot residing in Macao, who has not competed since November last year-when he played the World Lamborghini Super Trofeo World Finals, having won the title in the Lamborghini Super Trofeo Asia Pro-AM category-received a last-minute invitation from MacPro Racing Team to conduct one of the Honda Civic Fl5 TCR Team in the third race of the Chinese Championship. TCR.
Without any previous workout, André Couto came back to sit in a car he already knew, also with a technical structure that was familiar to him. By 2023, the territory pilot had already played some TCR China events with this set, then at the service of the official team Dongfeng Honda Racing Team, showing a progress right from the beginning.
"Free training did not go wrong, but in qualification a less attentive pilot hit me on my first departure lap to the track. He hit me from behind and did not realize why. Damaged me the rear, dislocated the convergence and the car was crooked. Hm. "Still, I qualified myself in fourth in Q1, five tenths of the first, which, with the car in the conditions it was, was not bad. The car had potential."
In Q2, due to the damage, the Japanese car “became much harder to guide” and Couto ended in tenth. However, this ended up having a positive effect: “With the reversal of the starting grid, the tenth place of Q2 allowed me to start first to the second race.”
The first race, played on Saturday on the shaoxing track, did not go as well as the pilot wanted, not being able to follow the official links, nor the best Honda and Hyundai. "I ended up eighth. The car was not as good as I expected and we found that there was a damaged damper, still from the crash in the qualification, which was exchanged for the Sunday race."
Inglorius Sunday
In the 20 Sunday round race, André Couto had everything to shine as he departed from pole-position and Honda finally seemed in a position to fight for the first places. "On the way back, the car was good. I didn't feel strange anymore and I was optimistic."
The idea was to get well to distance themselves from the fastest competitors in the first laps and then manage the race with new tires. However, it all faded quickly when it was wrapped by Wu Yi Fan right in the brake for the first curve.
“That was my mission, but I couldn't,” acknowledged the winner of the 2000 Macao Grand Prix. “He hit me on the first curve and the car was damaged. Sports commissioners, but that does not change the fact that I have given up. ”
With Honda's damaged direction, André Couto had no choice but to leave. "I was a bit disappointed because I hope to get a good result for MacPro Racing Team that had given me a good car.</description><pubDate>2025-07-01 00:26:00</pubDate></item><item><title>GP | Jaguar that won in Macau in 1984 returned to the tracks</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/06/gp-jaguar-que-venceu-em-macau-em-1984-regressou-as-pistas/</link><description>The more than seventy years of history of the Macau Grand Prix are people, machines and great moments. We were in 1984, when Tom Walkinshaw won Jaguar's only victory in the guide race. After years away from the audience, for the affected man, this same car returned to the tracks at the hands of an enthusiast of the MSAR MOTOR EVENT
 
Richard Meins, an English maritime transport entrepreneur who lived many years in Hong Kong, who participated on several occasions at the Macao Grand Prix, led this Jaguar XJs of Group A in the Historic Touring Car Challenge race, a competition for classics during the Donington Historic Festival. This “Big Cat”, Chassis No. 5 and one of the four original XJs still existing, is practically as it was in 1984, but given the limitations of tobacco advertising, today boasts the colors used in the European Tourism Championship, instead of the iconic black and gold decoration of John Player Special (JPS) that marked the ticket through the guide circuit.
Interestingly, this return to the clues, from a car that has been still in New Zealand and Japan, was scheduled for the Algarve International Race Track, but the Historic Touring Car Challenge canceled its race in early April in Portimão. So it was in lands of his majesty that Richard Meins made his first race with the British car.
“The car won in Macao in 1984, so I'm a big fan of this model,” Ricard Meins told the English magazine Motorsport News. “I still have the photographs I took this weekend in Macao,” said this avid classic competition car collector who, besides driving, supported several riders at the Macao Grand Prix.
In Donington Park, Richard Meins shared the imposing Jaguar XJS, equipped with a 5.3 -liter V12 engine with Jack Tetley, and ended in sixth place, winning in his class. Richard Meins had only guided the car once or twice, but plans to participate in more historic touring car challenge rounds with XJS 1984. “Let's try to put it on track more often now,” Ricard Meins said, who revealed that he was a stake in the Silverstone Festival in August with this very rare and striking copy of the 1980s tourism cars history.
Premiere of an iconic decoration
In the summer of 1984, Tom Walkinshaw accepted the challenge of the Portuguese organization of the Grand Prix to travel later this year to Macau. With the European title in his pocket, the English driver and team boss was accompanied by one of his usual riders, German Hans Heyer. The guide race was a BMW fiefdom and the controversial English wanted to put an end to the Bavarian domain in the race. To this end, it had the precious support of JPS, which was relaunching the brand, decorating its cars with the famous black and gold colors that would later be eternalized in Ayrton Senna's Lotus. At the time, the guide race took place three weeks before 1000 km from Bathurst, another important race on the worldwide calendar of tourist racing, and so TWR made a "two in one."
The 100 -mile race on the streets of Macau would not have much history, such as the cars built in the Kidlington workshops against the competition headed by the two BMW 635i Schnitzer officers, guided by Hans Stuck and Dieter Quester, and painted by rival Marlboro. Tom Walkinshaw ended first and Hans Heyer and m second.
At the end of the race, quoted by the Portuguese newspaper Autosport, Tom Walkinshaw said: “The circuit is fantastic. Tight, but with many curves, climbs and descents, which made the race become difficult. But I like difficult things and, for me, the race was great from beginning to end.
The Jaguar were again invited by the Macao Grand Prix committee to run in 1985, but Tom Walkinshaw had other plans for his cars. Fortunately, thanks to Richard Meins we will continue to see this beautiful car on the tracks.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>MOTOR EMBALISM | Project for new track in Zhuhai emerges</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/30/automobilismo-surge-projecto-para-nova-pista-em-zhuhai/</link><description>With a very black cloud to turn to the future of the Zhuhai International Circuit, there is a potential good news for the great bay of motoring: a project for a new permanent circuit in the Chinese city adjacent to the MSAR.
According to Hong Kong's Ta Kung Pao newspaper, Guangdong's provincial government recently published the document “Measures to promote high quality tourism and accelerate the construction of a strong tourist province”, which proposes, for the first time, the creation of an “industrial circle of culture and tourism of the Great Bay”, offering political support to the integrated development of culture and tourism in the region. With this, the first industrial and tourist complex of motorized sports in the Great Bay may emerge.
The project of the Zhuhai Chaoyue international circuit was recently presented at the Zhuhai Ocean Spring Resort, located in Doumen, not far from the city's airport, with an initial investment of 250 million Renminbis.
According to the first information, the project of this circuit provides for welcoming evidence such as Formula 3 and foster collaborative development between motorized sports sectors, cultural events and exhibition industry. The plan includes the holding of several international tests per year and foresees collaboration with Hong Kong and Macau to connect cities such as Jiangmen and Zhongshan, promoting “Multiple stops” and boosting the innovative development of “Event Economics + Cultural Tourism”.
According to Zhou Jian, China Travel Service (Zhuhai) Executive Director General Ocean Spring Resort Co., the FIA grade certification-will also include a karting track, drift track and an interior space of 2,400 m² for exhibitions and events related to the automobile sector. With more than 50 international events projected annually, the goal is to become a "super IP" that joins running, leisure and tourism under the same concept.
The first phase of the Zhuhai Chaoyue International Circuit project will include international certification professionals, as well as support facilities. This project aims not only to fill “a gap in the high -end motorized sports sector in Zhuhai, but will also promote the modernization of the Great Bay's cultural, sports and tourist industries by conducting international racing and themed cultural events linked to motorsport.”
Uncertainties in the air
Last summer, the company Malay LBS Bina Group BHD announced that it sold its participation in the Zhuhai International Circuit (ZIC) - the first permanent circuit built in the interior of China - by 124.7 million ringits (about 214.15 million patacas). In a statement to Bursa Malaysia Securities BHD, the group reported that their subsidiary, Dragon Hill Corporation Ltd, sold all his participation in Lamdeal Investments Ltd (Lil) to Huafa Urban Operation (HK) Ltd, a well -known real estate operator. Lil Detinha 60 percent of Zhuhai International Circuit Limited (ZICL), circuit operator.
Raised in 1996 in order to receive the first major award from China from Formula 1 - something that never materialized - ZIC was still the initial motor of motoring in the country and a reference in Asian motorsport. Since its opening, it has welcomed several international evidence, such as the FIA GT, A1 GP or the Intercontinental Le Mans Series. In recent years, track administration has chosen to organize its own events, abdicating the most costly international evidence.
Despite having received, in the past, auto competitions from MSAR, ZIC has been losing protagonism in local motorized sport, due to high prices, limited availability and reducing sports activity in favor of the most profitable commercial activities. The future of the circuit remains uncertain: it is only known that lease agreements between resident teams and the circuit have been frozen and are not being renewed. The track approval will also be about to expire, requiring a new certification to continue to receive competitions in the future.
However, on the weekend of June 14 and 15, the still only circuit of Zhuhai will host the third race of the Formula 4 China Championship season.</description><pubDate>2025-05-30 01:53:33</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
