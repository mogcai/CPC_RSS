Duterte boarded Manila International Airport with three others around 9:00 pm, Martin Delgra told reporters, according to the French agency AFP. “We cannot approach the plane. The plane is still on the track with the door open, ”he added at the time.
It is unknown whether the plane has already taken off from Manila to Hague, headquarters of the TPI, in the Netherlands. The Supreme Court of the Philippines had announced hours before it would examine a petition presented by Duterte's lawyer to suspend the arrest of the former president.
Duterte, 79, was arrested today by the Philippine Police upon arriving Manila from Hong Kong under a TPI term, who accused him of crimes against humanity. The alleged crimes will have been committed during the Duterte Administration Anti-Drug War (2016-2022), which victimized about 6,000 people, police said.
Several non-governmental organizations state that the number of victims will be 30,000 killed in anti-drug operations and extrajudicial executions.
The UN Human Rights Office concluded, in a report published in 2020, that there was evidence of widespread and systematic human rights violations, such as extrajudicial executions and arbitrary arrests.
Following Duterte's detention, families from victims of extrajudicial executions during the Anti -Drug War participated in a Thazon City Thanks Mass in the Manila Metropolitan Region.
"This is a Thanksgiving Mass for a huge surprise, a historic surprise, Duterte was arrested and his arrest warrant was fulfilled," Father Bong Sarabia told journalists, quoted by Filipina PNA. “It is possible that the case in the international criminal court proceed now. This is the year of Jubilee, Freedom and Justice, especially for families who survived, ”he added.
Some of the family members said Duterte's detention does not replace pain with those who were killed. “At least, [Duterte] was only arrested. Our loved ones were killed at the scene, ”said Amy Jane Lee, whose husband, Michael, was killed in a drug -related shooting in 2017.</description><pubDate>2025-03-12 04:19:06</pubDate></item><item><title>Air Links | Cheung Kin Chung calls for innovation to the government</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/12/ligacoes-aereas-cheung-kin-chung-pede-inovacao-ao-governo/</link><description>The deputy and president of the Macao Hoteleiros Association, Cheung Kin Chung, considers that the government should adopt a more innovative stance, in order to expand the number and type of international aerials with Macau.

According to Cheung Kin Chung's statements, authorities should adopt a more multifaceted stance on efforts to attract international tourists with greater purchasing power to promote “sustained tourism development”.
The president of the Macao Hotelers Association states that the efforts of the Tourism Services Directorate (STD) to participate in events in Spain, United Arab Emirates, Japan or South Korea are positive. However, they are not enough, and for Cheung the promotion of Macau as a tourist destination without creating better international calls will always have a limited impact.
At the level of calls, Cheung also asks authorities that they are not limited to short -term connections with surrounding countries and regions, but bet on bringing tourists from other more distant markets, but with great consumption capacity.
At the same time, the associative leader requested greater coordination between the government, game concessionaires, companies and aviation companies in this effort of greater internationalization in the market.

Health services (SS) appealed to all macao inhabitants vaccinated “before traveling to areas where measles is endemic” in the United States of America, according to a statement released Monday night.
"Recently, there have been a lot of measles outbreaks in the United States and countries such as Philippines and Vietnam are also being affected by the low measles vaccination rate, resulting in cases," the SS said.
Residents who were born from 1970 are pointed out as a priority group for vaccination, free through marking at public health centers. This is because, although the measles vaccine was introduced by the then Portuguese administration in Macau in the late 1960s, the vaccination rate remained low until the early 1980s.
According to the latest report by the US Disease Control and Prevention Centers (CDC) in the United States, the country has already recorded almost 230 measles during the current outbreak.
The overwhelming majority of cases (94 percent) reached unvaccinated people or who did not complete vaccination and 80 percent of patients are children or adolescents, the CDC revealed on Friday. A school -age child died in late January in a region of the west of the state of Texas where 159 measles have been identified.
Invisible enemy
The SS warns that the measles are “a highly contagious disease that can be transmitted through the air, droplets or direct contact with nasopharyngeal secretions of an infected person. The incubation period is usually 7 to 18 days, but it can reach 21 days. ” The entity led by Alvis Lo adds that the measles is contagious four days before and after the appearance of skin eruptions, and has as “high fever symptoms (greater than 38 °), spots on the oral mucosa, systemic maculopapular eruption, conjunctivitis, cough and nasal discharge”.
Once infected, children may develop complications such as otitis media, encephalitis and pneumonia. In severe cases, it may lead to hearing impairment, intellectual deficiency and even death.
The vaccine against measles, bread and rubella is safe and highly effective in preventing severe infections and cases. The first dose is recommended for children from 12 to 15 months, and the second for children from 4 to 6 years old.

With the start of a new phase of the Grand Prix of Consumption scheduled for March 24, Deputy Ngan Iek Hang appealed to the government to solve the problems of the previous two editions, and facilitate the attribution of discounts. The big consumption award is a discount coupon distribution event, for residents who consume local commerce, and seeks to respond to consumer escape to the interior.
“We want the government to dynamically adjust the great award for consumption. For example, we have received opinions from some residents that there is better more flexibility in the discount coupons and periods in which they can be used, ”said Ngan Iek Hang, who participated in a lecture on the center of collective wisdom policy, subordinate to the residents' association.
In the previous way, residents needed to consume Monday to Friday to qualify to receive discount coupons, which had to be spent on the next weekend. If this were not the case, the discounts were valid. This format is considered problematic: “Residents explained to us that they need to work from Monday to Friday, or that they have to work by shifts [which prevents consumption on the days indicated],” said the deputy. "The period of qualification to participate in the discount coupons draws has to be broader and more flexible," he said.
Praxe compliments
Despite pointing out the need to improve the local commerce support program, Ngan Iek Hang pointed out that the initiative deserves to be praised as it also allows you to support the elderly and the most disadvantaged groups.
In addition, Ngan Iek Hang cited merchants from Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) of community neighborhoods who have confessed to lack of liquidity and difficulties to survive in the current economic context when they have to face loans during the pandemic.
Given this subject, NGAN asks for the temporal extension of the aid in force: "We hope that the government will extend the measures that help the SMEs, such as interest without interest and the credit guarantee plan," he said.
The residents' deputy also suggested to the government to do a study on consumption in the different community neighborhoods of Macao, based on data collected through the means of electronic payments, and that based on these data adjust companies support policies.
On the other hand, Ngan Iek Hang considered that SMEs have to review their operational strategies and diversify products according to the trend of residents and tourists.
The deputy also recalled that in recent years, the government has launched positive measures to digitize the SMEs.</description><pubDate>2025-03-12 03:45:32</pubDate></item><item><title>Macau Pass | Elderly guest to sign candidacy when exchanging card</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/12/macau-pass-idosa-convidada-a-assinar-candidatura-quando-trocava-cartao/</link><description>One resident claimed that his grandmother was invited to sign a filed report for legislative elections while trying to change the Macau Pass card to the elderly for the great consumption award. The deadline for presenting the application commissions ends on June 6
 
“My grandmother wanted to change the Macau Pass card to the elderly and went to some associations. When dealing with the process to change the card, the association's employee asked my grandmother if he could sign a proposal bulletin for the elections. ” The allegation of electoral use of the replacement processes of the “Macau Pass card for the elderly” was yesterday reported by a listener of the “Macao Forum” program of the Chinese channel of Radio Macau.
The listener, nicknamed Wong, described in a nutshell the state of confusion in which she was her grandmother after asked to sign the bulletin during the exchange process. “My grandmother was confused and bothered by the situation. She just wanted to replace Macau Pass, without getting involved in electoral matters and was thinking that the card exchange could be related to the signature of the newsletter, ”he said.
The resident was also incredulous in the face of how the card replacement process is processed. “When I saw the presentation of the program, I noticed that the replacement of the cards is coorganized by the Institute of Social Action. I do not realize why the Institute of Social Action does not directly deal with the replacement of the cards, just as it receives requests and documents for the assignment of subsidies, ”said the listener.
Process in course
Until March 20, 60 posts for the free replacement of the “Macau Pass Card for the Elderly” are open throughout the territory, between social service institutions and civic associations.
Change of cards is required for residents over 65 who have old versions of Macau Pass for the elderly, as these cards have a chip that cannot be supported to get immediate discount of the great consumption award. It is recalled that the measure starts on March 24 and, for the first time, offers the mode of use of Macau Pass so as not to exclude from the elderly program that do not know how to use online payment platforms.
On the other hand, the Electoral Affairs Commission of the Legislative Assembly began last week to make available the forms to build candidates. The deadline for applications, with the signatures required by law, ends on June 6. The elections are scheduled for September 14.
HM has sent questions to the Electoral Affairs Committee of the Legislative Assembly and the public entities that organize the exchange of cards and the major consumption award (Institute of Social Action and Directing of Economics and Technological Development Services) to ask if there would be any case in an investigation related to electoral actions during the exchange of Macau Pass. Until the closing of this edition, no answers were obtained.</description><pubDate>2025-03-12 03:41:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Homes of Elderly | Lo Choi in defends incentives for private</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/12/lares-de-idosos-lo-choi-in-defende-incentivos-para-privados/</link><description>The deputy linked to the community of Jiangmen warns of the lack of beds in the elderly homes in Macao. Faced with population aging, Lo Choi In defends the incentive to develop alternatives to public resources
 
Given the aging of the population of Macao, Lo Choi in alerted to the lack of beds in elderly homes and defends the promotion of the private sector. The subject was addressed in a interpeação written by the deputy linked to the community of Jiangmen.
According to the accounts presented in the interpellation, there are currently 2,510 beds in elderly homes, a number that has not increased since 2021, a circumstance which the deputy explained with the pandemic. By 2028, it is expected that the number of beds will increase up to 3,600, which is due to the opening of new homes in zone A of new landfills.
However, the numbers are insufficient in the optics of Lo Choi In, not only due to the expected aging of the population, but because it cites reports from experts to indicate that the minimum acceptable number would be 4 beds in homes of elderly per 1,000 inhabitants. In Macao, the average number is 3.4 beds per 1,000 inhabitants.
The deputy also points out that despite the official information about these numbers not always being the most transparent, the data provided by the Executive allows you to determine that by 2028 there will be a deficit of 400 beds. In the ideal scenario, it indicates that by 2026 there should be 5,200 beds in elderly homes, based on the recommendations of the Economic Cooperation and Development Organization (OECD) and the World Health Organization (WHO). However, this bar will not be realized.
More Private Market
Given this situation, Lo Choi in asks the government to invest more resources in the availability of beds, but also to promote the development of the private sector, with the distribution of land reserve land and the implementation of the support policy.
"In recent years, in many countries and neighboring regions, the private care market for the elderly has been developing vigorously, which not only satisfies the needs of the community and reduces the government's burdens, but also creates a large number of jobs," he says. The deputy adds that "in Macao, demand is also increasing and, even if the government is willing to invest public resources, it is still difficult to satisfy the demand." “Is the government considering releasing more public land and creating political incentives for the development of private homes?” He asks. Lo Choi also asked if the government equates the role of the private market in response to the needs of the community within the policy for the elderly.
In addition to land, Lo Choi in admits that it is difficult to attract workers to this sector, because most professions are not considered attractive to residents. The legislature thus wants to know if there may be a flexibility of hiring non-residents.</description><pubDate>2025-03-12 03:38:06</pubDate></item><item><title>Clinical Psychology | The benefits and risks of the introduction of AI</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/12/psicologia-clinica-os-beneficios-e-riscos-da-introducao-da-ia/</link><description>Artificial intelligence is there to stay and its use in the field of psychology begins to be spoken. Recently, Deputy Lam Lon Wai defended its use and, in Portugal, the Order of Psychologists created the “PSIA” platform, which allows it to detect symptoms. Nuno Gomes and Goreti Lima, two resident therapists, talk about the benefits, risks and potential uses of technology
 
Understanding whether emotions can result in psychological forum diseases is something that is already possible to do using Artificial Intelligence (AI). The issue begins to discuss in Macao still shyly, namely through Deputy Lam Lon Wai, who in February interpelled the government about the need to apply AI tools in clinical cases with young people.
HM spoke to two clinical psychologists who work with residents of Macao, in person or distance, about the benefits and risks of betting on AI. Nuno Gomes, a psychologist in a local clinic, says that “is, for now, a help, and it will always be”.
“AI is an irreversible process and it is inevitable that it covers all fields of our lives, and in them is psychology and help people. But I come from a field of psychology that is the humanist school, which is based on the relationship with the patient, and therefore I do not see great benefits, for the use of AI, because in human relations AI does not enter, ”he defended.
Nuno Gomes believes that AI can help in the diagnostic phase, although he thinks "the psychologist will always be the central character." “AI can be an advantage in Macau for people who have difficulty asking for help. The use of the well -defined AI, even in ethical terms, may be very useful for the beginning of a therapy. However, at this moment we have no conditions for the use of AI at the level of a more complete and background therapy, ”he said.
Nuno Gomes also recalls that for those who want to talk to someone, AI "can give the feeling that we are not alone and that is someone on the other side." It is a feeling that is still "strange", but "in the future will no longer be, because AI will be part of our days."
The psychologist believes that AI "may work as long as it is ethically well regulated and can help in brief therapies, but always as a complement to a larger process."
Goreti Lima, who has lived in Macao, continues to do clinical psychology at a distance with residents living in the territory. It is more skeptical in relation to the use of AI, arguing that human relationship is always fundamental for quality monitoring.
“Therapy is done in the relationship and these applications do not contemplate this. I think very well that we can use AI to diagnose, see symptoms, but this we can also do with a book or article. ChatgPT already tells us some things in the area of ​​psychology, possible symptom analysis. AI helps in this process, but then the rest works in the therapeutic relationship. This is why people like more from one psychologist or another. Then there is the ethical question, the data is stored as? Where do you go? Can people trust? ”He asks.
Recommendations in Portugal
In a written interpeação directed to the Government of MSAR, Deputy Lam Lon Wai questioned whether there will be “cooperation” between government departments, technological companies and local academic institutions in the use of AI in the area of ​​mental health. However, Goreti Lam regrets that deputy "do not speak in the figure of the psychologist."
“Academics have a different experience from psychologists and therapists, who have gained this experience in practical terms. This develops over time. All these questions have to be thought of when applying AI. AI can identify what the person has and even techniques to be used, but then we have to take into account deontological conditions. The assessment always has nuances depending on the social context of the person, and this is never analyzed in AI, or is unquestionable, ”he added.
Portugal is one of the countries where the application of AI in Psychology begins to gain some form, to the point of the Order of Portuguese Psychologists (OPP) has created the online “Psia” tool, which allows you to state a series of symptoms and reach a diagnosis. Personal data appear to be protected with the introduction, on the website, the citizen card number, with the digital mobile key.
In addition, OPP has created a manual of good practices, entitled “The Human Factor in Artificial Intelligence - Strategic Recommendations for Sustainability”, which states that there are “virtual therapists who can identify, in communication with people, emotional difficulties that facilitate deliberate psychological education”, as well as enhancing “the learning of techniques and skills that aim, for example, to reduce anxiety”.
In addition, the OPP document concludes that "some studies suggest that these chatbots, developed based on validated therapeutic models, may be effective in reducing depressive symptoms and even that some people establish a bond similar to that of a human relationship." However, “these evidence is not consolidated and security-related (people and data), eventual dependence on technologies and the responsiveness of support given to different psychological difficulties are not clarified”, it reads.
Regarding PSIA, it is referred to the OPP website that "on very specific or complex issues should not be used in tasks that require specialized judgment and evaluation, deep technical analysis or professional counseling." It is also clarified that the answers provided are based on “available documents and information” until July 31 last year, and PSIA “does not replace the role of a psychologist or any supervision activities”.
In the case of Hong Kong, some solutions are also beginning to emerge, which motivated, by the way, the interpellation of Deputy Lam Lon Wai. This is the case of Hollo, a mobile phone application developed in connection with the University of Hong Kong (UHK) that aims to “make mental health care more accessible to patients, service platforms and organizations”.
Hollo uses AI power and technologies to bring clinical practices standardized to another level of productivity, intelligence and digital connectivity. According to Cameron Van Breda, Hollo's CEO and co-founder, the company aims to be "an easily accessible tool in stress times, offering analysis and friendship suggestions for better mental health exercises." In practical terms, “focuses on young people from 12 to 24 years old, works in English and Chinese and introduce them to therapy and counseling practices through mindfulness activities and daily games,” reads UHK's website.
Almost the same
Asked about Macao's mental health landscape, Nuno Gomes understands that he persists "some conservatism and ignorance not only in what is AI and areas where one can apply, but also what psychology can do."
“Psychology is here to help people and in the context of Macao there is no such understanding yet. This stigma prevents many people from seeking help and AI can give this support. However, the older population is still very unaware of the operation of AI, but the younger ones will increasingly resort to this type of platforms, ”he said.
In general terms, “the picture of mental health has changed little from the pandemic”, because “in general, people are not necessary to express emotions and since they are encouraged to keep emotions, which when they are bad and stored a long time, they begin to hurt. People don't know how to express them out of shame or guilt. ” Goreti Lima also understands that in the area of ​​mental health there is still some ignorance in Macau.</description><pubDate>2025-03-12 03:36:41</pubDate></item><item><title>Former Filipino President detained boarded a plane to The Hague, confirms a lawyer</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/12/ex-presidente-filipino-detido-embarcou-num-aviao-para-haia-confirma-advogado/</link><description>Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, detained under a warrant of the International Criminal Court (ICC) for alleged crimes against humanity, embarked on Tuesday on a plane to Hague, his lawyer said.

Also highlight for another theatrical production in Patuá dos Doci Papiaem di Macau, with “ass reindeer?”, Which looks at the uniqueness of the territory
 
The show “Bate Fado”, by the Portuguese duo of choreographers Jonas &amp; Lander, is one of the highlights of the 35th edition of the Macao Arts Festival (FAM), which starts in late April, was announced yesterday.
The president of the Macao Cultural Institute (ICM) justified the invitation to the duo Jonas Lopes and Lander Patrick with the desire to “include activities or groups with special characteristics”. "We know Fado and have promoted fado shows," said Leong Wai Man at a press conference.
The leader recalled the nights of fado with Portuguese singers, held at the D. Pedro V Theater, in the first half of 2024, as well as the collaboration between fadista Mariza and the Chinese orchestra of Macao, in the last edition of the region's International Music Festival.
“We hope it is new, since it is not just fado, it is a body performance that fuses singing and dance,” said Leong. During the presentation of the FAM program, the ICM said that "Bate Fado", scheduled for May 17, "combines the emotional music with the tap dancing, evoking old Tabernas from Lisbon."
In a video shown during the performance, the duo Jonas &amp; Lander said the show “rescues the extinct dances of fado” and stressed that it will still guide a dancer workshop and another for families with children between 8 and 12 years.
“Bate Fado” will also be part of an outdoor show, free admission, on May 16, 17 and 18, in the Iao Hon market garden, whose program also includes the Casa de Portugal Association in Macao.
In 2023, Jonas Lopes told Lusa that “hits fado” intends to recover the nineteenth -century tradition of the beaten fado, which rhythmicly consisted of following the fadist melody compass, beating one foot or both at the same time, possibly with a choreography.
With a budget of 23.4 million patacas, six percent less than in 2024, FAM will present, between April 25 and May 31, 15 shows and 33 opera, dance, music and theatrical arts, in a program that includes seven local groups.
On May 24th the small auditorium of the Macau Cultural Center receives “the shaman's beat”, from the Tago group and Kook's direction and choreography. It is a show with the “fresh and young breeze of the traditional rhythms” of South Korea, which moves away from pop music. “The shaman's beat is a masterful demonstration of precision and movement, a representation of old rituals with an appealing contemporary touch,” reads the program.
On May 17th and 18th, “Kiki, the Apprentice of Witch-The Musical”, with dramaturgy by Kouki Kishimoto. This musical debuted in 2017 and since then it has taken the stage more than 70 times in Japan, having "a young and energetic cast." This is the “first outside tour” of the group, described in the poster.
More Patuá
As is tradition, the Dóci Papiaçá di Macao, end the festival with the play “Cuza Tá Rena?” (What is going on?), In Patuá. The theater in this Creole of Portuguese origin has been part of the list of Chinese National Intangible Cultural Heritage since 2021, underlined Leong Wai Man.
On the sidelines of the presentation, the Dóci stagnant Papyam, Miguel Senna Fernandes, said the play, with a center of explanations as a background, will be "a call of attention" to the importance of "maintaining the origin characteristics of Macao."
The director recalled that during a passage in the region in December, Chinese President Xi Jinping stressed that Macau is “the only place in the world that has Portuguese and Chinese officials” and argued that the city has to enjoy “its uniqueness”.
In a speech during the inauguration of the new local government, Xi said that Macau has the "unique advantage of being the mix of different cultures", but warned that the territory needs "a more tolerant attitude, more open."
In the last FAM, the Dóci Papiam were caught by surprise when, for the first time, local authorities asked the script of the piece before this debut, giving as justification the need to make the age classification of the show.
Leong Wai Man assured that this is "essentially the reason" why the script of all the shows presented to the public to Macao is evaluated by a commission, to "know if it can be seen by kids and big ones."</description><pubDate>2025-03-12 04:00:25</pubDate></item><item><title>Ukraine | China expects “just and lasting solution” for the war</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/12/ucrania-china-espera-solucao-justa-e-duradoura-para-a-guerra/</link><description>China said yesterday expects to be found a “fair and lasting solution” for the war between Ukraine and Russia, before negotiations between US and Ukrainian authorities in Saudi Arabia.
"We hope the parties will reach a fair and lasting solution that will be acceptable to everyone," said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning at a press conference in Beijing.
"China supports all efforts that contribute to a peaceful resolution of the crisis," the spokesman continued when asked about the conversations. "China is also ready to continue to work with the international community to play a constructive role in the political resolution of the crisis," he added.
Beijing presents itself as a neutral part in the war, claiming not to send lethal help to either side, unlike the United States and other Western countries. But China is a political and economic ally of Russia and NATO members have described the Asian country as a “decisive facilitator” of the war, which has never condemned.
Conversations in Saudi Arabia will be the most important since the reception of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the White House last month.</description><pubDate>2025-03-12 04:06:45</pubDate></item><item><title>Rua do Almirante Sérgio | Residents concerned with works</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/11/rua-do-almirante-sergio-residentes-preocupados-com-obras/</link><description>Yesterday the works of repairing and repairing the drainage system in Rua do Almirante Sérgio. The hope of the residents is that they come quickly to the end and have little impact on the area.
The area in the interior port is one of the busiest arteries of the city, and the works aim to “improve the drainage network and the road floor”.
However, a nickname resident Chio regretted that the areas in Rua do Almirante Sérgio and Rua da Praia do Manduco are always under construction, without any rest for residents. Speaking to Radio Macau's Chinese channel, Chio also stated that the works are more annoying for residents and drivers, so the hope is that the problems will be solved quickly and that there are few congestion.
Another resident of the nickname Law, also proved bothered by the work, and called on to the authorities to begin to coordinate the work, so that they are not always doing works in the same sections.
Already the president of the neighborhood assistance association, covering Rua da Manduco Beach, Cheong Lai Chan, was more restrained in the comments, but did not fail to ask the authorities to be careful and do everything to avoid traffic jams at the end hours. Therefore, the official expects the authorities to coordinate for the work to be completed as soon as possible.</description><pubDate>2025-03-11 00:52:27</pubDate></item><item><title>Today Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/autor/hoje-macau/</link><description>Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, detained under a warrant of the International Criminal Court (ICC) for alleged crimes against humanity, embarked on Tuesday on a plane to Hague, his lawyer said.

Several non-governmental organizations state that the number of victims will be 30,000 killed in anti-drug operations and extrajudicial executions.
The UN Human Rights Office concluded, in a report published in 2020, that there was evidence of generalized and systematic human rights violations, such as extrajudicial executions and arbitrary arrests.

Looking at the bank, he noticed in a large tree that rose from a temple and soon wished to use it to replace the broken mast. As he approached, however, the abbot of the monastery advised him that, before he did, he consulted the spirit of the temple by removing a tray of guessing. As he removed it, he read: "Everything under heaven has a master,/ an honorable man takes nothing to himself. Soon gave up on the intention.
The story illustrates the character of the future monarch that, being an orphan still very young, was welcomed in a Buddhist monastery as a novice monk, realizing the value of chance that since then has worked to peer. In the choice of his counselors, obeying this concern, themselves were committed to planning the following steps.
Among them was Liu Ji (1311-1375) also known as Liu Bowen, the 'Sincere Old' Military Stratega, statesman and poet, to whom works that responded to this desire to predict the succession of the days, such as the book of prophecy Shaobing Gene Quan Wen, 'The Full Song of the Shabing Ball, or the' Master's Philosophical Treaty ' From the brilliant trigram Li, the Fire », to clarify the world and the decision makers.
Among its short chapters is the edifying account of a Qin builder, the musical instrument of the literati, which was presented at the court was refused because it did not have the prestige of being ancient. Then he added some risks, buried him for a while and again introduced him, being very well received. In contrast, the imperial counselor sought to clarify in the truth. As on a trip he made, in the fall of 1343, with a companion for the Huangshan mountain range, the yellow mountain.
Leng Qian (c.1310-c.1371), this friend who was also scholarly in the arts and musical instruments, accompanied him in a way to an elevation, which from the time of Emperor Jiajing (r.1521-67) was designated Qiyun, 'tall as the clouds', being part of the way by sea, packed in the rhythm of the waves. This rhythm that Leng Qian, versed in the secrets of alchemy, sought to convey in the Painting Monte Baiyue (vertical roll, ink on paper, 84.4 x 41.4 cm, at the National Palace Museum in Taipei) who made Liu Ji's request to memorize the journey.
From the bank of the Hengjiang River, he made a painting free of options for styles or schools, taking advantage of chance, as Emperor Hongwu wanted.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>ANA CRISTINA ALVES</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/autor/ana-cristina-alves/</link><description>Ana Cristina Alves - Coordinator of the CCCM Educational Service
Zhuangzi, the Taoist philosopher, who will have lived between the fourth and 3rd century BC, possibly between 369 and 268 BC, left us in the homonymous work 《莊 (庄) 子》, as was customary at the time, the possibly transmitted teachings in the first person in the interior chapters (1-7), in the second person in the external chapters (8-21) and in the third person of other intellectuals in the chapters of miscellany (22-33).
It is an extremely motivating philosophy that rests, from my point of view, in three fundamental principles: the acceptance of spontaneous nature (道 giving); The Principle of Transformation (物化 Wùhuà), which leads to the postulate of an essential uniformity; and the non-acting (無為/无为 wuwéi), which presupposes the acceptance of a pre-established harmony and destination. We are facing the best order possible, so it is not right to interfere with what is given to us, letting us lead by a necessarily tension rhythm of life, but whose challenges should be viewed without negative reactions, following the existential bamboo model, when confronted with gigantic winds, such as those of tuffons in China.
Chapters 17 and 18, which now bring themselves allegedly belong to their closest disciples, who faithfully transmit the philosophy of the great Taoist master, and Taoism is the most devoted philosophy to develop a personal project, which will therefore exemplary from the existential point of view.
Completing Chapter XVII, that of the Full Full (Qiū Shuǐ Dìshiqī), is assisted at a symbolic dialogue between the philosopher Zhuangzi and his great friend Huizi (惠子), known in the synological tradition, of which Father Thomas Merton is a good herald in The Via de Zhuangzi (1999, 126-127) Joy of fish ”, whose guideline principle is that of communicating connectivity among all living beings, the same that guides another episode, reported at the end of Chapter II, that of the philosopher dreams of being a butterfly (Zhuangzi, 1999,38-40).
In Chapter XVII, Zhuangzi affects the unbelieving friend Huizi to realize, or rather perfectly intuit the joy of fish, since when looking at them on the Hao River bridge recognizes the signs that in themselves manifest when they feel happy. Friend Huizi, following a rationalizing and separatist philosophy, opposes that this is impossible, being silenced by the logical assumption of communication between all nature. Zhuangzi appeals to the argument that it is possible to extend the intelligent dialogue of humans to all living beings. The philosopher, winning the debate, widened the mastery of language, which now includes the verbal, but also the visual, much closer to silent and intuitive communication, highly valued by the Taoist school, always suspicious of excessive and discursive profanity. And at the same time, guarantees the primacy of the connection, sometimes visible, sometimes invisible, among all nature, rooted in Tao, after all this viable connection of a flow of feelings among all beings, which leads to true joy, against the sad and solipsist cosmos defended in some rationalist philosophical traditions, whose primacy is based on a reason to establish the connection with the body, whether individual or whether it is individual or Collective, as António Damásio had the opportunity to denounce in the error of Descartes (2011).
In fact, what matters so that joy is guaranteed, including humans, goes through a widening of the sphere of sensitivity, the feeling of oneself, still thinking of Damásio, the feeling of others, the recognition of the satisfaction coming from the profound connection between all nature.
Then move on to the translation of dialogue, the traditional Chinese to the contemporary and the contemporary to Portuguese:
原文 Classic Chinese1
莊子與惠子遊於濠梁之上。莊子曰： “鯈魚 2 出遊從容 ， 是魚之樂也。”
惠子曰： “子非魚 ， 安知魚之樂？”
莊子曰： “子非我 ， 安知我不知魚之樂？”
惠子曰： “我非子 ， 固不知子矣；子固非魚也 ， 子之不知魚之樂 ， 全矣。”
莊子曰： “請循其本。子曰‘ 汝安知魚樂 ’雲者 ， 既已知吾知之而問我 ， 我知之濠上也。”
今译 Contemporary Chinese
庄子和惠子在濠水桥上游玩。庄子说： “白鲦鱼从容不迫地游来游去 ， 这是鱼的快乐啊！”
惠子说： “您不是鱼 ， 怎么知道鱼是快乐的？”
庄子说： “您不是我 ， 怎么知道我不晓得鱼的快乐？”
惠子说： “我不是您 ， 固然不知道您；您本来也不知道鱼 ， 那么您不知道鱼的快乐 ， 是完全可以肯定的了。“
庄子说： “请回到原来的话题吧。您说‘ 您怎么知道鱼的快乐 ’这句话 ， 就是您已知道我晓得鱼的快乐而来问我的 ， —— 我是在濠水桥上知道的啊！”
(ZHUANGZI, 1999, 282-3)
Note that the translation I propose to Portuguese has some adaptation to our language, for example, I use conjunctions and conjunctive phrases to join prayers and avoid the repetition of certain verbs, with non-philosophical sense, to make reading more fluid:
Zhuangzi and Huizi were strolling on the Hao River bridge, when Zhuangzi said, "The fish swim calmly and carelessly from side to side, this is your joy!"
Huizi replied, "If it's not fish, how can you know the joy of fish?"
Zhuangzi replied, "You're not me, how can you know that I don't know about the joy of fish?"
Huizi continued: “I am not my friend, which is why I do not know him, and the Lord does not know the fish either, so it is more than certain that they do not know their joy.”
Zhuangzi concluded: “Let's go back to the root of the question. He said the following prayer: 'How can you know the joy of the fish', so you already realized that I knew their joy, so I asked me about me, I met her on the Hao River bridge! ”
This spontaneous and natural connection to all that exists is a source of great joy and happiness, as explained to us in chapter XVIII, entitled “Perfect Happiness”. Here the principle of non-acting (無為/无为 wúwéi) is defended, rather, of agreement with nature, inner and exterior, without seeking to interfere with the world around us, because if the goal is to achieve happiness, it is not acquired by any of our actions that have in view of material or social values, as well as wealth, honors, abundance or even health; We arrived at this world without being consulted and will leave when it is our time, as well illustrated the episode of the death of Zhuangzi's wife, reported in this same chapter. When Huizi visits his friend to introduce him to his condolences, he finds him crouching to drum into a basin and singing, in a clear acceptance of fate: yes, the woman had made her very good company over decades, she had to accept the law of nature and not revolt against the pre-established order, which tells us there is health and illness, wealth and poverty, life and death in an eternal transformation cycle.  "Genuine happiness is derived from the absence of happiness, just as perfect fame derives from the absence of fame." (至樂無樂 ， 至譽無譽, in the contemporary version of simplified Chinese, 最大的快乐在于 ‘无乐 '最高的荣誉在于‘ 无誉 ’(Zhuangzi, 1999, 286).
By non-acting, or rather, as we do not follow the existential models of the light/clairvoyant sky and the quiet earth, thus achieving perfect happiness and immense joy in living:
原文 Classic Chinese
天下是非果未可定也。雖然 ， 無為可以定是非。至樂活身 ， 惟無為幾存。請嘗試言之。天無為以之清 ， 地無為以之寧 ， 故兩無為相合 故兩無為相合 萬物皆化生。芒乎芴乎 無從出乎？芴乎芒乎 ， 而無有象乎！萬物職職 ， 皆從無為殖。故曰天地無為也而無不為也
今译 Contemporary Chinese
天下的是非确实还难以下定论。尽管如此 ， “无为” 可以定是非。最大的快乐能存活身心 ， 而只有清静无为才几乎可以存活身心。请让我说说试试看：天 “无为” ， 因而清虚; 地 “无为” ， 因而宁静 ， 天与地这两个无为的合一 ， 才孕育出万物的存在。恍恍惚惚 才孕育出万物的存在。恍恍惚惚 ， 不知道它们从哪里生出来！恍恍惚惚找不出一点迹象来！万物繁多 “天地无心作为 ， 却没有一样东西不是从它们之中产生出来的。”
(ZHUANGZI, 1999, 286)
Translation proposal for Portuguese
It is very difficult to distinguish right from wrong in our world, even though it “not acting” can do so, which is the greatest happiness. Allow me to say it, the sky is clairvoyant because of its "not acting"; The earth is quiet because of its "not acting." Not acting conjugates from heaven and earth leads to pregnancy and existence of all that lives indistinctly, without realizing where they came from! Indistinctly, without traces, the myriads of beings arise, all created from a vital non-report. That is why it is said that, "Heaven and Earth create unintentionally, but nothing is generated."
And it is added in conclusion that it does not interfere with the heaven of the earth with the natural order of the "ten thousand beings" brings great joy and even supreme happiness following what is defended by the founder of Taoism, in chapter VII of the book of the road and virtue 《道德经 • 七》 3, in the translation of António Graça de Abreu (2013):
天長地久
天地所以能長且久者
以其不自生
故能長生
(……)
Eternal, heaven and earth.
Why eternal?
Do not exist for themselves,
So they remain forever.

Chengdu's natural architect was chosen by the work “coherent”, in peace with nature and the surrounding world. The organization of the prize highlights the “path that was neither linear nor expected”, and architectural projects with “convincing answers” ​​in environmental terms
 
In Liu Jiakun's work is the citizen who rules, without fixed lines or barriers, combining the old and the modern. But above all, there is a kind of consistency. The Chinese architect, born in 1956 in Chengdu province, won this year's Pritzker Prize, a distinction often described as the Nobel Prize in Architecture. With this week's announcement, the point that was missing to consecrate the talent of a man who lived and worked in a changing China was added and who narrowly did not give up architecture. By the way, according to the official information of the Pritzker Award on Liu Jiakun, his journey “until architecture was neither linear nor expected”.
The mother was an internal doctor at Chengdu Second People's Hospital and it was there that much of her days spent during her childhood. In the years when China lived intensely Maoism and then during the process of reform and openness, Liu underwent all political and social transformations as it grew. He attended the program for “educated young people” in the area of ​​agriculture, and then the Chongqing Institute of Architecture and Engineering, later called the University of Chongqing University in 1978. “As in a dream, I suddenly realized that my life was important,” he said, according to the official information of the Pritzker award.
The studio in his own name, Jiakun Architects, only emerged in 1999 in his hometown, Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province.
About himself and his work, Liu Jiakun said: "Aspire always being like water-permeating a place without having a fixed shape of his own and infiltrating me in the local environment and in the place itself." “Over time, water is gradually solidified, becoming architecture and perhaps even the highest form of human spiritual creation. However, it maintains all the qualities of this place, both good and bad, ”he added.
Regarding the attribution of Pritzker, the jury considered that the Chinese architect knew how to innovate, keeping the side more traditional than the profession can have. “Identity has as much to do with the individual and the collective meaning of belonging to a place. Liu Jiakun revisits the Chinese tradition without nostalgic approach or ambiguity, but as a trampoline for innovation. Create a new architecture that is simultaneously historical record, infrastructure, landscape and a remarkable public space, ”says the organization.
Spatial commitment
Building houses or buildings can be much more than simple building, establishing a commitment to space and the environment. For the Pritzker jury, "in a global context where architecture strives to find adequate answers to rapidly evolving social challenges, Liu Jiakun gave convincing answers that also celebrate people's daily lives as well as their community and spiritual identities."
Also according to the jury, "through a remarkable work of deep consistency and constant quality, Liu Jiakun imagines and builds new worlds, free from any aesthetic or stylistic embarrassment."
“Instead of a style, it has developed a strategy that is never based on a recurring method, but rather the evaluation of the specific characteristics and demands of each project differently. That is, Liu Jiakun takes current realities and manipulates them to the point of offering a totally new scenario of everyday life. In addition to knowledge and technique, it adds common sense and wisdom to the designer toolbox, ”he adds.
The note that presented the award states that the architect can project “a built environment that is often being pulled in opposite directions”, rethinking “the foundations of density through cohabitation, creating an intelligent solution that balances the opposite forces at stake”.
The jury also describes that "through a remarkable work of deep consistency and constant quality, Liu Jiakun imagines and builds new worlds, free from any aesthetic or stylistic embarrassment."
The largest projects
This year's Pritzker statement highlights the “West Village” project in Chengdu, classified as “transformative”, where Liu Jiakun knew “reformulate the paradigm of public spaces and community life”, “inventing new independent and shared forms of living together, where density does not represent the opposite of an open system”. The architect created here a space that allows "adaptation, expansion and replicability."
Also noteworthy are “subtle and memorable museums” created by themselves, such as the Suzhou Museum of Imperial Kiln Brick or the Shuijingfang Museum, also in Chengdu. In turn, at the Huishan Memorial in Chengdu, the architect "understands that identity is a matter of collective and personal memory, brilliantly raising the individual perspective to a fundamental element of place creation in order to revive a community dimension."
Degree in 1982, Liu was part of the first generation of students responsible for the major projects of the so -called “Nova China”, already with Deng Xiaoping to the rudder of the central government. At the beginning of his career, he was linked to Chengdu's Institute for Research and Architectural Design, a state-owned entity, having moved to Nagqu in Tibeta, where he lived two years in the 1980s.
About this time, the architect recalled his “greatest strength at the time seemed to be my fear of nothing, beyond the abilities of painting and writing,” pionering books and writing at night when he did not project.
His career in architecture was almost set aside until Liu Jiakun saw Tang Hua's solo architecture exhibition, a former university colleague at the Shanghai Art Museum in 1993. Such “rekindled his passion for the profession and fueled a new mindset that he could also be diverted from prescribed social aesthetics,” describes the pritzker jury.
For Liu, "architecture must reveal something - abstract, distill and make visible the qualities inherent to local people," "the power to shape human behavior and create atmospheres, offering a sense of serenity and poetry, evoking compassion and mercy, and cultivating a meaning of shared community."</description><pubDate>2025-03-07 02:59:07</pubDate></item><item><title>Beijing | “Two sessions” start today focusing on the economy</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/04/pequim-duas-sessoes-arrancam-hoje-com-foco-na-economia/</link><description>The month of March is synonymous with political movements in Beijing, with the political advisory conference of the Chinese people, which begins today, and the session of the National Popular Assembly, which begins tomorrow. At meetings will be discussed goals and political and economic plans for this year, without forgetting the evolution of the International Panorama
 
Today begins another session of the Chinese Political Advisory Conference (CCPPC), in Beijing, while for tomorrow is scheduled the start of the National Assembly (APN). The two events are the most important of the Chinese political system, materializing the country's political representativeness system, with the participation of delegations all provinces and regions of China, including the special administrative regions of Macau and Hong Kong. CCPPC has, as the name implies, an advisory character, while APN is the most important legislative body in the country.
The so -called “two sessions”, with annual periodicity, draw the attention from around the world because it is at this time that the Chinese government presents its economic goals and main political measures for the rest of the year.
According to the Xinhua state agency, data related to the country's gross domestic product (GDP) is one of the most attention points attracts, but the "two sessions" will also serve to shed some lights on China's foreign policy, something particularly remarkable in a turbulent global scenario.
Until March 11, the expected date for the closure of the work, there are objectives, calendars and essential policies, shaping “the political direction of the country” in a “complex and challenging global environment”, reads in Xinhua.
Let us look, then, to what we can expect in matters of GDP values. “As the Chinese economy is oriented for high quality development, GDP is not the only measure of the economy, but it remains an important indicator. In 2024, China reached its objective of economic growth of about five percent, thanks largely to a number of significant macroeconomic measures, introduced to compensate for the pressure of economic recession, ”he reads.
Thus, "more concrete policies to stimulate economic activity are expected." According to Xinhua, "China has already given signs of change in its macroeconomic orientation." "At the last central conference of economic labor in December, political officials committed to apply more proactive macroeconomic policies in 2025."
Thus, the adoption of a “monetary policy‘ moderately flexible ’was decided, which represents a significant removal from the 'prudent' approach adopted in the last 14 years,” the agency describes. In this meeting were also defined “nine fundamental priorities”, the first “the increase of consumption”.
Thus, it is expected that in the “two sessions”, “China emphasizes internal demand as the main economic priority”, and this year it is expected “that large-scale equipment updates and consumer exchange programs will be promoted with greater intensity and more extended”.
It is indicated that "China will actively use the maneuver margin for a higher deficit and increase the issuance of special obligations of local administrations", as well as "continuing to issue Special Treasury obligations with a longer term and increase central government transfer payments to local administrations." The "two sessions" will reveal more details in this regard.
Featured
Still on the economic level, Xinhua describes how President XI Jinping underlines on other occasions “the main priorities, such as support for the growth of the private sector”, “the acceleration of the development of the digital economy” and the deepening of the country's opening.
APN members “will analyze the annual budget and government development plan”, and proposals and suggestions related to Artificial Intelligence (AI) ”are also expected to be expected. In fact, this is “one of the main points of interest to China observers”, along with GDP values. It should be noted that, in this field, the country has sought to score points and gain a growing positioning in the market with the creation of the Deepseek platform.
According to the Global Times newspaper, Chinese companies such as Tencent, Baidu and Byd are part of DeepSeek in the products and services they make available, and "some local governments have also announced collaborations with Deepseek IA models to improve public services."
“Many AI-related plans mentioned in work reports of provincial governments [from China] focus on building innovation platforms, promoting industry deeper integration and improving political staff. It is important to note that the rise of platforms such as DeepSeek reflects China's commitment to make leadership in technological advances and a greater strategic focus on talent cultivation and the existence of an innovation conducive environment, ”he reads.
The “two sessions” also constitute “a crucial platform for political legislators and counselors to present suggestions and promote ample consensus on national development” in the AI ​​area, and “some of them are executives of renowned companies and researchers”.
GDP: Maintenance
Still with regard to Chinese GDP, an analysis by Neil Thomas and Jing Qiang of the Asia Society Policy Institute argues that the “two sessions” should reveal “an even more agenda for growth than last year, with approximate objectives of five percent for GDP growth, four percent for the GDP tax deficit and two percent inflation in terms of consumption ”. "Measures should also be introduced to increase consumption and encourage the private sector in innovation," the authors write.
The same analysis of the Asia Society Policy Institute also highlights economic measures to prevent and combat unemployment, a problem that has affected the Chinese economy in recent times.
“China will also announce the annual goals for new jobs in urban areas and the urban unemployment rate. Last year, Beijing settled these objectives in 12 million new jobs and 5.5 percent unemployment rate, and this year's numbers will probably be similar, ”is mentioned.
With regard to domestic consumption, China is intended to be more and more “a hub for product launch, winter tourism and has a 'silver savings' focusing on the area of ​​restoration for an elderly population”. Also according to the analysis of the Asia Society Polycy Institute, "other priorities include rebalancing economic platform regulations, stimulating economic activity in small towns, greater integration into the area of ​​the large bay and expanding investment in maritime industries."
Attention to Investment
The "two sessions" take place with Donald Trump to return to the presidency of the United States of America and certainly that this point will mark the external agenda of the meetings in Beijing throughout the week.
But still regarding the economy, the Chinese authorities will seek to present and discuss measures that may maintain foreign investment attraction in the country, after the launch of the “Action Plan to stabilize foreign investment”, on February 19.
Here is a “strategic change in Beijing's approach, moving away from tax benefits and subsidies and addressing the liberalization of specific sectors, rationalizing regulation and incentives for re-inbackets,” the same analysts point out.
Therefore, Beijing intends to “frame foreign companies into China's regulatory framework to turn them into long -term stakeholders, making local expansion more attractive than capital reafect to other markets”. Analysts also expect the "two sessions" to reveal concrete policies in this regard.
Sam Hou Fai in Beijing
The chief executive, Sam Hou Fai, has been in Beijing since yesterday to attend the opening ceremony of the third session of the 14th National Popular Assembly (APN), which takes place tomorrow.
Sam Hou Fai will be in the Chinese capital until Thursday of this week. According to a statement from the Social Communication Office, Sam Hou Fai will be replaced by the Secretary for Administration and Justice, André Cheong, who acts interimly, the functions of Chief Executive.
In the 14th APN, the Government's work report will be reviewed and the analysis of the report on the implementation of the Annual National Economic and Social Development Plan for 2024. The agenda also includes analysis to the National Economic and Social Development Project for this year. The report on the implementation of the central and local budgets for 2024 will also be analyzed, as well as the central and local budget projects for 2025.</description><pubDate>2025-03-04 00:50:31</pubDate></item><item><title>Economy | Trips to China increase due to diversity and low prices</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/03/economia-viagens-a-china-aumentam-devido-a-diversidade-e-precos-baixos/</link><description>Going to China has never been so easy, fast and cheap. Two residents of Macao of Portuguese nationality reveal to HM which leads them to cross the border frequently, especially the weekend. Cultural diversity, low prices and higher quality of service in bars and restaurants make all the difference
 
Macao Small and Medium-sized (SME) have faced, since the reopening of borders in the postpandeia period, huge difficulties to recover the business, especially those that are further away from the tourist areas. At a time when traveling to China has become extremely easy and cheap, two residents explain why they prefer to move often to the neighboring city of Zhuhai, or even Shenzhen, and consume there instead of being in Macao. Options like dinner outside, catching a taxi or drinking a glass are much cheaper, and the possibility of driving outside the territory has made this option more frequent. But electronic trade has also contributed to the fall of local consumption, they ensure.
Nelson Moura, journalist and resident of Portuguese nationality, goes to Zhuhai whenever he has a free weekend or holidays. It even goes between three to four times a month. “Costs are lower inside China, and then there is the novelty factor. It has never been easy for a non -Chinese resident of Macau to go to China. I previously needed to ask for a visa, had a reduced deadline, and this greatly limited my trips, and always chose more distant places in a context of tourist travel. Local residents could go to China before, but the current convenience, with organized and developed borders, especially Hengqin, with the connection to the light meter, allows for easier connections, ”he told HM.
Since China has flexed the policy of visas and increased the offer of border circulation, traveling to the country is no longer seen as a great trip. “As a foreigner residing in Macao, going to China was a bit like going traveling to another Asian country. In the pandemic we did not go practically from Macau, but now since the policy of visas to Portuguese has been flexible, it is possible to go to China whenever we want, ”said Nelson Moura.
“I am as easily as a Chinese resident, and it has become a viable option to go to the weekends and holidays to China, knowing different sites. The food is a third of the price of what is practiced in Macau, has more quality, with fresh products, the reception offers are better. Macao is a great city, but after three years of pandemic knows very well to get out of here whenever we want. It is a more convenient option now than before. ”
Nelson Moura also considers that "for the Chinese community of Macao and Hong Kong there is a greater convenience of travel," as "there are many residents leading all weekends to China just to go to large commercial surfaces, which allows you to buy large amounts of food."
“Traffic near the border of the HKZM siege or bridge is at a level never seen before. There is the option of being able to drive in the large bay zone which is good for small and expensive cities like are Macau and Hong Kong, ”he said.
PME, the eternal problem
On the side of Macau, associations linked to the Chinese community's commercial sector call for help, asking for more measures such as the great consumption award, or even consumer cards, that is, more campaigns and initiatives so that residents can buy more in Macao with discounts or support.
One of the last voices showing concern about this scenario was Stanley Au, president of the Macao SME association. To TDM Canal Macau, the official argued that in the next lines of government action the Chief Executive, Sam Hou Fai, has to show effective measures to avoid closing and, consequently, more unemployment. “The most urgent and current situation is the closure of companies. I believe the population saw many stores closed in different neighborhoods of the territory. Sometimes, on the same street, there are more stores closed than opened. In addition, the biggest problem is that Macau is facing continuous economic slowdown. If we do not solve this problem, society does not improve, ”he added.
However, according to Nelson Moura, it will always be difficult to combat the attraction of the consumption of Greater China. “Macao's local commerce is a complicated issue. There is a major reduction in consumers, especially on weekends and days when people have time to leave the city. ”
Electronic trade also enhances a reduction in local consumption. “Residents know they find more and cheaper out there. There are Chinese electronic trade companies, such as TAOBAO, which allow purchases from all over China to Macao without transportation charges, which has reduced domestic consumption. People go to stores to see what they want to buy and then do it at Taobao. I don't know how this trend can be circumvented. It is capitalism to work, ”explained Nelson Moura.
The resident also draws attention to the fact that it is now easier to use online payment platforms in China with foreign cards or Macao banks, namely through MPay.
Nelson Moura believes that local SMEs have only endured so much time because they were in a kind of closed economic circuit. “Local businesses lived a little in an island economy, and they survived the fact that the Macao market is in the territory, without people could leave so much. Now that there has been competition with what China has to offer, companies suffer because they often don't offer the service so much quality and at such an attractive price. I know the situation in Hong Kong is similar. ”
“Like” in China
Macaense Miguel Rosa Duque has always worked in Macau and spent in the territory most of the days of the week, but since he started teaching in Zhuhai his life has become more across the border. Highlights the much cheaper night exits as well as the restoration offer. “Macao has no variety and people are filled with the fact that the territory is small. We have hotels and restaurants, but they are expensive because the lace are expensive. Faced with China, in terms of price, the difference is like between heaven and earth. I give an example: To take a taxi from the siege gates to the university where I teach it is 40 minutes of travel, 28 kilometers, and paid about 60 to 80 Renminbis. It's very cheap. In Macao, from the doors of the siege to Coloane we pay 150 patacas or more, the price difference is huge. ”
Miguel Rosa Duque says that the trips to China in her circle of friends have become so frequent that they even created a group on the WhatsApp social network to facilitate group walks. “I prefer to go to China a thousand times just for fun. I have a lot of variety of bars and nightclubs and in Macau everything is dead. A two -person massage costs 600 Renminbis in Macao costs twice. I don't talk about hotel massage. Customer service is much better in China, with more attention to customers, more attentive, and it's all cheaper. If we spend 1000 patacas on a night in Macao, China we spend 400 Renminbis and we are treated like kings. The variety is infinite in terms of restaurants. Macau can't compete, ”he said.
Miguel Rosa Duque says he has friends who, even with a car in Macau, eventually acquired another Chinese enrollment car who are parked in the border parking park because it is cheaper to rent a place to park.
Macanese understands that between local SMEs and trade in China “there is no possible competition”, especially with online sales platforms. “People no longer go to stores here, there are a thousand choices and you can buy it from home. My girlfriend rarely goes to the supermarket, does everything online, for example, ”he added.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Clinical Psychology | The benefits and risks of the introduction of AI</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/12/psicologia-clinica-os-beneficios-e-riscos-da-introducao-da-ia/</link><description>Artificial intelligence is there to stay and its use in the field of psychology begins to be spoken. Recently, Deputy Lam Lon Wai defended its use and, in Portugal, the Order of Psychologists created the “PSIA” platform, which allows it to detect symptoms. Nuno Gomes and Goreti Lima, two resident therapists, talk about the benefits, risks and potential uses of technology
 
Understanding whether emotions can result in psychological forum diseases is something that is already possible to do using Artificial Intelligence (AI). The issue begins to discuss in Macao still shyly, namely through Deputy Lam Lon Wai, who in February interpelled the government about the need to apply AI tools in clinical cases with young people.
HM spoke to two clinical psychologists who work with residents of Macao, in person or distance, about the benefits and risks of betting on AI. Nuno Gomes, a psychologist in a local clinic, says that “is, for now, a help, and it will always be”.
“AI is an irreversible process and it is inevitable that it covers all fields of our lives, and in them is psychology and help people. But I come from a field of psychology that is the humanist school, which is based on the relationship with the patient, and therefore I do not see great benefits, for the use of AI, because in human relations AI does not enter, ”he defended.
Nuno Gomes believes that AI can help in the diagnostic phase, although he thinks "the psychologist will always be the central character." “AI can be an advantage in Macau for people who have difficulty asking for help. The use of the well -defined AI, even in ethical terms, may be very useful for the beginning of a therapy. However, at this moment we have no conditions for the use of AI at the level of a more complete and background therapy, ”he said.
Nuno Gomes also recalls that for those who want to talk to someone, AI "can give the feeling that we are not alone and that is someone on the other side." It is a feeling that is still "strange", but "in the future will no longer be, because AI will be part of our day."
The psychologist believes that AI "may work as long as it is ethically well regulated and can help in brief therapies, but always as a complement to a larger process."
Goreti Lima, who has lived in Macao, continues to do clinical psychology at a distance with residents living in the territory. It is more skeptical in relation to the use of AI, arguing that human relationship is always fundamental for quality monitoring.
“Therapy is done in the relationship and these applications do not contemplate this. I think very well that we can use AI to diagnose, see symptoms, but this we can also do with a book or article. ChatgPT already tells us some things in the area of ​​psychology, possible symptom analysis. AI helps in this process, but then the rest works in the therapeutic relationship. This is why people like more from one psychologist or another. Then there is the ethical question, the data is stored as? Where do you go? Can people trust? ”He asks.
Recommendations in Portugal
In a written interpeação directed to the Government of MSAR, Deputy Lam Lon Wai questioned whether there will be “cooperation” between government departments, technological companies and local academic institutions in the use of AI in the area of ​​mental health. However, Goreti Lam regrets that deputy "do not speak in the figure of the psychologist."
“Academics have a different experience from psychologists and therapists, who have gained this experience in practical terms. This develops over time. All these questions have to be thought of when applying AI. AI can identify what the person has and even techniques to be used, but then we have to take into account deontological conditions. The assessment always has nuances depending on the social context of the person, and this is never analyzed in AI, or is unquestionable, ”he added.
Portugal is one of the countries where the application of AI in Psychology begins to gain some form, to the point of the Order of Portuguese Psychologists (OPP) has created the online “Psia” tool, which allows you to state a series of symptoms and reach a diagnosis. Personal data appear to be protected with the introduction, on the website, the citizen card number, with the digital mobile key.
In addition, OPP has created a manual of good practices, entitled “The Human Factor in Artificial Intelligence - Strategic Recommendations for Sustainability”, which states that there are “virtual therapists who can identify, in communication with people, emotional difficulties that facilitate deliberate psychological education”, as well as enhancing “the learning of techniques and skills that aim, for example, to reduce anxiety”.
In addition, the OPP document concludes that "some studies suggest that these chatbots, developed based on validated therapeutic models, may be effective in reducing depressive symptoms and even that some people establish a bond similar to that of a human relationship." However, “these evidence is not consolidated and security-related (people and data), eventual dependence on technologies and the responsiveness of support given to different psychological difficulties are not clarified”, it reads.
Regarding PSIA, it is referred to the OPP website that "on very specific or complex issues should not be used in tasks that require specialized judgment and evaluation, deep technical analysis or professional counseling." It is also clarified that the answers provided are based on “available documents and information” until July 31 last year, and PSIA “does not replace the role of a psychologist or any supervision activities”.
In the case of Hong Kong, some solutions are also beginning to emerge, which motivated, by the way, the interpellation of Deputy Lam Lon Wai. This is the case of Hollo, a mobile phone application developed in connection with the University of Hong Kong (UHK) that aims to “make mental health care more accessible to patients, service platforms and organizations”.
Hollo uses AI power and technologies to bring clinical practices standardized to another level of productivity, intelligence and digital connectivity. According to Cameron Van Breda, Hollo's CEO and co-founder, the company aims to be "an easily accessible tool in stress times, offering analysis and friendship suggestions for better mental health exercises." In practical terms, “focuses on young people from 12 to 24 years old, works in English and Chinese and introduce them to therapy and counseling practices through mindfulness activities and daily games,” reads UHK's website.
Almost the same
Asked about Macao's mental health landscape, Nuno Gomes understands that he persists "some conservatism and ignorance not only in what is AI and areas where one can apply, but also what psychology can do."
“Psychology is here to help people and in the context of Macao there is no such understanding yet. This stigma prevents many people from seeking help and AI can give this support. However, the older population is still very unaware of the operation of AI, but the younger ones will increasingly resort to this type of platforms, ”he said.
In general terms, “the picture of mental health has changed little from the pandemic”, because “in general, people are not necessary to express emotions and since they are encouraged to keep emotions, which when they are bad and stored a long time, they begin to hurt. People don't know how to express them out of shame or guilt. ” Goreti Lima also understands that in the area of ​​mental health there is still some ignorance in Macau.</description><pubDate>2025-03-12 03:36:41</pubDate></item><item><title>Teaching | Chinese universities rise in ranking by disciplines</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/25/ensino-universidades-chinesas-sobem-em-ranking-por-disciplinas/</link><description>Chinese universities have risen at the “World University Rankings by Subject 2025” in various areas, although in arts and humanities Asia remains short of other continents. In 11 disciplines analyzed, such as Law, Management and Economics, China and Singapore are in the 50 best, while Hong Kong stands out in Education Studies
 
The latest world ranking of higher education by areas of knowledge of Times Higher Education, the “World University Rankings by Subject 2025”, concludes that universities in the interior of China have climbed to top positions, although Asia continues to position themselves in the areas of arts and humanities.
In total, 11 academic areas were analyzed. “Arts and Humanities”, “Business and Economics”, “Computer Science”, “Education Studies”, “Engineering”, “Law”, “Life Sciences”, “Medicine and Health”, “Physical Sciences”, “Psychology” and “Social Sciences”.
It is concluded, according to an official note from Times Higher Education (The), that “China and Singapore appear among the 50 best in all 11 subjects”, especially the University of Beijing and Tsinghua University, respectively, for fourth and sex places in “business and economy” disciplines. In fact, “Asia's best performance is registered in the areas of management and economics”, with “its main universities to continue to have difficulty competing worldwide in the field of arts and humanities”. "Concerns about the 'crisis' in humanities seem to be designed to continue this year, but the analysis of The reveals the continuous importance to elite institutions."
Given the analysis of 11 academic areas, the neighboring region of Hong Kong stands out in nine, especially in the area of ​​education, where the University of Beijing and Tsinghua also achieved good results. “The National University of Singapore again occupies the ninth position in Engineering, entering the top 10 of the physical sciences-the first institution in Asia to achieve it-in 10th place,” is also read.
Quoted by the same grade, Simon Marginson, professor at Oxford University, an institution that usually leads rankings worldwide, said that Asia's performance in this classification shows “the multipolar world of higher education” existing today, with greater amplification “national academic capacity”.
"In this context, over time, the relative position of Anglosfera and Western European countries has to decrease, not because its absolute quality is decreasing, but because the field of comparison is more filled with other countries to emerge," he said.
The same responsible also pointed out that "East Asia and Southeast Asian higher education systems have improved over the past two decades due to the growth in the number of students, increased public funding, more performance -oriented organization and management and selective internationalization policies."
One of the areas where there is a better position of Asian universities is in education studies, showing “a remarkable force, with three universities in the top 10, with the University of Hong Kong in sixth place, the University of Tsinghua in seventh place and the university of Beijing in eighth place”. In addition, The Show that the Chinese University of Hong Kong has made “significant progress” from 19th to 11th position. On the other hand, the Taiwan National University of Science and Technology (Taiwan Tech) obtained "the highest score in terms of research quality."
However, global leadership goes to Stanford University, "surpassing the University of California, Berkeley, demonstrating exceptional performance in both teaching and research environment."
China rises in law
Looking at the area of ​​law, there is currently, according to the ranking of The, the best place to study than Stanford University, which has achieved “excellence in teaching and research environment”, followed by Harvard University, with “exceptional performance” and, thirdly, the University of New York, “with the highest score in terms of research environment”.
Highlight, in this area, for the entrance of the University of Beijing in 14th position, in part due to the good classification “in teaching and the research environment”. It should be noted that, as regards the law, 389 institutions from 48 countries and territories were classified, using 18 “strict performance indicators”.
In the area of ​​law, specialties are analyzed such as constitutional and administrative law and examination to structures and frameworks of governance, or international law, which includes global legal systems and treaties.
Capital Knowledge
China also stands out in business and economy, led by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The University of Beijing rose to fourth place, accompanied by 20 other Chinese universities that improved their positions in the table. In this area were analyzed 990 institutions from 85 countries and territories, with the attention focusing on the quality of teaching and research in disciplines such as strategic leadership, international business and organizational development, as well as business finances or economic.
With regard to the social sciences, China actually comes below the list of the top 20, again with the University of Beijing in 16th and the University of Tsinghua in 20th. Here, the lead is up to MIT, passing Stanford University for the third to call Oxford, with "exceptional performance in teaching and research environment." The London School of Economics and Political Science remains an integral institution of the top 10, now occupying ninth place.
1,093 institutions from 100 countries and territories were analyzed in disciplines such as media communication and studies, policy and international studies, including development studies, sociology, geography and anthropology.
China also rose in the discipline of Computer Science with the University of Beijing to move from 16th to 12th place. In this area, leads the University of Oxford, reaching its highest score ever.
MIT Leads in Arts
The MIT has been at the head of Stanford University, assuming “first place in arts and humanities, as well as business, economy and social sciences”, even if it is first recognized “by specialization in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics”. According to the ranking, it is now “the best place to study arts - with high scores in each of the five pillars underlying the methodology, especially the quality of the investigation and the international perspective”.
In the 11 disciplines of the ranking, "Stanford ranked first in education, law and psychology studies, Harvard University ranked first in engineering and life sciences."
The only local institution in the ranking of The Disciplines is the University of Macao (one), but in places far below top 10: in the area of ​​computational sciences, it is in the 126-150 best in the world, a similar position occupied in the area of ​​education and engineering. In the area of ​​law, for example, one is in the best group of 176-200, while in life sciences is among the 151-175 best.</description><pubDate>2025-02-25 04:59:01</pubDate></item><item><title>Study | Digital insomnia treatment can combat depression</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/24/estudo-tratamento-digital-de-insonia-pode-combater-depressao/</link><description>An unprecedented study developed by several universities, including the Chinese Hong Kong University and the University of Beijing, concluded that cognitive behavioral therapy through mobile phone applications can help combat young people by monitoring insomious. The rate of disease reduction is about 40 percent
 
The study “Effectiveness of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Based on insomnia for insomnia in the prevention of Major depressive disorder in insomnia and subclinical depression: a random clinical trial” [Effectiveness of App-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia on Preventing Major Depressive Desorder Inorder Whit Insomnia and Subclinical Depression: Randomized clinical trial] promises answers to the treatment of cases of depression in the younger ones.
The work, published by PLOS MEDICINE magazine and developed by academics from various universities in Hong Kong and China, included the University of Hong Kong, Chinese Hong Kong University or the University of Beijing, concludes that it is possible to reduce, by about 40 percent, cases of depression in young people using a mobile phone application that monitors insoponials, a habitual symptoms, a symptom in the one who suffers from the sufferers illness. The data were presented at the end of last week in Hong Kong.
To reach the results, a random sample of more than 700 young Chinese from the interior of China and Hong Kong with insomnia disturbance and depressive symptoms, aged 15 to 25 years, who underwent testing with application for six weeks, was chosen.
Thus, “this controlled and random study evaluated the efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy for application based on application (TCC-I) in preventing the future appearance of Major Depressive Disturbance (MDD) in young people” can be read. This at a time when "more and more evidence suggests that insomnia plays an important role in the development of depression," in this investigation "intervention in insomnia as a promising approach to prevent depression in young people."
Thus, “applications based TCC-I is effective in preventing the future appearance of major depression and improving the results of insomnia among young people with insomnia and subclinical depression”. The study also concludes that "these results underline the importance of aiming at insomnia to prevent the appearance of DMG [a type of depression] and enhance the need for greater dissemination of digital TCC-I to promote sleep and mental health in the young population."
It is also concluded that the TCC-I based on applications "not only improved night insomnia symptoms, but also reduced daytime fatigue and led to greater change to maturity."
More than 700 young people analyzed
After testing the application of TCC-I, base clinical interviews were conducted over a period of six to 12 months to understand the results in participants and monitor symptoms. We spoke, in the period between September 9, 2019 and November 25, 2022, of 708 participants, of which 407 was women (57 percent), with an average ages of 22 years. The study also points out that “37 participants, 10 percent, in the intervention group and 62 participants, 18 percent, in the control group developed new mood disturbances over the 12 months of follow -up”.
In turn, the group that was subject to CBT-I based on mobile phone application, ie cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, presented “rates of remission of insomnia disturbance higher than post-intervention control groups” within one year. In addition, the same group "reported a greater decrease in depressive symptoms than post-intervention controls and over six months of follow-up." The authors of the study understand that "insomnia was a mediator of the effects of intervention on depression", and no adverse events related to interventions were reported. "
The authors left for this study with some proven ideas that insomnia is one of the main causes for depression. "Emerging data on insomnia intervention, especially cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (TCC-I), have shown promising results in insomnia relief and depressive symptoms in patients with insomnia," he reads.
Existing investigations focus on adults and elderly, so it was important to analyze this matter among the younger ones.
"In addition, there are few studies with suitable statistical power to demonstrate the preventive effect of TCC-I on depression, both at the level of symptoms and disturbances," explains the study authors, stressing that "little is known about whether the digital insomnia intervention can potentially prevent youthful depression."
Important meanings
The study also points out that cognitive behavioral therapy for applications based on insomnia is a viable and effective intervention to prevent future depression at both symptoms and disturbances in young people. ” However, further studies are recommended to explore “the integration of application-based TCC-I in clinical practice to improve accessibility and prevent depression among the young population”.
It is also mentioned the need for more clinical trials “to explore the potential benefits of adapting digital interventions on sleep in relief and prevention of depression” in order to “move towards personalized and staggered care approaches to the community”.
Limitations are referred to in this study published in “PLOS Medicine”, namely “the inclusion of a mixture of individuals with and without prior depression, and a limited sample of adolescents, although there was an adequate global sample”.
To the Hong Kong press, the study authors spoke of the importance of these results and how they can constitute new tools in future treatments of the disease. Quoted by The Standard HK, Chen Si-Jing, the first author of the Postdoctoral Research and Psychiatry Department of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said the study "shows that Digital TCC-I is effective in preventing the future appearance of severe depression, with satisfactory effectiveness." Wing Yun-Kwok, director of the Li Chiu Kong family sleep evaluation unit, indicated that future studies will focus on digital intervention on insomnia in clinical practice.
The unprecedented character of this study in Asia still gives him greater importance. According to Lu Lin, an academic at the Chinese Academy of Sciences and president of the PKU Sixth Hospital, to date "no investigation in Asia had been carried out on the effectiveness of this therapy."</description><pubDate>2025-02-24 02:07:54</pubDate></item><item><title>Diplomacy | Macao Platform seen in the context of Chinese foreign policy</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/19/diplomacia-plataforma-de-macau-vista-no-contexto-da-politica-externa-chinesa/</link><description>In "Paradiplomacy in China: Macao's role in relations between sino-Portuguese countries," Xu Heng Wang concludes that the role of platform with Lusophony "can be seen with extension of China's foreign policy." However, the MSar presents its own ideas, without “complete obedience to the central government”, indicates the academic
 
Macao's diplomatic role in the relationship with China and Portuguese -speaking countries was the focus of Xu Heng Wang's doctoral thesis defended in January at the University of Coimbra (UC) Faculty of Economics. In “Paradiplomacy in China: Macao's role in relations between sino-Portuguese countries”, the author argues that, regarding the role of Economic and Commercial Platform of MSA in the connection of Beijing and Portuguese-speaking countries, there is a certain extent of Chinese foreign policy, but at the same time, ideas proper to local authorities.
"Although the role of Macao as an economic and commercial platform can be seen as an extension of China's foreign policy, this does not mean that Macau is in a state of complete obedience to the central government," is referred to in research work.
Although it is stressed that “it is difficult to discern Macao's desire to develop, it must be mentioned that Macau has his own ideas about the course of his development”, namely in relation to the game and the entire economic structure.
“Macao has long foresaw that the structure of his economy would be unbalanced and that the game would be dominant. Authorities and academics have also made many debates on the issue of unsustainable development based on the game industry. At the same time, Macau is also very aware of its advantages in terms of cultural integration, having carried out the construction of a historic and cultural city, becoming a tourist attraction. ”
Between the own ideas and what is defined in the field of foreign policy by Beijing, there is "a direction of the development of Macao which, basically, is consistent with the role that the central government has conceived to Macao."
In this context, the author concludes that “the interests of Macao and the Central Government are basically the same”, being “a special case of paradiplomacy in China”, due to the implementation of politics “a country, two systems” in the territory and the high degree of autonomy it provides in various areas.
THE ROLE OF THE MACAU FORUM
Xu Heng Wang took a different approach on this issue, not resorting to traditional international relations theories, because “Macao interactions involve both state and non-state actors,” so these theories “do not provide an accurate explanation of Macao's role”. Thus, and to understand the role of Macau in the relations between China and the Portuguese -speaking countries, the idea of ​​paradiplomacy with Guanxi theory, a term used to describe social, economic or political relationships that can enhance business or other benefits, was combined.
Thus, it is said that "the creation of the Macau Forum can be considered one of the prominent paradiplomatic activities," with "Macao playing a role that mixes its development with the strategic objectives of the Chinese central government, especially with regard to Portuguese -speaking countries."
Macao has performed some relevant activities in the relations between China and Portuguese-speaking countries, ”although it is assumed that“ the results have been limited so far ”.
The academic states that these activities are "mainly concentrated in the fields of economics, education, tourism, culture and technology, with political effects that are not yet so evident." In addition, it is pointed out that "the influence of Macau on the relations between China and the different Portuguese -speaking countries has varied in intensity." Still, "much of the interaction and cooperation between Macao, China and the Portuguese -speaking countries occurred through the Macao Forum."
Help with objectives
In general terms, the “paradiplomacy of Macao is a complex and fluid process”, and the territory “shows its identity as a world tourism and leisure center and a characteristic financial center with international activities”, with the aim of “improving economic structure” and making diversification beyond game.
The author highlights fundamental areas such as services for small and medium enterprises, exchange-cultural and formation of bilingual talents. In addition, it is explained that “the central government provides political support to Macau based on its foreign policy needs, with the reinforcement of cooperation” with Portuguese -speaking countries. In these actions, include the Great Bay project, as well as the idea of ​​Macao's establishment as the Renminbi Compensation Center (RMB).
“On the one hand, the central government provides conveniences to Macau and helps [the territory] to establish its identity, 'supported by the mainland China market'. On the other hand, it helps Macau to develop the activity of RMB compensation center for transactions that occur on the Macao negotiation platform. ”
Thus, it denotes the author, "the role of Macao in paradiplomacy, but as an assistant to the implementation of central foreign policy, is also evident." However, "the paradiplomacy of Macao does not only reflect the diplomatic objective of helping the Chinese government to establish relations with Portuguese -speaking countries, but also the improvement of Macau's own international influence."
The doctoral thesis also presents a practical case analysis of Macau's relationship with the most striking Portuguese -speaking countries in the economic relationship with China, namely Angola and Brazil. "For Angola, Macao has played an approach role to China," as the African country needs "foreign investment for the hydroelectric power, infrastructure and agriculture sector." Thus, the binding axis is made at the Macao Forum, where "Angola can establish relations with the Chinese central government and cooperate on investment, in addition to the oil sector."
In addition, "most of China's investment in Angola comes from large companies, while small and medium -sized companies still depend mainly on Macau for commercial cooperation."
In the case of Brazil the situation is slightly different, because “in sino-Brazilian relations, the role of Macao is not obvious”, more “centered around the BRICS”, a group of emerging economies initially founded by Brazil, Russia, India and China, which today has ten member countries.
“Although the first ministerial meeting of the Macao Forum (2003) preceded the first meeting of the BRICS (2009) leaders, the impact of the Macao Forum on Sino-Brazilian Relations is not obviously as good as the influence established through direct meetings. Therefore, in the early days of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Brazil, relations between the two countries developed more at national level. ”
It is also highlighted that "although the role that Macao has in the opening of a door to the mainland China market has been established in Brazil's eyes, the impact of Macau on sino-Brazilian relations has not yet become obvious."
It is certain, however, that in recent years "the continuous development of the Macao Forum and the continuous improvement of organizational activities, its attraction to Brazil has become increasingly evident." “As Brazil tries to expand trade, commercial cooperation and investment with China will no longer be concentrated only in national business giants and will be increasingly targeted at private companies,” is still completed.
Regarding Portugal, the “attitude is very positive”, to the existing historical connection. “In many memos and statements signed with China, Macau has been stated to play an increasingly important role as a link between China and Portugal. Portugal and China have great technical cooperation in the domains of new energies, aerospace industry and other technological innovations. There is also a profound relationship of cooperation in the field of education. ”
It is also noteworthy that Portugal “not only signed cooperation agreements in the field of teaching with universities in the interior of China, but also signed several cooperation and exchange agreements with the main universities of Macao”.</description><pubDate>2025-02-19 00:24:24</pubDate></item><item><title>Air Links | Cheung Kin Chung calls for innovation to the government</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/12/ligacoes-aereas-cheung-kin-chung-pede-inovacao-ao-governo/</link><description>The deputy and president of the Macao Hoteleiros Association, Cheung Kin Chung, considers that the government should adopt a more innovative stance, in order to expand the number and type of international aerials with Macau. The position consists of an article published yesterday in the newspaper or world.
According to Cheung Kin Chung's statements, authorities should adopt a more multifaceted stance on efforts to attract international tourists with greater purchasing power to promote “sustained tourism development”.
The president of the Macao Hotelers Association states that the efforts of the Tourism Services Directorate (STD) to participate in events in Spain, United Arab Emirates, Japan or South Korea are positive. However, they are not enough, and for Cheung the promotion of Macau as a tourist destination without creating better international calls will always have a limited impact.
At the level of calls, Cheung also asks authorities that they are not limited to short -term connections with surrounding countries and regions, but bet on bringing tourists from other more distant markets, but with great consumption capacity.
At the same time, the associative leader requested greater coordination between the government, game concessionaires, companies and aviation companies in this effort of greater internationalization in the market.
Last year, according to the Directorate of Statistics and Census Services, the territory received 34.93 million visitors, including 2.42 million international visitors, a proportion of 7 percent.</description><pubDate>2025-03-12 03:44:05</pubDate></item><item><title>National Security | More than 25,000 students participate in competitions</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/12/seguranca-nacional-mais-de-25-mil-alunos-participam-em-concursos/</link><description>The winners of the composition and short film contests “my notion about the security of society” were chosen, the social communication office yesterday.

The deadline for presenting the application commissions ends on June 6
 
“My grandmother wanted to change the Macau Pass card to the elderly and went to some associations. When dealing with the process to change the card, the association's employee asked my grandmother if he could sign a proposal bulletin for the elections. ” The allegation of electoral use of the replacement processes of the “Macau Pass card for the elderly” was yesterday reported by a listener of the “Macao Forum” program of the Chinese channel of Radio Macau.
The listener, nicknamed Wong, described in a nutshell the state of confusion in which her grandmother was after her after they asked her to sign the bulletin during the exchange process. “My grandmother was confused and bothered by the situation. She just wanted to replace Macau Pass, without getting involved in electoral matters and was thinking that the card exchange could be related to the signature of the newsletter, ”he said.
The resident was also incredulous in the face of how the card replacement process is processed. “When I saw the presentation of the program, I noticed that the replacement of the cards is coorganized by the Institute of Social Action. I do not realize why the Institute of Social Action does not directly deal with the replacement of the cards, just as it receives requests and documents for the assignment of subsidies, ”said the listener.
Process in course
Until March 20, 60 posts for the free replacement of the “Macau Pass Card for the Elderly” are open throughout the territory, between social service institutions and civic associations.
Change of cards is required for residents over 65 who have old versions of Macau Pass for the elderly, as these cards have a chip that cannot be supported to get immediate discount of the great consumption award. It is recalled that the measure starts on March 24 and, for the first time, offers the mode of use of Macau Pass so as not to exclude from the elderly program that do not know how to use online payment platforms.
On the other hand, the Electoral Affairs Commission of the Legislative Assembly began last week to make available the forms to build candidates. The deadline for applications, with the signatures required by law, ends on June 6. The elections are scheduled for September 14.
HM has sent questions to the Electoral Affairs Committee of the Legislative Assembly and the public entities that organize the exchange of cards and the major consumption award (Institute of Social Action and Directing of Economics and Technological Development Services) to ask if there would be any case in an investigation related to electoral actions during the exchange of Macau Pass. Until the closing of this edition, no answers were obtained.</description><pubDate>2025-03-12 03:41:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Macao deputy at APN calls for a connection between Peninsula and Hengqin</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/12/deputado-de-macau-na-apn-pede-ligacao-entre-peninsula-e-hengqin/</link><description>Lao Ngai Leong, deputy for Macao at the National People's Assembly (APN), defended the construction of a new connection between Macau and Mountain Island, which should be made on the peninsula. The proposal presented within the scope of the Magnna meetings in Beijing was revealed yesterday by the Citizen Journal.
From the perspective of Lao, currently the only connection, which is made through the mud, by the bridge Flor de Lotus, is insufficient for all demand and eventually causes many inconveniences to people who need to move to Mountain Island. At the same time, the entrepreneur also believes that the new connection would be a way to integrate the two regions more, so he expects the project to be integrated into the 15th five -year plan of the Popular Republic of China.
The businessman also argued that the peninsula "is the oldest and most densely populated region of Macau", as well as "the traditional economic center of Macao" which concentrates "more than half of the industrial and commercial entities and the permanent population of Macao." As such, it is important that it also becomes a “connecting link” with Hengqin, to serve the needs of MSAR residents.
Interested party
In addition to being deputy at APN, Lao Ngai Leong is also a businessman with investments in Hengqin. In the 1980s, Lao founded the Chi'ong Building Development Company, which in English is named Chong, which, according to the institution's portal, is responsible for Hong Kong and Macau's Intelligent City Housing Project in Hengqin. The Ch'ong portal also comes out that the Icity Smart City project of Hong Kong and Macau will host an International Arts Promotion Center to promote MSAR artists.
Lao Ngai Leong's other economic interests involve the Golden Dragon hotel chain, China Huarong Financial Services company, Pastry Five October and the Pineapple Chain mobile application company (Macao) Technology Company.</description><pubDate>2025-03-12 03:39:27</pubDate></item><item><title>Homes of Elderly | Lo Choi in defends incentives for private</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/12/lares-de-idosos-lo-choi-in-defende-incentivos-para-privados/</link><description>The deputy linked to the community of Jiangmen warns of the lack of beds in the elderly homes in Macao. Faced with population aging, Lo Choi In defends the incentive to develop alternatives to public resources
 
Given the aging of the population of Macao, Lo Choi in alerted to the lack of beds in elderly homes and defends the promotion of the private sector. The subject was addressed in a interpeação written by the deputy linked to the community of Jiangmen.
According to the accounts presented in the interpellation, there are currently 2,510 beds in elderly homes, a number that has not increased since 2021, a circumstance which the deputy explained with the pandemic. By 2028, it is expected that the number of beds will increase up to 3,600, which is due to the opening of new homes in zone A of new landfills.
However, the numbers are insufficient in the optics of Lo Choi In, not only due to the expected aging of the population, but because it cites reports from experts to indicate that the minimum acceptable number would be 4 beds in homes of elderly per 1,000 inhabitants. In Macao, the average number is 3.4 beds per 1,000 inhabitants.
The deputy also points out that despite the official information about these numbers not always being the most transparent, the data provided by the Executive allows you to determine that by 2028 there will be a deficit of 400 beds. In the ideal scenario, it indicates that by 2026 there should be 5,200 beds in elderly homes, based on the recommendations of the Economic Cooperation and Development Organization (OECD) and the World Health Organization (WHO). However, this bar will not be realized.
More Private Market
Given this situation, Lo Choi in asks the government to invest more resources in the availability of beds, but also to promote the development of the private sector, with the distribution of land reserve land and the implementation of the support policy.
"In recent years, in many countries and neighboring regions, the private care market for the elderly has been developing vigorously, which not only satisfies the needs of the community and reduces the government's burdens, but also creates a large number of jobs," he says. The deputy adds that "in Macao, demand is also increasing and, even if the government is willing to invest public resources, it is still difficult to satisfy the demand." “Is the government considering releasing more public land and creating political incentives for the development of private homes?” He asks. Lo Choi also asked if the government equates the role of the private market in response to the needs of the community within the policy for the elderly.
In addition to land, Lo Choi in admits that it is difficult to attract workers to this sector, because most professions are not considered attractive to residents. The legislature thus wants to know if there may be a flexibility of hiring non-residents.</description><pubDate>2025-03-12 03:38:06</pubDate></item><item><title>Work | Leong Sun Iok wants residents in the corporate bosses</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/11/trabalho-leong-sun-iok-quer-residentes-nas-chefias-de-empresas/</link><description>At game dealers, the proportion of local professionals in intermediate or high management positions was last year of about 90 percent. Deputy Leong Sun IOK wants the government to encourage companies from other sectors to follow the example of the concessionaires
 
Leong Sun Iok wants large companies that do not belong to the game sector to follow the example of casino concessionaires in terms of recruitment policies and human resource management. The intervention takes into account the goal set by the government that states that concessionaires have at least 85 percent of the staff that occupy intermediate or high management positions delivered to Macao residents.
The deputy of the Federation of Macao Workers' Associations (Faom) argues that the government should encourage business tissue to adopt a similar policy that gives priority to places in more wage -like work.
It is recalled that, according to data from the Directorate of Statistics and Census Services, the income of game management professionals increased 22.2 percent in 2024 to an average of 68,900 patacas. Given these data, Leong Sun IOK defended, in statements to the Exmooo newspaper, that the Executive promotes the upward mobility of residents' careers and access to positions with better salary conditions, and argues that not only should game companies take on social responsibilities.
The deputy states that although Macao's unemployment rate is low, it is currently very difficult to access jobs with good remuneration.
Hole
However, the deputy of Faom also pointed to batteries to the game dealers, starting with the total volume of the labor hired by the sector. At the end of 2024, the number of game companies employees totaled 52,971 people. Despite the annual increase of 1,200 workers, Leong Sun Iok highlights the big difference for 2019, when the labor totaled 58,225 people.
The discrepancy is even more incomprehensible to the lack of human resources, according to the deputy, since it is common for workers to do overtime. In fact, Leong Sun IOK explains the 2.5 percent salary increase last year precisely with the overtime made by dealership employees.
Another area where the government needs to intervene, is at the entrance of newly graduated young people in the labor market. In this chapter, the deputy of Faom highlights once again the social responsibility that should not only fall on game dealers, in particular when opportunities are denied to young people without work experience.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Buses | Ella Lei calls for better shelters in stops</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/11/autocarros-ella-lei-pede-melhores-abrigos-nas-paragens/</link><description>Deputy Ella Lei wants to know how many bus stops will be the subject of works to create larger shelters. The issue is part of a written interpellation, released yesterday by the office of the legislator linked to the Federation of Macao Workers Associations (Faom).
The question was posed by the deputy, after revealing that he received complaints from the elderly who consider that several stops are lacking space: "Some residents have mentioned that the capacity of places sitting in some of the new bus shelters is insufficient, and they hope that the use of shelters with people with mobility difficulties are expected."
The deputy also points out that in many places the shelters in bus stops do not offer sufficient protection against wind and rain. Ella Lei also cites the official data to point out that in July last year there were 439 bus stops, including 348 she had shelter, or were in interior spaces. Now, the legislator wants to know where the works will take place to install the new shelters.
In addition, in view of the greater use of buses, with the growth of tourism numbers, Ella Lei intends to be sent more workers to organize the waiting lines in the stops. The deputy questions the executive about which plans have in this regard.
Finally, law asks the executive to reveal the plans for buses that will circulate in zone A of new landfills. According to the deputy, the housing built in this area is practically ready to be used, so it is necessary to start preparing the circulation of public transport.</description><pubDate>2025-03-11 00:38:32</pubDate></item><item><title>Planet X</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/12/planeta-x/</link><description>- Each man has the exact number of children before the alphabet he should conceive before he even learned his linguistic composition.

The first stream claims that benificaries should live in Macau at least 183 days a year to enjoy this check in the amount of 10,000 patacas. However, those who live in the Great Bay area would not be covered by this measure.
The second current believes that a timeline should be created, where the conditions will be different. This method can be synthesized in this way, "for the new residents the new system, for the old residents the old system." This will also be a way to reduce the expenses of the pecuniary check distribution plan.
The third lawyer is that instead of surrendering checks should be placed at 10,000 Patacas on consumer cards to encourage residents to make their purchases in Macao, thus encouraging the city's economy, benefiting the population and helping to increase government revenues from taxes.
Before analyzing these three currents of opinion, it is necessary to understand the government's financial situation. In September 2024, the financial reserves were approximately 617 billion. In the budget for 2025, it is expected that the executive's revenues will be about 121 billion patacas, the expenses will be around 113.3 billion and the gross profit from the game sector will be in 240 billion. Based on this calculation, by 2025, the government will have a financial surplus and tax reserves may cover about five years of expenses, which indicates signs of stability.
So why did these currents of opinion emerged? Because before the pandemic, revenues from the game sector taxing that reached the 300 billion of patacas annually fell by over 200 billion during the epidemic. This value was slowly recovering and reached 230 billion in 2024, so the budget surplus was very reduced. According to the “living within our possibilities” principle stipulated in the Macao Basic Law, the government must consider the reasonable way to cut in expenses, which will comply with the provisions of the Basic Law.
Although the measures that defend these three currents reduce the funds that the government allocates to the implementation of the plan, its essence, as an important policy to support the subsistence of residents, it is allowing everyone to share the fruits of economic development, increasing their sense of belonging and their satisfaction. As long as you have a Macao Identity Ticket and if you are a city resident, part of the shared money can be received. Therefore, the imposition of any kind of conditions could compromise the equity and inclusion of the plan. As soon as a situation is established in which “some have no right and others” will certainly create social dissatisfaction and controversy.
In order to maintain the essence, objective and characteristics of the plan, as much as possible taking into account the government's financial capabilities, the fairer form is that the setbacks and the advances focus on all residents. If the amount of pecuniary checks fall from the current 10,000 patacas, it will be in accordance with the principle “Living within our possibilities”, but being equitable, it will affect the lowest income families and is not feasible. Also, with a tax surplus and large tax reserves, why not consider the possibility of increasing the value of pecuniary checks instead of reducing it?
With the reduction of tax revenues, it is natural for the government to save by optimizing expenses and improving the effectiveness of tax funds. At the same time, the government should also actively explore the path of moderate economic diversification, reduce game industry dependence and increase revenue. And how can this be done in practice?
Recently, mainland China has resumed the policy “a visa, multiple trips”, which has undoubtedly injected a new vitality in the economic recovery of the Macao Tourism sector. The government must take this opportunity to increase advertising and promote efforts to attract more tourists. It should also simultaneously encourage stores to innovate their business model, develop special products and improve the quality of service to meet the different needs of tourists.
The government estimates that by 2025 Macao receives 36 million tourists. The city organized several successful concerts in 2024, which not only brought considerable economic benefits to the region, but also gave new ideas for the functioning of the moderate diversification of the economy. The government must continue to support and encourage this way and also exploit similar cultural tourism projects to promote the region's prosperity. Only increasing tax revenues can the plan remain unchanged and all continue to receive their part and enjoy good economic results.
In short, as an important subsistence support policy, the continuation of implementation and the improvement of the plan are of great importance to increase the sense of belonging and satisfaction of residents. When the government faces tax pressures such as reducing the game sector, it should adopt a prudent attitude and seek fair and reasonable solutions to ensure that the plan continues to play the role due to it. If government revenues return to pre-standard levels, the question of modifying the plan will naturally disappear.

It all started when Montenegro wanted to be a high -level politician and soon suspected of crumbling in the transformation of his house in ruins, Espinho, transformed into a luxury property. Montenegro went to president of the PSD and had, and has, a family business that is dedicated to consulting and real estate.
Okay, the creed has never stopped and the list of accusations has given water in recent weeks. Montenegro never wanted to publicize the entire customers of his family business, knowing that some are customers of great financial power and have had business with the state.
Montenegro gave a “press conference” -where journalists had to have a stupid tape in their mouth… because they were not allowed to ask questions -and where the Prime Minister, surrounded by all ministers to compose the power branch that has only been in the election campaign for a year, has announced to the Portuguese that he had no more clarification and that if the opposition wanted to advance with a motion of the government. And if it did not happen, the government could advance with a motion of trust. The Communist Party soon advanced with a motion of censorship, which was spoiled in Parliament. In this session, the socialist party may have made a serious mistake in its political strategy. Why? Because if the result of early legislative elections, they give the socialists scarcely, then they cannot expect communists support to govern.
But, continuing inside the spider web, Montenegro was news because he bought two houses the ready payment of about 700 thousand euros, with money resulting from the income of the family business that has three workers: his wife and two children. Worse still, Montenegro spent a huge shame when last week came to public who was spending daily 400 euros in a luxury hotel. Apparently, the Chief Executive finds it reasonable to pay half a national minimum wage per day, instead of living in the prime minister's official residence, for this reason the São Bento Palace is called “residence”.
It was no longer enough to affront all workers who have children aged 20, 30 and 40 who do not even have decent wages, having the distinct can to be outraged by their children, 19 and 23, can not fail to make 900,000 euros in four years, to the account of their parents' contact list. So that there is no doubt, 400 euros per night equals 12 thousand euros per month. Now the Prime Minister wins 4,500 net euros per month. As for us, it is infamous that Luís Montenegro does not understand the lack of decorum and respect for those who work, it gives difficulties and who is removed from the income subsidy and the pension decreased by more than 100 euros, that, from one month to another without notice.
However, the prime minister announced a motion of trust that will be debated and voted in the Assembly of the Republic already tomorrow, in yesterday there was no negotiations between Montenegro and the leader of the socialists Pedro Nuno Santos, in the sense that the PS remove the proposal of a parliamentary committee of inquiry and Montenegro to remove the motion of confidence. It was still possible to prevent a political crisis that can seriously harm the country in financial terms.
We think it will happen precisely what Montenegro wants. That it arrives, Socialist Party, Pan and Left Bloc vote against the motion of trust, possibly with the abstention of the PCP, and in the end, with the motion of confidence spoiled the government falls and the President of the Republic will have to mark early elections. The same Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa who was all silent about the Montenegro Spider Web-and now he has come to talk, and even more, because he gave the motion of confidence as a splash before being voted-and has announced that by his accounts the elections will take place there for the end of May.
We are really seeing a dirty laundry election campaign every day on the road. Surprising is the political tactic of the men of Montenegro. Possibly as they are almost all advised by Cavaco Silva, they are thinking, and a minister has already said it publicly, that AD could have the absolute majority… well, no more. A government that has left the poor people in a number of 4 million increasingly in misery, I am not seeing that AD gets an absolute majority. Sincere times are difficult to understand these politicians. We had legislative elections just a year ago, there are municipal elections in September and shortly afterwards presidential elections in January 2026.
For a country in the tail of Europe, don't you think it's the extra electoral luxury? Povinho is fed up with this balofa politiquice that in no way improves the quality of life of the Portuguese. Perhaps for this reason is that all polls indicate that the Portuguese do not want a president of the professional political republic but a military man…
Portugal has no medicine. Overcome AD or PS the next elections, we will continue to observe the gladiators with all kinds of dirty clothes to wash. There is no remedy, because no one gets an absolute majority that could give green light to deep and structural decisions for the good of people, such as giving up that superfluous Alcochete airport and the sale in all TAP. There is no remedy because rulers and deputies will continue to be owners of real estate and alter the law of soils so that their real estate agents are a gold mine in rare lands…</description><pubDate>2025-03-10 04:25:15</pubDate></item><item><title>With fate in the hands</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/07/com-o-destino-nas-maos/</link><description>“My destiny is in my hands,” is a speech by Ne Zha, the protagonist of the Chinese animation series “Ne Zha 2”, which represents the way of thinking of a bolder younger generation that boldly challenges those in power.  To some extent, whether the romance and the film, they criticize the current state of society. The protagonist wins the audience and the film naturally became a tremendous success. The inhabitants of Macao, who face the current economic situation, should also say "our destiny is in our hands"?
The Government of MSAR has finally announced that it will relaunch the “big consumption award”, which this year will take place of March 24 June 1, to help small and medium -sized SMEs and stimulate local consumption. Its promotional initiative also provides “immediate discount for elderly consumption”. The elderly can get immediate discounts on consumption of 300 patacas through the new version of the “Macau Card for the Elderly”. Although the goodwill of the RAE government is evident, will it really improve the difficult situation of SMEs?
Currently, the difficulties faced by Macao's SMEs result from the enormous consumption of Macao residents in mainland cities and the challenges placed by changing their buying patterns. Compared to the various cities of the Great Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Bay, operating costs, goods prices and sales services in Macau are at a disadvantage. For example, the price of 95 octane gasoline in mainland China is about 9 patacas per liter, while in Macao usually costs about 13 patacas. No wonder the drivers of Macao will return from the interior of China, with the car's deposit completely full. In addition, the stretch of Street of S. Paulo next to Rua da Palha is very busy, while more than a third of the stores ranging from Travessa da Paixão to Rua de Santo António are closed. What will help take the big prize to revitalize the economy of these streets and surroundings?
Given the adversities, the MSAR government shows the desire to change, but unfortunately there is still a significant space for an improvement in recognition and response to change. The crucial task is to break the monopoly of the installed interests.
Take as an example the Law of Economic Housing. At the time of the Portuguese Administration of Macao, Economic Housing served to resolve residents' housing issues and the owners of these homes were allowed to sell them, creating a market adjustment with properties at reasonable prices.
When I was deputy of the Legislative Assembly, the working group to which it belonged was responsible for the analysis of the specialty of the law entitled “Economic Housing Law”. The Legislative Assembly diary published that the deputies of the Association of Novo Macao, where I included myself, opposed the proposal to establish a deadline for the non -transferability of acquired economic housing and condition the purchase of economic housing by young people. With strong institutional support, the “Economic Housing Law” has passed, and subsequent revisions became increasingly strict. While some people have been satisfied because “economic housing has always to maintain the same nature, not being an investment”, but have you any idea how many young people were “enslaved by mortgages” when they bought home?
In Macao, only 3,600 babies were born in the dragon year (2024), a number less than 3,700 born in the rabbit year (2023). Some estimates point to 3,500 the number of those who will be born this year, and this number is already quite optimistic. But why is “denatality” gaining strength? Former Macao Chief Executive, Hau Wah, had the visionary idea of ​​proposing fractions of the “Mong In Building”, located at Francisco Xavier Pereira Street, to lease to newlyweds, providing young couples with a social housing option and relieving them from the heavy housing credit, allowing them to raise their children with peace of mind.
Unfortunately, Mr. Ho's proposal has not advanced and young people who want to marry and buy an apartment have no choice but to resort to the private real estate market. Even with their parents' help, young people have to pay mortgages over one million patacas! Now, with the decline real estate market, the apartments they bought are devalued. You should ask, how can they be willing to make babies?
Without breaking the double monopoly of economics and politics, we can only "resign to destiny" rather than believing that "my destiny is in my own hands"!</description><pubDate>2025-03-07 03:29:13</pubDate></item><item><title>FRC | Debate on Portuguese Language next Monday</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/12/frc-debate-sobre-lingua-portuguesa-na-proxima-segunda-feira/</link><description>The Rui Cunha Foundation (FRC) presents on Monday, 17, at 6.30 pm, a session of the “Roda de Ideas” cycle, entitled “The Potential of the Portuguese Language in the Contemporary World”, with the participation of the former Rector of ISCTE-University Institute of Lisbon, Luís Reto, and the Associate Rector of the University of Macau School, José Paulo Esperança.

Also highlight for another theatrical production in Patuá dos Doci Papiaem di Macau, with “ass reindeer?”, Which looks at the uniqueness of the territory
 
The show “Bate Fado”, by the Portuguese duo of choreographers Jonas &amp; Lander, is one of the highlights of the 35th edition of the Macao Arts Festival (FAM), which starts in late April, was announced yesterday.
The president of the Macao Cultural Institute (ICM) justified the invitation to the duo Jonas Lopes and Lander Patrick with the desire to “include activities or groups with special characteristics”. "We know Fado and have promoted fado shows," said Leong Wai Man at a press conference.
The leader recalled the nights of fado with Portuguese singers, held at the D. Pedro V Theater, in the first half of 2024, as well as the collaboration between fadista Mariza and the Chinese orchestra of Macao, in the last edition of the region's International Music Festival.
“We hope it is new, since it is not just fado, it is a body performance that fuses singing and dance,” said Leong. During the presentation of the FAM program, the ICM said that "Bate Fado", scheduled for May 17, "combines the emotional music with the tap dancing, evoking old Tabernas from Lisbon."
In a video shown during the performance, the duo Jonas &amp; Lander said the show “rescues the extinct dances of fado” and stressed that it will still guide a dancer workshop and another for families with children between 8 and 12 years.
“Bate Fado” will also be part of an outdoor show, free admission, on May 16, 17 and 18, in the Iao Hon market garden, whose program also includes the Casa de Portugal Association in Macao.
In 2023, Jonas Lopes told Lusa that “hits fado” intends to recover the nineteenth -century tradition of the beaten fado, which rhythmicly consisted of following the fadist melody compass, beating one foot or both at the same time, possibly with a choreography.
With a budget of 23.4 million patacas, six percent less than in 2024, FAM will present, between April 25 and May 31, 15 shows and 33 opera, dance, music and theatrical arts, in a program that includes seven local groups.
On May 24th the small auditorium of the Macau Cultural Center receives “the shaman's beat”, from the Tago group and Kook's direction and choreography. It is a show with the “fresh and young breeze of the traditional rhythms” of South Korea, which moves away from pop music. “The shaman's beat is a masterful demonstration of precision and movement, a representation of old rituals with an appealing contemporary touch,” reads the program.
On May 17th and 18th, “Kiki, the Apprentice of Witch-The Musical”, with dramaturgy by Kouki Kishimoto. This musical debuted in 2017 and since then it has taken the stage more than 70 times in Japan, having "a young and energetic cast." This is the “first outside tour” of the group, described in the poster.
More Patuá
As is tradition, the Dóci Papiaçá di Macao, end the festival with the play “Cuza Tá Rena?” (What is going on?), In Patuá. The theater in this Creole of Portuguese origin has been part of the list of Chinese National Intangible Cultural Heritage since 2021, underlined Leong Wai Man.
On the sidelines of the presentation, the Dóci stagnant Papyam, Miguel Senna Fernandes, said the play, with a center of explanations as a background, will be "a call of attention" to the importance of "maintaining the origin characteristics of Macao."
The director recalled that during a passage in the region in December, Chinese President Xi Jinping stressed that Macau is “the only place in the world that has Portuguese and Chinese officials” and argued that the city has to enjoy “its uniqueness”.
In a speech during the inauguration of the new local government, Xi said that Macau has the "unique advantage of being the mix of different cultures", but warned that the territory needs "a more tolerant attitude, more open."
In the last FAM, the Dóci Papiam were caught by surprise when, for the first time, local authorities asked the script of the piece before this debut, giving as justification the need to make the age classification of the show.
Leong Wai Man assured that this is "essentially the reason" why the script of all the shows presented to the public to Macao is evaluated by a commission, to "know if it can be seen by kids and big ones."</description><pubDate>2025-03-12 04:00:25</pubDate></item><item><title>Fisherman's Dock | RUC's anniversary is celebrated this Saturday</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/11/doca-dos-pescadores-aniversario-da-ruc-celebra-se-este-sabado/</link><description>The DD3 Verandah disco, at the fishermen's dock, is preparing to host this Saturday the RUC-Radio University of Coimbra Radio Party.

Health services (SS) appealed to all macao inhabitants vaccinated “before traveling to areas where measles is endemic” in the United States of America, according to a statement released Monday night.
"Recently, there have been a lot of measles outbreaks in the United States and countries such as Philippines and Vietnam are also being affected by the low measles vaccination rate, resulting in cases," the SS said.
Residents who were born from 1970 are pointed out as a priority group for vaccination, free through marking at public health centers. This is because, although the measles vaccine was introduced by the then Portuguese administration in Macau in the late 1960s, the vaccination rate remained low until the early 1980s.
According to the latest report by the US Disease Control and Prevention Centers (CDC) in the United States, the country has already recorded almost 230 measles during the current outbreak.
The overwhelming majority of cases (94 percent) reached unvaccinated people or who did not complete vaccination and 80 percent of patients are children or adolescents, the CDC revealed on Friday. A school -age child died in late January in a region of the west of the state of Texas where 159 measles have been identified.
Invisible enemy
The SS warns that the measles are “a highly contagious disease that can be transmitted through the air, droplets or direct contact with nasopharyngeal secretions of an infected person. The incubation period is usually 7 to 18 days, but it can reach 21 days. ” The entity led by Alvis Lo adds that the measles is contagious four days before and after the appearance of skin eruptions, and has as “high fever symptoms (greater than 38 °), spots on the oral mucosa, systemic maculopapular eruption, conjunctivitis, cough and nasal discharge”.
Once infected, children may develop complications such as otitis media, encephalitis and pneumonia. In severe cases, it may lead to hearing impairment, intellectual deficiency and even death.
The vaccine against measles, bread and rubella is safe and highly effective in preventing severe infections and cases. The first dose is recommended for children from 12 to 15 months, and the second for children from 4 to 6 years old.

With the start of a new phase of the Grand Prix of Consumption scheduled for March 24, Deputy Ngan Iek Hang appealed to the government to solve the problems of the previous two editions, and facilitate the attribution of discounts. The big consumption award is a discount coupon distribution event, for residents who consume local commerce, and seeks to respond to consumer escape to the interior.
“We want the government to dynamically adjust the great award for consumption. For example, we have received opinions from some residents that there is better more flexibility in the discount coupons and periods in which they can be used, ”said Ngan Iek Hang, who participated in a lecture on the center of collective wisdom policy, subordinate to the residents' association.
In the previous way, residents needed to consume Monday to Friday to qualify to receive discount coupons, which had to be spent on the next weekend. If this were not the case, the discounts were valid. This format is considered problematic: “Residents explained to us that they need to work from Monday to Friday, or that they have to work by shifts [which prevents consumption on the days indicated],” said the deputy. "The period of qualification to participate in the discount coupons draws has to be broader and more flexible," he said.
Praxe compliments
Despite pointing out the need to improve the local commerce support program, Ngan Iek Hang pointed out that the initiative deserves to be praised as it also allows you to support the elderly and the most disadvantaged groups.
In addition, Ngan Iek Hang cited merchants from Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) of community neighborhoods who have confessed to lack of liquidity and difficulties to survive in the current economic context when they have to face loans during the pandemic.
Given this subject, NGAN asks for the temporal extension of the aid in force: "We hope that the government will extend the measures that help the SMEs, such as interest without interest and the credit guarantee plan," he said.
The residents' deputy also suggested to the government to do a study on consumption in the different community neighborhoods of Macao, based on data collected through the means of electronic payments, and that based on these data adjust companies support policies.
On the other hand, Ngan Iek Hang considered that SMEs have to review their operational strategies and diversify products according to the trend of residents and tourists.
The deputy also recalled that in recent years, the government has launched positive measures to digitize the SMEs.</description><pubDate>2025-03-12 03:45:32</pubDate></item><item><title>Rua do Almirante Sérgio | Residents concerned with works</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/11/rua-do-almirante-sergio-residentes-preocupados-com-obras/</link><description>Yesterday the works of repairing and repairing the drainage system in Rua do Almirante Sérgio. The hope of the residents is that they come quickly to the end and have little impact on the area.
The area in the interior port is one of the busiest arteries of the city, and the works aim to “improve the drainage network and the road floor”.
However, a nickname resident Chio regretted that the areas in Rua do Almirante Sérgio and Rua da Praia do Manduco are always under construction, without any rest for residents. Speaking to Radio Macau's Chinese channel, Chio also stated that the works are more annoying for residents and drivers, so the hope is that the problems will be solved quickly and that there are few congestion.
Another resident of the nickname Law, also proved bothered by the work, and called on to the authorities to begin to coordinate the work, so that they are not always doing works in the same sections.
Already the president of the neighborhood assistance association, covering Rua da Manduco Beach, Cheong Lai Chan, was more restrained in the comments, but did not fail to ask the authorities to be careful and do everything to avoid traffic jams at the end hours.

The investment bank Jefferies reduced by 2 percent game growth estimates to 240 billion patacas. Prior to this low review, the estimates pointed to revenues to round the 245 billion patacas, predictions similar to those of the government.
“After the results of the fourth quarter of 2024, and based on the January/February trend, we reviewed the estimates of the game's revenues,” read the latest report on the Macao market, quoted by Inside Asian Gaming and GGR Asia portals.
The number reviewed down, still means a 5.8 percent growth compared to 2024. In the investor report it is indicated that this number represents, however, a higher estimate by 2 percent than consensual expectations among different analysts.
According to Jeffries, the difference is explained by the fact that they expect the mass market to have a 6.9 percent growth throughout this year, while most analyzes are more conservative, pointing to a 4.8 percent growth.
The highest level of visa visas for interior tourists are used to explain optimism: “We hope that the multiple entrance visa for Zhuhai residents, which came into force in January 2025, along with the multiple entrance visa for tourism groups, which was effective in May 2024, continuing to boost visits to Macau and the mass game recipes” justified.
Compared to last year, the volume of revenues between January and February was similar, with a growth of 0.5 percent to 38 billion patacas. However, analysts expect to accelerate revenues between March and December.
Market changes
In addition to the review of bass estimates, analysts advanced with different estimates compared to local market quotas.
With regard to this year and next, analysts believe that Sands China dealers, responsible for casinos such as The Venetian or Sands, and Galaxy, who manages the casino of the same name, will increase the proportion of revenue from competition. However, the speed of the increase will be lower than the initially expected: “However, as the trend of visitors in the two months of the year was not as high as it was expected, we slowed the rhythm of the increase in Sands China and Galaxy market share,” noted the institution. "With the number of visitors in 2025 to return to 94 percent of the 2019 level, it should be a good omen for large hotel operators, such as Sands China and Galaxy," said Jefferies.
In terms of the scholarship market, the investment bank considers it to be a good time to invest in actions of all concessionaires except SJM, which still needs “more time to reinforce its profit margin in Greater Lisbon Palace” and also due to uncertainty linked to satellite casinos.
Satellite casinos are casinos explored by dealers independent companies, but with their means, such as gaming tables, employees and gaming tables. The government wants to end these casinos by the end of the year, or at least that management is assumed in its entirety by the concessionaires.</description><pubDate>2025-03-11 00:51:12</pubDate></item><item><title>Mahjong | CPSP detained 19 people in an illegal game room</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/11/mahjong-cpsp-deteve-19-pessoas-em-sala-de-jogo-ilegal/</link><description>The Public Security Police Corps (CPSP) announced the detention of 19 people in an illegal mahjong salon, located on the 7th floor of an industrial building on Quatro Street in the Iao Hon neighborhood. The case was released yesterday afternoon after the authorities' operation took place around 2 pm on Sunday.
According to the CPSP, quoted by the newspaper or Mun, the investigation of the case began after a complaint about the existence of illegal game in one of the floors of the industrial building.
Police decided to investigate the situation and when they entered the space found 18 players, including 11 men and 7 women, aged 32 to 75 years. In addition, another 60 -year -old man was arrested that authorities suspect being the space manager.
Inside the industrial apartment were also seized five game tables, 4,900 cash patacas and another game material.
Asked by the authorities, the alleged manager confessed that he had leased the space in September last year and that he paid about 19,000 Patacas of income. By the use of each game table, 100 patacas were charged per hour, and the space was open from 13h to 19h, every day, in interruptions.
The detainee also confessed to having found profits of 120,000 patacas since opening in space and that on the day of detention he had a 330 patacas profit. In turn, the players said they got to know the space through conversation with friends.

Two elderly people were transported to the hospital, due to the inhalation of smoke and heart problems
 
A fire on Sunday night caused two wounds, and forced 24 more people to leave home. The flames triggered in Seac Pai Van, in the Lok Kuan building, in the fourth fire in housing buildings in about three weeks.
According to the information cited yesterday by the Chinese channel of Radio Macau, the Fire Department (CB), after preliminary investigations, identified as possible cause of the flames a short circuit on the electric wires of a washing machine.
The flames triggered around 10 pm, in one of the Varadas, where the machine was. Firefighters will take a short time to receive the alert and extinguish the fire, although if they had come across a lot of smoke coming from the vary. Despite the speed of the operation to extinguish the flames, 24 people had to abandon their dwellings, mainly due to the spread of smoke.
As a consequence of the flames, part of the washing machine's electrical installations has been melted, as is the pipe to drain the water from the rod. Also much of the wall where the washing machine was was black.
According to the newspaper or Mun, firefighters had to transport a 70 -year -old woman to the hospital due to the inhalation of fumes, as well as another 90 -year -old resident for feeling heart symptoms. Yesterday morning the condition of the two women was considered "stable".
Successful cases
In the last three weeks, four fires have been registered, with this largest of them, which forced two children with burns in at least 20 percent of the body and a woman had to be hospitalized.
This is not the first time in these weeks that the Lok Kuan building is affected, as on February 26 a man died of a fire, which, according to the authorities, was started by himself. The man, who suffered from psychic problems, was found at home sitting in a chair with his feet tied.
As a result of the recent vacancy of fireworks in housing buildings, some deputies, such as Lo Choi In and Si Ka Lon, asked authorities to adopt new security measures. Lo Choi In, a deputy linked to the Jiangmen community, was concerned about the fact that in the fire in the lake building the fire alarm did not work. In turn, Si Ka Lon appealed to the government to consider the hypothesis of funding the use of natural gas by supporting the installation in local buildings of distribution pipes.
Also in recent days, the Fire Department has announced the intensification of activities to promote security and inspection measures, including a simulacrum in Seac Pai Van.</description><pubDate>2025-03-11 00:43:47</pubDate></item><item><title>Zelensky vs Zelensky</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/31/zelensky-vs-zelensky/</link><description>10/27/22
A renovated Ukrainian, with the same name of the president, guilty Zelensky about the extension of the conflict that destroyed his village. Zelensky, the village, who has never left his land, now lives mortified because his favorite gravedigger died in the bomber.
This Zelensky, the village, represents half the world that reproves the other Zelensky, the villain, for not wanting to negotiate with Putin.
Negotiate what? The invader enters us through the house, pies us the wife and daughter (cf. recent UN report on Ukraine violations in this “special operation”), an act that forced us to watch, and then we say: Alto there, we are for peace, but we have to negotiate: You have not said the name you want to give to children!
A peace that is not worthy is but a cessation of rights. As severe as Russophobia that Putin inflicts his people.

In a lunch with several guests I hear a friend, who declares himself a spiritist, explaining about the particularities of his belief, in a serene and balanced way, would even say, without "irrationalism". He discussed long and serenely, devoid of any fanatical proselytizing. “Here is someone to whom belief brought weighting!” I thought, a rare alliance.
However, at one point a phrase that horrify me. He says, “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!” And I enter the voracious fauces of holism. Because holismo has a pathological aspect like all good things, a side of shadow.
Two examples: In Hinduism there is less sensitivity to existential dramas, if that child suffers in this life this is only an expression of the strict karmic symmetry, an effect of the acts she committed in her previous life. In Africa it is not accepted that death may have been accidental, and many women are accused by the dead family of having caused her husband's death, in an act of manifest dementia, and, in the blatant majority of cases, in a huge injustice to his wife - madness that spreads and infiltrates the social fabric.
Buddhism has introduced compassion and Christianity to Caritas, trying to break with this logic, but in many other beliefs and religions the cage of causalities prevails over sensitivity to experience, the need to respond to the now.
It is a tremendous logic that transforms the world into a platonic stage, where we are just the shadows of something -an inextricable law -in a determinism that calcines all singularities, but strangely fascinates many.
The conquest of modernity has anchored in the conquest of chance and random, subtracting the incidences of a life to this fierce determinism that closed the world in a web. When the Renaissance freed the body from the influence of the stars, at this moment sexuality was relieved of guilt and individualism and their volition could emerge.
There is an unequivocal moral implication in the phrase “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!”, Which should work as a key to self-knowledge and self-judgment, but usually this phrase is managed to seek a reason for things abroad from us in the other. It is an alibi.
There is a holistic temptation in the world today, as in the Middle Ages there was a satanic temptation, without great reflection on its consequences. Because it is not enough we want to connect everything in a resonant chain of affection. Even the most unexpected: affection itself can kill.
I realize, thanks to this cultured, balanced, intelligent woman, that “the combat” moved at the beginning of this century. One of the great misconceptions of the twentieth century was the false dichotomy between "rationalism and irrationalism", a debate that extended to all fields, including art. First, rationality was confused (the positive side of reason) with rationalism (the pathological feature of reason), and articulated in this lack of discernment was confused irrationalism with freedom. Almost all the art of the twentieth century, with surrealism to the head, worked in this error. The fallacy still exists despite having consolidated the emergence of 'irrationalism' and the consequent relativist currents that followed it. Essentially much of what happened in the twentieth century, it turned around this shock between two paradigms: rationalism versus irrationalism.
Now, I see, the indetermination, chance, the random of the terrible temptation of the causal cage. Holism, in its pathological feature, can be the reductionism that is the way it puts the way as a new 'eschatological narrative'.
Is it "by chance" that the holism emerges at the moment when neo-liberalism and its cynical contempt for the human person besides all freedoms, all acquired rights?
Holistic consciousness has brought positively a greater ecological awareness but followed by scholastic rigor drifting reality under the blanket of a determinism that is much more than inconvenience: all great authoritarian ideologies are holistic.
My friend will know how to combine her holistic and transpersonal belief with the freedom and responsibility that every moment asks us - but how many will make the destruction, under a law that explains and encompasses everything?
How many will not be abandoned to what it is?
The awareness of the indeterminate brings tragic conscience, as the Greeks knew, but also brings the will and the courage of the decision. And of this we cannot abdicate.
In addition, as Drummond shows in Carlos Drummond de Andrade's poem “Quadrilha”:
"John loved Teresa who loved Raimundo/ who loved Maria who loved Joaquim who loved Lili/ who did not love anyone./ John went to the United States, Teresa to the convent,/ Raimundo died of disaster, Maria stayed to aunt,/ Joaquim suicide himself and Lili married J. Pinto Fernandes/ who had not entered the story."
Real always runs outside the track, in full exteriority to our concepts. This is what is worth a J. Pinto Fernandes at the exact moment we thought we had everything under control.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Nobel and others</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/17/do-nobel-e-outros/</link><description>9/10/22
Reading many people's reactions when the Nobel Prize in this year's literature was announced, I couldn't help but remind me of this repair of Jean-Pierre Siméon, in relation to another Nobel Prize: “An editor of a large national newspaper wrote five lines of indignation because the Nobel Prize for Literature, a complete stranger. But unknown to whom? How did not occur to this patented and paid literary columnist to do his work, that his apparent ignorance was a matter of incorrect professional conduct? Tranströmer was translated into many languages, it was available in French. »
There is always the choir of those who wait for the announcement of the prize to complain about not being invited to the jury of the prize, there is a subgroup of Irados that professes “never read and I will not bother to read”; It is an uncommon fauna, which inhabits social networks.
I don't always know all the winners-I was unaware of the existence of Louise Glück, who I find a great poet, or the Olga Tokarczuk, for example-but it only brings me the comfort of knowing that the world is not a soap opera where everyone knows each other and the joy of recognizing that the gauge of the world is not measured with my short measure and that on the contrary it gives me a new opportunity to face the unknown.
And perhaps the most cretin of reactions was the smart one who wrote, but there are still those who read French? Confirming only that today there is a new kind of ignorance that fires with a displeasure: the one who only read English.
I would also prefer that, in French, Pascal Quignard, Linda reads, or even Sollers, or, among the new ones, Mathias is awarded, but that does not take dignity to the work of Annie Ernaux (and it would be enough to have written the “Les Années”). There are books of her that I like less, like the vulgar "a simple passion," but this happens with almost every authors, they have a channel books and others that are like intervals in their itinerary. I advise reading a beautiful book of interviews with her, "L'Ecriture Comme un couteau".

Yesterday came an article in Maputo's morning “News”, realizing that the Pen Club narrative prize was assigned to my wife, Teresa Noronha, for her soap opera “Tornado”, which had already had the Maria Velho da Costa award.
The summary they made of the book does not even deserve comments, by pathetic, but what matters to highlight is the note of disqualification about their "Mozambicanity" by calling it Luso-Mozambican. It is not inaccurate, but for those who know the context, it is a dirty touch.
Because finally, following the same logic, Adelino Timóteo should be called Tsonga-Mozambican, to Álvaro Taruma-Mozambican, and Macua-Mozambican to the writers who are from the north, etc., etc. Which is not reported to happen.
At the beyond moment, in the soap opera, she writes:
«Our color has never been dominant. In colonial time we were not white, we were ripped from monories, gone mugs, the pejorative term to speak of a son of Goes and Portuguese. In the postcolonial period, I was not black and if, in Lisbon, they took me by Brazilian or Cape Verdean, already in France were lost in cogitations of where they would be and amazed when they found out it was African. There I had to explain my DNA's wanderings before relying on moorms. It took me a long time to accept that it was so because yes, and that it was no curse that were so; On the contrary, I could even discover intense patterns of fantasy and freedom in this shrewd cloak that is our genealogy… »
In the current Mozambique it is white… and this is overlapping it soon to what it does or what it is.
It is sad, but as Naipaul warned, through these stops the race is everything and is soaked in it as deeply as, elsewhere, in religion.

Bruno Latour, an anthropologist who studied the sciences and their procedures and legitimations, law, technique and religions died and entertained themselves to turn the guts to the dogmas of the “modern”. For him the place, the expert's function, was more defined by the perplexity he embodied than for the supposed truth he would support him.
He proposed, as an alternative to the kinds of multiculturalism and his mistaken password "all different all the same", the return to "diplomacy", given precisely, not from the presupposition that "we are unified because participants of the same nature" but simply reveal that we "do not yet share an ordinary world"; It is necessary to deal frontally with the "abyss of disagreement" that separates us, rather than wanting to delude it.
And about politics said, disassessedly:
«If transparency is required from the politician, we kill him; If one requires fidelity to what the other was or he says, kills him; If a mimetic relationship is required between what the crowd wants and what its representative says, the representation is killed. These must, therefore, by definition, betray, deceive, modify, distort the word. Without this ability to double the word and betray, political language would not exist. I put the perfectly plausible hypothesis that political vocabulary will become as inaccessible as the religious language of the last twenty, three or fifty years. (in “UN Monde Pluriel plus Commun”). I believe it will be missed to decipher this frantically complex world that fit us.</description><pubDate>2022-10-17 02:18:03</pubDate></item><item><title>The yo -yo</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/30/o-fuxi/</link><description>O my friends, companions of these funerals trips to countries as old as the stars and the moon, and as strange as the profound interior of our disgraceful souls, - that startle still awaits us, what secret spells we will have to overcome, what horrors will rise to our dilated pupils of amazement and terror?
Increasingly close to our precarious existences, howling the war monster, which threatens to merge humanity with the earth, incessantly traveled by the squalid spectrum of hunger and the invisible evil of ten thousand pests.
O human human, who cries superior to his own nature, but then reveals to you, once and again, unable to simply order your existence and do not understand that you are possessed by the fickle wrath and are slave to your own ambition! Do not be content with the white jade or the light gold, there is no treasure that gives you your inextinguishable thirst for other men, animals and things; for in you an eternal anguish in you; in you crawl the expelled snakes; For you grows, powerful and impossible, the very fertile ivy of evil!
This is perhaps why on the mound they call the white deer, where one of the eight immortals in sacred mount was evolved through the skies to Penglai, inhabits the fuxa, a bird whose form resembles that of the rooster, although topped by a human head. What strange copulas, what monstrous amplexes, what terrible procedures will have occurred to make the existence of this animal sinister possible? We do not know, but it is enough for our exhausted mind to dare to raise an answer, so we soon feel the skin traveled by horrendous goose bumps and the heart trigger in paraded, which wild horse beaten by the night whip of fear, oblivious to reins and containment.
May men refrain from going through the Mount of the deer, because although there are riches capable of calming the most misunderstanding ambitions, if they have the disgraced fortunate to glimpse a fuxa, it will be immediately triggered the cultivated fields, because it will be beheaded the soft animals, for it will be sacrificed the best young man and destroyed superb from countries.
Fuxi emits a sound that resembles its name.

«Every man morally is one and absolute; But you have to live with your personality to mitigate. (…) Coexistence is only possible among people reduced to a negative or hollow presence, which is constantly giving in. Hence, the emptiness of society, a huge ghost composed of numerous deceased. An upper man is antisocial or criminal. Its destination is jail and desert.
He is in thinking about whether she reflects here about the political-social conditioning that gagging, and worse, in a sad country as Portugal was in the middle of the Estado Novo (and the book is from 1931) where any possibilities of spontaneity and frankness in human relations were coarcet, or only lends the behavior of men (oppressed) a metaphysical frame, a “essence”, from a presumption of each one in the presumption of each one be in isolation “one and absolute”. Sometimes, to an excess of spirituality (or longing), it adds to Pascoaes to lack the world. He is a great poet, but he is a poet who takes gray-Jewish ampoules and is therefore written amiiude on a programmatic furor, ceasing to have pores; There is often a glass between him and the real, the same one who made him wring the Ballet, 1921: “Everything is ghost. There are only clouds, clouds of voices, clouds of souls, afflictions and tragedies! Clouds and more clouds, appearances and more appearances! It is a divine lightning that pierces them, the instant appearance that arises and throws us to the ground, dazzled! »
Sometimes I would like to remind him, as Antonio Sérgio did in the article “Regeneration and Tradition, Moral and Economy”, which dedicated to Easter: “Easter, Easter my dear friend: You are a pure, excellent and noble poet, but also a victim of this social environment, like us all: this horrible isolation that you praise and I”.
"As a child, he stole two melos," says Jacinto do Prado Coelho, stole him from a nest, and throb his lifetime remorse for it. The person, few more mischief is known to him. Only in Álvaro de Campos sprouts him a twinge of evil and obscenity: “Oh, and ordinary and dirty people, which always seems the same,/ who employs profanity as usual words,/ whose children steal at the grocery door/ and whose daughters at eight years-and I think this is beautiful and I love him! -/ masturbate decent -looking men on the stairs. » (Ode triumphal).
Both poets beaten by a certain idea of ​​holiness, they were identical to the inability of breaking the siege of the skin with the overflow of the dike, the same curse of sublimating Eros's concrete ferocity with the mansuity of the verses.
Of course, they are the two "Bigger Than Life", but sometimes unnerves to watch, from my hostor's post at the Procrastinators Club, to the tantrums between them, just to see who occupies, in the internal organization, the place of president and treasurer.
Although a person has guessed more, for example, this he wrote in the least known martial ode and that is declining in the situation we live today, differently, with the heart in his hands:
«Ode martial

Duterte boarded Manila International Airport with three others around 9:00 pm, Martin Delgra told reporters, according to the French agency AFP. “We cannot approach the plane. The plane is still on the track with the door open, ”he added at the time.
It is unknown whether the plane has already taken off from Manila to Hague, headquarters of the TPI, in the Netherlands. The Supreme Court of the Philippines had announced hours before it would examine a petition presented by Duterte's lawyer to suspend the arrest of the former president.
Duterte, 79, was arrested today by the Philippine Police upon arriving Manila from Hong Kong under a TPI term, who accused him of crimes against humanity. The alleged crimes will have been committed during the Duterte Administration Anti-Drug War (2016-2022), which victimized about 6,000 people, police said.
Several non-governmental organizations state that the number of victims will be 30,000 killed in anti-drug operations and extrajudicial executions.
The UN Human Rights Office concluded, in a report published in 2020, that there was evidence of generalized and systematic human rights violations, such as extrajudicial executions and arbitrary arrests.
Following Duterte's detention, families from victims of extrajudicial executions during the Anti -Drug War participated in a Thazon City Thanks Mass in the Manila Metropolitan Region.
"This is a Thanksgiving Mass for a huge surprise, a historic surprise, Duterte was arrested and his arrest warrant was fulfilled," Father Bong Sarabia told journalists, quoted by Filipina PNA. “It is possible that the case in the international criminal court proceed now. This is the year of Jubilee, Freedom and Justice, especially for families who survived, ”he added.
Some of the family members said Duterte's detention does not replace pain with those who were killed. “At least, [Duterte] was only arrested. Our loved ones were killed at the scene, ”said Amy Jane Lee, whose husband, Michael, was killed in a drug -related shooting in 2017.</description><pubDate>2025-03-12 04:19:06</pubDate></item><item><title>Ukraine | China expects “just and lasting solution” for the war</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/12/ucrania-china-espera-solucao-justa-e-duradoura-para-a-guerra/</link><description>China said yesterday expects to be found a “fair and lasting solution” for the war between Ukraine and Russia, before negotiations between US and Ukrainian authorities in Saudi Arabia.

"This morning, the Manila Interpol received the official copy of a warrant of capture issued by the TPI [International Criminal Court]," said the presidential presidency in a statement. "It is currently found in custody," he said.
Rodrigo Duterte (2016-2022) was arrested after arriving from Hong Kong and police took him in custody by order of the ICC, which has been investigating the mass murders that occurred during the former leader's repressive campaign against the drug, said President Ferdinand Marcos's office in a statement.
The ICC launched an investigation into murders related to the anti -drug campaign under the command of Duterte, between November 1, 2011, while still mayor of the city of Davao, in the south of the country, and March 16, 2019, as possible crimes against humanity.
Duterte removed the Philippines in 2019 of the Statute of Rome, as the human rights activists say that it aimed to escape accountability for murders.
Duterte's government moved to suspend the investigation of this court in late 2021, arguing that the Philippine authorities were already investigating the same allegations and saying that the TPI - a court of last appeal - had no jurisdiction. TPI judges decided in July 2023 that the investigation could be resumed and rejected the Duterte government's objections.
Crucial intermediary
Headquartered in The Hague in the Netherlands, ICC can intervene when countries do not want or cannot prosecute suspects of the most serious international crimes, including genocide, war crimes and humanity crimes.
President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who succeeded Duterte in 2022 and was involved in a bitter political dispute with the former president, decided not to join this Universal Court again.
However, Marcos's administration said he would cooperate if ICC asked to the International Police to bring Duterte under custody through the so -called “red alert”, a request for law enforcement agencies around the world to locate and temporarily stop a crime suspect.</description><pubDate>2025-03-12 04:05:26</pubDate></item><item><title>South Sea | Beijing appeals to the United Kingdom to stop stretching</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/12/mar-do-sul-pequim-apela-ao-reino-unido-para-que-deixe-de-agitar-tensoes/</link><description>China said yesterday to the United Kingdom that "stops sticking the flames," in response to comments by British Foreign Minister David Lammy, who criticized Beijing Sea's "dangerous" activities in the Southern Sea of ​​China.

The discussions, which WSJ sources said they were in the early stages, are taking place at a time when the administration of US President Donald Trump imposed additional customs rates and other commercial measures against China.
Also the Hong Kong South China Morning Post newspaper has advanced that Trump could move to China in April to meet Chinese homologist Xi Jinping. Both the White House and the China embassy in the US declined to comment, the WSJ said.

“A successful entrepreneur has to embrace 100 percent the market, treat everyone well and everyone will be good for himself in return. But if we approach the issue in an electoral perspective, half of the voters will like us and the other half, ”said the secretary general of the China Passenger Automobile Association, Cui Dongshu, quoted by Bloomberg news agency.
"It is an inevitable risk after he sought his personal glory," he added Cui, who indicated that part of the population now sees Tesla as a political issue, given the proximity of Musk with the new president of the United States, Donald Trump, and the public notoriety of his initiative to reduce public spending.
Bloomberg recalled that China is not the only market in which Tesla is suffering: in Germany, where Musk was openly positioned in favor of the far right party, before the elections, Tesla sales fell 71 percent in the first two months of the year, while in France 44 percent fell.
Tight competition
In Asia, one of Tesla's biggest markets, sales fell 49 percent in February, in homologous terms, which cuized also attributed to the traditional low time that follows the Lunar New Year - the country's main festive season - and buyers awaiting renewed model Y.
In addition to Musk's political stance, another factor that is weighing on Tesla's sales is the rapid rise of local competitors, such as BYD, which has already surpassed the US brand as the world's largest electric car manufacturer and increased by 161 percent, in homologous terms last month.
Tesla's fall occurred in a context where sales in the Chinese automotive market increased 26 percent after the renewal of the “renewal plan”, promoted by Beijing, with those of electric and hybrid cars to rise 80 percent.
Sales from the US company have been falling homologous for five months and in February they reached the lowest value since mid-2022, when economic activity in various areas of the country was practically stopped in the face of Zero Covid-19's 'Case' policy.

China's top legislative agency ended the plenary session, considered the largest annual political event in the country.
A recurring theme during a week meeting of the National Popular Assembly (APN), consisting of about 3,000 delegates, including political, business, technological, media and artistic leaders, was the need to boost investment and domestic consumption, at a time when the economy came into deflation.
China is facing a profound crisis in the real estate sector, intensifying the trade war with the United States or the excess of indebtedness of local governments. The legislative body has stipulated the goal of economic growth for this year in "about 5 percent."
These challenges include contraction of more loans to a series of initiatives, such as the concession of 300 billion Yuan in discounts for consumers to exchange their old cars and electrodometes for new ones. But most loans will be intended to support the real estate and local administrations, which are overloaded with debt.
"It is not clear what will be the impact of this budget on underlying internal demand and efforts to counteract deflation, despite the considerable increase in the deficit," wrote Jeremy Zook, an analyst at Fitch Ratings for China in a report.
The ambitious objective suggests that Beijing may adopt more stimuli. Last year, the government surprised markets with various measures, which began in September, to reach the growth target of 5 percent. Finance Minister Lan Fo'an said the government has sufficient instruments to cope with external or internal uncertainties.
Chinese President Xi Jinping seems to be committed to invigorating the private sector, which represents much of growth and job creation in an economy that continues to be dominated by the state. Years of a regulatory campaign, however, the confidence of entrepreneurs and investors shook.
APN analyzed comments on a law designed to improve the environment for private companies, regulating aspects of market access, financing, competition or protection of property rights.
Xi intends to send a “message to entrepreneurs, but also to local governments and regulatory entities, that the private sector is important and necessary,” said Neil Thomas, an investigator of Chinese policy in the Asia Society Policy Institute, quoted by Associated Press.
Companies will have access to a higher percentage of loans than previously and the financing obtained through the issuance of obligations will be extended, the Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang said.
Chained economies
Much depends on to what extent the US leader Donald Trump continues the trade war against China and other countries.
The Asian country has diversified export markets in recent years, but the US remains a vital commercial partner. The biggest fear is not customs rates, but the health of the US economy and the demand for Chinese products, wrote Alicia Garcia Herrero, chief economist for the Investment Bank Asia Pacific Natixis.
Trump has increased taxes on imports from China twice since he took office in January. "If the American side continues to follow this path, we will fight to the end," warned Minister of Commerce, Wang Wenta, during the plenary session.
Asked about Trump's “America First” policy, China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi said the jungle law would reign if all countries adopted the same approach.
"A large country must honor its international obligations and fulfill its responsibilities," he said, on the sidelines of the APN session. "You should not put selfish interests ahead of the principles, let alone exercise their power to intimidate the weak," he said.</description><pubDate>2025-03-12 03:54:49</pubDate></item><item><title>Seoul | MP continues criminal proceedings against president</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/11/seul-mp-prossegue-processo-penal-contra-presidente/</link><description>South Korean Attorney General said yesterday that he will proceed with the accusation in the insurrection process against the deprived president, although Yoon Suk-Yeol was released by court order.
Shim Woo-Jung's statement arises following rumors that the prosecution would be withdrawn and the case closed, after the prosecutor decided not to appeal the court's decision to release the leader.
"I followed the principles of due process of law after having collected various opinions of the investigation team and others," Shim told reporters, justifying the decision not to appeal. Shim considered that the decision does not justify dismissal-as they ask for opposition forces-and said it will respond "in accordance" if the South Korean parliament takes steps to dismiss it.
Yoon Suk-Youol was arrested in mid-January on charges of insurrection for declaring martial law in December. Following the decree, which lasted only a few hours, was deprived by the National Assembly, but remains in office while the Constitutional Court evaluates the legality of the deposition.
After almost two months detained, Yoon was released on Saturday after a court of Seoul decided that the detention exceeded the legal period and that the accusation was presented after detention.
The attorney general declared yesterday that he respects the court's decision, taking into account the authority he has to decide on these issues, but stressed that he disagrees with the calculation used in the decision and ordered the accusation team to refute this point during the ongoing criminal proceedings. The rebellion is the only accusation against which a South Korean president does not enjoy immunity.</description><pubDate>2025-03-11 01:07:30</pubDate></item><item><title>China | Average life expectancy increases to 79 years in 2024</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/11/china-esperanca-media-de-vida-aumenta-para-79-anos-em-2024/</link><description>The average life expectancy in China reached 79, after increasing 0.4 years in 2024, according to data from the National Health Commission released yesterday.
The “healthy lifestyle of the Chinese people and the implementation of a series of strategies” by the authorities had a “direct effect on the health improvement” of the Asian country, the director of the National Health Commission, Law Haichao, explained yesterday, on the margin of the annual session of the National People's Assembly, the country's maximum legislative agency.
Law detailed that the average life expectancy in 2024 was one year and seven months higher than in 2019, which represents a “very positive pace of improvement” in five years.
The official also highlighted the “diminishing” in life expectancy between the different regions of the country, which said it was symptomatic of “an improvement in equality [in access] to health”. Law stated that life expectancy currently goes beyond 80 years in cities such as Beijing and Shanghai and coastal provinces such as Jiangsu, Shandong, Zhejiang, Guangzhou and Hainan.
In recent decades, China has recorded gains in many health indicators, such as life expectancy and child mortality, although data tends to be different between the prosperous coastal cities and the country's east and eastern areas. China registered population declines in 2022, 2023 and 2024, the first contractions since 1961.
It is estimated that by 2035 about 400 million people over 60 live in the Asian country, which will represent more than 30 percent of the population of China, with the consequent negative impact on the country's workforce and economy.</description><pubDate>2025-03-11 01:03:19</pubDate></item><item><title>Augusto Nogueira, President of Artm: “Macau is ahead of Hong Kong”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/11/augusto-nogueira-presidente-da-artm-macau-esta-a-frente-de-hong-kong/</link><description>The Macao toxicode dependent rehabilitation association is 25 years old this year. Augusto Nogueira makes a positive balance of the fourth century that began with a small therapeutic community and reached international recognition. The Association's president argues that, in prevention, Macau is at the head of Hong Kong and that the use of synthetic drugs is not yet problematic in the territory
 
 
What balance does the work developed by ArtM in these 25 years?
We do the balance very positive, because we started with a small area and a small therapeutic community. Nowadays we have a community with a capacity of 60 people, much more than the 15 we had at the time. We have developed several programs, namely the syringe distribution, which is a success, because it has led to a reduction and almost suppression of HIV contagion by people who inject drugs. For nine years there is the program and we have zero cases of infection. We developed support for social integration and follow -up after treatment, with “After Care”. We do preventive work in schools with the “Be Cool” program. We have the project “Hold on To Hope”, betting on vocational education, through coffee and the art gallery. It is a project that is well achieved and that turns out to be turned to tourism. We have visits from international entities and various non-governmental organizations, and the United Nations themselves. The most positive for us is to know how many people are recovered and who are well today. Unfortunately, we could not recover all people, but in each relapse there is always the possibility of the person coming again to do treatment.
How many people have recovered in 25 years?
We couldn't get this notion. We maintain contact with many people, but others have already left Macau, followed their lives. We have some contacts in the first two years after treatment, but then life goes on. People also want to go on a lifetime with no connection with the artm, sometimes marry and new companions don't know about their previous life and want to keep some confidentiality. But sometimes we meet. The other day they paid me a water without me knowing (laughs). These are small gestures that give us satisfaction to continue and make us believe that recovery is always possible.
What are the big challenges to maintain the ArtM project in terms of space and financing?
In terms of space and places for treatment we are well. The facilities are ten years old, there are maintenance problems, but this is more related to the panorama of construction in Macao. We need a space for the After Care, because what we have currently rented and is deteriorated. We are talking to the Institute of Social Action (IAS) to have a new space. With regard to the back, all our departments have financing, but we obviously seek support for our activities otherwise.
Regarding the authorities' posture regarding consumption and treatment, do you understand that it is still conservative in relation to other countries and regions?
This question is a little ambiguous. In terms of treatment and strategy in combating consumption, I think Macau is very ahead of Hong Kong, for example. In Macao, we have therapeutic community, we work on prevention and treatment, as well as our syringes and methadone distribution program. We have a range of treatments available to those in need. In the area of ​​prevention, the government has given a lot of support. The IAS has been quite open in strategies to combat consumption and prevention. In Hong Kong, for example, there is no syringe distribution program. Macao is from the few regions of Southeast Asia that has a government -supported syringes distribution program. But there could be another different interpretation of the law, with a differentiation between what is trafficking and their own consumption. For example, at this time if the person has a higher amount than that stipulated is soon considered trafficking, without proof. We think that in this case there should be a differentiation. It is then up to the police to investigate whether the quantities found are for consumption or trafficking. There should be an opening to give people more opportunities to be referred for treatment instead of going to prison. But lately, there have not been as many cases as that.
How do you describe the current consumer profile in Macau?
There is a large reduction in heroin consumption, and the few people who did so consume it today, or sleep. At this time the highest consumption is metabetamin, cannabis and some ketamine residues. As for the new synthetic drugs, there have been some records, but so far nothing alarming. But of course we have to be alert, we have to continue to do a good prevention job so that people are aware of the problems related to drug use. Regarding trafficking, we know that before the pandemic there was much cocaine trafficking to Macao, and after Covid-19 this situation almost ceased to happen. A good dissuasive work has been done and has to continue to be done so that there is less traffic to pass through Macau. It does not mean that there are no situations currently, but we are not in such a chaotic situation as that.
Speaking of synthetic drugs and their consumption, which according to the latest United Nations report has reached a worrying situation around the world. What is your comment to the scenario described in the annual report of the International Narcotics Control Board?
It is evident that the use of this type of drugs has been increasing over the years. Synthetic drugs are a real problem in the United States of America, for example, with fentanyl consumption, and Asia in some countries. It is a global problem because consumption and production are easy. Some of these drugs are made with other chemicals and many other products that are not well known to the origin and that can cause many overdoses. The UN suggests combating the production of ingredients that are used to produce these drugs, continue to reinforce the investigation to catch traffickers. But there are points of this report that it is necessary to follow, for many countries, which is the struggle between ideologies.
In what sense?
There is a struggle between those who argue that harm reduction is sufficient to combat all these problems that are arising, and that it is the solution to everything. Then we have those who think that harm reduction is not missing. In the artm we consider that there has to be a balance, because prevention is something important that cannot stop. What happened in Portugal, for example, when they liberalized the drug and failed to prevent and support treatment, [it was not good], and today Portugal is again in a slightly chaotic situation at consumption and trafficking. This means that prevention can never cease to exist. There should be quality treatments, with supervision of entities. The speed of access to treatment has to exist, and it can not be like in some countries where people have been waiting for a vacancy or permission to enter, as non -governmental organizations do not let the person enter until they receive the subsidy for each bed and patient. In these months a lot can happen. Damage reduction should be seen as a continuity for recovery, with rooms for consumption with medical and technical support, or syringe management programs. There is another problem, especially in Europe, which is heroin consumers, when they reach a more advanced age, already have many health problems and need sites to be, of a certain dignity. We have been wasting a lot of time with these ideological wars, and some of them exist for the sake of power, to influence the liberalization of drugs, and this is quite harmful. People's rights end when it is beginning to harm the rights of all other people, there must be a balance. As the report also says, there is a lack of medicines for some countries in Africa.

Art
To commemorate the 25th anniversary, the artm inaugurated on Friday the “Exhibition of the 25th Anniversary of Artm”, which is evident in the Hold on To Hope Gallery until the 23rd of this month. In the cultural space in the village of Nossa Senhora in Ká-Hó, which is part of the Occupational Therapy Program for the Arts users, you can see an art show done by these, with 45 works of ceramic, painting and wooden works. According to a press release of the association, the exhibition “celebrates resilience, creativity and healing”. “Throughout the last quarter of the century, the artm has been a symbol of hope for individuals on their journey of dependence recovery. This exhibition presents the extraordinary works of art created by our residents ”, reads.</description><pubDate>2025-03-11 00:28:17</pubDate></item><item><title>Debbie Lai, director of the center of the good shepherd | “Victims need more protection”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/10/debbie-lai-directora-do-centro-do-bom-pastor-vitimas-precisam-de-mais-proteccao/</link><description>Regarding International Women's Day, which was celebrated around the world on Saturday, HM talked to Debbie Lai, director of the center of the good shepherd, one of the entities that welcomes victims of domestic violence in the territory. The official defends speed in investigations of cases of domestic violence and more days of maternity leave
 
 
Regarding domestic violence, the law remains not revised, with many cases where it cannot be accused or condemned the aggressor. What needs to be changed in current legislation?
You should accelerate the time spent in investigating the case, as well as to make a simple promotion of the law, to let people understand what they will face if they report the situation to the police. There is still afraid of the complaint to the police, so what happens is that the aggressor, before a complaint, gets angry, again committing violence and the family is departed.
How many women are currently at the center of the good shepherd?
According to the License of Service granted by the Institute of Social Action (IAS), we can welcome 14 people, including children. We currently have 11 people, six women, three children and two girls living in our center. Some of these women have problems due to emotional conflicts, and although they already have some stability at this level, they continue to have financial difficulties. Many of these women are not permanent residents, so they are unable to apply for government social housing, and they need more time to save money to pay an income in Macao, which is not cheap. If young children exist, it is harder for them to find a full -time job, so these women cannot move in a short time for a home, staying in our center a year. And in this situation, the center cannot have more empty rooms to help other women in crisis.
Do you consider that more reception centers are needed for victims of violence in Macao, or more resources to ensure the victim's safety, since the territory is so small?
I think the resources are sufficient, but the investigation process is time consuming. Victims need more protection, as there is always the risk that the perpetrator continues to threaten them.
What is necessary to increase the birth rate and ensure that women continue to have access to equal economic and employment opportunities?
Promotion needs to be continuous, and should increase maternity leave, as in other countries there are more maternity leave. The monthly value of day care centers could also be decreased. The attribution of a subsidy by each child could also be considered if the family has financial problems.
There is a lack of support for single -padded families, where women are alone with dependent children, or where women are caregivers? In concrete terms, what needs to be improved?
I think yes. I think some of them do not know that there are resources in society to help them, or may not have motivation to seek help. Many of these women also do not want to rely on government, not even non -governmental associations or organizations that provide services to the family. But these women can always apply for the subsidy attributed by the Institute of Social Action, which gives them some money and allows you to stay at home to take care of their children.
How do you describe women in Macao currently, especially the Chinese community? Are you more emancipated and equal to men regarding their rights?
Nowadays the capacity of women has changed a lot, as they have equal opportunities and the right to develop. Many local companies are already chaired by women, for example. In addition to having physical strength, they can choose their jobs, attend higher education, marry and have the ability to take leadership positions. However, there are many women who come to Macau and marry residents and have a lower social position, suffering from various family problems. I speak of machismo that still exists, the addiction of the game, situations of toxicodependence or lack of communication. There are men who control everything, creating a climate in which the wife has to hear her husband and is devoid of self-esteem to get out of this situation. In such cases, it is very easy to have discussions, conflicts and even cases of violence between the couple. These are situations that obviously also affect their children.
International Women's Day celebrated in Macau
International Women's Day was celebrated in Macao in very diverse ways. In the case of Sands China, flowers were offered to the operator's workers as a way of expressing “the appreciation for the indispensable contributions that women make in the workplace, in the family and society”, can read in a company statement. It was also organized a debate that focused on the issues around women, organized by the Sands Empowher volunteer team, a “global initiative of diversity and inclusion led by women, which aims to connect the team's female members to create network job opportunities”. This event was broadcast live on Sands China's various digital platforms.
Sands Empowher is, above all, to organize training and mentoring actions so that women can develop in professional and career terms.
In the same note, it states that the company “is committed to building and maintaining a workplace with respect and equality”, defending and guaranteeing women's rights. Regarding sexual harassment, Sands states that it has carried out a campaign to prevent cases since July 2018, as well as actions that reduce cases of discrimination against women.
This was “the first in Macao”, and a “training action with all team members” on these themes was also carried out. Regarding support for maternity, "the company also offers breastfeeding rooms for mothers and performs a wide variety of activities for parents and children to promote family harmony."
At the Portuguese School of Macao, International Women's Day was celebrated on Friday with the DAC project-“Women who inspire”, an initiative organized by the teachers of the disciplines of Portuguese, Philosophy and Mathematics, among others. The 10th grade students have developed several works on inspiring women in the most diverse areas. One of them was the recently deceased poet Maria Teresa Horta.</description><pubDate>2025-03-10 03:54:15</pubDate></item><item><title>Bernardo Mendia, Chamber of Commerce and Industry Portugal - Hong Kong: “Portugal should extend your hand”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/06/bernardo-mendia-camara-de-comercio-e-industria-portugal-hong-kong-portugal-deve-estender-a-mao/</link><description>The Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry of Hong Kong, Sun Dong, arrives today, accompanied by entrepreneurs from digital areas, online trade and technology. Bernardo Mendia, Mayor of Commerce and Industry Portugal - Hong Kong, highlights the importance of visiting Portuguese companies and Raehk as a complement to Portuguese contacts in Macau
 
 
Last year, Portugal was visited by Christopher Hui Ching-Yu, Secretary of Hong Kong Financial Affairs and Treasury, and now another Hong Kong ruler passes through Portugal. Is it a visit with added meaning?
As a Chamber of Commerce and Industry Portugal - Hong Kong we consider this visit extremely important, valuing the attention that is being given to Portugal. It is important, above all, because it is such a specific area as innovation. This is an area where Hong Kong bets a lot and has been a priority for the region's authorities, and this is something that exists in common with Portugal, which has also bet on technological and scientific development. What Portugal should do is take this opportunity, extend your hand to the secretary and work in partnership. Technological and economic development is only done with international partnerships, opening markets and collaborations. This is also what we promote as a Chamber of Commerce. We have been involved in organizing this trip, something that started months ago. We will lead Portuguese companies to identify potential synergies with the entities that come here, so that they know each other and then do their work.
Hong Kong has been present in all editions of Websummit in Lisbon. Does this visit give the idea that the region intends to expand and establish more concrete partnerships with Portugal?
Yes, no doubt. This has evidenced in official speeches of the most important members of the Hong Kong government, including the executive's own head. This is the region's strategy at this time, being a bridge for the rest of the world to be able to enter Asia. Then the territory competes with other platforms, as Hong Kong, Singapore and Tokyo are perhaps the three territories with the greatest expression in this [technological] area in Asia. But Hong Kong presents the best conditions, not only for the support it gives [to companies], but also for being part of China, despite having a different legal system and a different currency. There is a system completely open at the level of capital circulation and internet access. I think Hong Kong is better positioned in this field, but this is a competition that the territory has to do, such as Portugal when it will perform in Asia, competing with Spain and other European countries in attracting foreign direct investment.
Macao is usually the main connection to Portugal, for historical reasons and the presence of the Portuguese language. Can Hong Kong also be a binding territory between Portuguese companies and Asia?
Macau and Hong Kong are very complementary in this regard. Macao has this historical connection with Portugal and has very important companies based in the territory, some of them for over 100 years, namely the National Bank Overseas. This experience, and the fact that the Portuguese language is still official, is undoubtedly an advantage for Portuguese companies. If it is necessary to enter the capital market, Portuguese companies will opt for a number of services provided by Hong Kong. But Macau has its own advantages and I consider it two very complementary markets. The geographical proximity of Macau and Hong Kong also acts as an attractive point.
During Christopher Hui Ching-Yu's visit last year, Hong Kong's position as Fiscal Paradise was addressed. How do you look at this question?
This visit is organized by the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office and the tax issues will now be set aside. But our position, as a Chamber of Commerce, is that it makes no sense Hong Kong being on the list of tax havens, and makes no sense or from a legal point of view. None of the markets we compete with Hong Kong as a fiscal paradise, nor the European Union itself. We just have to lose with it, because we create barriers to trade and foreign direct investment in Portugal, and also the investment that is made by Portuguese companies in Macao, which are eventually affected by it. It makes no sense to this designation from a legal point of view, because Hong Kong does not gather the conditions to be part of the list of tax havens, and from the political point of view because no other European country puts the territory in this category.
China is present in the Portuguese market through various investments. Hong Kong is trying to create its own way?
Not in these terms. The overwhelming majority of Chinese investment that is made in Portugal is through Hong Kong. Then, in this respect, Hong Kong and China work in a quite complementary way. Hong Kong acts as a "aircraft carrier" from China in terms of foreign investment, and there is no competition between the two, working, together.
Encounters in Oeiras | Taguspark today hosts exchange sessions and seminars
Dong Sun is accompanied by Portugal by Hong Kong's most important companies and entities in the areas of innovation, technology and digital media, either government, with Hong Kong Science and Technology Park and “Cyberport”, technology park with budget projects in two billion Hong Kong; either academic and research, attending the entourage of the Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute and “Hong Kong Microelectronics Research and Development Institute”.
Exchange sessions and seminars take place today from 4 pm at Taguspark, Oeiras, where Oeiras Valley Investment Agency is located, whose representatives have already been present in Macao for commercial contacts.
In the afternoon there will be the opportunity for dialogue between the Secretary of Hong Kong, representatives of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry Portugal - Hong Kong and leaders of Raehk's technological parks and institutes, and in total 24 companies are represented.
In the Catalan road
In a statement issued by the Hong Kong executive, it is read that the program includes “meetings and exchanges with leaders of local political, business and innovation and technology sectors”, as well as visits to infrastructure, technological parks, research institutes and businesses.
The aim is to “reinforce ties and cooperation” with Portugal in this sector, “promoting the advantages of Hong Kong innovation and technology and exploring business opportunities abroad,” according to the statement.
Before passing through Lisbon, the delegation was in Barcelona to participate in the “Mobile World Congress”, considered one of the most influential technological events worldwide.
This is the second visit to Portugal of a member of the Hong Kong government within a year, after the secretary for financial services and treasure had passed through Lisbon in June. At the time, Christopher Hui Clay-Yu asked Portugal to remove Hong Kong from the list of tax havens and argued that it already fulfills the European Union standards to combat tax dropout.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Cristina Rocha Leiria, author of the project of the Ecumenical Center Kun Aím: “The work that most filled me”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/04/cristina-rocha-leiria-autora-do-projecto-do-centro-ecumenico-kun-iam-a-obra-que-mais-me-preencheu/</link><description>Until March 13 can be seen at the Kun Iam Ecumenical Center, the show “Moments of Light With Kun Iam”, an exhibition by Cristina Rocha Leiria, architect, sculptor and author of the center project.

Tell me “moment of light”, the exhibition patent at the Kun Iam ecumenical center.
The center was created for silence, because everything is done for majorities, but we have to think about minorities, which have the right to exist. There may be a minority that needs silence. Crystals are seen from Portugal and also purchased in China, chosen by me, and energy stones. There are also 25 pieces made by Atlantis [Portuguese Company of the Vista Alegre Group] in Cristal, as well as a bazaar with other materials.
The ecumenical center was inaugurated in 1999, 25 years passed. How do you look at the project today? Do you feel that you are properly used?
It is the work that filled me the most. I worked on it at the level of architecture, because this is my training area, and I also worked with the sculpture because it is what I do, although I did not take any course. I sculpture as therapy. I worked at the level of music with Kyao and another conductor, who realized what I wanted and made a composition of such order that plays all day [in the center] and people never get tired. I treated, at the time, everything else, the decoration and what was sold there. Things have been running out and there was almost nothing to sell except for some books and postcards. We created a lot that sold, the tourists went there, made no noise because they realized it was a place of silence, bought and this space had a certain performance. This ecumenical center should be disclosed, which has become a former Macao Libris, with tourists as Macau has and that exists in any other urban place in the world. Therefore, the center works at this time with an exhibition of mine and a bazaar that has products that sell themselves in other places and that have nothing to do with the ecumenical center, but are a gimmick.
How was the start of the construction of this project? Have you ever done anything so much with so much connection with the spirit world?
I lived in Mozambique until I went to Lisbon to study architecture. As a child I know the goddess Kun Age, because my mother had a white statue of Kun ran home, and it was the thing I liked the most in that house. Little did I know that one day I would make a center dedicated to this goddess. When I came to Macau to work in the Leal Senate, as the president's advisor, with the first money I earned I went to Hong Kong to buy a white Abat-Jour with the figure of Kun Iam, which I still have today. Regarding the spiritual part, it comes from a child, I always liked the silence. When I do architecture or sculpture it is always in complete silence. I am only me linked to work and a world that, as it is not tangible, many people do not even realize it, do not believe him. I believe because I feel that when I work two nightsless nights, or three days in a row, in any project, silent, I wake up in the morning and I think of the ideas I had, I am surprised even with them. So the spiritual part is reflected in the sculpture I make. I specialize in housing and spirituality is also reflected in the projects I did in Macao in the area of ​​social housing. Spirituality is a part of me, and the ecumenical center is guided to it. In these guided tours that I have tried to pull for younger people to realize that we can be greatly helped by energies that we do not see. I do not name things and say not to care about it, because the important thing is to become aware that there is more than what we see. The material world is not the only one who interests us, there is more to make contact and thank.
Macao is a territory based on consumption, the game, the excesses. Having a center of this nature in this society has a greater meaning?
This center is ecumenical, but it has nothing to do with the church, referring to something comprehensive. The center was made for atheists, agnostic, religious and non -religious, for all those who need silence. And in the world of Macao, or in large urban media, there is always hearing pollution. This center was made on an island that I asked for the governor of the time, General Vasco Rocha Vieira, who was a very open person to this proposal. This island was created because there was no space in Macau at the time to place a 20 meter high monument. The center became a symbol, many will pray there, but it was not done for it. I must say that I believe that the essence of the divine is in each of us, but not everyone is aware of it. Others are open to this essence.
Returning to the exhibition. What can people learn from her?
I am now in Macao for a period of six months, but I have also dealt with various projects related to projects I have done in Portugal for many years and I have been trying to be recovered. The exhibition itself is there and is not an attractive. It is good to know that the reopening of the ecumenical center did not have the disclosure it should have. No one knows that the ecumenical center has been opened, and who appears there are the people who leave the children in the parks, watch the space, and go there with the children. It is interesting because the little ones go precisely to the energy points identified by me. People who are walking, come in, but will not be on purpose to see my exhibition. Then, as they see the gate that gives the river, they leave soon and the exhibition goes unnoticed.
But regrets that no more dissemination has been made.
It was not done, no. Now I am doing this job and spreading with friendly people. I am finishing an exhibition without, in fact, people have enjoyed when I have sculptures with messages. It takes about a month to sculpture, and I write, thinking, doing poetry, so I have a lot to convey to people about each sculpture. Many people say they get out of there richer. I will ask the exhibition to be prolonged beyond March 13th and it was good to happen, because there have been groups of people, including some that mark time with me and I will make the guided tour.
How did your connection come to Chinese culture?
This connection comes from childhood. Then I deepened this connection a lot because I had to study about the goddess Kun Iam. I had to see many figures of Kun were going to think how it would do one that was suspended there, outdoors subject to taps and strong winds, as well as high temperatures. The spiritual part was easier for me, because since childhood I am interested in oriental philosophies. This part of spirituality [in the construction of the ecumenical center] was easier for me, although it had many difficulties. I gave myself everything, books to the library, and even contributed financially to this center so that many young people could enjoy it.
He told me that some works he has built need recovery. Is this side of the artist ungrateful to see the projects to destroy themselves over time without preservation?
I don't regret anything, I try to understand. But I also try to defend the purposes that existed in the start of each project. I try to understand the way of being of the Chinese who lived so many years limited and with many prohibitions. I would like to understand why they put a bazaar at the exhibition to sell so many products. The same happens in Portugal: I have the work “Candle to the Wind” in Tavira, in a huge roundabout that had a lake, it was something I tried to do poeticly, but then I see that people despise. Now there is no water in space and herbs grow. I feel that there is a lack of respect for the artist.</description><pubDate>2025-03-04 23:35:42</pubDate></item><item><title>Piménio Ferreira: “Anti-igan rhetoric has always worked in Portugal”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2021/04/26/pimenio-ferreira-a-retorica-anti-cigana-sempre-funcionou-em-portugal/</link><description>Piménio Ferreira, better known as Gitelles Ferreira, anti-racist militant, 34, physical engineer, national Romani. He is a man with a provocative speech, a corrosive, kind mood and a smile that leaves no one indifferent
Gitelles, we live in an intercultural land and the Gypsies - in particular - have lived about five centuries in Portugal. What is going on for Gypsy communities to remain “on the fringes” of the so -called society? 
The model of society remains to be changed. This is extremely stratified by placing people in subordinate places to privilege a violent minority. The white social structure is patriarchal and racist. What is called the "margin" of society is actually an intrinsic place to it, which belongs to it. In other words, Gypsy people have been included in this model of society since they discovered Europe and its kingdoms. The problem is the model of society that is maintained and the place to which they were relegated and how they were relegated: with violence, in inferior status against whites, without the right to human dignity, to constitute a family, to choose one's own language and religion, expropriated from any and all cultural and material law. A place built and maintained to this day by violence and genocidal and ethnicidal persecution. In 1463, a Gitano Vasco was drowned to an estate. In 1521, Gitans, or Gypsies, were already used as a reference for all that is considered bad in the model of society. The "counter-exemple" in the face of the white that would stand out for the positive. The 'angel' and the 'devil'; the 'other', the enemy; That against whom any attack and persecution is legitimate. Including the prohibition of defending, having weapons, any kind of goods, and the right of permanence.
And is this right to permanence that we still have nomadic gypsy communities within the country is denied?
Yes, no doubt. There are many ways to force nomadism: directly, prohibiting permanence and expelling with police or military force; indirectly, refusing public or private housing to Gypsy people, as they are Gypsy; and even through the gentrification process.
I read the result of an inquiry from the European Union Fundamental Rights Agency, which is said to be approximately 80% of the Gypsies responded to the risk threshold of poverty in their country; One in three Gypsies lives in a housing without channeled water; One in three Gypsies belongs to a family where someone hungry at least once the previous month; and 50% of Gypsies aged 6 to 24 do not attend school. Why does this happen like this? 
It is the historical persecution, which continues. There is no impoverishment that has no external cause. In this case, a political system of total expropriation and imposed on the basis of violence. Already in 1648, D John IV, the restorer, prohibited ‘Giving or Rent houses to Gypsies’. The same D John IV who got the kingdom of Portugal thanks to D. Jerónimo da Costa and his 250 knights. The same D. Jerónimo da Costa who had died to defend Portugal's independence from Castile. Gypsy, like his wife and children. Between prohibitions of permanence, “that do not enter Gypsies in the Kingdom and leave those who are” (D John III, 1526), ​​with expulsions, degred to the galleys, expropriation of goods and properties, imposed with stripping, mutilation and death, systematically performed to this day (still in 2011 Faro City Council wanted to ban Gypsies in the municipality).
The prohibition of working on others (no one employs Gypsy workers, and those who accept they do it in total precariousness, for poorly paid positions and without decent rights and conditions). They cannot be dependent on their own work, they cannot get investment means due to extreme expropriation. Are dependent on precariousness. If you want to know what it is like to live in pure neoliberalism, know the lives of Gypsies. Their reality is paradigmatic of the aggression and depletion to which the "gentlemen" are willing to go to their benefit.
Are you talking about economic and political power?
The group of political, social, cultural and economic power. The owner, the colonizer. This group that has been in power since it established the system of current domination. And that only makes sense within the hierarchically stratified sociopolitical model in which we live. Hence the need to end 'gentlemen' and institute a new model of society, healthy, free, without hierarchies or strata, whether of race, class or gender.
The model we live in leads to the Gypsy (and not only) community to economic exclusion, removing it from access to product consumption or excluding them from its production process; political exclusion associated with lack of access to information; To education and consequently the social exclusion that is seen in inequality of access to quality community areas such as restaurants, libraries, theater, cinema, concerts, health care, etc. How do you feel a gypsy child when you realize that it is not part of a whole? Children who are never represented, neither in movies, nor in books, nor in cartoons, not even in an announcement to eat cereals, for example? Is this a disaster for self-esteem, is a priori condemnation?
The question is that. Gypsy people are not “excluded from society”, by contrast, they are included in it. The problem is the existence of what is cynically called 'social exclusion', which term Orwellian, and there be under coercion, people. Which field of concentration and extermination. Incidentally, Nazi concentration camps are a more visual realization than called 'social exclusion' and, as here, were not a 'excluded' part of Nazi society, but rather its fundamental and characterizing structure. It is a place of violence, where people are maintained by violence, dedicated to their extermination, and designed so that few people can leave. And yet they resist. As in Nazi concentration camps.
And what you have listed as an example of 'consequence' of this 'exclusion', is actually the means by which this exclusion also happens and remains. Gypsy people are out of theaters, both as consumers and producers (but go to the cinema). They are out of school, education and the gym. Either as 'users' or as producers (but go to school and are on the basis of knowledge construction and academic and scientific debates).
Even in attacking Gypsy children's self -confidence, we talk about a maintenance mechanism of this situation. But Gypsy people respond very well: with Gypsy pride. Another resistance, another aggression. Gypsy people are thus included in society. In a place that belongs to this model of modern society. And they resist and contradict the power of domination and make a point of being in the city, in the cinema, in the theater, in the gym, in all spaces. With a lot of struggle and always resisting, but they are there. Social exclusion, more than a “place outside of society”, is part of its social structure.
Do you want to say that there is a collective resistance?
At work, already in a context of absolute precariousness, during the pandemic, Gypsy people rolled up sleeves and showed once again proactivity and creativity in adversity. They learned seeing and doing. And here, it is again the women who jump to the front line, face, learn to use digital tools with their daughters or children, and throw themselves into the network. And so they explore online sales as well as application by application (transportation or rehabs). In housing, in a context of pandemic in which the evictions were not locked - as they owed and dictated the law itself - residents did not fail to organize and fight unjust evictions and claim dignity in housing; associations of allied residents in their action with other housing and anti-racist struggle organizations.
It should also be noted how they reinvented and intensified to raise and distribute dietary goods and kits of masks/alcohol gel to the most expropriated people. Gypsies and non -Gypsies. In the anti-racist struggle, new movements emerged and their actions intensified by social networks. People who had never been organized or militated before began their first steps in activism, thickening this way of the organization and popular gypsy and anti-racist action. People forget, or do not want to value, but Gypsy action has helped determine results in the political dispute. Gypsy citizens mobilized in large and determined electoral results in the municipalities of 2017, both in Alentejo and in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area, even causing electoral earthquakes.
And even in the presidential, second place was resolved by a value equivalent to the estimated number of Gypsy voters. Apart from the non -Gypsy votes that were mobilized by the action of Gypsy voters. Gypsy people are even co-considering power in the spaces of opinion, local media, social networks and party and institutional political dispute. And most importantly, in the popular Ação and alliances with other social movements. We have never stopped fighting for all means and continuing to resist.
In contrast there are more and more hate speeches, from the far right in particular. What do you have to say about it?
To start these speeches are historical and European. Not even current and even less “of the far right”. These speeches have been adopted and rendered for a long time, even in 'democracy and freedom', by several representatives of the center right, conservatives, left center, liberal, liberal left, even representatives of the PCP. Anti-egana rhetoric has always worked in Portugal as it is the whiter rhetoric [white genesis]. That is, it allows you to create and give the "white" as the superior of all. And so please the white electorate who, when feeling well, pays off with his vote. Even if the policies implemented by their elected harm him even more.
Finally, did you like them to talk a little about your personal experience and how did you get to the activist?
I studied, fought for studies, made alliances, graduated, went in the labor market of the “formal precariousness”. I started my militant action and here I am today. We can transform this society a better. This certainty combined with the fact that the current one has so much suffering makes anyone want to have a transformist attitude. I wanted to be 'inventor' (physical engineer) and anti -racist militant. And through study (not necessarily schooling) and organization with others, in turn, with other studies, formations and visions, I learned how the world works and how it can be changed. But before transforming, we need to survive.
Hence two types of actions arise: transformative and survival. The struggle against hate discourse arises as survival, but his defeat will be a transformative victory. There is a lot that - like people who want a better world - we have to do, namely working to criminalize hatred speech; condemn and prohibit organizations with racist discourses and practices; denounce the racist institutional structure and logics that organize power and generate community resources. And in this sense, there have been various types of actions, of petitions, to manifestations. And we need more.
I, besides being a military man in the SOS Racism movement, participate in the “We came to stay” podcast, with Mamadou BA and Joseph da Silva. And if all goes well, we will soon start a new project. With friendly people, we also have the project “Gypsy Initiative”, dedicated to reflecting and promoting transformative movements. Essentially focused on educating against anti-agigarism, denouncing historical and continued genocide and working for a new society project. Also with new projects on the gutter. And finally, there are always voluntary actions without an organization, where I try to share what I found out about anti-egism and Roman history in schools and with interested people. In addition, there is still the struggle for housing, because the evictions did not stop during the pandemic. Due to housing and work precariousness, the subjects racialized especially the Roma nationals are the most vulnerable to COVID-19. There is essential to have actions in this area; Of all the struggles, this is the most structural, as it goes against one of the main enemies of a healthy society: the real estate speculation of this capitalist system, which places profit and goods above people and their humanization.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>GP Macau | FIA confirms GT World Cup</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/28/gp-macau-fia-confirma-taca-do-mundo-de-gt/</link><description>The World Council of the FIA ​​last Wednesday confirmed the expected, that the eighth edition of the FIA ​​GT World Cup will be held as part of the Macao's 72nd Grand Program, from November 13 to 16. However, there is a big news for this year's edition
 
The International Federation, which co-organizes this race in partnership with Sro Motorsports Group and the Macau-China General Automotive Association (AAMC), took the opportunity to announce a new qualification model for the race. In addition to the 30 -minute qualification session equal to the previous editions (Q1), a second qualification segment (Q2) was added, reserved for the top ten pilots of the first session.
The Q2 session will be held in Super Pole format, with each pilot to go to the track individually for a total of two qualification turns, and each pilot is also allowed to use a new tire set at this session. This novelty will allow qualification to be decided without interference from third parties.
The remaining program of the Queen of GT will remain the same as the previous editions, with the free training session, the traditional 12-lap classification race on Saturday afternoon, followed by the 16-lap main race that will decide the world's Cup winner on Sunday.
Veterans compliments
These measures introduced by the FIA ​​were very well received by the most experienced GT riders. This is because traffic has always been a huge obstacle in obtaining a good qualification return on the guide circuit, something essential for those who aim to win this title.
"It's an excellent idea to introduce the Super Pole session in Macao," said German Maro Engel, the winner of the World Cup last edition by Mercedes-AMG. This will be one of the most spectacular and exciting sessions of the season and should also secure sports justice. Fans have a lot to yearn. ”
Raffaele Marciello, for two winning occasions of this trophy, and one of BMW's factory riders, also reacted positively, adding: “In Macao, it was always complicated to make a clean turn. With this new format, you will not hear the excuse of traffic or a red flag. Having only two laps will be very challenging, but now the fastest pilot will probably be in pole. ”
This is an opinion shared by Laurens Vanthoor, the World Cup winner in 2016, who said there will no longer be “apologies” in the qualification. Porsche's experienced Belgian pilot believes that “there will be an added pressure because you only have these two turns”, because in a difficult circuit like this, “if you make an error, there is nothing else to follow. In a normal qualification, you have more opportunities. Personally, a shootout is always something I appreciate a lot. For pilots, on a track like this, it will be almost the highlight of the weekend. ”
And the younger ones too
Chinese pilot Yifei Ye premiered at the Grand Prix last November at the World Cup. Ferrari's official pilot, which competes in the Endurance Fia World Championship (WEC), has left a good impression on the guide circuit, and he also welcomes the now introduced measurements.
“It's good to eliminate these red flag interventions and yellow flags, so that in the end, the one that really is the fastest to get pole position,” said Yifei Ye that she could return to the race this year. “In Macau, everyone is very close in terms of times, so it will be extremely difficult for pilots to try to reach Super Pole. I think it will also be great for viewers. ”</description><pubDate>2025-02-28 01:03:51</pubDate></item><item><title>GP | Célio Alves Dias will continue to run this season</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/24/gp-celio-alves-dias-vai-continuar-a-correr-esta-temporada/</link><description>Macaense pilot Célio Alves Dias was one of the long -term returns of the 2024 car.
 
The Macao Cup winner of Macau in 2021 was removed from motorsport at the time of 2023 for personal reasons, but last year made his debut in the competition that joins the Toyota Gr86 (ZN8) and the Subaru BRZ (ZD8). Despite the vast experience in tests of the specialty, having conducted several generations of tourism cars, Célio Alves Dias had never managed the new bobbinns that the Macao-China General Association (AAMC) introduced in its competition in 2023. Last time turned out to be of learning, with some difficulties in the tuning and behavior of the Japanese car.
Participation in races at the Zhuzhou International Circuit and the Macau Grand Prix made Célio Alves Dias realize that his Toyota GR86 was not at the strongest competition level. Based on the conclusions drawn from these experiences, he decided to start preparing for the new season.
“The car had to be all dismantled. My car was bought on Monday, and the chassis and the security arc, for me, were not well done, ”explained Fu Lei Racing Team pilot to HM. “This, made the car too hard and very difficult to bow. I tried a car from China, which was well assembled, and there is a difference. I had a long time in January, in China, with this car. Our cars, made in the same workshop, were very hard, which made it difficult to make turns fast. ”
If in the Macao Grand Prix, the house riders, excellent guide circuit, managed to equate the progress to their hong Kong opponents and the interior of China, in the initial races on the Zhuzhou track in Hunan province, it wasn't quite like that. “There are many differences between cars, but especially in chassis, because engines, in terms of power and horses, are almost all at the same level. Our opponents also experienced many pieces, many engines, even gearboxes, and chassis. Competition cars are always the same. You have to have engine power, but also chassis. Having only power is not enough. Having better a good chassis is the most important. ”
Silver Jubilee in November
Being a usual Portuguese name in the Macao Grand Prix in recent decades, Célio Alves Dias debuted at the Guide Circuit in 2000 and from then was a frequent presence and no faults in the race until 2023. This year, its objective is to account for its twenty-fifth participation in the biggest sports event of RAEM, but will have to align in the findings.
While awaiting the announcement of the 2025 calendar by AAMC, Célio Alves Dias details details to start his test program, because his Toyota, after being reviewed, "is ready to test" in the interior of China, something that will happen "very soon," says the pilot.
In the last edition of the Grand Prix, Célio Alves Dias qualified in 12th place for the Macau Roadsport Challenge race. However, his participation was short and unhappy: at the wheel of Toyota with dorsal No. 11, was forced to give up after being immobilized on the climb of San Francisco. The Macanese pilot was out of the race on the first lap, in an incident that caused the Safety Car.</description><pubDate>2025-02-24 02:50:53</pubDate></item><item><title>Iame Asia finals of Karting back in December</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/11/finais-da-iame-asia-de-karting-voltam-em-dezembro/</link><description>The Macao Karting International Award will receive again, from December 11 to 14, the Iame Asian finals. Like last year, the coloane karting race will give invitations to the very coveted world end of Iame in 2026.
Organized by the Institute of Sport, Macau-China General Automobile Association (AAMC), Otk Kart Asia and Iame Asia, the 2024 event brought back the international spirit to one of the largest competitions of the sport on the Asian continent. Coloane's karting received several races and different categories of Iame Series Asia, recovering the international prestige of an event that has been the scene of the Cik-Fia World Championship events.
Pilots from the interior of China, Singapore, Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Japan, India, Sri Lanka, Australia, New Zealand, Sweden, Italy, France, Austria, the United States of America, Brazil, Hong Kong, and, of course, Macao, filled the track from the mashes in 2024 for four days of intense Competition, something that has not been seen for several years.
After the success of the previous edition, the formula is repeated this year. Singapore's organization again chooses Coloane's karting for its biggest event of the season, confirming the presence of the usual categories: Cadet, Junior, Senior and Master.
Thank you Macau!
The Iame (Italian American Motor Engineering) is one of the world's leading engine manufacturers for Karting. Founded in 1968 by Bruno Grana, the company is headquartered in Italy and is one of the references in Karting Internacional, having bet strongly in the Asian market in recent years. The presence in Macau is part of this strategy of growth and expansion.
The announcement of the return to the territory was made on social networks: “After an incredible debut in 2024, we are back with the Macao International Award and the Iame Asia final for another epic confrontation! The city of emotions at high speed and legendary races will be the stage again for the best pilots in Asia and around the world! Larger, more bold and even more intense. ”
Satisfied with the reception in 2024, Iame Asia organizers took the opportunity to leave a "huge thanks to AAMC and the Macao government for their continuous support and confidence to make it possible!"
In addition to the Macao test, the 2025 calendar of Iame Series Asia includes three events in Malaysia and three events in Thailand. However, for the first time, last weekend of March, the Iame Asia Cup will be held at the International Shanghai Circuit Karting.</description><pubDate>2025-03-11 01:04:32</pubDate></item><item><title>Return to GIC | Local tests return to Zhaoqing</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/10/regresso-ao-gic-provas-locais-voltam-a-zhaoqing/</link><description>The dates for the Macao of Tourism Car Championship (MTCs in the English acronym) were made known on the past Friday by the General Automóvel Association of Macau-China (AAMC) through a newsletter. The competition for local pilots and decides to find out the Macao Grand Prix in November will again return to the Guangdong International Circuit (GIC).
After a year when the MTCS headed to the Zhuzhou International Circuit in Hunan province, AAMC listened to most of the territory pilots and chose to make these important races closer to the main interveners' house - the pilots. In recent years, the circuit of the surroundings of Zhaoqing has been the preferred stage for the realization of these races, due to the proximity and the fact that it serves as an operational basis to most teams.
The first of the two events scheduled for the 2025 MTCS is scheduled from 18 to 20 April, while the second round is scheduled from 16 to 18 May. The AAMC newsletter says that "all riders must go through a selection process before they can participate in the 72nd edition of the Macao Grand Prix - Macau Touring Car Challenge."
Registration, for the competition that joins the Toyota Gr86 (ZN8) and the Subaru BRZ (ZD8), are open until March 29 and after the end of the registration period, "all applications will be subject to AAMC approval, which reserves the final right to accept or reject any registration."
The technical regulation was also published, as was officially confirmed the use of tires of the Italian brand Pirelli, which belongs to the Chinese conglomerate Sinochem, as had already happened on the last edition of the Macao Grand Prix.
Confirmation of the Great Bay
AAMC also confirmed the two findings for the GT Cup - Great Bay Race (GT4), which will be concomitant with the new Chinese Championship Sro GT Cup. The first race will be played from March 21 to 23, at the International Circuit of Shanghai, in the Formula 1 China Grand Prix. Zhuhai International. Also here Pirelli will be the only tire supplier.
These two tests will be determined for the big holiday party on the guide circuit, and it is defined that only 28 cars will be accepted on the starting grid in the mashed race.

After welcoming TCR China by 2024, the FIA ​​TCR World Tour “worldwide” will have the company of the Australian competitors in the most demanding race of the season, as HM had already foreseen at the end of last year.
This announcement is the second news in the calendar of one of the largest national TCR competitions in the world, after the announcement of a new promoter for the championship.
One pilot who was certainly pleased with the news was Australian Ben Bargwanna, who ran on the streets of Macao in 2023. TCR Australia's first international participation was made possible by the global rights holder, the WSC Group, which will ensure full transportation costs for Australian teams traveling to Macau.
"TCR Australia has always been one of TCR's most important and exciting competitions, rooted in the long tradition of tourism motorsport in the country," said WSC Group president Marcello Lotti. The Italian businessman made it clear that “when logistical issues forced us to cancel the Australian rounds of Kumho Fia TCR World Tour last year, we immediately started working to return in 2025. It is fantastic to extend cooperation for a second event and offer Australian competitors the unique opportunity to finish the season in Macau.”
Other applause
TCR Australia Prosecutor David Sonenscher, an old acquaintance of Macao, highlighted the importance of the moment for the category.
"I am very happy to bring TCR Australia to one of the most iconic circuits in the world and certainly one of the biggest challenges for a pilot," said former Malaysian-based English driver and entrepreneur and co-founder of TCR Asia. “The opportunity to expand our cooperation with the TCR World Tour FIA and to show the talented Australian riders on the highest international stage in Macau demonstrates the unique opportunity that TCR Australia and the TCR Global Platform provide all participants.”
Confirmation of the presence of TCR Australia in the Guide Race should not be impeded to the participation of local pilots and the interior of China in the most celebrated tourist car race on the Asian continent.</description><pubDate>2025-02-19 01:54:58</pubDate></item><item><title>Motorcycling | FHO RACING WITH NEW FOCUS IN 2025</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/13/motociclismo-fho-racing-com-novo-foco-em-2025/</link><description>Doubts dissipated this week. Macau's businesswoman Foye Ho's FHO Racing will continue to active in the 2025 season, but without the initially announced riders. Peter Hickman and Davey Todd are leaving and goes to a new team called 8ten Racing
 
According to a statement sent by FHO Racing, BMW Motorrad UK has restructured its training for the 2025 British Superbike Championship, and FHO Racing BMW will compete with a single pilot aboard a BMW M 1000 RR. German 2024 Superbike Champion and Resistance World Cup driver, Ilya Mikhalchik, will make his debut in the British competition, at a time when team owner Faye Ho, realinhas the objectives of his team “to explore new activities in motorized new markets, with the support of BMW Motorrad Motorsport”.
Currently in his fifth year at the British Superbike Championship Paddock, Faye Ho has been a strong presence in the British competition, as well as in the popular road races, such as the Macao Grand Prix, as well as supporting several young female riders, helping them progress in their careers since the lower classes. Faye Ho, Stanley Ho's granddaughter and Clementina Leitão, has supported Kate Walker and Jamie Hanks-Bliott on BMW F 900 R Cup and, it seems, which will continue to support.
To be
Contrary to the rumors that put her from Paddock's departure, Faye Ho made it clear that she is a “great advocate of the British Superbike Championship, one of the world's most exciting and competitive competitions” and will keep her commitment to discipline. However, the territory entrepreneur now has new objectives for herself and its structure. The future will be in Asia and support for young female talents.
"Given my long -term objectives, which include expanding motor sport activities in Asia and continuing to support young women in motorcycling, I realized that I cannot dedicate the same time, to the British Superbike Championship and the road races, which I gave them since I became the owner of the team in 2021, due to additional commitments I have in Macao," Faye Ho said.
Another chapter
This announcement has put an end to a successful partnership, particularly on the island of Man TT, between Peter Hickman, four times winner of the Macao Motorcycle Grand Prix, and Fho Racing. Hickman left some words of thanks to his now former boss.
“I want to leave a huge thanks to Faye [Ho] and Fho Racing for all they have done for me over the past four years,” Hickman wrote in a Facebook social network post. “As it is normal in motorized sport, we had amazing moments and others more difficult, but Fho has always been and always will be a fundamental part of my career. I will be eternally grateful for this opportunity. ”
The new 8Ten Racing team, which will be officially presented on February 26, will be mostly composed of former FHO Racing elements. Hickman and Todd will maintain the important support of BMW Motorrad UK and are expected on the big prize starting grid in November.</description><pubDate>2025-02-13 01:30:05</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
