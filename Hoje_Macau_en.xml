The session, which has free admission, is co-organized by the Yunnan Tea Trader Association in Macao, and has the participation of guest speakers Chen Haoyan, founder of that institution; Zheng Zhanpeng, founder of Tea Company Lao Ban Zhang, Ltd. de Menghai; and Xu Yanting, heiress of the ethnic tea brand “Fire Pond Boiling Water”.
The doctor, writer, and usual presence at FRC events, Shee Va will attend the simultaneous interpretation between the Mandarin, Cantonese and Portuguese languages.
According to the FRC, the event aims to promote the understanding of the history and origins of the “Lao Ban Zhang” tea from the village with the same name in Menghai County in the southwest of Yunnan province, near the Myanmar border.
Located in a mountainous area of ​​1,700 to 1,900 meters of altitude, with an average annual temperature of 18.7 degrees Celsius, Lao Ban Zhang produces one of the rarest and appreciated types of tea Pu'er. Local minorities, such as the BU Lang tribe, have been responsible for tea plantations for centuries in this high region, which remains almost half of the year covered by a dense fog.
Tea Pu'er is a variety of traditional fermented tea from Yunnan Province, China, produced from the leaves of the Camellia Sinensis var. ASSAMEMICA. In the context of the production of this variety of Chinese tea, fermentation refers to the microbial process that usually happens after tea leaves have been sufficiently dry and curled in the form of “wet stacking”, allowing them to remain oxidizing until desired flavors are reached.
The final test
The dissemination of Yunnan's tea art and culture also includes a demonstration and tasting ceremony of “seven infusions”, which will be shared with the public at the FRC gallery, allowing lovers to know their authentic flavor.
"Most products currently sold, supermarkets and tea houses, are not pure tea. Consumers are simply buying a rolled -up tea cake on a piece of silk paper, not pure bingdao tea, Lao Ban Zhang or other varieties. The result is a bad and bitter flavor," explains the organizers of the session.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>DSEDJ | Manuals should look at the country's linguistic political</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/18/dsedj-manuais-devem-olhar-politica-linguistica-do-pais/</link><description>Cheang Sek Kit, head of the Curriculum Development and Evaluation Division of the Directorate of Youth Education and Development Services (DSEDJ), argued that the elaboration of didactic materials is an important measure to implement the country's linguistic policy, and should adapt to the needs of Macao's educational development.

The agreement was announced after almost seven hours of meeting between the representatives of university students and deputies of the National Congress of Reconstruction of Timor-Leste (CNRT, power), the Revolutionary Front of Timor-Leste Independent (Fretilin), the Democratic Party (PD), the Popular Liberation Party (PLP) and Khunto.</description><pubDate>2025-09-18 04:37:55</pubDate></item><item><title>Hotels | Online promotions result in two burles</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/18/hoteis-promocoes-online-resultam-em-duas-burlas/</link><description>Two people were circumvented at 4,784 patacas, after reserving hotel rooms through social networking ads.

Seduced by the price, the woman accepted the conditions and was made available to read a QR code as a form of payment. Since your MPay was limited to 3,000 patacas transfers at a time, made a transfer first in this amount.
However, unlike expected, the account was associated with a number of Hong Kong. For this reason, the woman suspected the event and immediately stopped the transfer.

Emperor Wanli (1572-1620), named Zhu Yijun, had an underground palace built to be his tomb, whose value spent would allow feeding ten million people for a year. The decay was prevailed and the population lived in misery. He was forced to pay high incomes and fees, which led the peasants to revolt and take up arms to protect themselves.
In 1627 a peasant revolt began north of Shaanxi, which extended to Shanxi and Henan. In 1635, heads of armed groups of peasants met in Xingyang, Henan province, to plan a strategy. Li Zicheng, one of the leaders, with his army of peasants occupied Xian in 1644, and the entire province of Shaanxi, having formed the state of Dashun. Then he left east and passing by Shanxi and Hebei, began to Beijing, which led the last emperor of the Ming Dynasty, Chongzhen (1628-44), who was also called Zhu Yijun, taking refuge on Mount Wansui (Hill of Long Life), located in the northern part of the Imperial Palace. Then it was 43 days, but all efforts failed and without a solution to the complicated situation, the emperor hanged himself. China was out of imperial government for a few months, a period known for the interregnum Shun.
Ming troops fought the rioters peasants in many parts of China and a small ming cut moved to Nanjing, now with the name of Yingtian, creating the South Ming Dynasty.
The Manchus had their ancestors on the Nuzhen tribe, which in the Song had formed the Jin dynasty and lived in the Northeast many centuries from the mountains of Altai. In 1616, they joined the command of Nurhachi and in 1636, his son Huangtaiji formed the state of Qing. With an increasingly strong military body, he was preparing to invade China. For a long time, the Manchus troops were being parked along the borders with the territory of the Ming Dynasty.
General Ming, Wu Sangui, who ruled the passage of Shanhaiguan, surrendered to the Manchus and let them go through the great wall so that the Ming troops, together with the Manchus, to fight the rebels. Li Zicheng had to leave Beijing and, heading west, to Shanxi, was chased by the Manchus and Ming troops that had united. He was killed in Hubei, at the age of 39.
After the Manchus troops crossed the great wall with the help of Wu Sangui, they found China without a dynasty on the dragon throne a few months ago. In 1644, the Manchus occupied Beijing and stopped their capital, which until then was in Shenyang. Many Ming officers, who hitherto cooperated with the Manchus against the peasants, changed to their side, fighting the invaders Manchus.
With the last Emperor of the Ming Dynasty killed in 1644, the small Ming Court settled in Nanjing and then formed the South Ming Dynasty (1644-1662). Zhu Yousong, prince of Fu, becomes Emperor Hong Guang (1644-1645) and freed from the prison Zhu Yujian, convicted since 1636, when he was withdrawn the title of Prince of Tang.
Yingtian (Nanjing) was captured in June 1645 by the Qing forces and the ming court fled again. Divided into the South Ming Dynasty, part goes to Shaoxing (Zheijiang) and another refugee in Fuzhou, where Emperor Long Wu (1645 -1646) climbs, whose name was also Zhu Yujian, Prince of Tang. He belonged to the eighth descendant generation of the third son of the first Emperor of the Ming Dynasty and had the hope of being able to defeat the Manchus, who already formed the Qing Dynasty.
Macau and the Ming Resistance
With the antecedents explained, we come to the period of the story that interests us to study to recognize the character linked to the Ming who hides behind the god Zhu of Xian, whose belief of his protection has great power.
Until 1660 there was a resistance from the Chinese Han to the Manchus, where Macau has placed himself, sending several times military detachments, with cannons, to help the Ming Dynasty, which had opened the doors of the middle country.
In 1630, paid by the Ming Court, they departed from Macao four hundred Portuguese towards the Great Wall, but when they were in Jiangxi they were interrupted in their march due to the intrigue of Canton merchants with the provincial mandarins.
In 1643, a cannon and four top scorers are sent from Macau to Guangzhou and Nanjing, which between 1644 and 1645, receives the court that runs out after the Manchu invasion.
Following the conquest of Beijing by Manchus, the loyal forces to the Ming Dynasty again ask for help from the Portuguese and therefore, in 1646, Nicolau Ferreira joins the last southern Ming Emperor, Yang Li. He reigned for a period of fifteen years, being captured in early 1662, when the second Emperor Qing, Kang XI, had been in power for a year.
Macau remained faithful to Ming and good relationships with resistance forces, led since 1644 by Zheng Chenggong. Whether this name tells us little or nothing, the Coxinga is more recognized by those who use history, although both represent the same person.
Coxinga's name was given to Zheng Chenggong by the Dutch, who heard him in Taiwan from the mouth of the inhabitants of Fujian, where the mini dialect and the Kejia of the Hakka people, who called him Kok Sèng Iâ. Coxinga, whose birth name was Zheng Sen and then passed to Zheng Fu Song and only in 1645 moved to Zheng Chenggong, was the son of a former inhabitant of Macao, with the Christian name of Nicholas Gaspar. Coxinga's father, Zheng Zhilong (1604-61), born in Fujian, had spent some time as a young man in Macau, where he was converted and baptized. After recognizing the good money in trade, Nicholas Gaspar again as Zhilong, joined a group of pirates, who attacked mainly Dutch, headquartered in Taiwan and Chinese merchants, still making trade with Japan. And it is in Japanese Mother, who was born Zheng Fu Song's Zheng Sen (1624-83). The father, Zheng Zhilong in 1628 he was dedicated to the attack of Chinese Qing ships, fighting for Ming. Already his son, who had spent his first seven years of life in Japan, then will pick him up to be with him living in Fujian. At 15, Zheng Fu Song studied in Nanjing Guo Zhi Jian and in 1645, at the age of 21, studied at Beijing Guo Zhi Jian.
Zheng Zhilong was the most powerful ally of Emperor Long Wu (1645-1646) with whom he had a great friendship, since he had helped him to arrive at the emperor. By the faithfulness of both Zheng Zhilong and the son, the emperor, in Fuzhou, in 1645, attributes his family name, Zhu, Zheng Fu Song, which thus has the official name of Zhu Chenggong. Despite this name means “Zhu Success” in 1646, with the Qing Army victories in the center of China and Fujian, Emperor Long Wu on October 6 was captured and executed.
The Manchus bought Zheng Zhilong to be at their service and it accepts. His son, angry by the parent having passed to the Manchus hosts, refuses to abandon the Ming and with others from his father's group, ruled Fujian's back since 1646.
Emperor Longwu's younger brother, Zhu Yuyue, escaping by a boat from Fuzhou arrives in Guangzhou where he founded a Ming state, having on December 11, 1646 with the title of Shao Wu reign. But after a month, Li Chengdong, a former commander of the South Ming Dynasty, who led a small group of Qing troops, captured and killed Shao Wu. Little by little, the Qing dynasty occupies the entire Chinese territory.
The siege by the Manchus Guangzhou (Canton), which lasted ten months and ended on November 25, 1650, caused 70,000 dead. It was a great axed to Ming resistance that, in the eastern part of China, was confined only to the sea. Then, the armed commander, Zheng Chenggong, is defeated in 1659 at the Yangtzé River estuary. After this battle, Coxinga returns to Fujian and from there in front of 25,000 people to Taiwan, where after a nine -month siege take the island to the Dutch in April 1661. So many inhabitants of Fujian went to live in Taiwan.
In 1662, Zheng Chenggong died of illness at 38, but Taiwan only moves to the Qing dominance in 1683, when he is conquered to his grandson.
Coxinga behind Zhu da Xian
The history of this period, briefly presented here, transports us to Coxinga, a name given by the Dutch from what they heard from the Fujian Chinese call the Kok Sèng Iâ.
Analyzing the name Coxinga, which in Mandarin is Guo Xing Ye and in Cantonense, Kok Sèng Iâ, we have for Guo (国) the meaning of country, to Xing (姓) the family name and for Ye (爷), respectful way of calling an elder, an officer, the father or grandfather, the parents or grandparents, linked to the representation of power. This means that Kok Xing represents the nickname of the Emperor of China that was Zhu, in the Ming Dynasty.
In 1645, Emperor Long Wu gives Zheng Fu Song the name of Zhu and therefore had the official name of Zhu Chenggong, who wanted to mean "successful Ming Dynasty." It was only used in official documents and only the emperor could call him that, because Zhu was the nickname of those who ruled in the Ming Dynasty. Normally called Zheng Guoxing and with greater respect Guo Xing Ye, the Zhu reference was hidden from this great character to the Ming Dynasty, especially when it was the Manchu Dynasty Qing that ruled.
The god Zhu of Xian, which means great immortal Zhu, is also connected with Fujian and both linked to the nickname Zhu, the family name of the ming emperors. Therefore, there seemed to be something to unite them, but because it could not be revealed, due to the Manchu dominion then the enemy of the Han, had to hide Coxinga on the cover of a god to worship him.
Still in the South Ming Dynasty, Emperor Yong Li (24/12/1646-20/1/1647) gave Zheng Chenggong the title of Yan Ping Wang.
Attempts to rehabilitate Ming Dynasty, the Manchus consolidated in power in China, when Zheng Guoxing's descendants wrote to the second Emperor of the Qing Dynasty, Kangxi (1661-1722), asking Zhu Chenggong, who was in Taiwan, for the province of Fujian.
Emperor Kangxi wrote to them that, although Zhu Chenggong does not belong to his supporters, he allowed his body to come to Nan An in Fujian, his father's homeland Zheng Zhilong (1604-1661).
Since Zhu Chenggong was against the reigning Qing Dynasty, only narrated in the book Fujian Tong Zhi in 1737 in the period of the reign of Qianlong.
Lastly, our hypothesis of Zhu from Xian being Zhu Chenggong seems to be understood in 1875. Emperor Guangxu of the Qing dynasty, from the title of King Yan Ping awarded to Zhu Chenggong by the Ming Dynasty, passed him to God, Yan Ping Jun Wang. But since it did not belong to the supporters of this dynasty, it was called Zhu da Xian, thus hiding the name of Guo Xing Ye, which had great power. In the same year, the emperor offered the renewal of the Kai Shan Wang Temple, which now has the god Yan Ping Jun Wang.
Thus we believe, with these little explanations, to be able to put this God, Zhu of Xian, Deity to Cushion.  We found in Macau the statue of Zhu da Xian in the Temple of Pau Kong, in Rua da Figueira.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>António Graça de Abreu</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/autor/antonio-graca-abreu/</link><description>Text and Translation António Graça de Abreu
Writing about the nymphs and muses of Luís de Camões (oh, the Chinese dynamic of Camões!), Recently remembered my friend and editor Manuel S. Fonseca: “Who are the muses (from Os Lusíadas): will be a twenty Angelina Jolies or Scarlett Johassons to blow sweetness to the ear of Camões?”
Two hundred years after Camões, muses, nymphs, Chinese beauties, wives and concubines, soft eroticism in the poetry of an exceptional eighteenth -century poet Yuan Mei (1716–1797) now translated.

Candles and flowers in the bridal pavilion
In the Pavilion of the Marriage,
the light of candles between the flowers.
Opens the silk robe, spring spring.
Golden hair pins of your hair,
reflexes of light in the soft breasts,
The skin, white and fresh as snow.
As early as 1515, in his eastern short, Leiriense Tomé Pires spoke of the Chinese women: “They cast many gold nails into the hair (…) are from our whiteness and have small and other eyes. And noses as they are.”

The light of the dawn has not yet reached its garments,
Of the undone hair, such as clouds, a jade pin falls.

And she asks, "Who was the man of my dream?"

The flowery skirt falls,
Perfumes flutter in the air.
Clouds

For a beauty
You departed for uncertain place,
Since then, two or three on my bed.
The perfume of flowers,
Break my late dreams.
The bruxulear of the fire in the lamp
Accompanies my smile.
As the Mexican Octavio Paz says (1914-1998), the Nobel Prize for Literature, in his very rare memory of a threesome, “in bed, there were only three: she, he and the moon.”

不记灯前笑语繁
Return, at night
Advances the silence of the night,

Afternoon
The Seta of the afternoon, the dream,
The corner of spring on the pillow on the bed.

Still your thin silk skirt.

The shadow of flowers
The window hidden in the shadow of the flowers,
A slight moonlight illuminates the night.
Lying in the fragrant room,
We talk about loves of the past,
In a low voice, not to scare the swallows.
Deviation to your delicate hand into the silk cord.
夜饮
灯下佳人笑语频
酒香微暖入罗巾
拥衾不觉鸡声起
窗外桃花又一春
Drinking at night
In light of Almotolia,
The beauty does not stop laughing, of speaking,
The odors of wine moist their embroidered scarf.
Embraced under the silk covers,
We didn't even hear the singing of the roosters.
Flower peaches announce another spring.
The empty room
I got sick last year during the fall rains,
Tomaste accounts for me for two months,
Exhausted, day and night in light of the lamp.
Winds blown from the West, I recovered my health,
but quiet your jade pins,
Sad the empty room, the window forever closed.
In the year 1754, Yuan Mei got sick with malaria. Concubine Tao, which the poet estimated very much, took care of him with enormous dedication. He died the following year, suddenly 29 years old. Yuan Mei then wrote six brief poems in his memory, one of them the latter translated here.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>PAULO MAIA AND CARMO</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/autor/paulomaiaecarmo/</link><description>Li Shimin (626-649), Emperor Taizong, the second of the Tang Dynasty, had the words, which valued more than precious stones, gold or any other transactive material wealth, recognizing their unique capacity as an instrument of the spirit to act in the physical world.
He caressed a few words in particular. One of them designates a tree, Ziwei, the "marta de crepe" (Lagerstroemia indicates) that in addition to the beauty of its wrinkled texture flowers such as the crepe paper and a color that goes from white to rosy, from mallow to purple, has other rare characteristics such as flowering in summer and fall, where its alternative name Bairo Hong, "a hundred days". But it also functioned as a homophony in the expression Zwei Leng, "humble purple star server" (the emperor) a way to designate an official post in the great secretariat of the Taizong government whose empire praised faithfulness, as seen in the title of his era of his reign Zhenguan, "observing loyalty."
Poet Ba Juyi (772-846), who was a loyal imperial employee, becoming governor of Hangzhou and Luoyang, would take advantage of the double meaning of the word in a poem that can be translated as:
In the wire pavilion,
where they are written edicts,
Nothing urgent to write.
The clock drum sounds in the tower,
But time is lengthened in the clepsidra.
Sitting at twilight,
Who will do me company?
Only the flowers of the murta (zweihua)
respond to the employee
of service to the purple star.
The autumn flowering of the tree made it a metaphor adjusted for literate people who lived in the hope of one day to leave the official duties, a utopia that had the poet Tao Qian (365-427), the "hidden", as a model, to dedicate themselves only to the brush arts. Of these, the painting often figured out the delicate flowers that insisted on extending the summer, impressing painters who dedicated themselves to the genus Niaohua, of "birds and flowers".
Zhou Zhimian (1570-1606), a Changshu painter (Jiangsu), was distinguished in this specialty, using in some cases a combination of processes to show the longs for the first cold flowers.
In a painting made in the shape of a folding range (paint and color on gold paper, 17.2 x 47 cm, sold on Christies) he used the Moga Fa of the painting "without bones" where the paint or color are used without contours, "staining" the paper to figure petals and branches but also the precision of the trace to outline slots.
Differently, the method is suitable for the Ziweihua flowers that share with the emperor the word Zi, "purple" and "northern star", the terrestrial address of the celestial emperor that Taizong, attentive to words, used in the form of poems to create ties or praise behaviors.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>ANA CRISTINA ALVES</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/autor/ana-cristina-alves/</link><description>ANA CRISTINA ALVES

Among vacation readings, I had the opportunity to reread philosopher José Gil Portugal today.  The fear of existing (2017) and I could not help but amaze with the timeliness of many of its reflections on the way of being of the Portuguese, still currently 21 years about the first edition of the work in 2004. The reasons for our being in the world are due to a number of determining factors for collective development that attach to religious and policies that are not favorable to the development of philosophical, critical and scientific spirit Quental so well saw in causes of the decay of peninsular peoples, in a conference presented in the Lisbonense Casino Room on May 27, 1871. It would be resumed and theme by the philosopher João Maurício Brás in Portuguese delay: way of being or being (2022). Here it is argued that we are not late, since there is no essentialist determination to the fact, but we are, as a manner of being collective, delayed in relation to the European model we have followed since 1985/1986. We have lacked great thinkers and scientists in the last three centuries and we have been turning into passivity shortly after the discoveries, reassembling, from the religious point of view that succeeded to the Council of Trent, held between 1545 and 1563.
He did not adhere to the Protestant Reform and paid a philosophical price so, measured in a lack of critical spirit, lack of scientific boldness and absence of initiative and stamina, in which we had both exceeded to the great venture of the discoveries.
To this religious limitation, there were unfavorable political and economic factors, such as the persistence of autocratic political tendencies, which would culminate in Salazarism and the counterproductive factor of the apparent “gift” of riches obtained from abroad, specifically the colonies, which did not develop us internally, since everything we needed were first, first from outside, first India, after Brazil and last, as well noted the thinker João Brás from the “New India”, the European Union, this manna through which millions continue to drain.
The truth is that so that they do not dilute themselves into more “fumes in India”, it will be necessary to know what to do with them, how to apply them correctly in the country's renovation and modernization plans. We are still in the phase of the three "you" of the 2025 revolution, according to João Brás, an opinion that shares. Portugal needs to continue to develop, decolonize, that is, to believe that one can create wealth from within, and democratize, that is, to exercise critical thinking, without "fear of existing". The thinking movement has begun and the philosophical hordes have been thickening since Fernando Pessoa, Teixeira de Pascoaes, passing by Eduardo Lourenço, José Gil, Viriato Soromenho-Marques, João Brás, Adriana Serrão, Paulo Borges, Carlos João Correia, Pedro Calafate, among many others and others.
When reading José Gil, I came across one or two unavoidable paragraphs for those who have been dedicated to Chinese studies:
A French diplomat who had lived long years in China and later in Portugal said the Portuguese were "the Chinese of the West." And he explained: the Chinese never go directly to the subject, go around and more laps before they arrive and always in veiled terms. The Portuguese do the same: they approach indirectly, travel through spirals, glimpse and baroque ways to clearly address the issue. (GIL, 2017, 66)
There are, in fact, some similarities in the way of being of the Portuguese and Chinese, especially in terms of social relationships. Neither Portuguese nor Chinese like to directly confront people, let alone the hierarchical superiors, the boss is always right, at least until he turns his back, barely turning them is the target of the worst slander. Non -confrontation is not just a matter of cowardice for Portuguese and Chinese. There is a natural softness in the Portuguese and cultivated in the Chinese, by a long confusion tradition of control of emotions, with a view to the creation of a harmonious environment. As for the Portuguese, who better witness than Antero de Quental unsuspecting? It distinguished us, as one of the fundamental characteristics of pre-decadence, qualities reassembling the Middle Ages, including “charity triumphed from the disgust and prejudices of race and belief” (Quental, 2010, 12).
The softness in the name of harmony and good living is then a feature shared by Chinese and Portuguese, who have or had another remarkable affinity, the importance of the family as the basis and support of the social pyramid. This will lose ground to each other, the result of the great social changes, printed in China, first by the Communist Revolution of 1949, in which the popular masses and the collectivity would go to the foreground, then by the Reform and Opening Movement (1978/9) designed by Deng Xiaoping (1904-1997), which combined socialism with the market economy and the development of a middle class to be more and more and more and more Selfish and individualistic, as António Caeiro says in new things in China - "I change soon" the emergence of the Chinese middle class is the greatest history of our time "(2015, 28), based on data from Forbes Magazine of 2011.
It is undeniable that the Chinese nowadays are very close to individualism of the Portuguese. There is another trait that shares by tradition and that drives them away today, love for theoretical thinking, formalities and formalisms.  However, the result of a brutal trauma in the nineteenth century, the two wars of opium (1839-1842; 1856-60), the authorities and the Chinese thinkers and philosophers, such as Sun Yat-sen, Feng Yulan (馮友蘭/冯友兰 ， 1895 -1990), among others, encouraged the countrymen to learn science with the Westerners in the name of modernization. Today China has a scientific elite already with its own thinking and without the need to follow western models, which is one of the factors, coupled with the fight against corruption and the development of a model of science as ecological as possible, which maintains the communist party in the country's government leadership, making its political system difficult to describe to great authors like Francis Fukuyama: it is called many names as “red capitalism”, 2015, 2015 174/5), which is not a democracy in the western way, nor a dictatorship in the classic way, but rather a country ruled by a party “-of revolutionary party, the CCP has become a leading party of a process of modernization.
Before it was the forefront of the proletariat, today directs the nation ”(Caeiro, 2015: 42), according to the opinion of many Chinese. That is, while having a plan for the modernization of the country, especially in educational and scientific-technological terms, which includes the fight against social inequalities and the endemic problem of corruption and promotes a strong middle class, the Chinese government will not be discussed. Especially scientific and are on the front line in many technological sectors. And in this respect there was a great distance from its traditional way of being, which emphasized aesthetic and, above all poetic, as well as free knowledge, culminating in a immense repetition of the classics, which extended from antiquity to the early twentieth century.
There is, however, an interesting feature to be emphasized in the Chinese way of being, which, guided by the principle of transformation, important philosophical and cultural pillar, changes without changing. How is this possible? Keeping their essential structures intact. “The old and the new are confused. 'Historical' areas are rebuilt from the root, 'new old buildings' replace the old. Instead of preserving, destroying and then the same is the same' (Caeiro. 2015, 14).
The principle of transformation allows change, but not radical, from the point of view of mentalities, for example, and regarding the categories of interiority vs. there is a background that remains in a civilization used to cultivating interiority. Think of the religious mindset, formed by centuries of meditation, favored by the Taoist and Buddhist schools. Transcendence does not emerge as an outer deity, it is inside and when the meditator turns inland finds the divine in itself.
And it is precisely the inner/ outer relationship that most distinguishes the modes of Portuguese and Chinese, both from a religious and philosophical point of view, the Portuguese deity is exterior and in the philosophical world has always been careful to separate the transcendent and the immanent, the subject and the object, etc.  Therefore, in the way of being Portuguese the exteriority was crucial in philosophy and science, at least in the last centuries, since everything that comes from outside is extraordinary and good, read by the excellent article of Fernando Pessoa “the Portuguese mental case”, in which this idolatry and flattering of the foreigner is classified without contemplation by the pursusing poet as “provincialism”; But on the positive side, this trend can be perspective as a driving and inspiring soul force from the geographical and scientific points of view, since “our expansion” allowed the development of scientific and experimental thinking, remembered the words of João Brás “the capacity for initiative and even avant-garde we found in the 15th and 16th centuries” (Brás, 2022: 114) Good to live at the expense of third parties. When he is aware of China's history and geography, it is noted that the expansionist moments were minimal, based on the occupation of border territories, a spread from within and not an output out. And when they launched abroad, they did so in the fifteenth century with the help of a fleet led by a Muslim, not to occupy territories, but to make diplomatic efforts to surrounding countries and even eastern Africa. It should be added that, especially in the nineteenth century the Chinese would become much pressured by the poor economic situation, the result of the wars, to emigrate and imitate the foreigner, in the midst of the Chinese considered of decay.
Portuguese and Chinese have a great respect for their ancient historical traditions and heroes and both peoples are confronted with the urge to modernize, however, the Chinese have been more effective in the answers found, perhaps because they did not forget the last centuries under the yoke of a foreign dynasty, by the wars and turbulence they had to overcome, and he resulted a capacity to outburst long plans. Deadline that contributed to society to mobilize and accept reforms, reading them as a true possibility of socioeconomic emancipation, by promoting a middle class avid a knowledge that once belonged only to the elites, as well as the Chinese meritocratic system was good for everyone, the truth was that it had to have the “shadow” privilege of the aristocracy.
The way to be Portuguese will only approach the Chinese again when the need for development and modernization, which will inevitably go through the implementation of reforms, is assumed by each of us in a conscious and organized way, as they already asked them Antero de Quental and the generation of 70 in the late nineteenth century, which will not be that difficult to happen, if each of us prepare for ethical transformation, but are not necessary exceptional people, but they are not necessary: Self-responsibility, civism, critical and demanding spirit, the idea that change begins mainly with each of us. ” (Brás, 2022, 110) 2.

The session, which has free admission, is co-organized by the Yunnan Tea Trader Association in Macao, and has the participation of guest speakers Chen Haoyan, founder of that institution; Zheng Zhanpeng, founder of Tea Company Lao Ban Zhang, Ltd. de Menghai; and Xu Yanting, heiress of the ethnic tea brand “Fire Pond Boiling Water”.
The doctor, writer, and usual presence at FRC events, Shee Va will attend the simultaneous interpretation between the Mandarin, Cantonese and Portuguese languages.
According to the FRC, the event aims to promote the understanding of the history and origins of the “Lao Ban Zhang” tea from the village with the same name in Menghai County in the southwest of Yunnan province, near the Myanmar border.
Located in a mountainous area of ​​1,700 to 1,900 meters of altitude, with an average annual temperature of 18.7 degrees Celsius, Lao Ban Zhang produces one of the rarest and appreciated types of tea Pu'er. Local minorities, such as the BU Lang tribe, have been responsible for tea plantations for centuries in this high region, which remains almost half of the year covered by a dense fog.
Tea Pu'er is a variety of traditional fermented tea from Yunnan Province, China, produced from the leaves of the Camellia Sinensis var. ASSAMEMICA. In the context of the production of this variety of Chinese tea, fermentation refers to the microbial process that usually happens after tea leaves have been sufficiently dry and curled in the form of “wet stacking”, allowing them to remain oxidizing until desired flavors are reached.
The final test
The dissemination of Yunnan's tea art and culture also includes a demonstration and tasting ceremony of “seven infusions”, which will be shared with the public at the FRC gallery, allowing lovers to know their authentic flavor.
"Most products currently sold, supermarkets and tea houses, are not pure tea. Consumers are simply buying a rolled -up tea cake on a piece of silk paper, not pure bingdao tea, Lao Ban Zhang or other varieties. The result is a bad and bitter flavor," explains the organizers of the session.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Finance | Portugal withdraws Hong Kong from the list of tax havens</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/08/financas-portugal-retira-hong-kong-da-lista-de-paraisos-fiscais/</link><description>From January 1, 2026, Hong Kong will no longer be part of the Portuguese tax paradise list, such as Liechtenstein and Uruguay. The authorities in the neighboring region have long called for the withdrawal, including official visits to Portugal. The Portugal-Hong Chamber of Commerce and Industry Kong emphasizes the decision consistent with the position of the European Union
 
The Hong Kong government has finally seen the desire, expressed several times, to leave the list of tax havens in Portugal. The change will be a reality from January 1, 2026, taking into account the ordinance published on Friday by the Ministry of Finance in the Diário da República.
According to this document, Hong Kong is no longer included in the list of “clearly more favorable tax regimes”, the official name of the list commonly known as the “Fiscal Paradise List”.
It reads at the Ordinance, signed by the Secretary of State for Tax Affairs, Claudia Reis Duarte, that “the governments of the Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong, the Principality of Liechtenstein and the East Republic of Uruguay drove formal requests” to the “revision of their framing in the list, which were the subject of positive opinions elaborated by the Tax and Customs Authority”. The withdrawal of these three countries and territories is officially on January 1 of next year.
Thus, the Portuguese Government considers that the conditions are verified to, in the legally established terms, exclude those jurisdictions from the list of countries, territories or regions with clearly more favorable tax regimes ”.
It is also noteworthy that “the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, the Principality of Liechtenstein and the Eastern Republic of Uruguay are not on the European Union of Non-Cooperative Jurisdiction List, adopted by the European Union Council, which took place on February 18, 2025”.
It is recalled that one of the last times that Hong Kong made a formal request to leave the list of tax havens was during the visit to Lisbon of the Secretary for Financial and Treasury Services, Christopher Hui Ching-Yu, last year, as a meeting with Secretary of State Claudia Reis Durte.
There, and according to Lusa, the ruler of the neighboring region "expressed concern" for Hong Kong being considered a fiscal paradise since the list was created by the Portuguese authorities in 2004.
The inclusion in the list “would subject Hong Kong companies to a tax increase and special measures” in Portugal, described the ruler, who recalled that the two parties signed an agreement to prevent double taxation, which came into force in 2012.
In the same meeting, Christopher Hui reminded the Portuguese Secretary of State that the European Union (EU) removed, in February 2024, Raehk from the non -cooperative jurisdiction list for tax purposes, a decision that, in the secretary's understanding, "demonstrated the recognition of the EU of Hong Kong's efforts" to introduce measures that combat "the [fiscal] transfronio evasion resulting from the pair not the pair not taxation ”. Christopher Hui added that Hong Kong already fulfilled all European standards in this matter.
It should be noted that, at the time, the Portuguese Minister of the Economy was Pedro Reis, who at an event about Christopher Hui's visit to Lisbon, said it was important to “maintain sustainable economic growth and take advantage of the opportunities for mutual investment” between Portugal and Hong Kong.
Chamber of Commerce Rejubila
However, the Portugal-Hong Chamber of Commerce and Industry Kong (PHKCCI, in the English acronym) issued a note in LinkedIn to highlight Hong Kong's exit from this list. "This milestone represents the culmination of a long-term and transverse process in Portugal, which involved continuous dialogue and coordination between successive governments, parliamentary parties and international partners. Although the consensus on the objective was solid, the process has gradually unfolded over more than a decade," he reads.
For PHKCCI, the Portuguese State decision “restores coherence with the European Union's rules and reflects Portugal's commitment to a fair and current approach to its tax governance”, also stressing the “importance of respecting objective criteria, maintaining a permanent dialogue and ensuring legal and diplomatic rigor in the management of fiscal policy”.
“As a chamber of commerce and industry Portugal-Hong Kong, we greeted this outcome as a step forward in the alignment of our bilateral environment of commerce and investment with predictability, transparency and good governance. We maintain a committed to facilitating constructive involvement between our markets, supporting the clarity in tax staff and fostering mutual confidence”, is referred to in the same note.
According to the online newspaper Eco, the inclusion of a country or territory on the list of tax havens happens if there is no tax similar to IRC [tax on the income of legal persons], charged in Portugal, or the existence of tax benefits that are more favorable than in the European country.
It also serves as a criterion for inclusion in the list administrative practices of countries or regions do not allow the effective exchange of tax information. All issues that Hong Kong considers to have exceeded and ensure that there is full respect for the fight against fiscal dropout.
More concretely, and when his visit to Portugal last year, Secretary Christopher Hui spoke of the “Hong Kong efforts in the introduction of a foreign source performance regime (FSIE) for certain passive income to better combat transionic dropout resulting from the non -taxation”. In his view, "such efforts fully aligned the Hong Kong FSIE regime with FSIE regimes updated by the EU regimes in December 2022".
MEXIDES IN FSIE
According to an explanatory note from consultant PriceWaterhousecoopers (PWC), Hong Kong was added to the EU Observation list in October 2021. On that date, the EU was concerned that, under the then Foreign Source Exemption Scheme (FSIE), there could be situations in which companies without substantial economic activity in Hong Kong would not be subject to Tax regarding certain passive income from a foreign source (such as interest and royalties), thus resulting in situations of 'double non-tax', ”can be read.
The following year, Raehk "promulgated legislative changes", namely in December 2022, to "improve and reinforce the FSIE regime against transfronical fiscal evasion."
With the changes in force since 1 January 2023, “the four types of foreign source income”, such as dividends, interest, intellectual property income and alienation gains from the sale of corporate interests, are “being considered origin in Hong Kong and subject to profit tax if received in Hong Kong by an entity of a multinational group that exercises trade, profession or business in the business Territory, ”explains PWC,“ except if this entity meets the requirements of the applicable exception ”.
After the EU's suggestion, “the Raehk government further perfected the FSIE regime to widen the scope of incomes, including alienation gains from other types of assets (beyond corporate appearances) in order to align with the latest EU orientation, with effect from 1 January 2024”.
It was then that on February 20 last year the EU council published the conclusions of the semiannual EU review regarding the “non -cooperative jurisdictions for tax purposes”, the so -called “black list” of tax havens, as well as the “observation list” regarding the “state of cooperation with the EU in relation to the commitments made by cooperative jurisdictions to implement principles of good tax governance”.
At that time Hong Kong was removed from the list, considering the EU that the territory had "fulfilled the commitment by changing the FSIE regime", highlighting PWC, in the same note, that Raehk is now "among the jurisdictions that cooperate with the EU and have no pending commitments."
According to PWC, "the Raehk government greeted the recognition of the EU of efforts to align its FSIE regime with the relevant requirements, as reflected in its removal from the EU observation list", and will also have "will continue to comply with international tax standards, while maintaining Hong Kong fiscal competitiveness."</description><pubDate>2025-09-08 02:09:53</pubDate></item><item><title>Elections | Political programs focused on the economy and social support</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/05/eleicoes-programas-politicos-com-foco-na-economia-e-apoios-sociais/</link><description>There are six lists of candidates for deputies by Via Direct, and another six by the way indirect. There are new guys, many out of departure and even deputies who decided to wander among suffrage. The main focuses of political programs continue to be employment, the promotion of the economy and the increase in social support
 
On September 14 will be chosen the deputies of the Legislative Assembly (AL), either by the vote of the people, in the direct via or by indirect way through the associations that represent the various professional sectors. The campaign is on the streets and the 12 lists have made available electoral programs whose content does not differ much from the interpeairs presented to the government in recent years, given that most of the list heads have been in AL for some time.
Thus, issues such as the crisis in youth employment, the incentive for local consumption, the need for more social support and the regional integration of Macao in Hengqin and the Great Bay dominate the measures presented.
In the case of list 1, the “Association of United Citizens of Macau” has roots in Fujian and is led by Mrs Song Pek Kei, who began to accompany businessman Chan Meng Kam in parliamentary Lides. Now he is accompanied by the young deputy Nick Lei, followed in third place, and on a list of ten people, Chan Lai Kei.
In the work area, the list defends the creation of a share for residents in all professional areas, “support for employment and local companies”, and the guarantee that “85 percent, or more, of employees are local residents”.
It is also advocated the release of “vacancies in the financial and management areas for qualified residents”, as well as the granting of a subsidy of five thousand patacas for “each resident eligible in employment support, unemployed or temporary workers”.
The Nova Esperança list, led by José Pereira Coutinho, wants “employment for all” and promises to fight for “Macao's permanent residents priority at game dealers” and the establishment of a “compulsory system (pension fund), which protects 100 percent to the population”.
The electoral program also emphasizes the area of ​​game promoters, whose number of licenses has fallen by the last years. The list calls for “reinforcement of its viability by increasing the legal commission from 1.25 to 1.30 percent” and “facilitating the opening of bank accounts for licenses” junket attributed by the executive.
In the case of list 3, the Promoting Union for Progress, which represents the General Union of Macao residents' associations, led by Deputy Leong Hong Sai, asks for “improving the use of residents”, tourism revitalization or support for “small and medium enterprises”.
List 5, the union for development, is led by a well -known al face. Ella Lei and the workers' bench partner Leong Sun Iok again put their jobs as a political priority.
The “guarantee of employment opportunities to local” is asked, as well as the “improvement of the entry and exits system of foreign workers”.
The list of workers promises to fight for the development of “paid training to increase the qualifications of local workers”, as well as “improvement of the employment support system, properly increasing the allocation of services”.
Also in the work area, this group of candidates asks to be “improved the workers protection system to increase their living”, suggesting the “strengthening of the salary structure” and the “social security system to increase workers' protection level”.
Consuming it is necessary
Since Macao has recovered from the crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, with the closing of business, which another problem has placed: the fact that it is easier to travel to China has made residents consume less in the territory, affecting the trade in less tourist areas.
This has been a recurring theme in the interventions of deputies in AL and is also in the electoral programs. Returning to the list linked to the Fujian community, “incentives for domestic consumption” are asked to “reduce pressure on residents' lives” and “revitalize the local economy”. For this should be followed "the experiences of consumption support programs between 2020 and 2022, creating new consumer cards to stimulate trade."
In the case of Pereira Coutinho's list, the institution is defended “an electronic annual support card for the consumption of 10,000 patacas”, and the candidate even calls for the creation of a permanent cash planning plan with the value from 15,000.
The workers also ask "the stimulus to consumption in order to help residents spend and boost the economy."
In the case of Macao-Guangdong Union 4, representing the Jiangmen Naturals, and led by the academic Joey Lao Chi Ngai, it is asked to “promote the operation of a 'coordination working group for employment promotion, in order to boost the social mobility of residents.” It is also suggested to review “several social security regimes, and investment in resources to support the elderly, children, people with disabilities and vulnerable groups”.

Consumption is not forgotten
With regard to the executive's subsidies to the so -called most vulnerable layers of the population, children, young people, the elderly, chronic patients or disabled people, all lists ask for more.
In the case of the group led by Song Pek Kei it is suggested to conduct a study “on the creation of a universal health insurance system to ensure free basic medical services for all residents”. It is also asked for a “better use of resources to expand coverage of medical services and reduce families' burden” in this area. It should be noted that the Executive, in addition to complying with moderating rates for residents, also assigns health valleys worth six thousand patacas for residents.
Song Pek Kei's list takes one of Sam Hou Fai's latest measures, the creation of a childhood allowance to ask for its extension from three to six years of the beneficiary. The creation of “differentiated subsidies for the second and third children” is also advocated, as well as a 90-day maternity leave to increase the birth rate.
Looking at the New Hope list, the news is the request for conversion “of the current [health] benefits to multifunctional consumption valleys with the value of 10,000 patacas”, as well as the expansion of the maternity leave to 90 days. In the case of childhood subsidy, the New Hope defends its extension up to the child's 12 years and a monthly payment of 2,000 patacas.
Also noteworthy is to defend the increase in the allowance to informal caregivers and monoparent families from 5,000 to 8,000 monthly patacas. Given that Coutinho is linked to the Association of Macao Public Function Workers, this is an area that is paid attention to this political program: increase, between 30 and 50 percent, “from the base remuneration, replacing the 100 points of the Indicion Table, to the agents of the security forces”, also defending the “voluntary retirement after 20 years of service”.
In the case of list 6, a good home alliance, led by Wong Kit Cheng, the most and better measures are made for parents: “increase the number of parental licenses and monitoring to prenatal exams”, it reads, also the defense of “more flexible working hours and tax deductions by the number of children in charge”.
In an overview of the programs, it should be noted that in six lists of direct suffrage, only the new hope list uses the two official, Portuguese and Chinese languages. In the indirect suffrage there are more groups to make this bet, such as the union of the business interests of Macau and the union of the interests of Macao professionals. There are no English programs. These elections are based on the departure of deputies such as Ron Lam U Tou, Chak Mo, Chan Hong and Lei Chan U.
What indirects want
In the indirect suffrage there is a novelty: the entry of businessman Kevin Ho, nephew of Edmund Ho, to the list led by José Chui Sa Peng, the “Union of Macau Business Interests”, which represents the industrial, commercial and financial sectors. Highlight, in this group, for the entry of Si Ka Lon, which always competed by the way. This group advocates “support for digital and high -tech transformation to modernize traditional industries and develop emerging sectors”, also promising to “listen carefully to the difficulties and claims of commercial and financial industries, especially small and medium -sized companies”.
Kevin Ho
The union of the interests of Macao professionals, led by Iau Teng Pio, a subdirector of the Faculty of Law of the University of Macao, defends the struggle for the “training of the diversification of the economy in accordance with professional strength” and “the articulation of the rules of Macau and Hengqin”. To this end, it suggests the creation of an “experimental zone of application” of these same norms, exploring “a direct and transfronical execution mechanism of arbitration”. Following is the desire to “strengthen international competitiveness of law”, encouraging “exceptional talents to study in the interior of China”.
A face for education
Ho Ion Sang, a face that we got used to in direct suffrage, competes again for the indirect suffrage alone, representing the education sector, with the Association of Promotion of Social Service and Education.
The candidate calls for the “implementation of mental health support measures” as well as “improving the overall quality of Macao medical services and effectiveness in care”. Ho Ion Sang promises to fight for measures that look “the impact of low birth in the education system” and more “support for inclusive education and special education schools”.
The businesswoman Angela Leong joins the first time to MA Chi Seng to compete for the Cultural and Sports Union of Sol Nascente, in defense of culture and sport. One of the ideas is “asking the government to guide the use of the free -related elements [of the concessionaires] to support local cultural and sports activities”.
In the “Joint Commission of the Associations of Employees”, led by Deputy Lam Lon Wai, it is defended the improvement of infrastructure, the “reduction of business costs and the facilitation of trade and investment”. The promotion of the “sharing the benefits of economic development with employees” is asked, stabilizing a “salary growth mechanism”.
In the union of workers' associations, led by Leong Pou U and Choi Kam Fu, it is suggested “improving the protection of work and workers”, as well as “the protection of the basic rights of workers, improving infrastructure of child support”. The “dynamic adjustment of the minimum wage to ensure basic life needs” is also advocated.</description><pubDate>2025-09-05 00:01:01</pubDate></item><item><title>SCO | China reveals ten -year plan for multipolar world</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/02/sco-china-revela-plano-de-dez-anos-para-mundo-multipolar/</link><description>In Tianjin was presented the initiative of global governance, a Beijing plan that defends multilateralism in the world geopolitical order. From the Shanghai Cooperation Organization came a new Defense Defense of the Multipolar World, as well as new “100 Small and Exemplary Projects” of financial support to the body's member countries
 
The Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) approved a development strategy for the next decade, with the aim of promoting a multipolar world, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi announced yesterday. The global governance initiative (GGI, on the English acronym) comes at a time when the regional bloc recognized, in a joint statement, that the worsening of geopolitical tensions represents a growing threat to the safety of its members.
Speaking after the 25th SCO summit, which took place in Tianjin, in northeastern China, Wang said the development strategy until 2035 “defines the tone and a clear direction for the next decade”, considering it one of the main results of the meeting.
The summit had as its backdrop the increase in friction between some of the main members of SCO and the United States of America (USA), namely due to sanctions and commercial fares applied by Donald Trump administration.
Wang classified the meeting as the “most fruitful” to date, stressing that participants have issued a unified message against unilateral actions, in an implicit reference to Washington. "The summit firmly defended a multilateral trade mechanism centered on the World Trade Organization, rejected unilateral measures that violate the organization's rules and sent a clear message in support of equity against intimidation," said Chinese diplomacy chief.
Wang also announced the creation of four new SCO security centers, focusing on combating regional security, transnational organized crime, drug trafficking and information security.
According to Xinhua agency, Wang Yi also said that GGI has arrived "at the right time," as "the world faces numerous challenges, including frequent regional turbulences, slowing economic growth and the increase in anti-globalization [ideas and movements."
The GGI has as its principles “respect for sovereign equality, the observation of international law, the practice of multilateralism, the defense of a people centered on concrete actions”, concepts that are “in line with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Letter,” noted Wang Yi.
The Chinese Foreign Minister also recalled that GGI is the “fourth global initiative proposed by President XI Jinping in recent years” after the launch of the global development initiative, the global security initiative and the global civilization initiative.
According to the minister, "these four initiatives bring stability and predictability to a turbulent world, reflecting the active role and meaning of responsibility of China in international affairs."
A new statement
From the summit also came the statement of Tianjin of the Council of Heads of State of SCO, where multilateralism is a watchword. “World politics and economics, as well as other areas of international relations, have undergone profound historical transformations. The international system is heading for a fairer, more egalitarian and representative multipolarity, opening new perspectives for national development and cooperation with mutual benefits,” he can read.
In the same document, SCO Member States commit to “deepening long-term partnerships and further strengthening Shanghai's cooperation organization, in order to jointly preserve regional peace, safety and stability, promoting sustainable development” countries.
In the statement, it is also established that SCO member countries "consider interference in internal affairs in other states under any pretexts, as well as the use of unilateral coercion measures that are not based on international law and harm the interests of other states."
"Member States reaffirm their position of principle against the imposition of extraterritorial unilateral sanctions," was still declared in the document.
Support to countries
President Xi Jinping reaffirmed the view of a new world order that challenges Western rule, appealing to the construction of a fairer and more multipolar international system. "The SCO must oppose the Cold War mindset, the confrontation between blocks and the behaviors of intimidation," Xi said in the main speech of the summit, in an indirect reference to the United States.
The Chinese leader defended a reform in global governance with greater representation to the global south and called for the “equal and uniform” application of international law, without double standards or the hegemony of the few.
Xi also announced a set of concrete measures to face the challenges to development, at a time when the US trade war raises fears of global economic stagnation.
Among the initiatives are 100 “small and exemplary projects” of well-being support in SCO countries, more than two billion Yuan in non-reimburseable aid and ten billion yuan in loans to the SCO Interbank Consortium in the next three years.
XI also revealed plans to accelerate the creation of a SCO development bank to reinforce security and economy cooperation between member states. "We must expand the basis of cooperation and fully use the resources of each country, assuming the responsibility for peace, stability, development and prosperity in the region," he said.
Regarding China's role in the world geopolitical system, Xi Jinping highlighted a series of measures and initiatives in which he considers that the country was a pioneer. In Monday's speech at SCO, he stressed that “we were the first to launch the cooperation of the track and route initiative”, and a large number of signature projects were developed ”. In addition, “cooperation at the level of industrial investment has significantly advanced, providing conducting forces for development and prosperity throughout the region”.
China says it now has data that trade with SCO member countries has surpassed "the objectives that had been set," and the communications and transport network was "widely improved", with a land of land of almost 14,000 kilometers among the Member States.
On Monday, Xi Jinping also pointed out that China was the first country to “present the vision of global governance based on a wide consultation, a joint contribution and benefit sharing,” making an “effort to practice true multilateralism”.
"We deepen cooperation with the United Nations and other international organizations, and play a constructive role in international and regional affairs. We are always alongside international equity and justice, we advocate inclusion and mutual learning between civilizations. We oppose the hegemonism and policy of power, so we become a pro-action for peace and world development," said Chinese President.
Hand in hand
Prior to the official photo shoot on Monday, Russian presidents Vladimir Putin, and India Narendra Modi were seen walking hand in hand in the direction of Xi Jinping, with whom they kept a brief conversation, accompanied by interpreters. According to Modi himself, the two leaders traveled together in the same car for their bilateral meeting.
Created in 2001 as a European-Asian security alliance between China, Russia and four Central Asian countries, SCO has expanded areas such as economic and commercial cooperation. According to Beijing, the organization currently brings together 26 countries in Asia, Europe and Africa, between full members, observers and dialogue partners. Myanmar and Türkiye are among the countries intended to full adhesion.
Despite the growing influence, the group is still affected by internal disputes - such as India and Pakistan, or between Tajiquistan and Kyrguistan - that compromise its global effectiveness.

Montenegro also praised the development of the territory and spoke at a “very positive” phase of the relations between Portugal and Macau
 
Portugal Prime Minister Luís Montenegro believes that the MSar will create a “more agile” regime for Portuguese citizens. The statements were made yesterday to journalists, when Montenegro was confronted that the Misrem had eliminated the attribution of a preferential regime for Portuguese citizens in accessing the resident identity ticket.
According to the Portuguese politician, the matter was discussed yesterday morning, in a meeting with the chief executive, who took place before the visit to the Portuguese School of Macau.
"We have a concern regarding the visas of residence of all those [Portuguese] who go to this territory with desire to work and to help the institutions can do their work," acknowledged the leader of the Government of Portugal. "Our staff are in contact and has been combined following what had already begun with the visit of the Minister of State and Foreign Affairs, last March, […] I think things will be sent so that we can have the consecration of a more agile, easier, more experienced regime, and therefore, that we know that we know," he added.
When asked if the regime would be the same as applied before the Ho Iat Seng government propose its elimination, approved by the Legislative Assembly, Montenegro refused to enter details. "I cannot now be entering this detail. What we want, from the point of view of the authorities on both sides, is that all this dynamic is as easy as possible and, therefore, that the rules are fast and also so as not to disagree with this [Portuguese Portuguese] mobility that is positive mobility," he said.
Positive phase of cooperation
Montenegro also considered that he felt like the side of Macau to continue to receive Portuguese. "I believe yes [that there is a desire to have Portuguese in Macau], I think it was very clear from the conversation we had," he said.
As for the relationships between Portugal and Macau, Montenegro considered that they cross “a very positive phase” of cooperation, in the level of the economic, social, cultural and historical and entity aspects.
"We have registered a very strong commitment of the Macao Executive in the preservation of architectural heritage, of the historical heritage, which is also part of what is the identity of Macao," he said. "We want, in fact, that there will be compliance with a mutual cooperation relationship, which is based on the documents that have presided over the transition […] and that attributes responsibilities to all. And we will be up to our [responsibilities] and, of course, to request compliance with others," he added.
Some obstacles
Regarding the situation of Macao, Montenegro claimed to be “a good example”, although with some “obstacles” and “tensions”, which explained to be normal of these kinds of regions.
"I think that in global this is a good example of how it was possible to organize a transition process, to safeguard the most relevant interests in presence and contribute to the economic and social development of this territory," said the Prime Minister of Portugal. Numbers, although they do not express everything, are a good instrument for us to be able to gauge the economic and social success of this route and this process that is not free of tensions, is not free of obstacles. It is like in all processes that imply changes, something that is never truly finished and impels us to be pro-action, ”he shot. The leader of the government of Portugal did not specify the" obstacles "or the" tensions. "
Off the agenda
Speaking to journalists, Montenegro also addressed the case of the detention of former deputy Au Kam San, who also has Portuguese nationality. The Prime Minister revealed that the case was not part of the schedule of this trip and must be treated with discretion. "It was not the subject of our conversation, but it is a subject, this and others, which we follow and that we promote with the necessary description, because there are some subjects that also deserve some modesty in treatment. And this is one of them," he explained.
Montenegro also refused to explain whether there was any movement to support the detainee. "We are not discussing this case, I will not particularize. In this context of the visit, what I want to reiterate is our firm purpose in bringing our cooperation relationship to the most varied levels and the preservation of a connection that has been fruit, despite having its problems," he said.
Sam Hou Fai guarantees Portuguese rights
The chief executive stated that the government of Macao attributes great importance to the rights and traditions of Portuguese resident in the territory. Sam Hou Fai's statements were made yesterday morning when he received Luís Montenegro, according to the Communication Office (GCS).
In a press release, it is reported that the representative of the MSAR stressed "that the government of MSAR has always attributed, throughout its development, great importance to the protection and respect for the rights, customs and cultural traditions of the Portuguese residents of Macao."
The government leader also associated the Portuguese traditions with the “teaching and diffusion of the Portuguese language”, which indicated to be the target of a proactive promotion by the executive.
The government leader also "stressed that the friendship between the Chinese and Portuguese peoples is long and lasting, and the two countries have been established for 20 years a broader strategic partnership, with a special emphasis on the use of the Macao platform in promoting exchange and sino-Portuguese cooperation."
In response, GCS indicates that Montenegro defended the implementation of the principle a country, two systems. "Portuguese Prime Minister Luís Montenegro praised the successful implementation of the principle" a country, two systems "in Macao and the huge advances made since its return to the country. He also praised the preservation of cultural diversity in Macao, including Portuguese culture," was reported.
Security | Montenegro's visit with great apparatus
Unlike visits by other Portuguese leaders Macao, as happened with Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, in 2019, Luís Montenegro's passage was marked by a large security apparatus, which was guaranteed by a team with security guards and Chinese agents, as well as the forces of the mashes. Before the Prime Minister of Portugal arrived at the Portuguese School of Macau (EPM), all who wanted to be inside the institution had to be searched. Also journalists or image reporters who had not registered beforehand could not enter.
Inside the institution there was also a dog accompanying one of the agents. Outside the school, when the car that carried Montenegro arrived, police warded the passers -by and prevented the passage. During the stop of the Montenegro car, the car was being protected by a higher van that stopped next to it to block one of the angles of vision. After passing the EPM, the area between the consulate of Portugal and the Sé Zone was full of security agents.
Culture | Montenegro highlights Portuguese “values”
During the speech of the reception to the Portuguese community, Luís Montenegro highlighted the “values” brought by the community in Macao, and in the principal the diffusion of the language.
"I mean that we have attributed special importance to those who are here, in the most varied affinities, that bring the values ​​of Portugal, which bring and transport and preserve the Portuguese culture and tradition, which are therefore a link between our countries and our peoples," he said.
The ruler also said that the community "through work" can "take further" the "preservation of language", which considered it to be an "irreplaceable identity factor and also as a factor of approximation." In the economic aspect, Montenegro considered that the community contributes to the common objective of building “societies with prosperity”, with “opportunities for all” and promotes “equality and social justice”. The prime minister also promised to support the community: "It has the government of Portugal, we also have very with you," he said.</description><pubDate>2025-09-10 23:01:31</pubDate></item><item><title>China | Montenegro expects “close relationship” fruits with Russia</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/09/china-montenegro-espera-frutos-de-relacao-proxima-com-a-russia/</link><description>The Portuguese Prime Minister said yesterday, in a meeting with President Xi Jinping, who expects the “close relationship” between China and Russia to help reach a peace agreement in Ukraine. Official visit to China, with Macau, Luís Montenegro stressed China's fundamental role in the global context
 
The Portuguese Prime Minister said yesterday, before the President of the Popular Republic of China, Xi Jinping, who has his close relationship with Russia to “build a fair and lasting peace” in Ukraine.
Luís Montenegro made these statements at the beginning of the first day of the official visit to China, during the meeting with Xi Jinping, of which journalists could only record the first three minutes. "I can not help, on behalf of the government of Portugal, to transmit to the President that we count a lot with your contribution and the close relationship that China maintains with the Russian Federation to be able, as fast as possible, build just and lasting peace in Ukraine," he said.
Earlier, Montenegro stressed that, in the international context, Portugal and China have maintained "on many occasions a base of cooperation and sharing of values." "China has a key role in the global and international context, a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council and we expect your contribution to build bridges between peoples, bring some of those who are in conflict, promote peace, promote multilateralism, promote respect for human rights," said the Portuguese politician.
Montenegro said he was confident that the appeal he addressed to the president of China about the Russian-Ukraine conflict will be heard. "I believe that the appeal, coming from a friendly country, coming from a European Union (EU) country, coming from a country, such as Mr. President XI Jinping also emphasized, who has an identity of values ​​and route, will not fall into a rotor bag," he said.
Saying not being able to answer for the president of China, Montenegro expressed convinced that Portugal has done what is required to this conflict.
"My conviction is that, to our dimension and without any kind of pretentiousness, we do what is required to a nation with history and the international respectability that Portugal has. We are builders of bridges, we are protagonists of the approach between peoples, we are advocates of peace, defenders of values, respect for people's rights," he said.
Montenegro considered that, at the meeting with Xi Jinping, he was limited to “being frank, loyal and direct in the appeal” so that China's ability to influence and “bring practical results” to Ukraine.
Luís Montenegro also mentioned that “it is very tasteful” that he makes this official visit to China, after brief statements by Chinese President Xi Jinping.
"As Mr. President said, Portugal and China have a relationship founded on a story that has shared with various times in common, but also a relationship facing the future. I remember Mr. President's visit to Portugal for seven years and I also want to convey the greetings of Mr. President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa," he said.
Good friends
The Portuguese Prime Minister expressed agreement with the words of Xi Jinping about how the transition from the administration of Macao de Portugal to China in 1999 took place.
"We had in the transition from Macau a good expression of the way we were able to converge and we managed to ensure the cultural identity and the relationship between the special administrative region of Macau, with Portugal and with China," he said.
At yesterday's meeting, Xi Jinping said that “Portugal is a good friend of China”, saying that it is “a pleasure” to meet the Prime Minister, Luís Montenegro.
“Welcome on the visit to China. I remember that in 2018 I made a state visit to Portugal, which left me a beautiful impression, and deep,” he said, taking the opportunity to ask Montenegro to transmit to the Portuguese head of state, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, “sincere greetings”, according to the simultaneous translation into Portuguese of his statements.
The Chinese president stressed that China and Portugal "are countries with deep history, and the two peoples have idiosyncrasy, openness, inclusion, progress and autonomy", arguing that "Portugal plays an important and unique role on the international stage."
Xi Jinping also highlighted “the important role” played by three former Portuguese prime ministers in international and regional affairs.
"The Secretary General of the United Nations, António Guterres, the president of the European Council, António Costa, and the former president of the European Commission Durão Barroso. I have good relations with them," he said.
In the brief statement, the Chinese president stated that "Portugal is a good friend of China" and considered that both countries have "properly resolved" the issue of Macao through friendly negotiations. "
"Portugal was also the first country in Western Europe to sign with China acts of cooperation under the initiative" a track, a route ", and the first country in the euro zone that issued titles" in the Chinese currency, he said.
A little help in the crisis
In turn, Luís Montenegro thanked China's support to Portugal during the period of the financial crisis. "At the level of our bilateral economic cooperation, it is my duty to tell you that we do not forget, on the contrary, we have very well present and respect the bet that China has developed in the Portuguese economy, in one of the most critical moments of our country, when the financial crisis," he said.
As had been highlighted moments earlier by the President of the Popular Republic of China, Montenegro also considered that, in recent years, the two countries have reinforced ties "in various sectors of the economy, from energy to bank, from health to water supply." "Our conviction is that we can continue to walk this path on the basis of trust," said the prime minister.
Luís Montenegro landed in Beijing early Monday afternoon, closed to the media, and did not have any public agenda that day. The prime minister's official agenda began yesterday morning with a ceremony of deposition of a wreath at the monument to the people of the people, in Tiananmen Square, where he was accompanied by his wife and three ministers who are part of this visit: Paulo Rangel, Minister of State and Foreign Affairs, Manuel Castro Almeida, Minister of Economics and Territorial Cohesion, and Graça Carvalho, Minister of Environment and Energy.
In addition to the meeting with Xi Jinping, Luís Montenegro met first with the president of the China National Popular Assembly, Zhao Leji.
In the late afternoon, the head of the Portuguese government had a work of work with the Chinese counterpart, I read Qiang, also at the Great Palace of the People, having followed to Macao, where he has today schedule only in the morning. Tomorrow and Friday, Montenegro will make an official visit to Japan, with tickets for Tokyo and Osaka.
Pilfe
At HM, analyst Tiago André Lopes, an auxiliary professor responsible for Asia Study at Lusíada do Porto University, argued that “Lisbon and Beijing share quite different views regarding international conflicts”. It should be noted that Montenegro visits China when they spend a few days about the summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, which took place in the Chinese town of Tianjin, and where conflicts were discussed Gaza or Russia-Ucrania.
"We can see that Lisbon is distinctive in the Palestinian issue, looking little uncomfortable with the barbarism that is slaughtered over the Palestinians; while China positions itself in a different spectrum of Portugal in the Ukraine War. What does this tell us? The trip will be very focused on the dimension of economic diplomacy and much less in the so -called traditional diplomacy," said the analyst.
Tiago André Lopes considers that Portugal could take advantage of this trip through Asia "to self-admit some of the dependence on the Brussels-Washington axis and gain space for maneuver integrating Beijing's Force," although he considers that "the current government bets on an atlanticism-Europeist without global ambitions."
Asked about the issue of 5G, which guided the Portugal-China relationship in recent months, Tiago André Lopes understands that Montenegro's trip to Beijing serves to "minimize the impact" of this issue and "try to leverage economic cooperation between the two countries."
"An element that can help measure the pulse of the Portuguese Prime Minister's visit will be the signing of documents. Will be signed memorandum of understanding (which are generally not binding), or commercial agreements? Or only press notes? This will be the best barometer, beyond the words of circumstance that will naturally be delivered," he said.
Investments | Montenegro says Portugal is “reliable and confident”
Luís Montenegro said yesterday that during the official visit to China and then Japan, he wants to bring the message that Portugal “is a reliable and confident country” for economic investments.
According to the Prime Minister, the program “Gives the opportunity that the Portuguese Prime Minister has to talk and interact directly with the President of the National Assembly of the Popular Republic of China, with the President of the Republic, with the Prime Minister”.
"At the same time that the Minister of State and Foreign Affairs, the Minister of Economy and the Minister of Environment and Energy interact bilaterally with their counterparts and also with entrepreneurs and Chinese companies that operate in Portugal and with Portuguese companies operating in China," he added.
For Montenegro, the fact that the visits are being made “with some compression in terms of durability” - four days divided between China and Japan - should be seen from another perspective.
"It is just the record that we are able to do all this simultaneously, we are able to leave here to Macau, we are able to go to Tokyo and to be able, in this geographical area, to bring the message that Portugal is a confident country, is a reliable country, it is a country where it is worth looking and that also looks to the world," he defended.
Montenegro also pointed out that Portugal is already “enjoying several investments that originate in China and have been levers for the transformation and economic development of Portugal”.
"It is our intention to contribute to our coming here so that we can also open doors to more Portuguese companies can find in the Chinese market the destination of their products and, therefore, also increase our export share for this geography," he said.

In a report by Lusa agency, there are details of the “MPOP” style of the election campaign, with a lot of music and requests for financial support to the mixture
 
Crowded audience, all dressed in the gowns on the list with which they compete for the elections on the 14th; Chinese drums next to the stage and above candidates and supporters, various microphones, music and choreography. This is the campaign for Macao legislatures, in a style that can be called "MPOP".
The microphones change hands, reproducing the same slogans with different voices, in short and acute scales, which end almost all in a party instruction. At this point, the drums are listened to loudly and the audience reproduces the last note heard, while shaking the political 'merchandising' that is handed over to the start of the rally: plastic hands to clap, numbers on the list with led lights, malleable straws, fans, all with the same color.
Campaign actions in Macao, restricted to the last two weeks before legislative elections for the local parliament, do not contain speeches in the events of the six lists that will elect 14 of the 33 deputies to the Legislative Assembly (AL).
The remaining 12 candidates are chosen through the associations, through the indirect suffrage, and there are still seven deputies appointed by the Chief Executive, in this case Sam Hou Fai.
Describing campaign events is like an exercise of musical shows, namely the genus "Kpop", among the lists led by younger candidates, or the genre "pop old-myle", as if it was figures like Elvis or Olivia Newton John Risen.
The concentrations are made up of the members of the lists and the people mobilized by them, some and the other dresses with the same uniforms. But there are no politicians on stage and viewers listening to them.
In these events, politicians seem to be assumed as artists, but there are no audiences, because they seem to be part of the choreography. Finally, there are very few people besides and each other, that is, people watching who are not directly linked to the lists.
Abstention is the great ghost that hangs over the whole process, which takes place for the first time under the framework of the new Electoral Law of April 2024, which aims to "reinforce the implementation of the" Macao Macao governed by Patriotas "principle.
Economic challenges
Ilia Chou, 40, an employee of the financial sector, was with a child and a friend watching one of these rallies and seemed to be one of those few people present not involved in the campaign list. He agreed to talk to Lusa after he had spoken to another microphone.
Ilia was attracted to the list that was there because those people have a "young and community aspect" and are concerned with "offering prospects for progress" to young people. "Given the current challenging economic climate, we face a critical question: our young people now have fewer options than before. This specific aspect is what attracts me most in this initiative," he said.
But “other groups also talk about youth and employment, what are the differences? Why do you like this particular group?” We asked. "I don't know them [the other groups]. Well, I was attracted to the charming characters of this list," he replied. "I think these four characters quite charming," Ilia added, they talk about "love, the title is very charming, and the color is pink, it looks very welcoming."
Political programs are, without exception, lists of requests to an “provider father”, incarnated by the executive, who has the responsibility of managing a comfortable and growing financial reserve, fueled by taxes paid by the six game dealers in Macao.
The numbers show this comfort. In August, the Macao Financial Reserve, which was always growing throughout the first half, reached 647.3 billion patacas, and was applied in subcontracted investments, deposits, current accounts, and credit securities.
Lists want to be applied to initiatives such as creating a development fund and reversing 10 percent of profits for distribution by all citizens, want to increase pensions or more money in consumer coupons, subsidies and maternity licenses, want more social housing, want free health and higher education, or simply require greater annual money distribution.
Pasta
There are also other requirements, such as promoting the diversification of the economy, measures to support the transformation and modernization of small and medium -sized enterprises or development of the intelligent city, but the most significant part of the six lists shows directly to the government's distribution of money in the most varied forms.
The other recipients of the requests are the game dealers, to which the candidates go with warnings that they are determined to defend the priority of residents in access to the best paid jobs.
Macao's unemployment rate is 2 percent and permanent residents at 2.6 percent. That is, technically, Macau has full employment. However, as Lusa told a candidate, the employment issue has nothing to do with statistics, it just holds on with "perception."
And in fact the question of unemployment, especially those who have just graduated, is a pressing issue of political programs, as HM indicated. This is the case of the first list to compete for direct suffrage, the “Association of United Citizens of Macao”, which is led by Song Pek Kei, a deputy linked to the Fujian community, who took the first steps in politics alongside businessman Chan Meng Kam.
The list led by the deputy asks, for example, the creation of a share for residents in all professional areas, “support for jobs and local companies”, and the guarantee that “85 percent, or more, employees are local residents”.
The Nova Esperança list, led by José Pereira Coutinho, and one of the few macanese participants in these elections, asks for “employment for all”, a slogan present in his electoral program where the “employment priority for Macao's permanent residents is promised at game dealers”.
Who goes out to their
List campaigns for indirect suffrage may seem more discreet, but that doesn't mean there is no news. After investing in Global Media, Portugal, and betting on the real estate area, in Porto, Kevin Ho, the nephew of the first chief executive, Edmund Ho, bet on local politics, when entering the list “Union of Macao Business Interests”, led by José Chui Sa Peng. Also he is familiar, in this case, from a previous head of the Executive of MSAR, Chui Sai On, already removed from the political scene.
In the case of these lists, representative of the sectors of labor, culture, education or business interests, employment is a concern, but what the candidates are looking for is a government that can support companies and finally diversify the economy.
Thus, in the “union of business interests of Macao”, it is advocated “support for digital and high technology transformation to modernize traditional industries and develop emerging sectors”. Candidates promise to play the role of intermediaries between those who have difficulty maintaining in this business fabric and the executive by “listening carefully to the difficulties and claims of the commercial and financial industries, especially small and medium enterprises”. The names of the seven appointed deputies are not yet known, as the Chief Executive's choice is usually made public only after the elections.

"Making Waves - Navigators of Hong Kong" will present films like "Papa", the documentary "Four Trails" and the restored copy of "Ah Ying", 1983
 
There are six films, four fiction and two documentaries, which promise to show the best of the best in Hong Kong cinema. This is the second edition of the Hong Kong Film Festival, taking place in Lisbon, at the ideal cinema, between 25 and 28 September, which has as artistic director Vanessa Pimentel, also she director, former resident of Macau linked to producer Blue Lotus Lisboa.
In addition to the exhibitions, the Portuguese public will be able to closely see Hong Kong actors, directors and producers, in a proof that it is possible to establish ties between Portugal and different cinematic environments. This year's poster consists of “Papa”, a 2024 film by director Philip Yung that will be screened on the 25th, a Thursday. Follows Ray Yueng's “All Shall Be Well”; Rikki Choy's “Never Too Late”; Montages of A Chan Oliver Siu Kuen; Four Trails, a 2023 documentary directed by Robin Lee. To end the beauty festival, the restored copy of Allen Fong's “Ah Ying” will be projected from “Ah Ying”, a 1983 movie.
Vanessa Pimentel explained to HM that the show has “a program that comes from Hong Kong”, where it has been around since 2022. “It is an itinerant program that aims to promote Hong Kong cinema, especially the cinema made by younger filmmakers in terms of experience, although programs always contain more veteran performance works,” he said.
This year, besides Lisbon, the Hong Kong Film Festival will pass through cities such as Berlin, Paris, Montreal and Udine, Italy. The event may be linked to Asian movie festivals or not. And it's the intention of Vanessa and Blue Lotus to create an Asian Film Festival in Lisbon, and Macau cinema will be part of it.
"In our case, the show is not associated with any festival because it does not yet exist, but I hope to be able to do so," he said. “I was born and raised in Lisbon, but I come from Macau, and my life from Macau is very close to all this. Of course an Asian Film Festival in Lisbon has to include Macau, nor could it be otherwise.”
“We do this program with a view to going a little further, and we are putting on an eye on the creation of an Asian Film Festival,” he said. "We haven't done it yet, we have to continue to work, but I think we're on the way."
Vanessa Pimentel says that, although she no longer lives in the territory, she is still very linked to the cinema that is done here. “I'm going to Macau at least twice a year, and I've been in permanent contact with movie people. They are all aware of our program [at the Hong Kong movie show] and there is a relationship.”
Film
We ask the artistic director of the show to talk about what the public can see in the small room of the ideal cinema, which works independently, without connection with large film screenings, which is located in the heart of Bairro Alto.
"Papa", which opens the festival, is described "as a very strong and good movie that talks about mental health and has an amazing approach." Vanessa Pimentel describes that this movie was awarded in Hong Kong with the distinction of best actor, presenting themselves throughout the plot "a very particular narrative."
“All Shall Be Well” is again shown in Lisbon, after the presentation at the Queer International Film Festival, and has passed Berlin. “It's a very good movie, there was no more screening after being in Berlin, I thought it would be interesting to put it on the program.”
Vanessa Pimentel also highlights the presentation of the restored copy of "Ah Ying", which belongs "to the new place of Hong Kong cinema", which shows a story that wanders incessantly between "fiction and documentary." It is a "very interesting movie in which the story is inspired by the story of the actress's own [Hui So Ying] who plays him."
The second show of Hong Kong's cinema will be attended by Hui So Ying. "It's a great honor because the actress will make a giant trip. She is already some age, but has soon came to come. It will be very interesting to have a movie inspired by her life and count on her presence to share with us this moment," said Vanessa Pimentel.
Little known paths
Another highlight of the Film Show is the exhibition of the documentary “Four Trails”, which has been “a ticket phenomenon”. It is a movie about the 298-kilometer race for the four best known Hong Kong tracks.
The film portrays a daily reality "from the Hong Kong regions that almost no one knows." "It's a movie about the challenge of sports and people who, not being professional sportsmen, sign up and run, training all year long. It's interesting to see the challenge they propose and how they live," said Vanessa Pimentel, who also highlights "Never Too Late", "A movie about our relationship with the environment." Here one can glimpse "a very Asian and Chinese side of this perspective of what the environment is and what our relationship with nature is like."
There is later the "Montage of A Modern Motherhood", a movie that "has been playing the festivals a lot." “It's a movie that has a very interesting side, about motherhood and a perspective that, perhaps, may not be so romantic, about the idea that maternity is not just a sea of ​​roses, having any reverse,” says Vanessa Pimentel.
Here the artistic director of the show warns that the film “can challenge a little,” playing “in things that concern everyone, like this thing of family tradition and sharing in motherhood and paternity”.
Vanessa Pimentel assures that the first edition of the show was a success, with "about a thousand people going to the cinema in four days." "It was surprising to see a lot of new people, older and also many people of Chinese origin, that is, children of immigrants, eventually a second generation, who were born in Lisbon, speak Portuguese and live here with families. We had sessions with many Chinese to ask questions at the end of the sessions and had never seen it in Lisbon," he said.
Hong Kong's cinema show also comes to the script of viewers who usually go to festivals. "We have a very interesting audience, consisting of people who like cinema and go to other festivals. It is not often to see a program that, in Lisbon, focuses on Asian cinema. We have Doc Lisboa, or Indie, but in its programming the proportion of this cinema is much smaller.
Between the Hong Kong Film Festival and the future festival, the official says there is “exhibition space” in Lisbon and Portugal, because the Asian cinema is “very vast and rich, having a very high quantity and quality relationship”.</description><pubDate>2025-09-11 23:54:29</pubDate></item><item><title>DSEDJ | Manuals should look at the country's linguistic political</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/18/dsedj-manuais-devem-olhar-politica-linguistica-do-pais/</link><description>Cheang Sek Kit, head of the Curriculum Development and Evaluation Division of the Directorate of Youth Education and Development Services (DSEDJ), argued that the elaboration of didactic materials is an important measure to implement the country's linguistic policy, and should adapt to the needs of Macao's educational development.

The name of the new responsible for the sports portfolio was not revealed
 
The current president of the Institute of Sport (ID), Luís Gomes, will be transferred and assume the duties of vice-president of the Board of Directors of the Social Security Fund (FSS), from Saturday. The decision, which appears signed by the secretary for social affairs and culture, LAM, was published yesterday in the official bulletin, and implies a dispromotion.
The publicly released order does not present the reasons for the departure of the ID, merely justifying the transfer to the FSS with the fact that the secretary considers that the leader has “professional competence” and “aptitude to exercise office”. However, these justifications are a form of public appointments.
Luís Gomes had been appointed vice president of ID in November 2023, after about 12 years linked to the Directorate of Youth Education and Development Services (DSEDJ). However, with Macao being chosen as one of the places that will host the national games, then ID president, Pun Weng Kun, was transferred to the lead in Macao of the organization of the event, opening the place for the promotion of Luís Gomes.
As a result, the young leader assumed ID's rudder, first as a substitute president, but later in the service committee regime, which now came to an end. Luís Gomes' promotions also occurred during the administration of Ho Iat Seng.
Yesterday was not made public the name of the new president of ID, who currently has two vices, law Si Leng, appointed in service committee, and Mok Chi Hang, who is a substitute vice president.
Education and Sport
As vice president of the Social Security Fund, Luís Gomes will work in an area further from his training and professional path.
The leader is a degree in Physical Education and Sports at the Macao Polytechnic Institute and has a master's degree in Education Sciences (Physical Education and Sports) from the University of Macau. According to information published in the official bulletin, he entered the civil service in September 2011, where he stayed until November 2023.
At the entity that regulates local education, it performed the duties of superior technician, director of the Center for Youth Areia Preta Activities and the Juvenile Activities Center of the Hippadromo neighborhood, head of the School Sports and Occupation Division, Head of the Youth Association Training and Support Division, Head of the Youth Development Division, Head of the General Student Development Division and the Chief of the Non -Superior Education Department.</description><pubDate>2025-09-18 03:42:24</pubDate></item><item><title>Lag | Pereira Coutinho calls for wages and social support</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/18/lag-pereira-coutinho-pede-aumentos-de-salarios-e-apoios-sociais/</link><description>Pereira Coutinho defends the increase in wages in the civil service, but also in the concessionaires of the game. The winner of recent legislative elections also suggested reinforcing public expense to increase support to the population, starting with the cash check
 
It assumes that it has barely slept since, on Sunday, managed to elect, with the new hope list, three deputies in Hemiciclo. José Pereira Coutinho is still celebrating Sunday's overwhelming victory and the fact that he sat back in the Legislative Assembly (AL) next to Che Sai Wang and Chan Hao Weng. The trio was yesterday on the morning program of the Chinese channel of Rádio Macau to defend wage increases, now that the government is preparing for the elaboration of the Lines of Governing Action (LAG) for next year.
Coutinho said, on the sidelines of the program, to expect "that the salaries of the workers of the civil service, the TDM itself and the concessionaires", as well as defend "the increase of public spending in terms of distribution of consumer cards."
"The six dealers have this year updated the salaries, but the civil service was in the way. We sent a letter to the government, which is currently preparing the budget for 2026, and we expect a salary update to improve the purchasing power of civil service workers and retirees," said Coutinho. The deputy was more specific and pointed to a climb of "three to five points of the Indian table, the minimum for the recovery of purchasing power."
As for the minimum wage, Coutinho said in the program that he should go beyond 34 patacas per hour. "It can't be so, Hong Kong's minimum wage is more than 40 dollars of Hong Kong per hour. The government must assume the leading role to increase the minimum wage," he said.
Blurr Checks
The elected deputy said that the executive should bet “in the return of the 21,000 patacas for the elderly”, without forgetting the increase in the value of pecuniary checks. In his view, “they are effective policies to increase consumption in Macao and counterbalance residents' trip to consume beyond borders,” he defended TDM-Radio Macau.
In turn, Chan Hao Weng said he expected more guarantees for teachers in the reform phase, namely a monthly subsidy for retired teachers. The deputy who will debut in the Legislative Assembly and the repeate Che Sai also spoke of the importance of creating more job opportunities for residents, arguing that there are still many jobs occupied by non-residents.</description><pubDate>2025-09-18 03:40:19</pubDate></item><item><title>Secretary Tai Kin IP listens to employment and economy opinions</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/17/secretario-tai-kin-ip-ouve-opinioes-sobre-emprego-e-economia/</link><description>The government began the round of public auscultations to prepare the lines of governing action (LAG) for next year. The Secretary for Economics and Finance, Tai Kin IP, gathered yesterday with six associations that left suggestions regarding the promotion of employment and economic development, and that praised the executive's policies.

The new program of classification and distinction of the brands was presented yesterday at a press conference.
According to the presentation of the new system, reported by Rádio Macau's Chinese channel, the aim of the new classification is to value more local brands and businesses, while trying to create new tourist attractions that promote consumption and take tourists to community neighborhoods.
The new classifications are divided into three categories “Centenary brand”, “typical brand of Macau” and “stores with specialized and delicate characteristics”. In the first phase, only 100 small and medium -sized companies can be classified as “stores with specialized and delicate features”.
These will receive financial supports that can reach 150 thousand patacas, to finance 60 percent of online marketing campaigns, creative decoration processes and the launch of patented products. Regarding the categories “Centenary brand” and “typical brand of Macao” the candidacy are not limited and are open. The Macau Chain Stores and Franchise Association will watch in the application process.</description><pubDate>2025-09-17 01:53:15</pubDate></item><item><title>FUELS | Introduction of Gasoline No Lead 95 No Decision</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/17/combustiveis-introducao-de-gasolina-sem-chumbo-95-sem-decisao/</link><description>The government continues to analyze the possibility of the local fuel market to have the 95 gasoline without lead.

The lists of Coutinho and Song Pek Kei were thus with more votes
 
The results of Sunday elections that led to the choice of deputies to the Legislative Assembly (AL) are closed. The Commission of Electoral Affairs of the Legislative Assembly (Caeal) yesterday presented the data on the polls, and one of the changes involves validation of 24 votes previously considered invalid. From this universe, eight had been contested by the lists and 16 considered null, before reversal.
Cheang Kok Chi, president of Caeal's general finding assembly, explained that "the 24 invalid votes that have been valid are of direct suffrage and [change] did not damage the order or the results." "At each voting assembly, after finishing the vote, the table has a preliminary decision on the votes, where some can be decided on immediately. There are members of the lists present to see whether or not to protest this decision, so there are two types of situations," he said.
Thus, the Nova Esperança list, led by José Pereira Coutinho and who was becoming the great winner of the elections, putting three deputies in Hemiciclo, won six more votes with this change, because in the preliminary determination on Sunday the list was 43,361 votes.
Also the Macao United Citizens Association list, led by Song Pek Kei, won five more votes from 29,459 votes registered on Sunday's count to 29,464 votes released yesterday. The blank votes ciphed at 5,987, representing 3.42 percent, while the null votes were 7053, representing 4.02 percent.
The Caeal official assured that the law "also expressly provides that, during the vote, people [members of the candidates] lists may be present beyond the members of the vote and assistant assembly."
A WAY OF WORKING
Cheang Kok Chi did not give a clear justification that the null votes are not shown, evoking the duty of confidentiality, although the practice is common to the previous elections. "As for the fact that the votes are not identified, before we do the qualifying work we never know what the votes are like. Taking this into consideration, we chose this way to do our finding work," he said.</description><pubDate>2025-09-17 01:42:11</pubDate></item><item><title>Geotourism and themed parks - 2nd part</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/18/geoturismo-e-parques-tematicos-2a-parte/</link><description>Connie Kong, as a director of the theme park at Lisbon Macau, has played a key role in defining the park's operational view and in the strategy of involvement with the community.
His leadership reflects a strong commitment to the integration of local culture into the entertainment experience, ensuring that the park not only has fun, but also identifies with the collective identity of Macao residents. Under its direction, Lisbon Macau has actively supported local SMEs through initiatives such as the business connection session, promoting economic inclusion and reinforcing the role of the park as a socially responsible entity in the region.
Christine Hong Barbosa and Sophia Mok played equally fundamental roles in expanding the presence and purpose of Lisbon Macao. As vice president of marketing and retail development, Christine Hong Barbosa has created buying experiences that combine nostalgia with innovation, positioning the park as a destination that honors Macao's past while embracing his future.
In turn, Sophia Mok, Vice President of Sales and Corporate Communication, has been essential in the construction of strategic partnerships and the elaboration of narratives that highlight the cultural relevance of the park and its community-centered philosophy. Together, their contributions helped establish Lisbon Macau not only as a thematic attraction, but as a significant space that celebrates local heritage and promotes pride among Macao residents.
Lisbon Macao transcends conventional entertainment offers. It proposes a true sensory cartography, where each attraction is designed to dialogue with the territory, collective memory and local culture.
It is an experiential model that surpasses the paradigm of Asian thematic parks by integrating body, space and narrative in a proposal for identity cultural tourism. The attractions are not mere leisure devices but they are also instruments of territorial reading, historical evocation and emblematic diplomacy. Each is conceived as a chapter of a larger narrative, where the visitor not only consumes, but participates, interprets and transforms.
Lisbon Macau offers experiential narratives such as Zipcity Macau that stands out as a moving geography. Being the first urban zip line of Macao, it is more than an attraction of adrenaline, as it is an aerial installation that crosses the hotel skyline, offering visitors a panoramic reading of the urban landscape. Overcoming Facades inspired by Macao from the 1960s, the visitor's body becomes a vehicle for space recognition. Experience is not only physical but also cartographic, aesthetic and symbolic.
Zipcity transforms space into show and movement into interpretation. Goairborne Macau represents the body as an instrument of territoriality. This indoor parachDism simulator is an unprecedented technological and sensory innovation in the region. By combining augmented wind tunnel technology, the experience simulates the flight over the city, reinforcing the connection between body and territory. The visitor not only feels but also flies, observes and understands. Goairborne is a metaphor for air perspective, living cartography and experiential geography.
Line Friends Presents House of Friend embodies pop culture as transnational diplomacy. This thematic space dedicated to Asian pop culture is more than a merchandising center because it acts as a cultural diplomacy platform, attracting young audiences and connecting Macau to transnational networks of symbolic consumption. Its playful environment, iconic characters and contemporary aesthetics create an experience that transcends borders, reinforcing the park's cosmopolitan dimension.
Maison L'Occitane represents nature as a sensory experience. The first thematic unit of the brand in hotel context is a work of sensory design. Rooms are inspired by natural ingredients such as lavender, verbena and cherry flower, offering a stay that connects visitors to the aromatic landscapes of Provence. This proposal is not only aesthetic but also therapeutic, ecological and symbolic. Maison L'Occitane turns the rest room into ritual, and hospitality into botanical experience.
The MX4D Cinemas Emperor is an image as a territorial immersion. Equipped with movement technology, aromas and tactile effects, it provides a multisensory film experience. The films are carefully selected to reinforce territorial and cultural narratives, positioning space as a protagonist. The visitor not only watches but also participates, feels, smells and vibrates.
Cinema becomes an extension of the park, and the image, an instrument of immersion. The H853 Fun Factory fuses international brands with design inspired by the city's futuristic aesthetics, and it is not only a commercial space but also a living museum, commercial gallery, and evocation of urban modernity. Each store, each showcase, each corridor is designed to tell a story, rebuild a time and turn the act of buying into a memory gesture.
Geogostronomy in Lisbon Macau is not a complementary service but a language that translates the territory into flavor, memory in revenue and landscape into sensory experience. The kitchen practiced in Lisbon is a living extension of the theme park, where each dish is a cartography, each ingredient an evocation, and each technique a bridge between tradition and innovation. The gastronomic proposal is deeply rooted in the sino-Portuguese fusion that defines Macau, but is not limited to reproducing historical recipes. Here, cooking is understood as creative act and gesture of territorial interpretation. Complex restaurants not only feed but also narrate, educate and celebrate.
At Stanley’s Café, for example, the elegance of memory is palpable. The decoration is inspired by twentieth-century colonial coffees, with dark woods, soft lighting and details that evoke the salons of Canton and Lisbon tea. But it is in the kitchen that true cultural alchemy is revealed, where flavors and stories intertwine to offer visitor a simultaneously intimate and universal experience.
Cuisine Raymond's chef, a reference figure in Macao's Thematic Gastronomy, features creations that are true identity synthesis such as cod chau-chau rice, cream pastels infused with jasmine tea, and desserts that reinterpret Portuguese classics with local ingredients. Your approach combines technical rigor with historical sensitivity. Each dish is conceived as a narrative, tribute and gesture of gastronomic diplomacy. Stanley's is not just a coffee but an edible memory space, where the territory is saved. The decoration evokes colonial halls, but it is in the kitchen that cultural alchemy transforms the taste into a historical reading tool.
Royal Palace represents high gastronomy as sensory cartography. Here, gastronomy reaches the art status. Tasting menus are conceived as taste itineraries that cross coastal waters, local markets and ancestral knowledge. Ingredients such as depth shrimp, regional black pig and carefully cultivated aromatic herbs are treated with accuracy and respect. Royal Palace's kitchen is not only sophisticated but is territorial. Each dish states Macau as a creative space, gastronomic territory, a city that thinks through taste.
The restaurant contributes directly to the recognition of Macau as a “creative city of gastronomy by UNESCO” not only for technical excellence, but for the ability to transform the place into universal language.
Angela Café &amp; Lounge embodies the delicacy of the signature kitchen. Experience is defined by elegance, serenity and accuracy. Under the direction of Executive Chef António Coelho and Cuisine's chef Sally Jimenez, the space offers a culinary approach that raises local ingredients through contemporary techniques. The dishes are delicate, balanced and deeply sensory.
Chef António, with classical formation and contemporary vision, works sober and deeply. Chef Sally, with aesthetic sensitivity and technical mastery, transforms each dish into a visual and taste composition. Together they create a kitchen simultaneously intimate and universal, local and cosmopolitan. Angela Café &amp; Lounge is more than a meal space but a geogogogeneous laboratory, where the territory is interpreted with delicacy and rigor.
None of these experiences would be possible without Terence Chu's institutional view as vice president of Lisbon Macau's Food and Beverages Department, Terence leads with strategic intelligence, cultural sensitivity and commitment to excellence. Not only coordinates operations but draws experiences.
Its ability to integrate chefs, spaces, narratives and public transforms the food sector of Lisbon Macao on the central axis of its thematic proposal. Under its guidance, gastronomy has evolved from service to language and function to mission. His work represents the elevation of gastronomy in thematic tourism, raising it to the status of cultural diplomacy and territorial innovation. Macao's recognition as a “creative city of gastronomy by UNESCO” is partly a reflection of his vision and dedication.
Geogostronomy practiced at Lisbon Macau is a unique model in the international panorama. By integrating territory, memory, technique and narrative, the complex transforms food into cultural experience, a gesture of recognition and the act of creation. This project has no direct parallel in any other hotel theme park in the world. It deserves authorial recognition and institutional acclamation as an international reference in gastronomic tourism with identity.</description><pubDate>2025-09-18 04:34:21</pubDate></item><item><title>Sex: A strategy for self-knowledge</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/17/sexo-uma-estrategia-para-o-auto-conhecimento/</link><description>Sex is a mirror for weaknesses and a path to self-knowledge. More than pleasure, sex unites what is normally separated: the melting process tests the porosity of personal boundaries. It becomes in a portal for deeper vulnerabilities and difficulties.
What reveals most is the form (and the difficulty) we have to connect with others. It will not be admired, sexual vulnerability implies physical, emotional and symbolic exposure at the same time. It exposes the skin, the imperfections and exposes the fear of rejection, the difficulty in asking, the shame of desires and emotions that do not seem "normal".
Sex as a cultural artifact is an attempt to produce protective masks to this discomfort. There is a clear association of sex with the aesthetics of the superficial. It is the dominance of non-real, the dressed, the bodies and the lives that are paved by social networks, the early plastic surgeries of young people who want to look in a certain way. Pornography, the only source of “education” that young people probably have currently live on fantasy and unrealistic expectations.
These images not only shape the way we show ourselves, but also aggravate the difficulty in exposing ourselves as we are - vulnerability is masked by a performance of perfection. I had a friend who was lying down and woke up earlier than his partner to touch up make -up so that he always saw his best version: will there be greater resistance than this?
That is why talking about sex should be encouraged, because in the midst of so much confusion it is much easier to grasp dogmas that deficiently explain how sex manifests parts of us that we do not want to look. There are wishes, desires, and non -articulated fears that are repressed at the bottom of the being and that remain there forever, without even giving room to realize what they say of us.
I recently found a heading in The Guardian newspaper that seemed to me a step in the opposite direction. First, for inviting couples to share their sex stories; Second, for valuing the creative forms they find to deal with human encounters and mismatches. For example, one of the couples says that, in the middle of an approximation and an intense but doubtful relationship, they decided to take a break in sex for three months and assumed the distance as a space to rediscover themselves in the relationship - which worked.
This work of making sense of vulnerability, instead of letting sexual experience remaining in the emptiness, prevents people from feeling alone and lost, without realizing why sex can be such an intense trigger for experiences that they cannot explain - for emotions whose origin escapes them. Communication patterns, power imbalances, proximity and distancing: everything recreates in sex. The room becomes a stage where they are repeated, in miniature, the same emotional games we live in everyday life. Of course Kink, sexual games, fetishes and roller-play have this much more assumed symbolic dimension, with a deeper understanding that it is necessary to express sensations, emotions and content in safe and container spaces (e.g. BDSM).
I don't stop being stupidly optimistic in the desire to work on sex as a path to self-discovery. It is precisely in the game between fragility and power that resides the paradox of sex - place of immobilization and movement. When it is used as this metaphorical portal for self-knowledge, I guarantee: The result is impressive. For those who want to think more about themselves, they can start with simple questions. How do I position myself about sex?
How is my relationship with pleasure? How do I like to be seduced? What emotions do you evoke? How do I react to them? And, more importantly, how can a more open and conscious view of sex allow the desired changes in the way we relate to each other? It is in the space between the vulnerability and the liberation of sex that we find perhaps the best metaphor of what is human being.</description><pubDate>2025-09-17 02:10:17</pubDate></item><item><title>Fine unconsciousness (II)</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/16/multar-a-inconsciencia-ii/</link><description>Last week, we analyzed the measures carried out in Shenzhen, mainland China, in the form of fines imposed under the “regulations on the establishment in Shenzhen Dapeng of the first natural disaster prevention decree in China.” This punitive measure was first applied to China in the framework of this regulation. The fines were passed on to two tourists because they "invaded a restricted area" during a blue alert raised by meteorology services. Hong Kong and Macau also have legislation to ban entries in restricted areas.
These regulations share a characteristic: they are intended to prevent the entry into restricted areas without authorization. However, there is no legislation to regulate the practice of dangerous activities such as persecution and tuffles and surfing.
In September 2013, Typhoon Usagi reached Hong Kong. Some people risk their lives to dive into the storm, be pushed by the wind to the point of not being able to walk, are completely soaked and still exclaimed, "that fix! This is so exciting!" A boy even declared, "Young people, if they don't live now, will they live when?" A woman took pictures with Usagi.
While the young people enjoyed the wind, their parents took their children to the beach to "observe the waves." On the Star Ferry quay in Tsim Sha Tsui, gigantic waves packed the coast every half dozen seconds, and the "wave observers" were extremely excited and applauded loud and sound. Some couples even danched in the middle of the Borrasca, while others just took two -story wave photographs.
During a natural disaster, if someone neglects security, for personal pleasure, has dangerous behavior in areas considered to be disaster or getting stuck and needing to be rescued put your life in danger and that of others. It is known that those who work in rescue operations in very hard circumstances have a high probability of taking serious risks. In 2017, the Hong Kong Yau Siu-Min Firefighter died during a rescue in MA on Shan. One of the people being rescued was an out -of -service police officer. Although later he was apologized to the deceased's family, stating that he had overvalued his abilities and had not paid attention to the warning "the entry is not allowed," none of this prevented Yau's death.
Society can pass various laws to punish those who have dangerous behaviors such as diving in the center of the storms, observing waves, taking photographs during typhoons and neglecting personal safety during natural disasters, and requiring them to pay the costs of rescue operations. However, there are several points that should be considered when legislates.
First, how to define dangerous behavior? The legislation that prohibits, during the occurrence of natural disasters, entrances into risk areas, circulation in bridges, entry into natural parks is easy to apply. Entry into restricted areas is simply prohibited. Dangerous behaviors such as exposing yourself to weather, observing waves, taking pictures during the passage of typhoons, although easy to understand, are difficult to define from the legal point of view. For example, a person may be on the beach during a typhoon watching the horizon, but does the wind feel? Are you watching the waves, or are you doing anything else? The simpler the more difficult behavior is to define from a legal point of view. Without definition of specific acts, it is difficult to regulate them legally and further process someone for these practices.
Because these acts are so simple, it is not easy to list all dangerous behaviors when they make law proposals and some omissions are inevitable. It is predictable that laws intended to regulate hazardous behaviors, need to be continuously reviewed after promulgation to cover a greater variety of hazardous behaviors. Both China and Macau use the statutory law, which requires legal changes through regulatory procedures. The more the laws are magazines, the greater the number of procedures involved and the higher the costs.
Hong Kong implements the system of consumetudinary law through basic law. Courts can review the definition of the different dangerous behaviors based on precedents. Although this legal framework reduces the number of times the Hong Kong government has to review the laws, the costs remain more or less equal; Simply passes the alteration of ordinances to the definition of hazardous behaviors through jurisprudence.
Whether it is to rescue people who have entered risk areas or save those involving dangerous activities during the occurrence of natural disasters, rescue teams need many people and a large amount of specialized equipment. Rescue operations costs are high and beyond the reach of ordinary people. While we can promulgate laws that force those who neglect their own security to bear the save expenses, how can one force to pay that has no money? Lastly, when someone cannot afford, it will have to be the government to cover the costs. Government funds are fed by taxpayers. Therefore, it is ultimately the society that supports the burden. It is not true that society pays the damage caused by those who engage in dangerous activities.
Even without legislation, everyone should understand that during a natural disaster, neglect personal safety and practicing walks, surf or aquatic ski puts it at risk but also who will rescue it. Instead of punishing those who risk dangerous behaviors, it is preferable to educate people about the dangers involved and also the potential damage to third parties. By consideration for ourselves and to others, we must keep saved during the occurrence of natural disasters. Keep save without redemption is a service we provide to society.

Some politicians also have two faces. Portugal watched another tragedy almost similar to February 1941: a cyclone that caused 100 dead; to September 1954 when a train derailed and caused 54 dead; May 1963 when the Fall of the Sodré Platform of the Sodré station fell and made 49 dead; to July 1964 when a trailer of a train passengers in Porto and 90 people died; September 1966 where a fire in the Serra de Sintra killed 25 military personnel; November 1967 when floods in Lisbon killed 362 people; September 1976 when a plane crashed in Lages and 68 passengers died; November 1977 when a TAP boeing broke in two in Funchal and caused the death of 131 passengers; to January 1980 when an earthquake in the third killed 73 Azoreans; April 1984 when a collision between a bus and a car in Paredes made it die 17 people; September 1985 when in Alcafache shocked two trains and killed 150 passengers; May 1986 when a shock of trains at Covilhã killed 17 people: February 1989 when an Independent Air Boeing 707 that scale in Santa Maria was pacing at the high peak dying 144 passengers and crew, being the largest air disaster in Portugal; to December 1992 when a Martinair airline left in two in Faro dying 56 people; to December 1999 when a plane from SATA fired on the island of S. Jorge killing 35 passengers; to March 2001 when he collapsed the bridge of between them and 59 Portuguese died; to February 2010 when a strong alluvion in Madeira caused the death of 51 inhabitants; to June 2017 when the Dramatic Fire of Pedrogão Grande and other municipalities left 66 people; October 2017 when 440 fires across the country killed 50 people. This is historical. As will be in the history of tragedies in Portugal the fall of the elevator of glory that has taken their lives to 16 passengers and five others are in critical condition.
The country was shocked because there are several means of mobility of the same genre in Lisbon and other places in the national territory. The information that has already come to public became unbelievable: maintenance of a carris outside company, whose contract had already ended and which was usually a “visual” maintenance…; Protests for a long time on the part of Carris workers warning that the maintenance of Lisbon elevators was not competent and fruitful; dismissal in the most experienced elevators maintenance carris; A piece that broke into a carriage and was linked to the conductive cable to another carriage. In short: irresponsibility, neglect, greed and labor crime. Maximum responsible? The Mayor of Lisbon, Engineer Carlos Coins. An edil that has left Lisbon much worse in four years when he found her and who wants to continue in the “pan”. The worst way. Apart from the water from the Capote on the tragedy of the Glory Elevator, arranging subterfuges to escape responsibility by indicating that no mistake made under the Prime Minister's tab, abandoning important meetings as soon as he began to speak in his resignation. Obviously Carlos Coins did not go to the sidewalk of glory to cut any elevators. If it was not sabotage and say all the rules were fulfilled, but still people died, so it is because there are security rules that no one knew they also needed to be fulfilled. Coins have two faces: to pretend to be very responsible and competent on one face and the other, a politician without the least dignity. Not even took as an example the cases of the ministers Jorge Coelho and Carlos Borrego who resigned on the spot without having any fault in the incidents verified. Carlos Coins also has an aggravating factor: he twice asked the former mayor of Lisbon, Fernando Medina, when it was the case of information availability to the Russian Embassy. Being the cases completely different. In the Tragedy of Gloria died Portuguese and foreign and the image of Portugal in Europe and America stayed by Rua da Amargura. Carlos Coins also committed a larger "crime". He was as embarrassed to go to television to give a bacocal justification interview about the tragedy and, at one point, offended those who can no longer defend.
He blatantly lied about the reasons for the dismissal of Minister Jorge Coelho due to the death of so many Portuguese when the bridge of Entre-os-ioso, simply because he had the ministerial protection of the bridges. The second face of currencies is unfortunate and, in such a way, that some relatives of the victims have already begun the request for large compensation to the state, read to Carris or the Lisbon City Council, with the main purpose that the inoperatives of the maintenance of similar devices more people will not happen again.
Carlos Coins, the politician with two faces, missed the opportunity to stay in history belonging to the pages of dignity, rectitude and responsibility. With all your behavior will be in history, but in the pages painted black.</description><pubDate>2025-09-15 05:25:24</pubDate></item><item><title>Lecture and tasting make known Yunnan Tea Culture today at FRC</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/18/palestra-e-degustacao-dao-a-conhecer-cultura-do-cha-de-yunnan-hoje-na-frc/</link><description>The Rui Cunha Foundation today from 18:30, a lecture and ceremony of tea tasting, in an event entitled “The Immaterial Cultural Heritage of Yunnan of Tea Art”. The session, which has free admission, is co-organized by the Yunnan Tea Trader Association in Macao, and has the participation of guest speakers Chen Haoyan, founder of that institution; Zheng Zhanpeng, founder of Tea Company Lao Ban Zhang, Ltd. de Menghai; and Xu Yanting, heiress of the ethnic tea brand “Fire Pond Boiling Water”.
The doctor, writer, and usual presence at FRC events, Shee Va will attend the simultaneous interpretation between the Mandarin, Cantonese and Portuguese languages.
According to the FRC, the event aims to promote the understanding of the history and origins of the “Lao Ban Zhang” tea from the village with the same name in Menghai County in the southwest of Yunnan province, near the Myanmar border.
Located in a mountainous area of ​​1,700 to 1,900 meters of altitude, with an average annual temperature of 18.7 degrees Celsius, Lao Ban Zhang produces one of the rarest and appreciated types of tea Pu'er. Local minorities, such as the BU Lang tribe, have been responsible for tea plantations for centuries in this high region, which remains almost half of the year covered by a dense fog.
Tea Pu'er is a variety of traditional fermented tea from Yunnan Province, China, produced from the leaves of the Camellia Sinensis var. ASSAMEMICA. In the context of the production of this variety of Chinese tea, fermentation refers to the microbial process that usually happens after tea leaves have been sufficiently dry and curled in the form of “wet stacking”, allowing them to remain oxidizing until desired flavors are reached.
The final test
The dissemination of Yunnan's tea art and culture also includes a demonstration and tasting ceremony of “seven infusions”, which will be shared with the public at the FRC gallery, allowing lovers to know their authentic flavor.
"Most products currently sold, supermarkets and tea houses, are not pure tea. Consumers are simply buying a rolled -up tea cake on a piece of silk paper, not pure bingdao tea, Lao Ban Zhang or other varieties. The result is a bad and bitter flavor," explains the organizers of the session.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Fringe Festival features new shows this weekend</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/18/festival-fringe-apresenta-novos-espectaculos-este-fim-de-semana/</link><description>Between themes as diverse as maternity, new family compositions or traditional tea, the Fringe Festival continues to go through the streets of Macao with new shows this weekend. One of the initiatives was inaugurated on Tuesday, the “Art Exhibition for All”, available until September 28th next to the City of Flores Garden, in Taipa, on Rua de Seng Tou.
It is intended here to “encourage the participation of people in love with creation”, as well as “provide a platform for the public to display their creative work, promoting the idea that everyone can be artists”. The show is “a creative zone that allows the public to manifest their creative potential in a improvised way and participate in artistic creation”.
There is also space for artistic performances and theatrical projects, such as “Thanks for being here” by Suzuki Cheng, hosted for the last time at the Bookand space tomorrow.

This is what Curb - Center for Architecture and Urbanism proposes, which on September 27 organizes the seventh edition of these tours, with the initiative entitled “On the Move VII: Verde Verde Moments”, which proposes “Creative Bicycle Tours that offer participants the opportunity to explore Green Island”.
On the Move is a “unique project that combines creative bike rides with the display of a documentary,” says a note from the organization, and this year the tours “will follow a different direction, with the starting point of the University of São José and exploring a new area of ​​Macao: The Green Island”.
The initiative offers an invitation to “discover different neighborhoods around the Verde Island through four journeys commented in English by curator Nuno Soares, president of Curb”. Nuno Soares is also an architect and is linked to architecture teaching at the University of São José.

Luís de Camões studied first in Coimbra, whose university Jorge Paiva is a jubilated teacher, before leaving North Africa, Mozambique Island, Goa and Macau, a period that partially coincides with the Portuguese navigators saga, a few decades after Vasco da Gama's armed Armada arrived in India in 1498.
“Since‘ the Lusíadas ’were written, almost in their entirety, in the East and centered on the discoveries, most of the plants referred to in this poem are Asian, particularly spices and medicinal ones,” explains the scientist.
The book “The Plants in the Poetic Work of Camões”, the result of a multi -year investigation, “will be made available in open access on the Press website of the University of Coimbra (IUC),” Carlota Simões director Carlota told Lusa.
In the 166 -page study, the biologist states, on the other hand, that in the Lyric of Camões, "mostly written in Portugal and centered on love and passion, the plants referred to are almost all, European, Mediterranean and generally used by poets since classical antiquity."
“Some botanical expeditions in which I participated [all over the world] coincided with some of the regions where Camões walked or alluded to their poems,” he explains.
The official celebrations of the 500th anniversary of the birth of the creator of “Os Lusíadas”, whose commissioner José Augusto Bernardes, from the University of Coimbra, is underway, the University of Coimbra, the edition of Jorge Paiva's work has been scheduled in the program since the beginning.
“At the time Camões lived, the best known and cited plants in literature were more medicinal plants than food and, in poetry, ornamental or mythological relevance,” he writes.
60 plants in the epic work
In "Os Lusíadas", according to the environmentalist, about 60 plants are referred to, "many Asian and Aromatic", whereas in the lyric work "much less species", around 40, especially "European, country or ornamental".
“Camões knew well the Asian medicinal plants used by Garcia de Orta, not only by reading the 'simple and drug of India'], but also by observing them alive in nature. In addition, (…) I certainly knew Garcia de Orta garden in Goa,” he admits.
The investigator, born in Angola in 1933, said that “during his stay in Asia, particularly in Goa, Camões, as well as the botanical and herbal knowledge achieved through living with Garcia de Orta, surely had the opportunity for cultural convivials with distinguished Portuguese and cults” who at the time resided in the colony, annexed by the Indian Union, 1961.
In “The Plants in the Poetic Work of Camões”, Jorge Paiva also interprets references to trees, herbs and flowers originating from land that the solid poet never visited, such as Brazil and Timor.
"The Portuguese when they saw the Asian red stick, they also called him redwood, but it is the wood of a tree of the tropical forests of East Asia," he exemplifies.</description><pubDate>2025-09-17 02:01:32</pubDate></item><item><title>Restoration | Payments with apps increase in July</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/18/restauracao-pagamentos-com-apps-aumentam-em-julho/</link><description>Data from the Directorate of Statistics and Census Services (DSEC) reveal a monthly and annual increase in electronic payments in the restoration business, although breaks in some restaurant segments.

The forecast appears in the Macao Real Estate Review Report in 2025, whose conclusions appear in an article in the Hong Kong Economic Times.
From the perspective of JLL, stores and offices will continue to watch the revenue of rent because the Macao market depends many of the tourists in the interior of China and the consumer power on the other side of the border is in breaking.
According to the stores index prepared by the company, the rent value in the first half of this year was reduced by 0.3 percent compared to the end of last year. At the same time, the evaluation value of these properties fell 6.6 percent in annual terms. The report also points out that the debt ratio not paid to trade loans increased to 5.4 percent at the end of June.
According to the scenario set by JLL, it is expected that by the end of the year the number of stores for leaseing increases, which is justified with the growing desertification of the community neighborhoods and the transition from the economy to a model without casino-satellites.
Offices in crisis
Regarding the offices, JLL points out that local companies are increasingly focused on controlling costs and expanding financial and law services within China. For these reasons, the real estate points out that the value of the offices will continue to fall. JLL also estimates that since the first half of the year the offices have lost an average of 4.1 percent of the value compared to the end of last year.
In this environment, and according to statements by Mark Wong, the company's senior director, the most advisable investment opportunities are at the hotel.
With the prices of the rooms and the hotel occupancy rate, JLL believes they will benefit from the “stable and healthy growth of the game and tourism sector”, so investments will be more profitable.
Mark Wong also stated that the market shows confidence in hotel investments and has given the sale of the hotel the 13, which believes to be profitable in the medium and long term.</description><pubDate>2025-09-18 03:46:39</pubDate></item><item><title>Real Estate | August with more sales and more expensive prices</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/18/imobiliario-agosto-com-mais-vendas-e-precos-mais-caros/</link><description>The annual comparison shows that the average price of the square meter grew 800 patacas. The climb was motivated by the prices practiced on the Macao Peninsula, since both in the mud and in Colaane the square meter lost value significantly. In monthly terms, sales in August fell 20 percent from July
 
Last August, the number of housing sales showed a 17.5 percent annual growth, according to the data released by the Directorate of Finance Services. Last month 235 transactions were recorded, when in August last year it had been 200 transactions.
The most active market was that of the Macau Peninsula with 192 transactions, 42 more than last year, which represented a 28 percent growth. Taipa were recorded 37 housing sales, four less than last year. Finally, in Coloane, six transactions were registered, a reduction three sales compared to the same period.
In terms of housing prices, August was marked by a slight increase in the average square meter price, compared to the same month of 2024, from 79,569 patacas to 80,370.
The increase in the average price was due to the market of the Macao Peninsula, where the average price increased from 77,565 patacas per square meter to 82,976 patacas per square meter. This change represented a growth of seven percent, or 5,411 patacas per square meter.
Growth in the area of ​​the territory where more people live was enough to counteract the trend of mud and coloane, where prices show a negative trend. In the mud, the average price per square meter was reduced from 82,996 patacas to 71,897, a difference of 11,099 patacas, and in coloane of 87,453 patacas per square meter to 78,425 patacas per square meter, a reduction of 9,028 patacas.

A renovated Ukrainian, with the same name of the president, guilty Zelensky about the extension of the conflict that destroyed his village. Zelensky, the village, who has never left his land, now lives mortified because his favorite gravedigger died in the bomber.
This Zelensky, the village, represents half the world that reproves the other Zelensky, the villain, for not wanting to negotiate with Putin.
Negotiate what? The invader enters us through the house, pies us the wife and daughter (cf. recent UN report on Ukraine violations in this “special operation”), an act that forced us to watch, and then we say: Alto there, we are for peace, but we have to negotiate: You have not said the name you want to give to children!
A peace that is not worthy is but a cessation of rights. As severe as Russophobia that Putin inflicts his people.

In a lunch with several guests I hear a friend, who declares himself a spiritist, explaining about the particularities of his belief, in a serene and balanced way, would even say, without "irrationalism". He discussed long and serenely, devoid of any fanatical proselytizing. “Here is someone to whom belief brought weighting!” I thought, a rare alliance.
However, at one point a phrase that horrify me. He says, “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!” And I enter the voracious fauces of holism. Because holismo has a pathological aspect like all good things, a side of shadow.
Two examples: In Hinduism there is less sensitivity to existential dramas, if that child suffers in this life this is only an expression of the strict karmic symmetry, an effect of the acts she committed in her previous life. In Africa it is not accepted that death may have been accidental, and many women are accused by the dead family of having caused her husband's death, in an act of manifest dementia, and, in the blatant majority of cases, in a huge injustice to his wife - madness that spreads and infiltrates the social fabric.
Buddhism has introduced compassion and Christianity to Caritas, trying to break with this logic, but in many other beliefs and religions the cage of causalities prevails over sensitivity to experience, the need to respond to the now.
It is a tremendous logic that transforms the world into a platonic stage, where we are just the shadows of something -an inextricable law -in a determinism that calcines all singularities, but strangely fascinates many.
The conquest of modernity has anchored in the conquest of chance and random, subtracting the incidences of a life to this fierce determinism that closed the world in a web. When the Renaissance freed the body from the influence of the stars, at this moment sexuality was relieved of guilt and individualism and their volition could emerge.
There is an unequivocal moral implication in the phrase “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!”, Which should work as a key to self-knowledge and self-judgment, but usually this phrase is managed to seek a reason for things abroad from us in the other. It is an alibi.
There is a holistic temptation in the world today, as in the Middle Ages there was a satanic temptation, without great reflection on its consequences. Because it is not enough we want to connect everything in a resonant chain of affection. Even the most unexpected: affection itself can kill.
I realize, thanks to this cultured, balanced, intelligent woman, that “the combat” moved at the beginning of this century. One of the great misconceptions of the twentieth century was the false dichotomy between "rationalism and irrationalism", a debate that extended to all fields, including art. First, rationality was confused (the positive side of reason) with rationalism (the pathological feature of reason), and articulated in this lack of discernment was confused irrationalism with freedom. Almost all the art of the twentieth century, with surrealism to the head, worked in this error. The fallacy still exists despite having consolidated the emergence of 'irrationalism' and the consequent relativist currents that followed it. Essentially much of what happened in the twentieth century, it turned around this shock between two paradigms: rationalism versus irrationalism.
Now, I see, the indetermination, chance, the random of the terrible temptation of the causal cage. Holism, in its pathological feature, can be the reductionism that is the way it puts the way as a new 'eschatological narrative'.
Is it "by chance" that the holism emerges at the moment when neo-liberalism and its cynical contempt for the human person besides all freedoms, all acquired rights?
Holistic consciousness has brought positively a greater ecological awareness but followed by scholastic rigor drifting reality under the blanket of a determinism that is much more than inconvenience: all great authoritarian ideologies are holistic.
My friend will know how to combine her holistic and transpersonal belief with the freedom and responsibility that every moment asks us - but how many will make the destruction, under a law that explains and encompasses everything?
How many will not be abandoned to what it is?
The awareness of the indeterminate brings tragic conscience, as the Greeks knew, but also brings the will and the courage of the decision. And of this we cannot abdicate.
In addition, as Drummond shows in Carlos Drummond de Andrade's poem “Quadrilha”:
"John loved Teresa who loved Raimundo/ who loved Maria who loved Joaquim who loved Lili/ who did not love anyone./ John went to the United States, Teresa to the convent,/ Raimundo died of disaster, Maria stayed to aunt,/ Joaquim suicide himself and Lili married J. Pinto Fernandes/ who had not entered the story."
Real always runs outside the track, in full exteriority to our concepts. This is what is worth a J. Pinto Fernandes at the exact moment we thought we had everything under control.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Nobel and others</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/17/do-nobel-e-outros/</link><description>9/10/22
Reading many people's reactions when the Nobel Prize in this year's literature was announced, I couldn't help but remind me of this repair of Jean-Pierre Siméon, in relation to another Nobel Prize: “An editor of a large national newspaper wrote five lines of indignation because the Nobel Prize for Literature, a complete stranger. But unknown to whom? How did not occur to this patented and paid literary columnist to do his work, that his apparent ignorance was a matter of incorrect professional conduct? Tranströmer was translated into many languages, it was available in French. »
There is always the choir of those who wait for the announcement of the prize to complain about not being invited to the jury of the prize, there is a subgroup of Irados that professes “never read and I will not bother to read”; It is an uncommon fauna, which inhabits social networks.
I don't always know all the winners-I was unaware of the existence of Louise Glück, who I find a great poet, or the Olga Tokarczuk, for example-but it only brings me the comfort of knowing that the world is not a soap opera where everyone knows each other and the joy of recognizing that the gauge of the world is not measured with my short measure and that on the contrary it gives me a new opportunity to face the unknown.
And perhaps the most cretin of reactions was the smart one who wrote, but there are still those who read French? Confirming only that today there is a new kind of ignorance that fires with a displeasure: the one who only read English.
I would also prefer that, in French, Pascal Quignard, Linda reads, or even Sollers, or, among the new ones, Mathias is awarded, but that does not take dignity to the work of Annie Ernaux (and it would be enough to have written the “Les Années”). There are books of her that I like less, like the vulgar "a simple passion," but this happens with almost every authors, they have a channel books and others that are like intervals in their itinerary. I advise reading a beautiful book of interviews with her, "L'Ecriture Comme un couteau".

Yesterday came an article in Maputo's morning “News”, realizing that the Pen Club narrative prize was assigned to my wife, Teresa Noronha, for her soap opera “Tornado”, which had already had the Maria Velho da Costa award.
The summary they made of the book does not even deserve comments, by pathetic, but what matters to highlight is the note of disqualification about their "Mozambicanity" by calling it Luso-Mozambican. It is not inaccurate, but for those who know the context, it is a dirty touch.
Because finally, following the same logic, Adelino Timóteo should be called Tsonga-Mozambican, to Álvaro Taruma-Mozambican, and Macua-Mozambican to the writers who are from the north, etc., etc. Which is not reported to happen.
At the beyond moment, in the soap opera, she writes:
«Our color has never been dominant. In colonial time we were not white, we were ripped from monories, gone mugs, the pejorative term to speak of a son of Goes and Portuguese. In the postcolonial period, I was not black and if, in Lisbon, they took me by Brazilian or Cape Verdean, already in France were lost in cogitations of where they would be and amazed when they found out it was African. There I had to explain my DNA's wanderings before relying on moorms. It took me a long time to accept that it was so because yes, and that it was no curse that were so; On the contrary, I could even discover intense patterns of fantasy and freedom in this shrewd cloak that is our genealogy… »
In the current Mozambique it is white… and this is overlapping it soon to what it does or what it is.
It is sad, but as Naipaul warned, through these stops the race is everything and is soaked in it as deeply as, elsewhere, in religion.

Bruno Latour, an anthropologist who studied the sciences and their procedures and legitimations, law, technique and religions died and entertained themselves to turn the guts to the dogmas of the “modern”. For him the place, the expert's function, was more defined by the perplexity he embodied than for the supposed truth he would support him.
He proposed, as an alternative to the kinds of multiculturalism and his mistaken password "all different all the same", the return to "diplomacy", given precisely, not from the presupposition that "we are unified because participants of the same nature" but simply reveal that we "do not yet share an ordinary world"; It is necessary to deal frontally with the "abyss of disagreement" that separates us, rather than wanting to delude it.
And about politics said, disassessedly:
«If transparency is required from the politician, we kill him; If one requires fidelity to what the other was or he says, kills him; If a mimetic relationship is required between what the crowd wants and what its representative says, the representation is killed. These must, therefore, by definition, betray, deceive, modify, distort the word. Without this ability to double the word and betray, political language would not exist. I put the perfectly plausible hypothesis that political vocabulary will become as inaccessible as the religious language of the last twenty, three or fifty years. (in “UN Monde Pluriel plus Commun”). I believe it will be missed to decipher this frantically complex world that fit us.</description><pubDate>2022-10-17 02:18:03</pubDate></item><item><title>The yo -yo</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/30/o-fuxi/</link><description>O my friends, companions of these funerals trips to countries as old as the stars and the moon, and as strange as the profound interior of our disgraceful souls, - that startle still awaits us, what secret spells we will have to overcome, what horrors will rise to our dilated pupils of amazement and terror?
Increasingly close to our precarious existences, howling the war monster, which threatens to merge humanity with the earth, incessantly traveled by the squalid spectrum of hunger and the invisible evil of ten thousand pests.
O human human, who cries superior to his own nature, but then reveals to you, once and again, unable to simply order your existence and do not understand that you are possessed by the fickle wrath and are slave to your own ambition! Do not be content with the white jade or the light gold, there is no treasure that gives you your inextinguishable thirst for other men, animals and things; for in you an eternal anguish in you; in you crawl the expelled snakes; For you grows, powerful and impossible, the very fertile ivy of evil!
This is perhaps why on the mound they call the white deer, where one of the eight immortals in sacred mount was evolved through the skies to Penglai, inhabits the fuxa, a bird whose form resembles that of the rooster, although topped by a human head. What strange copulas, what monstrous amplexes, what terrible procedures will have occurred to make the existence of this animal sinister possible? We do not know, but it is enough for our exhausted mind to dare to raise an answer, so we soon feel the skin traveled by horrendous goose bumps and the heart trigger in paraded, which wild horse beaten by the night whip of fear, oblivious to reins and containment.
May men refrain from going through the Mount of the deer, because although there are riches capable of calming the most misunderstanding ambitions, if they have the disgraced fortunate to glimpse a fuxa, it will be immediately triggered the cultivated fields, because it will be beheaded the soft animals, for it will be sacrificed the best young man and destroyed superb from countries.
Fuxi emits a sound that resembles its name. If you hear it, dark night or clear day, goose way, for the path where you find you is the most right of the ways for misfortune!</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Procrastinators Club</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/29/clube-dos-procrastinadores/</link><description>Walking in rereading of Easter, because of an article I prepare, I give this excerpt, extracted from “the universal man”:
«Every man morally is one and absolute; But you have to live with your personality to mitigate. (…) Coexistence is only possible among people reduced to a negative or hollow presence, which is constantly giving in. Hence, the emptiness of society, a huge ghost composed of numerous deceased. An upper man is antisocial or criminal. Its destination is jail and desert.
He is in thinking about whether she reflects here about the political-social conditioning that gagging, and worse, in a sad country as Portugal was in the middle of the Estado Novo (and the book is from 1931) where any possibilities of spontaneity and frankness in human relations were coarcet, or only lends the behavior of men (oppressed) a metaphysical frame, a “essence”, from a presumption of each one in the presumption of each one be in isolation “one and absolute”. Sometimes, to an excess of spirituality (or longing), it adds to Pascoaes to lack the world. He is a great poet, but he is a poet who takes gray-Jewish ampoules and is therefore written amiiude on a programmatic furor, ceasing to have pores; There is often a glass between him and the real, the same one who made him wring the Ballet, 1921: “Everything is ghost. There are only clouds, clouds of voices, clouds of souls, afflictions and tragedies! Clouds and more clouds, appearances and more appearances! It is a divine lightning that pierces them, the instant appearance that arises and throws us to the ground, dazzled! »
Sometimes I would like to remind him, as Antonio Sérgio did in the article “Regeneration and Tradition, Moral and Economy”, which dedicated to Easter: “Easter, Easter my dear friend: You are a pure, excellent and noble poet, but also a victim of this social environment, like us all: this horrible isolation that you praise and I”.
"As a child, he stole two melos," says Jacinto do Prado Coelho, stole him from a nest, and throb his lifetime remorse for it. The person, few more mischief is known to him. Only in Álvaro de Campos sprouts a twinge of evil and obscenity: “Oh, and ordinary and dirty people who always seem the same,/ who employs profanity as usual words,/ whose children steal at the grocery door/ and whose daughters at eight years-and I think this is beautiful and I love him! -/ masturbate decent -looking men on the stairs. » (Ode triumphal).
Both poets beaten by a certain idea of ​​holiness, they were identical to the inability of breaking the siege of the skin with the overflow of the dike, the same curse of sublimating Eros's concrete ferocity with the mansuity of the verses.
Of course, they are the two "Bigger Than Life", but sometimes unnerves to watch, from my hostor's post at the Procrastinators Club, to the tantrums between them, just to see who occupies, in the internal organization, the place of president and treasurer.
Although a person has guessed more, for example, this he wrote in the least known martial ode and that is declining in the situation we live today, differently, with the heart in his hands:
«Ode martial

Helahoho! Helahoho!
The sewing machine of the poor widow killed to the bayonet…
She sews in the afternoon indeterminate ...

What is clear today, at this disastrous moment when Cristiano &amp; Company failed in their mission in Braga, and where the self-sabotage of Russia pipelines recalls that Putin will even be willing to maintain dominion over referendum zones,
It is that, pump per bomb, the “bomb” of the fifth empire was preferable.

The session, which has free admission, is co-organized by the Yunnan Tea Trader Association in Macao, and has the participation of guest speakers Chen Haoyan, founder of that institution; Zheng Zhanpeng, founder of Tea Company Lao Ban Zhang, Ltd. de Menghai; and Xu Yanting, heiress of the ethnic tea brand “Fire Pond Boiling Water”.
The doctor, writer, and usual presence at FRC events, Shee Va will attend the simultaneous interpretation between the Mandarin, Cantonese and Portuguese languages.
According to the FRC, the event aims to promote the understanding of the history and origins of the “Lao Ban Zhang” tea from the village with the same name in Menghai County in the southwest of Yunnan province, near the Myanmar border.
Located in a mountainous area of ​​1,700 to 1,900 meters of altitude, with an average annual temperature of 18.7 degrees Celsius, Lao Ban Zhang produces one of the rarest and appreciated types of tea Pu'er. Local minorities, such as the BU Lang tribe, have been responsible for tea plantations for centuries in this high region, which remains almost half of the year covered by a dense fog.
Tea Pu'er is a variety of traditional fermented tea from Yunnan Province, China, produced from the leaves of the Camellia Sinensis var. ASSAMEMICA. In the context of the production of this variety of Chinese tea, fermentation refers to the microbial process that usually happens after tea leaves have been sufficiently dry and curled in the form of “wet stacking”, allowing them to remain oxidizing until desired flavors are reached.
The final test
The dissemination of Yunnan's tea art and culture also includes a demonstration and tasting ceremony of “seven infusions”, which will be shared with the public at the FRC gallery, allowing lovers to know their authentic flavor.
"Most products currently sold, supermarkets and tea houses, are not pure tea. Consumers are simply buying a rolled -up tea cake on a piece of silk paper, not pure bingdao tea, Lao Ban Zhang or other varieties. The result is a bad and bitter flavor," explains the organizers of the session.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Timor-Leste | Students sing Vitória for the “Maubere People”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/18/timor-leste-estudantes-cantam-vitoria-para-o-povo-maubere/</link><description>The Timorese University Students gathered in protest in front of the National Parliament celebrated yesterday the victory of the “Maubere people”, after the announcement that the deputies had committed to their demands.
"Our struggle was not easy, it has gone through the collective effort of all over these three days," Timor-Leste University Student Coordinator (EUTL), José da Costa, told journalists after the end of negotiations with Timorese deputies. According to José da Costa, the students' victory resulted in a “conquest for the Maubere people”.
José da Costa said the protest, which should continue next week, was temporarily suspended, but university students in Timor-Leste will continue to "streamline political action in the country."
Eutl's general coordinator also thanked the Timorese and foreigners who financially supported their action, allowing the purchase of food and water for the protesters.
The five parties with parliamentary representation in Timor-Leste pledged yesterday with all the demands of university students in the country, who protested three days ago in front of the National Parliament.
The agreement was announced after almost seven hours of meeting between the representatives of university students and deputies of the National Congress of Reconstruction of Timor-Leste (CNRT, power), the Revolutionary Front of Timor-Leste Independent (Fretilin), the Democratic Party (PD), the Popular Liberation Party (PLP) and Khunto.</description><pubDate>2025-09-18 04:37:55</pubDate></item><item><title>Gaza | Beijing condemns Israel and calls for containment to all parties</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/18/gaza-pequim-condena-israel-e-pede-contencao-a-todas-as-partes/</link><description>China manifested yesterday "firm opposition" to Israel's military operations against Hamas in Gaza and that "any party involved attends the conflict" after the visit of the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Israel.
Chinese diplomacy spokesman Lin Jian said at a press conference that Beijing "condemns all acts that hurt civilians and violate international law" and said he was "deeply concerned about climbing tensions."
Lin urged Israel “to meet the energetic appeals of the international community and to immediately end the military operations in Gaza” to reach “a full and lasting ceasefire as soon as possible” and prevent a larger humanitarian crisis. "We hope that all parties give priority to regional peace and stability, maintain an impartial position and a responsible attitude and play a constructive role," he added.
Lin reacted to Rubio's statements that on Tuesday said that Israeli forces "began to carry out operations" in the city of Gaza and warned that there is a short time to reach a ceasefire agreement.
"The deadline is no longer in months, but probably on days and perhaps a few weeks," Rubio said, referring to the possibility of a truce for the Gaza Strip, where the Israeli army has fought since 2023 the Islamite Hamas movement, responsible for the worst terrorist attacks on Israeli soil, who killed more than 1,200 people and broke more than two hundred. According to the Islamis, Israeli retaliation has already killed about 65,000 people in Gaza.</description><pubDate>2025-09-18 04:30:58</pubDate></item><item><title>Internet | Control on Religious Activities "Online" reinforced</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/18/internet-controlo-sobre-actividades-religiosas-online-reforcado/</link><description>China has released new rules that govern the activity of religious figures on social networks, including permission to preach on Wechat social network and the prohibition of the use of artificial intelligence for proselytizing purposes.
The text, entitled “Rules of Online Conduct for Religious People”, was released on Tuesday by the National Administration for Religious Affairs, responsible for regulating religious practices in China.
Religious figures are forbidden to preach “through direct broadcasts, short videos, online meetings, Wechat groups or Wechat moments”, read in the text, referring to the resources of China's main social network. It is also forbidden to “offer virtual training courses such as 'meditation', 'spiritual retreats' or 'therapy' with religious content,” says the warning, quoted by France-Presse (AFP).
Only members of religious organizations that have obtained a state -issued permission may be exempt from these prohibitions. The text also prohibits the use of “general artificial intelligence” for proselytizing purposes.
Exceptionally, the document specifies that it also applies to religious figures using “foreign platforms” as well as those located in Taiwan.
These new rules are based on a series of laws that have come into force since the 2000s and significantly reinforced state control over religions, particularly in the digital sphere. By 2022, China had already banned any religion -related online service without an official license.
These policies explicitly aim at the 'sign' of religions and encouraging 'patriotic' faith under the 'orientation' of the Chinese Communist Party, can be read in official documents.</description><pubDate>2025-09-18 04:29:33</pubDate></item><item><title>Hong Kong | Government promises more patriotic education and national security</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/18/hong-kong-governo-promete-mais-educacao-patriotica-e-seguranca-nacional/</link><description>Hong Kong leader presented yesterday, in the quarterfinals of government action, a plan to promote patriotic education and reinforce the national security law, to consolidate stability and Chinese identity
 
The Hong Kong executive will keep the bet on promoting nationalism through patriotic education and reinforcement of the National Security Act, to consolidate stability in the region and the Chinese identity of residents. Unlike previous years, there were no protests in front of the local parliament, where John Lee Ka-Chiu gave the speech after the overwhelming majority of opposition groups and a higher police presence.
The chief executive emphasized the importance of deepening reforms, fostering economic growth and improving living conditions, capitalizing the strengths of the region.
The leader also reflected on the five years since the implementation of the National Security Act, stating that Hong Kong has exceeded a period of “chaos and disorder” and walks towards prosperity. However, John Lee promised to continue to improve the law - imposed by Beijing without passing the local Legislative Council - and its implementation mechanisms to punish any act that threatens national security.
The government leader stressed that more than one million people have visited an exhibition on national security inaugurated in 2024 and that more than 3,300 instructors were trained to promote the issue.
Lee reaffirmed his commitment to the 'A Country, Two Systems' model, which he described as the best option to ensure long -term Hong Kong's prosperity and stability.
Return to the origins
Originally proposed by Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping (1904-1997), the concept 'One country, two systems' promised Macau and Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy at the executive, legislative and judiciary for a period of 50 years. This principle was applied in 1997 and 1999, with the transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong and the Macao administration, respectively.
John Lee also pledged to maintain the constitutional order stipulated in the Chinese Constitution and Basic Law, Hong Kong's 'mini-constitution'. Regarding education, the Chief Executive announced an impetus to patriotic education, promoting facilities in mainland China as “bases for patriotic education” for students and young people.
Dozens of police patrolled the area yesterday around the Legislative Council, in a strong contrast with 2024, when members of the Social Democrats League protested demanding universal suffrage. The opposition group, one of the last bastions of dissent in Hong Kong, announced the definitive dissolution in June, citing the “immense political pressure” resulting from the implementation of the National Security Act.
International organizations denounced the law as a “emergency of human rights”, which accused of criminalizing peaceful dissent and led to more than 1,800 arbitrary political arrests, undermining freedoms of expression and association.</description><pubDate>2025-09-18 04:28:02</pubDate></item><item><title>UN | Independent Commission accuses Israel of genocide in Gaza</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/17/onu-comissao-independente-acusa-israel-de-genocidio-em-gaza/</link><description>An independent UN investigation committee yesterday accused Israel of committing genocide in the Gaza range since the beginning of the war on October 7, 2023, with the “intention to destroy” the Palestinians.
"We have come to the conclusion that a genocide takes place in Gaza and will continue to happen, and responsibility is up to the State of Israel," said this committee's chairman Navi Pillay by presenting the UN Commission investigation report on crimes committed in the occupied Palestinian territories.
Israel “categorically rejects” this “biased and liar report and calls for the committee's immediate dissolution”, the Ministry of Foreign Ministry said yesterday.
The highest Israeli leaders "orchestrated a genocidal campaign," added 83 -year -old Navi Pililary, former United Nations Human Rights Commissioner. The commission "concluded that Israeli President Isaac Herzog, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant urged genocide and that Israeli authorities have not taken any measure against these people to punish this incitement."
Investigations showed that Israelite authorities and security forces committed “four of the five genocidal acts” defined by the convention for the prevention and punishment of genocide crime of 1948.
These crimes are "killing members of a group; cause serious physical or mental damage to members of a group; deliberately imposing calculated living conditions to cause their physical, total or partial destruction; and measures to prevent births within a group."
"The international community cannot remain silent before the genocidal campaign launched by Israel against the Palestinian people in Gaza. When clear signs and evidence of genocide, the omission in acting to prevent it to prevent complicity arise," according to the committee.</description><pubDate>2025-09-17 02:12:34</pubDate></item><item><title>Timor-Leste | Second day of protests ends with dance and garbage collection</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/17/timor-leste-segundo-dia-de-protestos-termina-com-danca-e-recolha-do-lixo/</link><description>The second day of student protests in Dili against the perks of the Timorese deputies ended with dance and garbage collection, after an intense tear gas exchange and stones between protesters and police
 
Beginning yesterday morning, young people began the demonstration in front of the National University of Timor-Leste (UNTL) and with Parliament under a strong police device, which conditioned the protesters and eventually pushed them into the educational establishment.
After negotiations between students and the security forces, the police allowed the most manifestation to the top of Lisbon Avenue, where the National Parliament, Untl and the Resistance Museum Archive is located. But the moods exalted and quickly began to shoot tear gas at the protesters, who responded with the throw of stones and burnt tires on the roads, and a state vehicle was set on fire.
The disorders affected the Government Palace zone, the National Bank Overseas, Pateo, the National University of Timor-Leste (UNTL) and the Ministry of Justice.
In the early afternoon, after new negotiations between protester and police, the security forces device was reduced and the young people returned to the front of the UNTL and the National Parliament to finish the second day of protest.
"The 65 deputies who are currently in the National Parliament do not represent the Timorese people, do not discuss the legitimate interests of the people. Deputies take the position to achieve their personal, group and supporters, but are not responsible for the suffering that the people face," student César João Batista told Lusa.
Vicentino da Costa Lemos also criticized the performance of the "rogues" deputies, noting that the university students are representing the voice of the people. "The deputies make rascal decisions and we will fight. The resistance of university students, unreservedly firmness, the struggle continues," said Vicentino da Costa Lemos.
Next to Parliament, young people shouted slogans against the deputies, but also danced traditional Timorese songs. The protest ended peacefully, with the students to be summoned to the last day of manifestation, which takes place today. In the end, the young people collected the trash, including the burnt tires, left through the various streets where they passed in confrontation with the police.
Flame Streets
Timor-Leste firefighters supported the four-vehicle security forces and erasing the fireworks caused by protesters in Dili, who protest against the deputies' perks. "This event urgently forced us to intervene to support the police in light fires. We considered it necessary to combat these short situations," the National Director of Firefighters, Paulo de Oliveira Maia, told Lusa Aníbal, while on the ground was on the ground to delete tires burned by students in front of Benfica's area.
"When there is an alert, we respond immediately and our intervention seeks to prevent a fire from becoming something serious that could affect important resources. This is our intervention, preventive," said the director. The official said that, so far, students have only burned light objects such as tires.
“Our fire brigade vehicles also suffered some damage, but some, due to the existing protection, were not reached. Whenever there are manifestations, we came across these conditions and situations,” added Oliveira Maia.
The Timorese police managed to stop two male students yesterday, who were taken to the squad.
One of them, Nilton Xavier Belo, said that during the demonstration there were disagreements between the Timor-Leste National Police and the students. "I am ready to take responsibility for the act that was eventually provoked by my colleagues. I am ready to be held responsible," said the student. "This is part of democracy and freedom of opinion. I am here to represent my colleagues, but in relation to anarchism, I have not practiced any act. This is my position, there is nothing to justify the police stop me," said the student of the National University of Timor-Leste (UNTL), asking companions to continue to fight.
Students from four universities in Timor-Leste began a protest against deputies' perks, which was eventually dispersed with tear gas by the police, after protesters throw stones and other objects against the National Parliament, where the third legislature of the sixth legislature was due.</description><pubDate>2025-09-17 02:08:46</pubDate></item><item><title>Diplomacy | MNE argues that China and Europe "must be friends"</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/17/diplomacia-mne-defende-que-china-e-europa-devem-ser-amigos/</link><description>Chinese diplomacy head Wang Yi has argued that "China and Europe must be friends, not rivals, and cooperate, not confront," during a journey through Europe, according to the Chinese Foreign Ministry.

The application, which aims to compete with the Brazilian Ifood and Colombian Rappi, already operates in São Paulo (Southeast) and Goiânia (Midwest).
With the new investment, the company aims to extend services to at least 15 regional capitals by the end of 2025 and reach 20 until January 2026, the group said, after a meeting between the president of Didi, Will Cheng Wei, and Brazilian head of state, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.
According to the statement, the funds will also serve to support the creation of infrastructures for statches, with at least 50 million reais (eight million euros) for the construction of physical posts in various cities, with bathrooms, resting places, mobile phone chargers and water supply. A credit program is also planned for purchasing or renting electric motorcycles from Galgo, Riba and Vammo, which could benefit up to 600,000 statches over five years.
The total amount of this program, up to six billion reais (967 million euros), is not included in the investment of two billion reais announced.
Didi will also sign a partnership with the Chinese manufacturer of Yadea electric motorcycles, which has a factory in Manaus (North), to produce vehicles to be offered under preferential conditions to 99food delivery. “This investment reinforces Brazil's central role in Didi's global strategy. Few markets combine scale, innovation and opportunities like the Brazilian,” said Cheng, quoted in the statement.

After a session this week that highlighted the former Fai Chi Kei Public Housing Complex, Manuel Vicente, Jorge Figueira today approaches the Rui Cunha Foundation O Legado de Nuno Portas
 
Today participates in the Conference “Nuno Portas: From Architecture to Urbanism, from man to city”. What legacy did this Portuguese architect have left?
Nuno Portas is someone who in the late 1950s has a critical activity that is totally innovative and pioneering in the Portuguese context. Then, in the 1960s, he had a more international activity, having been the first to publicize the work of Siza Vieira. That's when he had the first contacts with Spanish and Italian architects, fundamentally. Also in these years he wrote two books that were also unusual, such as “Architecture for Today” in 1964, and “City as Architecture” from 1969. They were also an extraordinary way to try to catch what was going on in terms of international currents in architecture. But then there was also a [important] activity as an architect alongside Nuno Teotónio Pereira, namely in the work of the Church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, in Lisbon, and in a house in Vila Viçosa. Then, with April 25, 1974, he was appointed Secretary of State for Housing and Urbanism and launches the Saal - Outpatient Services to Local Support, a completely revolutionary social housing program, according to the spirit of the time. Then Nuno Portas devoted himself more to the issues of urbanism and not so much of architecture. He was linked to the beginning of Expo 98. It turns out to be someone who in the last 20 years of his work has more scientific and sociological concerns, and less artistic. It's something you had from the beginning, but then it becomes the hundred of your activity.
Did Nuno Portas have a relationship with Macau?
I think relationships would not be so intense compared to other architects and contexts, but we know that Nuno Portas was in Macao at the government's invitation to a conference between 2001 and 2002. It is interesting because of this passage we have echoes of what happened, as his surprise when discovering the Ellen Liang orphanage of Manuel Vicente, he did not know. It was the first work of Manuel Vicente in Macau, from the 60s, and we know that Nuno Portas was thrilled to visit this work, especially the small chapel that exists in the orphanage. It is interesting because there was no direct relationship between Manuel Vicente and Nuno Portas, they are very different poles figures, and even opposite. There is also an interesting and positive reference to the Siza [Vieira, Expansion Plan of the city of Macao (Areia Preta and Outdoor Port, 1982], and when Nuno Portas visits Macau is being built. It is interesting to have commented on this plan because in the 60s and 70s the relationship between Nuno Portas and Siza Vieira was no longer the same, and the fact that he had made complimentary references to Siza is very interesting.
He was a student of Nuno Portas. What other aspects of your career or personality can highlight?
I also worked with him. He was a cultured man, very intelligent and with an overwhelming memory. It was someone who liked to provoke, but in a good way, to discuss, to counteract. I was lucky enough to maintain a dialogue with him for decades, and this is my personal knowledge that I will convey. I also notice that it was a man very close to the power of Lisbon, the parties, but always very independent. He was a personal friend of Jorge Sampaio, he was secretary of state, but never had great political protagonism. On the one hand, this is due to his independence, but on the other he was such a controversial and intelligently restless figure that I think power was also startled by him.
This week also spoke at the “Lisbon, Porto, Macau, Maputo: Heroic Collective Housing from the 60s &amp; 70s” conference. How do you describe Macau's public housing projects in those years?
There are many architects that I could talk about, but I focused on Manuel Vicente's work in Macau, namely the public housing complex at Fai Chi Kei, which was demolished and then gave rise to the project of Rui Leão and Carlota Bruni. I did not speak concretely about Portuguese or Macanese architects, we also have names such as José Ways. Also because the Portuguese architects have always been few in Portugal, and from the 1950s there were about 150, then greatly increasing in number. But I made [at the conference] a tribute to the Portuguese architects who built during this period, because in a complex territory and with their vicissitudes, different from those that existed in Portugal, they knew how to do architectural experiences in the field of extraordinary public housing. I tried to demonstrate what was happening in Lisbon, Porto, Macao and Lourenço Marques, currently Maputo, in different ways. In Macao, relations were established, which I call heroic, in the sense that they were relations of experimental architecture, in which people had to adapt, to have their own spirit. These are architectures already with a little history, as it has passed 50 or 60 years, but the examples we find in these cities have continued to be remarkable.
What projects highlight these years?
I talked about Gonçalo Byrne's housing development “Pantera Pantera” in Chelas, Lisbon. I showed the “five fingers”, by Vítor Figueiredo, also from Lisbon, and the “Bouça neighborhood”, from Siza Vieira, in Porto. I showed Manuel Vicente's Fai Chi Kei complex and a Pancho Guedes project in Mozambique. Although they are already distant in time, these are architectures that remain fundamental references of the cultural and architectural points of view. There is a kind of narrative luck to be able to talk about such different sites, and with such different architects, and show how they had this heroic, experienced, even radical, experienced side that had the architecture of this particular period.
Has Macao had a positive evolution with regard to public housing supply?
I arrived in August and have been visiting the territory in recent years, so I have been following this process a little. Macao is obviously an extraordinary territory and from the outset by the coexistence of very different cultures regarding housing, which here has a completely different scale and expression of the Portuguese. In Portugal there is an aversion to public housing towers, it has always been unusual and the results that are known have not been successful for various reasons. But in Macao this is exactly what we see, public housing in towers and with a very strong expression. This has to do with the characteristics of the territory and also with a certain culture of China and Hong Kong. This is not to say that everything that is being built in Macau is good, there are towers and buildings with less interesting solutions or that result from a certain repetition. But there is no city that only has good architecture or good public housing. The challenge is to solve the large -scale housing problem, something that must be studied and thought. It is beautiful and overwhelming to see that Macau is a territory that grows day after day and it is exciting to observe this from the point of view of architecture. This is what I am doing, working on future projects.
Analysis projects, or academic?
Yes, I am a teacher and researcher at the University of Coimbra and columnist for the public newspaper, so my work is very much to analyze and investigate. I already published a lot about Macau and I want to resume some ends that I left to solve, let's say. I am very stimulated with everything I have seen and the people I have spoken with, and maybe I will increase my work on the territory from an academic point of view and at the plan of the investigation.
At a time when Portugal has a chronic housing problem, with a lack of public housing, could Macau be an example?
No directly, because of the typological issue of the housing tower. It might not be a welcome model in the Portuguese context. But no doubt Portugal needs to learn from other experiences and other territories and need to find solutions. Surely what happens in Hong Kong and Macau are experiences that are very interested in knowing, not to replicate, but to realize that this is a global problem [the lack of housing].
Remember Nuno Portas
The Rui Cunha Foundation (FRC) receives today, from 6.30 pm, the Conference “Nuno Portas: From Architecture to Urbanism, from man to city”, with Jorge Figueira. It will be time to talk about a route that the newly failed architect began in 1959, with a text about the new generation of the modern movement in Portugal. Texts followed in the 1960s and 70s with “scientific approaches”, with Nuno doors to a walk between architecture and urbanism, always in a reflective way. Nuno Portas was a “multifaceted figure, better known for launching the Saal Social Housing Program, which is still the target of investigation and an example”, describes Jorge Figueira in a note. The speaker is linked to the Center Social Studies and Department of Architecture of the University of Coimbra.</description><pubDate>2025-09-03 23:33:07</pubDate></item><item><title>Anabela Santiago, Academic: “China is a reformist and moderate”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/30/anabela-santiago-academica-a-china-e-reformista-e-moderada/</link><description>Anabela Santiago has just defended at the University of Aveiro the doctoral thesis that analyzes how China has been positioned in recent decades as an important actor in the “global health governance”. Today, Beijing seeks “alternative mechanisms” of cooperation in the “global south” and tries to build an alternative model to the World Health Organization
 
 
Let's start with the concept of Global Health Governance (GGS). Is this a more contemporary concept or relating to the post-war period and the Foundation of the World Health Organization (WHO)? What have been the main actors of this governance until China's growth?
GGS is a concept whose prominence and relevance have grown significantly in the 21st century, largely driven by economic globalization and worldwide interconnection. Although global health has always transcended national borders, demanding multidisciplinary approaches and international cooperation, only from the 1990s it was made greater awareness of it. Historically, GGS has been predominantly influenced by western powers and neoliberal values. The main actors of this governance, until China's growth, were historically marked by interventions of entities such as WHO and non-governmental, predominantly American and European organizations.
One of the findings of its doctoral thesis is that China has been progressively positioning itself in this leadership. This position started specifically when and why?
Yes, China has been progressively positioned as a relief actor in the evolution of the GG system. Although it is not possible to point out an exact date of start, China has evolved from a relatively isolated country to a main actor in global political, economic and technological arenas. Its growing economic and political influence also represents a change in GGS's historical dynamics, and in the 1960s China tried to play a humanitarian health care role in neighboring countries and Africa. The thesis points out that China's experience can be seen as an example of what is achievable when a state chooses its own way rather than a pre-established model, aligning itself with the 21st century prediction as the "century of Asia."
Did the pandemic years influence this position? How?
Covid-19 pandemic highlighted the need for global health cooperation, as well as the potential consequences of the failure to prioritize global health. The thesis explores the evolution of the Health Silk Route before and after the pandemic, indicating that the pandemic years allowed greater awareness of the need for instruments such as the Health Silk Route as the most effective cooperation platforms among nations. Although not detailed in this specific section, it is implicit that the pandemic intensified China's performance in health diplomacy and health development assistance.
Looking at the internal reforms that China has carried out in the health area, which highlights as the most important?
I approach, in the thesis, the reforms of the China Health System and I point out that the Chinese governance model is a unique combination of state -oriented economic reforms and development by the state, incorporating elements of neoliberalism and authoritarianism into political issues in general, and the health sector is nothing different from the rest. One of China's mentioned contributions, recognized by WHO, is its primary health care model based on the recognized good practice of “barefoot doctors” (barefoot doctors). In addition, the thesis analyzes the main reform policies and their progress and challenges in the period 2009-2018, which comprise the reforms of primary health care, hospital and pharmaceutical reform. The “Healthy China 2030” program is also an important and ambitious reference of China's domestic reforms in health, also encompassing social determinants.
Is Beijing's intention to create an alternative entity to WHO, or simply create an alternative movement that can coexist with WHO, in the context of the relationship with the global south? How could this work?
The thesis suggests that China adopts a "dual approach": while integrating in existing global structures, forging simultaneously alternative paths, particularly through regional alliances such as BRICS and partnerships with Global South. This indicates an intention to create an alternative movement that can coexist and complement the role of WHO, rather than a direct alternative entity. China demonstrates a clear commitment to align the objectives of the “Belt and Road” initiative with the united nations sustainable development objectives, showing their willingness to present these initiatives as complements to the existing cooperation mechanisms in the international liberal order. President Xi Jinping's view of a “future community shared for humanity”, which includes the notion of a “global health community for all”, also points to a new perspective in international cooperation.
Traditional Chinese Masks, Vaccines and Medicine (MTC): What are China's products or instruments to position itself as an increasingly global actor in GGS?
The thesis points out that China is an indispensable provider of global public health, essential for the product supply chain, such as masks and vaccines. The MTC is also mentioned as one of China's great contributions to global health governance, with its chinese herbal treatments, some of which already recognized by WHO in 2017. In addition, Chinese medical assistance and medical teams sent to other regions of the globe are important instruments of Chinese health diplomacy.
In creating an alternative movement or reality to WHO, China may be taking advantage of the lack of full representativeness in the same WHO, or gaps in its operation?
The thesis does not address directly whether China is taking advantage of a lack of full representativeness in WHO or gaps in its operation. However, it emphasizes that the work aims to fill a gap in scientific knowledge in relation to the paradigm of health governance from a non-western and liberal perspective, emphasizing China as an actor of the global south. This suggests that China seeks to strengthen alternative models that can offer more personalized health challenges, different from those defended by Western countries, positioning itself as a moderate reformist actor.
How has the European Union (EU) foreign policy in relation to China affecting or influenced this position of the country in global health governance?
In the thesis, the fourth publication, entitled "Challenges on the European Union-China Cooperation in Higher Education from" People-To-People Dialogue ’Perspective: The Case of Health-Related Joint Projects," explores cooperation in higher education, in particular that includes health-related projects. Therefore, despite the strategic and economic dialogue, the deterioration of UE-china bilateral relations intensified, with the commission to assume a decline of enthusiasm due to “China's countermeasures to EU human rights sanctions, economic coercion and commercial measures against the single market, and the positioning of China in the war in Ukraine”. Although challenges and tensions are recognized, cooperation in higher education, including health projects, is seen as part of a broader picture of strategic partnership between EU and China. However, it is evident that there is no long tradition of health cooperation between EU and China in higher education, and that there are few joint projects compared to the general panorama. It is suggested that both EU and China should make more efforts to align medical study curricula and promote more joint research in areas related to health, infectious diseases, among others.
In the Trump 2.0 era, and without pandemic, what could be China's role in global health governance?
Although the thesis is published this year, it focuses on the preceding period and includes the pandemic, where it does not speculate directly on a future scenario of “Trump 2.0” without pandemic. However, the thesis argues that China is not just a participant, but a moderate reformist force in the formation of global health standards. Regardless of future political scenarios, their growing economic and political influence, strategic health diplomacy, internal reforms and initiatives such as the Health Silk Route will continue to shape their role in global health governance. The view of a “global health community for all” also remains a guiding principle for China's efforts.
Does this power of China in GGS verify more with bilateral or multilateral agreements?
The thesis suggests that China's power in global health governance manifests itself through both bilateral and multilateral agreements, but with a growing emphasis on certain forms of cooperation that strengthen their role in the global south and through alternative mechanisms. Although the thesis does not explicitly quantify the predominance between bilateral and multilateral, the focus on regional alliances (BRICS) and partnerships with the Global South (which often involve bilateral agreements and group cooperation initiatives) and the Health Silk Route indicate a hybrid approach.</description><pubDate>2025-06-30 23:46:26</pubDate></item><item><title>Macao Forum | Secretary-General says it has never discussed widening to Hispanic countries</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/30/forum-macau-secretario-geral-diz-que-nunca-se-discutiu-alargamento/</link><description>In an interview with Lusa agency, the secretary general of the Macau Forum, Ji Xianzheng, assured that “never discussed” the widening of action to Hispanic countries, but that the willingness already stated by the government of Sam Hou Fai will have to be the authorities to decide a new direction to the cooperation strategy
 
The Secretary-General of the Macau Forum stated that the institution “never discussed” the creation of an entity to extend to Hispanic countries to promote economic cooperation similar to those that provide the connection between China and Portuguese-speaking countries.
“Within the Macao Forum, we have never discussed this topic,” said the Forum Secretary-General for Economic and Commercial Cooperation between China and Portuguese-speaking countries Ji Xianzheng.
The official acknowledged that, "in society, there were some conversations to discuss or address the possibility of promoting more contact and cooperation with Spanish -language countries, but at the Forum level we have never addressed this theme."
The Macao executive announced in mid -April the intention of creating a center to promote economic services between China and the Portuguese and Spanish languages ​​in the neighboring special Economic Zone of Hengqin.
The idea is to provide companies in Hispanic countries services in the “linguistic, legal, fiscal, verification of compliance with norms, formation, arbitration and mediation”, according to the Secretary for Administration and Justice, André Cheong.
Days earlier, the chief executive, Sam Hou Fai, had also announced the intention of “promoting exchange and cooperation” through Macao between China and the universe of Spanish -speaking countries.
Although Macau wants to widen focus to Castilian -speaking countries, “the forum will remain the forum for China and Lusophony countries,” said Ji Xianzheng. The secretary general clarified that the institution that directs "can contribute contributions to the greater opening of Macao in international cooperation", as is the intention announced by the new government of MSAR.
Complementary forum
Personally, the secretary general has ensured that he had “pleasing to work with all parties,” but stressed that this is a “decision that is up to central governments to make” and that the forum was never contacted in this regard.
"Yes, I worked in Latin America, Spain, nine years in Madrid and Caracas. But this is not a decision of personal interest, it is up to politicians to make the decision," he said, explaining that the idea will be to promote the relationship between Macao and Brazil and then to other Latin American countries, as well as expanding the relationship with Portugal to Spain.
"There is no limit. The Macao Forum is complementary. It does not restrict any promotion of the cooperation of the other parts," he said.
According to the Macao Government Communication Office, Sam Hou Fai admitted on June 21 that he postponed a trip to Portugal, scheduled for July, and should also pass through Spain and the European Union headquarters in Brussels.
Bad interpretations
In the same interview with Lusa, the Secretary-General of the Macao Forum imputed to national governments the responsibility for conducting development and economic cooperation policies, stressing that the institution “has no investment projects”.
Ji Xianzheng attributes criticism to the Macao Forum to an wrong interpretation regarding the body's mission. "The forum is a mechanism of cooperation between central governments. Many people think it is to the secretariat that it is up to the execution of policies, but we have a limited number of people," added Ji.
"The secretariat has no investment projects, it is a mechanism for preparing the ministerial conference, connecting with governments, not a promotion agency. It has not been thought of, connects with the promotion agencies. We are four people sent by China and one delegate for each country," he said.
At the last ministerial conference, in April 2024, then Portuguese Economy Minister Pedro Reis argued that the Portuguese Language China-Parais Cooperation and Development Fund should bet more on small and medium enterprises (SMEs).
The Cooperation Fund was created in 2013 by the China Development Bank and the Macao Industrial and Commercial Development Fund, with a thousand million dollars, of which about 60 percent have already been invested, according to the secretary general.
Action plans
Ji Xianzheng has admitted that SMEs are "a difficult theme for any government" and that "international cooperation for the promotion of development and cooperation of small and medium enterprises is even more difficult. It is a topic that is being debated daily worldwide." But admitted, "here, little."
"But it is stipulated in the action plan [2024-2026]. It is up to central governments and commerce chambers, promotion agents, to work together to do this. The secretariat assumes responsibility as authorized by the central governments, specifically, in the activities program," he said.
Politicians from various countries, including Portugal, Angola and Mozambique, have appealed to a change in the rules of the fund's candidacy. Current rules require, for example, that candidate projects have a minimum investment of five million dollars, and the fund only covers 20 percent of total investment, referring the rest to governments or companies.
Ji Xianzheng said the new fund's new direction "is committed to promoting a broader investment, with better coverage for all forum countries, [relatively] to projects that have a strategic or significant impact on the socioeconomic development of participating countries."
According to the secretary general, "the terms of application [of the rules of access to the background] will be more flexible and the forms of application will also be more diverse." “Instead of being just direct investment, they are also studying ways to apply the fund, in cooperation with other funds or with other financial institutions,” he gave as an example.
"This fund has an operation according to market rules. It is not a humanitarian aid fund. Therefore, it has to guarantee the minimum return of benefit. But, on that, they are very open to study, in this case, the conditions of each project," added Ji Xianzheng, but to give examples of "flexibilization of the rules."
Regarding the approximation of the China universe and countries of the Iberian Peninsula, already cemented in official speeches, economist Maria Fernanda Ilhéu, president of the Seda's New Route Association, told HM, earlier this month, that this intention is “very objective and pragmatic and can be summarized to the Macao economy diversification project, for which companies and investors are not only in Macao, but also from Macao, but also from Macao, but also from countries, but countries Portuguese Language ”.
"But the fact is that companies and institutions from Portuguese-speaking countries are not being effective in responding to this need for Macao. Therefore, widening companies and Spanish institutions this invitation to cooperation seems logical to me," the economist said.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Isabel Rio Novo, author of the biography of Luís de Camões: “Time in Macau was of tranquility”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/26/isabel-rio-novo-autora-da-biografia-de-luis-de-camoes-tempo-em-macau-foi-de-tranquilidade/</link><description>It will be launched tomorrow, at the Consulate General of Portugal in Macau and Hong Kong, the biography of Luís de Camões, by Isabel Rio Novo. In an interview with HM, the author unravels some secrets about the poet's life in Macau, a period of relative calm in the middle of a almost always turbulent life
 
Why did you decide to get in the writing of another biography of Camões?
It is true that Luis Vaz de Camões has been biographed many times over 500 years. However, 50 years ago there was no biography about him. From my point of view and the editor, Camões deserved a more current biography that revised all kinds of prejudices, seeking known sources, the uncovered information research and where the rereading of all previous works were rereading. This biography is not only a summary, but also the reinterpretation of what has been known, but which had rarely been related. The book also brings some new data with some documentation that was discovered.
How was your relationship with the writing of Camões born?
I fell in love and went to those young readers who was not tormented with Camões. On the contrary, I liked it soon and let myself be seduced by Camões Lyric. I am from the areas of comparative literature and history, and in this sense I always understood the dimension and importance of the work of Camões.
And what are they?
It is a work and an author of its time and its time, which was extraordinary, with the Renaissance, Humanism and the travels of navigation. But at the same time, it is a work that is the product of an outstanding literary genius, one that we can tell a handful in the history of universal literature.
What camões we find in this biography?
I tried to go to the bottom, remove layers of the meaning that these 500 years were adding to Camões, in the sense that each season read its Camões and produced its interpretation. I wanted to discover the substrate, the man of flesh and bone he lived and wrote 500 years ago.
He was a man suffered, with many financial difficulties.
He was a man with a complex and difficult relationship with reality, not only of his time, but also with reality [itself]. The theme of the time, the disconcerting of the world, how society seems to work instead of what should work, being a literary topic of the Renaissance, it was something Camões felt personal and genuinely.
How?
He lived a series of disagreements, of extreme experiences. Suffice it to say that you have been stuck several times and for various reasons. He made great trips at a time when these were absolutely risky, long, and complicated enterprises. Camões was involved in military expeditions, and almost all his life was soldered. But this set of experiences allowed him to be almost everything someone could be at the time he lived.
He was one of the most traveled authors of the time, having been in Brazil, Goa…
Yes. Even the connection to Macau, which is contested by some scholars, but not by me… I am persuaded, given the existing documentation and indirect testimonies, which Camões passed through China with the position of Dead and Missing Provider. When this happened, albeit very incipiently, the Portuguese establishment in China, which was already Macao. It is not known whether Camões held this position assigned to him by Viceroy D. Francisco Coutinho, if he was exactly assigned to be a provider during the trip, or a provider at Macao's establishment. But what he knew from China was surely this little warehouse that Portugal had achieved, at a lot of cost, with great difficulty and after many attempts to obtain in China.
What did a deceased provider?
Whenever a Portuguese died in the East, a soldier or merchant, it was necessary to ensure the rights of the heirs, the families who were normally in Portugal. The provider had to identify the deceased, his naturalness, origin and make the heirs known. He also had to keep the deceased's assets before they were stolen, auction them, keep the coins that would result in, and then take it all to Lisbon. It was a process that, if it went well, took many months, because it was necessary to send this money to the authorities of Goa who later sent him in the career from India to Lisbon.
Can we talk about a period of stability in Camões's life in Macau?
Yes. Until this appointment as a deceased provider, everything Camões knew from the East had been as a soldier. As soon as Goa [1553] arrives weeks later in a first military expedition. We know why: Not because I had some war appeal, but because only participating in expeditions earned your welding. Although everyone said that the soldiers lived very poorly, the welding was what Camões had to survive. The time lived in Macao, when he was free from soldier obligations, was a time of tranquility regarding subsistence, which was assured. He had some time and calm to continue the work with "the Lusíadas." More than that, as much as the sources allow to deduce, Camões met in Macau a phase of balance in terms of personal and loving life, as, on the return trip, he brought with him, according to the testimony of Diogo do Couto, a Chinese girl.
Dinamene.
This was the term used by the chronicler. We don't know if it would be a Chinese or Asian girl. This girl with whom Camões lived maritally was someone who liked it very much, according to the testimony of Diogo do Couto. But Dinamene would certainly not be her name, as it was a mythological name that, by the way, Camões used in her lyric, even before she boarded the East. Chinese girls with whom soldiers and merchants in Macao lived amanced were baptized and received a Christian name. Therefore, Dinamene would even have a Christian and Portuguese name. But as we do not know her name, and if we are aware that we use a kind of metaphor, we can call it Dinamene.
She dies later on a trip and makes Camões very shaken.
On Macao's return trip to Goa, probably at the end of his mandate as a provider, Camões suffers the celebrated wreck, in which he loses the personal assets he had ease, including the assets of the deceased that he was guardian, and this will bring him complications. It also suffers the loss of dynamine. The wreck went with some in the seas of China, probably by the mouth of the Mekong River.
Considers unlikely to have lost part of "the Lusíadas."
The first biographers say Camões was saved from this wreck with a board. It is not unreasonable that he managed to save the manuscript of the Lusíadas on this board. But it is also no excluding that Camões knew his poem by heart. The memory of people in the sixteenth century was different. They were very used to keeping things from memory. And we know, because the proof is obtained in the work of Camões, that it had an extraordinary memory. I have a way to prove it, of course, that Camões is one of the rare authors who knew his poem by heart.
Do you think Camões had a lower life to his true talent?
Undoubtedly. According to a too extensive set of concordant testimonies, he dies poor, even in miserable conditions, and according to an eyewitness, without having a blanket with which he covered himself. On the other hand, Camões was known to follow the publication of the Lusíadas, who were commented and read [in the poet's life time]. We have the testimony of Faria de Sousa, one of the first biographers of Camões, which says that when he passed the streets, people stop and pointed. Camões also had a figure that stood out, with a leaked eye and using a pale. By then, I would be quite sick, using crutches. But there is a set of poets, which is very unreliable that they did not know Camões, who never refer to them. There are, on the other hand, other humanists, such as Pedro Magalhães Gândavo, who from the outset praises him as the prince of Portuguese poets.
But the king gives him a tendency for deeds provided and the publication of "The Lusíadas."
This famous tendency, which should not be a big deal, because all ancient biographers say it was derisive, is attributed to him as a kind of military reform, because of the 17 years of service in the East, and not as a reward for the publication of "The Lusíadas." D. Sebastião's mercy letter, which attributes him the title of nobleman knight, had no repercussion in practice, but gave him 15 thousand reais. [The publication of “the Lusíadas”] was an additional argument [for the letter] and not the main argument. This leads us to believe that D. Sebastião will not even have read or heard “the Lusíadas”, will have received indirect information, favorable about the poem.
How did the process of editing “Os Lusíadas” occurred?
It was an event, because both the press and the books that were published a year were a very small amount. In the year in which “the Lusíadas” are published were the only work of non -religious caress [to be edited]. To fund the edition, it is more than likely that Camões had the support of a patron, probably D. Manuel de Portugal, from the Condes do Vimioso family. Getting the work was a press was a mere and complicated process, as it had to go through the prior examination of the civil authorities, the royal authority and the censorship of the Inquisition. The resident of the Holy Office does not only let the book pass, but to make an amount of almost unprecedented compliments in the license that authorizes the publication of the work. If we go to the opinions emitted by the same rear, there is no other work on which he is as compliments as it was with the epic of Camões.
In Indonesia, he befriended a slave on the island of Java.
Camões was, at least once, on the island of Ternate, Indonesia, in the archipelago of molucas, at a time when there were conflicts motivated by an extremely cruel Portuguese captain towards the king or sultan of Ternate, which originated a kind of war between the Portuguese and the places. Camões has a song that describes the island of Ternate. We do not know if it was at this time, or in another passage to the Far East, that Camões turned on to a Jaú, or Javanese, but could not be exactly from the Far East, but a freed slave who had been linked by friendship to Camões. And this is because in one of the first biographies of Camões it reads that Jaú, with the Christian name António, asked for alms at night. This freedom of movements of a slave indicates that he would probably be a freed slave. He asked for alms to Camões, for himself and the mother of Camões, with whom Camões will have lived in recent years of life.</description><pubDate>2025-06-26 23:30:50</pubDate></item><item><title>Piménio Ferreira: “Anti-igan rhetoric has always worked in Portugal”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2021/04/26/pimenio-ferreira-a-retorica-anti-cigana-sempre-funcionou-em-portugal/</link><description>Piménio Ferreira, better known as Gitelles Ferreira, anti-racist militant, 34, physical engineer, national Romani. He is a man with a provocative speech, a corrosive, kind mood and a smile that leaves no one indifferent
Gitelles, we live in an intercultural land and the Gypsies - in particular - have lived about five centuries in Portugal. What is going on for Gypsy communities to remain “on the fringes” of the so -called society? 
The model of society remains to be changed. This is extremely stratified by placing people in subordinate places to privilege a violent minority. The white social structure is patriarchal and racist. What is called the "margin" of society is actually an intrinsic place to it, which belongs to it. In other words, Gypsy people have been included in this model of society since they discovered Europe and its kingdoms. The problem is the model of society that is maintained and the place to which they were relegated and how they were relegated: with violence, in inferior status against whites, without the right to human dignity, to constitute a family, to choose one's own language and religion, expropriated from any and all cultural and material law. A place built and maintained to this day by violence and genocidal and ethnicidal persecution. In 1463, a Gitano Vasco was drowned to an estate. In 1521, Gitans, or Gypsies, were already used as a reference for all that is considered bad in the model of society. The "counter-exemple" in the face of the white that would stand out for the positive. The 'angel' and the 'devil'; the 'other', the enemy; That against whom any attack and persecution is legitimate. Including the prohibition of defending, having weapons, any kind of goods, and the right of permanence.
And is this right to permanence that we still have nomadic gypsy communities within the country is denied?
Yes, no doubt. There are many ways to force nomadism: directly, prohibiting permanence and expelling with police or military force; indirectly, refusing public or private housing to Gypsy people, as they are Gypsy; and even through the gentrification process.
I read the result of an inquiry from the European Union Fundamental Rights Agency, which is said to be approximately 80% of the Gypsies inquired live below the risk threshold of poverty in their country; One in three Gypsies lives in a housing without channeled water; One in three Gypsies belongs to a family where someone hungry at least once the previous month; and 50% of Gypsies aged 6 to 24 do not attend school. Why does this happen like this? 
It is the historical persecution, which continues. There is no impoverishment that has no external cause. In this case, a political system of total expropriation and imposed on the basis of violence. Already in 1648, D John IV, the restorer, prohibited ‘Giving or Rent houses to Gypsies’. The same D John IV who got the kingdom of Portugal thanks to D. Jerónimo da Costa and his 250 knights. The same D. Jerónimo da Costa who had died to defend Portugal's independence from Castile. Gypsy, like his wife and children. Between prohibitions of permanence, “that do not enter Gypsies in the Kingdom and leave those who are” (D John III, 1526), ​​with expulsions, degred to the galleys, expropriation of goods and properties, imposed with stripping, mutilation and death, systematically performed to this day (still in 2011 Faro City Council wanted to ban Gypsies in the municipality).
The prohibition of working on others (no one employs Gypsy workers, and those who accept they do it in total precariousness, for poorly paid positions and without decent rights and conditions). They cannot be dependent on their own work, they cannot get investment means due to extreme expropriation. Are dependent on precariousness. If you want to know what it is like to live in pure neoliberalism, know the lives of Gypsies. Their reality is paradigmatic of the aggression and depletion to which the "gentlemen" are willing to go to their benefit.
What do you talk about is economic and political power?
The group of political, social, cultural and economic power. The owner, the colonizer. This group that has been in power since it established the system of current domination. And that only makes sense within the hierarchically stratified sociopolitical model in which we live. Hence the need to end 'gentlemen' and institute a new model of society, healthy, free, without hierarchies or strata, whether of race, class or gender.
The model we live in leads to the Gypsy (and not only) community to economic exclusion, removing it from access to product consumption or excluding them from its production process; political exclusion associated with lack of access to information; To education and consequently the social exclusion that is seen in inequality of access to quality community areas such as restaurants, libraries, theater, cinema, concerts, health care, etc. How do you feel a gypsy child when you realize that it is not part of a whole? Children who are never represented, neither in movies, nor in books, nor in cartoons, not even in an announcement to eat cereals, for example? Is this a disaster for self-esteem, is a priori condemnation?
The question is that. Gypsy people are not “excluded from society”, by contrast, they are included in it. The problem is the existence of what is cynically called 'social exclusion', which term Orwellian, and there be under coercion, people. Which field of concentration and extermination. Incidentally, Nazi concentration camps are a more visual realization than called 'social exclusion' and, as here, were not a 'excluded' part of Nazi society, but rather its fundamental and characterizing structure. It is a place of violence, where people are maintained by violence, dedicated to their extermination, and designed so that few people can leave. And yet they resist. As in Nazi concentration camps.
And what you have listed as an example of 'consequence' of this 'exclusion', is actually the means by which this exclusion also happens and remains. Gypsy people are out of theaters, both as consumers and producers (but go to the cinema). They are out of school, education and the gym. Either as 'users' or as producers (but go to school and are on the basis of knowledge construction and academic and scientific debates).
Even in attacking Gypsy children's self -confidence, we talk about a maintenance mechanism of this situation. But Gypsy people respond very well: with Gypsy pride. Another resistance, another aggression. Gypsy people are thus included in society. In a place that belongs to this model of modern society. And they resist and contradict the power of domination and make a point of being in the city, in the cinema, in the theater, in the gym, in all spaces. With a lot of struggle and always resisting, but they are there. Social exclusion, more than a “place outside of society”, is part of its social structure.
Do you want to say that there is a collective resistance?
At work, already in a context of absolute precariousness, during the pandemic, Gypsy people rolled up sleeves and showed once again proactivity and creativity in adversity. They learned seeing and doing. And here, it is again the women who jump to the front line, face, learn to use digital tools with their daughters or children, and throw themselves into the network. And so they explore online sales as well as application by application (transportation or rehabs). In housing, in a context of pandemic in which the evictions were not locked - as they owed and dictated the law itself - residents did not fail to organize and fight unjust evictions and claim dignity in housing; associations of allied residents in their action with other housing and anti-racist struggle organizations.
It should also be noted how they reinvented and intensified to raise and distribute dietary goods and kits of masks/alcohol gel to the most expropriated people. Gypsies and non -Gypsies. In the anti-racist struggle, new movements emerged and their actions intensified by social networks. People who had never been organized or militated before began their first steps in activism, thickening this way of the organization and popular gypsy and anti-racist action. People forget, or do not want to value, but Gypsy action has helped determine results in the political dispute. Gypsy citizens mobilized in large and determined electoral results in the municipalities of 2017, both in Alentejo and in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area, even causing electoral earthquakes.
And even in the presidential, second place was resolved by a value equivalent to the estimated number of Gypsy voters. Apart from the non -Gypsy votes that were mobilized by the action of Gypsy voters. Gypsy people are even co-considering power in the spaces of opinion, local media, social networks and party and institutional political dispute. And most importantly, in the popular Ação and alliances with other social movements. We have never stopped fighting for all means and continuing to resist.
In contrast there are more and more hate speeches, from the far right in particular. What do you have to say about it?
To start these speeches are historical and European. Not even current and even less “of the far right”. These speeches have been adopted and rendered for a long time, even in 'democracy and freedom', by several representatives of the center right, conservatives, left center, liberal, liberal left, even representatives of the PCP. Anti-egana rhetoric has always worked in Portugal as it is the whiter rhetoric [white genesis]. That is, it allows you to create and give the "white" as the superior of all. And so please the white electorate who, when feeling well, pays off with his vote. Even if the policies implemented by their elected harm him even more.
Finally, did you like them to talk a little about your personal experience and how did you get to the activist?
I studied, fought for studies, made alliances, graduated, went in the labor market of the “formal precariousness”. I started my militant action and here I am today. We can transform this society a better. This certainty combined with the fact that the current one has so much suffering makes anyone want to have a transformist attitude. I wanted to be 'inventor' (physical engineer) and anti -racist militant. And through study (not necessarily schooling) and organization with others, in turn, with other studies, formations and visions, I learned how the world works and how it can be changed. But before transforming, we need to survive.
Hence two types of actions arise: transformative and survival. The struggle against hate discourse arises as survival, but his defeat will be a transformative victory. There is a lot that - like people who want a better world - we have to do, namely working to criminalize hatred speech; condemn and prohibit organizations with racist discourses and practices; denounce the racist institutional structure and logics that organize power and generate community resources. And in this sense, there have been various types of actions, of petitions, to manifestations. And we need more.
I, besides being a military man in the SOS Racism movement, participate in the “We came to stay” podcast, with Mamadou BA and Joseph da Silva. And if all goes well, we will soon start a new project. With friendly people, we also have the project “Gypsy Initiative”, dedicated to reflecting and promoting transformative movements. Essentially focused on educating against anti-agigarism, denouncing historical and continued genocide and working for a new society project. Also with new projects on the gutter. And finally, there are always voluntary actions without an organization, where I try to share what I found out about anti-egism and Roman history in schools and with interested people. In addition, there is still the struggle for housing, because the evictions did not stop during the pandemic. Due to housing and work precariousness, the subjects racialized especially the Roma nationals are the most vulnerable to COVID-19. There is essential to have actions in this area; Of all the struggles, this is the most structural, as it goes against one of the main enemies of a healthy society: the real estate speculation of this capitalist system, which places profit and goods above people and their humanization.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>GP Macau | Michael Rutter fails this year's edition</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/08/gp-macau-michael-rutter-falha-edicao-deste-ano/</link><description>Nine times winner of the Macau Grand Prix, Michael Rutter, will fail the 72nd edition of the Macao Grand Prix. The charismatic British pilot continues to recover from the serious accident suffered at Isle of Man TT last June and is not fit to fight for tenth victory
 
In early summer, in the great classic of road, Michael Rutter fell off the motorcycle on the last lap of the Suartwin race, in the place known as 31st Milestone, and suffered several fractures in the spine, between the L2 and L5 vertebrae, even being transferred by helicopter to the hospital. The 53 -year -old pilot was also diagnosed with an ankle fracture.
After nearly three months away from the competition, “The Blade”, as he is known in the middle, made his return to motorcycling last August, participating in the famous classic TT parade, on top of a Honda RVF750 RC45, integrated in a tribute to the 1980s and 1990s. Of his nine wins in 1998, he went back to a motorcycle for the first time in the Classic TT, where he led a Honda RC45 in the 1980s and 1990s parade. However, Rutter is not yet prepared to return to the competition, the Irish publication News Letter said in the past week.
His last victory was achieved at the Guide Circuit in 2019, although not the way Rutter would like to have increased his palm, as the result was decided on the basis of positions after just one lap, after two red flag interruptions that led to the definitive cancellation of the race. Still with ambition to win a tenth time at the Macao Motorcycle Prize last year, deeply affected by bad weather, Rutter was disappointed with the result, having qualified with the fourth best time, in a race in which the result of the qualification determined the final positions of the race.
Before the accident at Isle of Man TT, Rutter had told News Letter that he wanted to travel to Macau at the end of the year. "We'll try again because it's another race that I really like to go. It's completely unique, it's on the other side of the world, one time zone, so it's unique," he said without knowing what he expected.
Another big question
Rutter may not be the only "historical" of the Macao Motorcycle Prize to be left out of this year's edition, as many doubts around Peter Hickman, he also victims of an accident at the Event of the Island of Man. The British accident was caused by a mechanical failure: the setting of the exhaust departed, causing it to come into contact with the rear tire and caused a hole that led to the fall of the experienced. Pilot. The winner of four editions suffered severe injuries: collarbone and left -blavado fracture, three broken ribs, four fractured vertebrae and still facial injuries.
In a social media publication, Hickman said he has worked “very hard” behind the scenes and even recently performed a test on Cadwell Park. Three months after the accident, he returned this weekend to the popular British Superbike Championship in Donington Park. The 38 -year -old has not yet recovered his best and the requirement of a city circuit, such as Macao, is far superior to a conventional circuit. So in the coming weeks it will be known if Hickman will try to conquer his fifth victory on the streets of Macau in 2025.
The 72nd Macau Grand Prix will take place between November 13 and 16 this year. In addition to the 57th Macao Motorcycle Grand Prix, the program also features the Macao Grand Prix -FR's FR's World Cup, the FIA ​​GT GT Cup, the Macao Guide Race -Kumho Fia TCR World Tour of Macau, the Macao Formula 4 -FIA Formula 4 Cup (GT4) and Macao Roadsport Challenge.</description><pubDate>2025-09-08 02:43:40</pubDate></item><item><title>GP | Event literature is expected to grow in the coming years</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/01/gp-literatura-do-evento-devera-crescer-nos-proximos-anos/</link><description>The literature on the Macau Grand Prix could continue to grow in the coming years. The release of the Macao Grand Prix-Personal Collection of Victor H. de Lemos, 1954-1978, volume II (1967-1978), by Macaense Carlos Lemos, residing in Toronto since 1974, will take place in November, not in October as initially expected, while a new book on motorcycling provies is forming form.
This change in the date is not related to any delay, but to the date of visit to the territory by the author. Following the success of Volume I, the second part of a book that aims to honor the author's father, Victor Hugo Lemos - an enthusiast of the Macao Grand Prix who, in life, collected a vast number of photographs and everything that was related to the Automobile and Motorcycle Races in Macau since 1954, the date of the first edition of the event.
“This second volume completes a significant part of my father's Macao Grand Prix Collection, Victor H. de Lemos. It is a 356 pages hardcover book, ie 100 more than the first volume,” says Carlos Lemos. “Content and composition are very identical to those of the first volume. Includes more chinese newspaper clippings and documents the first fatal accident, the failed attempt to create the Extreme Orient Automobile Association Circuit, the first edition of the Guide Race, the Giant Race and the gradual evolution of the Macao Grand Prix, from amateur races to a world -class event, recognized by the International Federation. of the car (FIA). ”
Also according to the author, “The book contains about 471 photographs, as well as an introduction to the other collection of my father, World of Motor Racing, composed of over 1900 autographed pilots photographs, car owners and international renowned designers, such as Il Commendatore Enzo Ferrari, Sir Stirling Moss, Michael Schumacher, Roy Salvadori, Dan Gurney, Sir Jack Brabham, Juan Manuel Fangio, Helmut Marko, Colin Chapman, Sir Jackie Stewart, Janet Guthrie, Professor Sid Walkins, Tony and Mary Hulman (owners of the Indianapolis circuit), Frank Williams, Charlie Whiting, Louis Meyer, among others. ”
The first volume sales exceeded expectations and therefore 550 copies will be sold. The cover price will be 400 patacas, but will be marketed for 350 patacas during the promotion period. Part of the liquid product from the sale will revert to the institution IC2 Association - “I Can Too”, which supports people with autism or disability, as well as Apomac. The presentation should take place at the headquarters of the Macao Retirees, Reformed and Pensioners Association (Apomac), at date and time to reveal.
A book about motorcycles
The literature on the Macau Grand Prix could continue to grow in the coming years. Carlos Barreto, the author of the book Karting History in Macau, written in co -authorship with Pedro Dá Mesquita, is considering writing a book about motorcycling in the Macao Grand Prix, a discipline that sometimes ends up in the background in terms of literary coverage of the more than seventy years of the Guide Circuit event.
"The idea is to gather the testimonials of pilots from Macao who participated in the proof of motorcycles of the Macao Grand Prix," Carlos Barreto told HM. “We already have some material collected; there is still a lot of collection of collecting, compiling and writing the story, selecting the images, etc… We are in a hurry!”
The Macao Grand Prix today has only one motorcycle test on the program, the Macao de Motorcycle History, but it wasn't always like that. The event even had more than three motorcycle races, and even scooter races took place at the Citadino Circuito da MSA, always with a very strong presence of local pilots.</description><pubDate>2025-09-01 03:08:38</pubDate></item><item><title>GP | FIA makes known 10 teams from the FR World Cup</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/12/gp-fia-da-a-conhecer-10-equipas-da-taca-do-mundo-fr/</link><description>On Wednesday night, the International Automobile Federation (FIA), in partnership with the Macao Grand Prix Organizing Committee, published the official list of teams registered for this year's Macao Grand Prix-FR DA Mundo Cup.
Although the names of regional formula (FR) pilots have not been disclosed who will visit Macao in November, according to the official statement of the organization, based in Paris, this “carefully selected platoon of ten truly international teams will bring together the best regional talents in the world to compete for this unique proof in the iconic guide circuit”.
This year's edition welcomes two new heavyweight teams at the event: Italian Trident Motorsport, which arrives in Macau after a 2025 season in which she won the FIA ​​Formula 3 Championship, with Brazilian Rafael Câmara, and the dunderving van Amersfoort Racing (VAR), a team that has known the circuit of the guide since 1998 and that, in 2018, has caught a huge fright with the aparado accident by Sophia Flörsch.
Return to defend the coveted title in Macau will be the R-ACE GP, a European training that won in 2024 with Ugo Ugochukwu, a pilot who will not be present this year to try to revalidate the title. The French team remains largely, leading Freca's current classification and ending second in the Middle East Formula Regional Championship earlier this year.
Return of SJM Theodore
Also back are some of the strongest candidates of the Macao Grand Prix last year and the Panorama FR in general, including a well -known name of the event: SJM Theodore Prema Racing. The Italian team Prema, currently in second place in the Freca 2025 Championship, is one of the most successful formations of Base Motorized Sports and returns to partner with Teddy Yip Jr. at the MGI event.
Return are also Pinnacle Motorsport, Irish flag team; Australian Evans GP, who reached a fourth place in the last edition; Japanese Tom’s Racing, one of the most prestigious of Japanese motorsport; the German PHM Racing; and the always competitive French structures SaintLoc Racing and Art Grand Prix.
On the other hand, the Dutch MP Motorsport, Australian Kiwi Motorsport and the Japanese TGM Grand Prix came out of the scene. No team from China has been selected, but unlike last year, none tried to sign up for the race.
The official list of registrants should only be known in mid -October, as is the tradition of the Grand Prix.
The second edition of the FR da FIA Cup will be held during Macao Grand Prix Week, from November 13 to 16, and will also feature for the first time with the F4 F4 World Cup, making the event one of the most prestigious world categories of monologues.</description><pubDate>2025-09-12 00:22:52</pubDate></item><item><title>Charles Leong Conquest title Lamborghini Super Trofeo</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/09/charles-leong-conquista-titulo-lamborghini-super-trofeo/</link><description>Macao pilot Charles Leong Hon Chio was won of the Pro Lamborghini Super Trofeo Asia class last weekend at the Sepang International Circuit in Malaysia. This represents the first title of the rider of the rider in competitions of Grand Tourism (GT) and the first title of a championship achieved in the service of SJM Theodore Racing.
Despite being sick and with two races for competing in the calendar of the competition organized by the prestigious Italian car brand, Charles Leong and the young Irish Alex Denning were always extremely fast on the Malaysian track. They won the first weekend race, thus reaching the sixth triumph of the season, and finished second in the second race. This second place raised to 10 the number of podiums obtained in 10 races, extending the impressive team series, which never ended below second place.
With two races still playing in the World Lamborghini Super Trofeo World Finals in Misano, Italy, in November, SJM Theodore Racing could focus on maintaining this impressive podium sequence, with the main objective of the season achieved. Charles Leong and Alex Denning are tied at the top of the pilot standings and are expected to complete the season side by side, sharing the same Lamborghini Huracán Super Trofeo EVO2.
Always adding
For Charles Leong, this result is the result of “incredible team work. We won the championship thanks to a great collective effort, without great mistakes and with total consistency. For the race, I expected more group, but it was hard to fight my opponents with new tires. In the end, followed my pace and managed the tires to deliver the best car to Alex.
After finishing in second place in the classification of this same monomoccotes, the Macao pilot adds this title to those who won at an early age in the Renault Formula Asian Championship and the China Formula 4 Championship, in addition to the two remarkable victories in the Macao Formula 4 Macao Grand Prix.
Obviously pleased with the results obtained by his pupils, Teddy Yip Jr., owner of SJM Theodore Racing, commented: “I want to congratulate the whole team for this done, the result of a collective effort over the season and previous years. Pilots responded exemplary to pressure. Thanks to Charles, even sick, and Alex, who held another fast and consistent stint, guaranteeing the tenth, the tenth ‘Top-2’ in ten races. ”
Theodore Racing and SJM have been supporting Charles Leong since 2021, when they won their second triumph in Formula 4 on the guide circuit. In 2023, it ended very close to the Arvid Lindblad teammate in the Macao Grand Prix Race 4, completing a triumphant 1-2 from SJM Theodore Prema Racing. Absent from last year's edition due to commitments at Lamborghini Super Trofeo Asia in Spain, Charles Leong has not announced whether he will participate in this year's Macao Grand Prix edition.</description><pubDate>2025-09-09 00:01:15</pubDate></item><item><title>GP | Invitations for TCR Asia pilots who participate in Korea and Zhuzhou</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/27/gp-convites-para-pilotos-tcr-asia-que-participem-na-coreia-e-zhuzhou/</link><description>The 72nd Macao Grand Prix Race will again be the stage of the final test of Kumho Fia TCR World Tour, the largest tourist cars competition worldwide under the seal of the International Automobile Federation (FIA). The test will be equally open to the participation of competitors from other supplies
 
Being the last stage of the TCR worldwide competition season, the Macao race will bring together the fastest tour pilots in the world, also crowning the absolute champion of the TCR World Tour. The unique format of the competition promoted by WSC Group will allow local and regional riders of TCR to face international stars, creating an unforgettable show on the streets of the territory.
Prior to the final in Macao, the resurrected TCR Asia Series will share the track with the TCR World Tour from October 17-19, at the Inje, South Korea circuit, and from October 31 to November 2 at the Zhuzhou International Circuit in China. Participation in this race will be mandatory for riders who wish to obtain an invitation to the Guide Circuit event, also providing an opportunity for Macao riders, who did not qualify in other competitions, ensure a place at the big holiday party.
"In 2025, Wildcard registrations will be available to competitors who participated in TCR Asia events. To be eligible to sign up for Macao, competitors will be able to participate in the next races in South Korea and China, where TCR Asia will also share the grid with TCR World Tour," wrote TCR Asia Series on social networks, stressing that: “It's a unique opportunity for life: measuring forces with the best in the world in one of the most legendary strokes of motorized sport.”
On the subject, WSC Group President Marcello Lotti, the father of the TCR concept, added: “We are proud that TCR Asia added two events in conjunction with Kumho Fia TCR World Tour. WSC is pleased to confirm that we will assign 'Wildcards' to competitors who want to join us in the final of the season in Macau.”
TCR Asia Series has been competing with Chinese Sailun tires, but in this race the pilots will have to adapt to Kumho compounds, required in the FIA ​​-sanctioned competition. Sean Chang Chien Shang, Taiwan's pilot, leads the four -point lead ranking about Chinese Liu Zhi Chen, both at the Audi RS 3 LMS steering wheel.
GUARANTEED QUALITY
TCR Asia Series will not be the only competition to compose the FIA ​​TCR World Tour subscribers list at the MSA, as the 2025 season of TCR Australia will end in style when joining the Macao's 72nd guide race grid, which will take place from 13 to 16 November. TCR Australia's first international participation was possible thanks to the Global Championship rights holder, the WSC Group, which will ensure the full coverage of transportation costs to Australian teams traveling to Macao.
TCR Australia announced in June that it will focus on the proprietary of the competition at the event “The Bend 500”, from 12 to 14 September, in conjunction with the Australian round of Kumho Fia TCR World Tour, a competition with more than a dozen-time competitors. The Australian competition, which once had starting grids with about two dozen cars, will no longer run this year, beyond this and that scheduled for the Macao Grand Prix.
Also with evidence for playing in Australia, South Korea, China and Macau, the title champion of Kumho Fia World Tour, Yann Ehrlacher of Lynk &amp; Co, leads the 250 points, followed by Esteban Guerrieri, the wheel of a Honda, with 223, while Santiago Urrutia, also to the command of a Lynk &amp; Co, occupies a Lynk &amp; Co. Third position with 215 points.</description><pubDate>2025-08-27 01:54:02</pubDate></item><item><title>Philippines | Carlos Barreto takes the experience of Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/20/filipinas-carlos-barreto-leva-a-experiencia-de-macau/</link><description>Carlos Barreto, former racing director of the Macao de Motorcycle Grand Prix, is still active in the motorized sports of the Asian continent, more precisely in the Philippines, where he has been putting into practice the experience of more than three decades in the service of Macau Automobile and Motorcycle
 
“I was invited in 2024 to help develop National Track Motorcycle Championships-Underbone, Scooters and Superbikes-organized by Morac and Fetap,” Macau's former Macau-China General Association (AAMC) told HM. “The experience gained over three dozen years helps. I have done several motorcycle and karting championships on temporary circuits, mud and nape, then in the coloane karting, trials with local riders (motorcycles and karts) and international (karts). several motorcycle championships. ”
With a strong connection to the Macao Grand Prix, Carlos Barreto was a test director in the Karting and Motorcycle Championships between 1991 and 1996, and later, between 2004 and 2008. He was also president of the College of Sports Commissioners between 2009 and 2010. This vast experience allows him today to face this new reality in a different country, but always showed great passion for motorized sports, ease of “some aspects. that deserved more attention to the level of the tests. ” Among them, it highlights “sports regulations, the application of the rules, the dissemination of official documentation, some infrastructure equipment, as well as the structure and functional organization of the team that generates these championships, from the secretariat to track commissioners and proof direction”.
This collaboration began in November last year and, by 2024, already extended to three rounds of the championships. The contribution of Portuguese, born in Mozambique, has been significant: “The various suggestions I presented to each of the two circuits I know, the Clark International Speedway and the Racing Circuit Batangas, some have already been implemented and the rest will be resolved by the end of the year.
The competition itself is also growing: “The pandemia, in a way, delayed the development of these championships, but the number of pilots has been increasing, there are teams with financial capacity and good equipment. Clark tests sometimes come together to gather close to 80 pilots, while Batangas have about 60. The prospects are encouraging.”
Contribution to Karting
The Philippines is a country with a long tradition in Karting, dating back to the 1960s and the enthusiasm generated by Arsenio “Dodjie” Laurel, a pilot who lost his life on the Guide Circuit in 1967. The presence of Philippine Teams and Pilots in the Asian continent is common and, internally, the discipline has always followed what has been done worldwide.
“At Karting level, national tests have a local and functional structure - for years it was Akoc,” recalls Carlos Barreto, adding: “My collaboration has been a sports commissioner at two international events. I did one in 2024 and another recently, the Fifth Rok Cup Asia Philippines, organized by Kilton Motors Corporation (KMC) and performed in Clark. ”
Also there, the former director of the Macao International Kart Prize (2004-2016), the 46th SKF World Championship of CIK-Sfi (2009) and the 49th Cik-Cia World Championship (2012), had the task of “auscultation of people and answering the questions that put me, as well as having suggestions for improvement”.
As for the future, Carlos Barreto believes that “the seed is launched, and now it remains to be expected to grow and that the results will become visible in the medium term.”
Macao a step ahead
For the author of the book “History of Karting in Macao”, written in co -authorship with Pedro Dá Mesquita, the MSar remains a step forward with the sports organization of this nature. “Macau has a clear advantage, but it must be borne in mind that events in Macao have the precious support of government entities, while in the Philippines it is an organization without these supports,” says Carlos Barreto.
Still, the evidence in the Philippines, a country with a vast history in the motorized Southeast Asia sport, are nothing to do with what is done in the territory in terms of competitiveness. "At the event level, scooter races are often very excited and competitive, with six to eight riders fighting every lap in the first place, numerous overtaking and suspense until cutting the goal. In superbike events, they compete for ducatis and enclosures and there is always a spectacle.</description><pubDate>2025-08-20 00:55:21</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
