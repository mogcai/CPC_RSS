The Cape Verde Internal Affairs Minister told Lusa that the government will give Macau Legend a "last opportunity", which promised "an alternative" for the beach-casino hotel on the beach.
"The entrepreneur has had several opportunities and has this last opportunity. He says he will have an alternative and the government is awaiting the presentation of this alternative, while the reversal process takes place" of the project, said Paulo Rocha in an interview with Lusa.
In November, the Cape Verde authorities began a reversal process of the Hotel Casino and other unfinished works of Macau Legend, at Santa Maria Island and Gamboa Sea Marítimo, in Praia City.
Paulo Rocha said that the Cape Verdean executive gave the company founded by David Chow Kam Fai 60 days to present a new proposal to conclude the project, but admitted not to know when this period "started to count".
"If it does not present, within the period that was given, the reversal process will be concluded and then the government will look for others, likely, any investors," said the minister, during a visit to Macao.
Stop everything
Currently, there are only guards at the venue, an area of ​​about 160,000 square meters, which includes the partially sparkled Santa Maria islet and, a paved bridge of a few meters that connects it to a building of about eight floors, empty and sealed with tails.
"The works have been stopped for a long time, have been halfway through there is no movement in that construction shipyard and the government intends to see it resolved. In one way or another," said Rocha.
The executive said in November that he gave Macao Legend "all opportunities to resume works or to negotiate the sale of actions or the assignment of his contractual position to a potential interested in continuing the project" but no alternatives were presented. "The project remains important, remains strategic for the city of Praia, for Cape Verde, and the government is interested in finding a solution," said the minister.
In 2015, David Chow signed an agreement for an investment of 250 million euros. After revisions, about six years ago, the conclusion of the first phase was scheduled for 2021. At the end of 2023, Macau Legend President Li Chu Kwan said the group intended to close the projects in Cape Verde and Cambodia by 2025.

On the other hand, Macao Legend admitted to "significant doubts about the group's ability to continue in activity" due to total dollar $ 2.51 billion debts.</description><pubDate>2025-07-07 05:20:10</pubDate></item><item><title>Advertising | Government wants to change law and legislate “influencers”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/07/publicidade-governo-quer-mudar-lei-e-legislar-influencers/</link><description>Macau authorities proposed for the first time regulating the activity of digital influencers, including 'live marketing', which involves real -time interaction with the public, changing a law of time from Portuguese administration
 
About 36 years after the entry into force of the Advertising Acting Law, the government is preparing to update the legislation, which will regulate the activities of digital influencers and live marketing, in which content creators interact or sell first-time products, with real-time interaction with the public.
Plated last Friday, the 30-day public consultation, which will take place until August 2, on the amendments to the law. During this period, the government will organize five consultation sessions, where legal concepts and definitions will be discussed and clarified the terms on inspection regimes and administrative sanctions.
"It is suggested to clarify that participants in online promotion activities and 'live marketing', such as advertisers, advertising agencies, platform owners and presenters, are subject to the advertising activity law and must fulfill their provisions when their acts are advertising," said the director of Economics and Technological Development Services (DSEDT) at a press conference.
The current law of advertising activity has been in force since 1989, Yau Yun Wah indicated that, considering the changes in the economic activity of the various sectors and technological evolution, "the contents, forms of dissemination and means used in current advertising are significantly different from those of the past."
According to the proposal, influencers should first use the products they support, in order to ensure compliance with the “veracity” requirement of the law. They may also “have to provide proofs of their support under a 'obligation of cooperation',” said Yau Yun Wah.
Own characteristics
"We hope that in the future, 'advertising' [influencers] will be clearly identified in the announcements and that, in case of complaints or false allegations, legal measures may be taken," he added.
The official also clarified that if companies hire influencers from outside Macao to promote products, they must obtain a work permit for them.
The DSEDT director also claimed to expect the future law to allow the increase in advertising on the streets of Macau. "Through the prior authorization regime we hope that the advertising sector may have more relief and develop," said Yau Yun Wah, adding last year's advertising requests were more than 4,000.
Lack of scope
Deputy Ron Lam argued that changes to the advertising activity law, currently in public consultation, are not comprehensive enough, unable to cover some areas.
According to the citizen newspaper, Ron Lam pointed out that despite the government's proposal to change the law to include the simplification of procedures and bring new definitions to advertising online, there are no definitions or regulations on new types of advertising, such as advertising projected by lighting or real estate. The deputy says he does not understand why the executive's proposal does not include, in real estate advertising, the advertising that is made to the vehicle parking lot.
The legislator understands that there must be a transitional period and greater dissemination of information, given that the changes in the advertising regime cover several professional areas.

Wong believes this would be a good way to promote Coloane's economy
 
Wong Kit Cheng defends the transformation of the facilities of the old Coloane prison into a "base" to promote patriotism among the local population. The idea was released through a written interpellation of the deputy linked to the Women's Association.
"Coloane's arrest is a witness to the history of correctional services, but it is also a land with an area of ​​18,000 square meters. It is a large building, which is not very common in Coloane, an area where there is lack of land, but also deserves to be revitalized," he began by indicating the deputy. "In fact, the revitalization of military, police or arrest facilities is common in other zones. For example, the old site of the Liugongdao Maritime Office and the Torpedo Factory in the city of Wehai, in Shandong Province, were turned into a broad national security exhibition center," said the deputy. Wong Kit Cheng also referred to the example of Hong Kong, where Victoria prison was transformed into a space with galleries and exposure zones open to the public.
Promote the economy
From the perspective of the deputy, the preservation of the historical site is still a way of promoting Coloane's economy: “In the future, if Colaane's arrest can be reused, the historical, cultural and correctional importance of the building can be used in the service of national security education, with the creation of immersive experiences, special games and commercial complexes,” he suggested. Wong also pointed out that reuse can “bring a new vitality to the community” by Coloane and promote the “development of cultural tourism and the protection of historical heritage”.
"Since the land of Coloane's prison belongs to the government, what are the plans for the use of space and what plans will be followed to meet residents' expectations, while betting on Coloane's long -term development," he asked. “When will there be conditions to announce the land development plan?” He added.
Assuming that the site should be transformed into a base of patriotism, and a “national security defense line”, Wong also questions the executive if the examples of various interior locations in the exposed materials level and will create permanent exhibitions on the subject.
In addition to these aspects, Wong asks the government to present a calendar for the transformation of the place to the base that it considers fundamental to the MSAR.</description><pubDate>2025-07-07 05:08:48</pubDate></item><item><title>AL | Deputies want to ban signs and implement suspensions</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/07/al-deputados-querem-proibir-placas-e-implementar-suspensoes/</link><description>The changes proposed by a group of legislators led by Kou Hoi in include the loss of office to any deputy sentenced to at least 30 days in prison inside or outside the Mand
 
In a little over a month of the Legislative Assembly vacation, and two months from legislative elections, a group of deputies wants to change the rules of hemiciclo to ban the display of signs in meetings, regulate the clothing of deputies, change the rules of mandate losses, and create a suspension system for those who reveal the content of what is discussed in the commissions.
The amendments to review the statute of the deputies and the Legislative Assembly Regiment came from a group of nine deputies led by the President of the Legislative Assembly, Kou Hoi In, and the documents do not allow to identify the rest.
At the proposal of loss of mandate, it is intended to apply to deputies convicted of a crime with a 30 -day arrest. For the loss of the mandate, the crimes contain on or outside the MSAR, and Parliament wants to be able to make the decision based on any document that it considers relevant, even if it is not official. The new statute provides for the police call to remove the deputy to whom the mandate was suspended, in the case of not leaving the plenary room.
Regarding the suspension of the mandate of deputies, Kou wants the visited to become deprived of the monthly remuneration, contrary to what is currently happening. In addition, the suspension can be applied if there is “criminal proceedings” or “serious violation of the duties of deputies”. The president of AL will also be able to suspend any deputy suspected of revealing the content of the meetings at the closed door.
Controlled clothes
The group of deputies also aims to prohibit at meetings the use of "clothing" or "materials with offensive content or political provocation." Deputies who proposed the amendments consider that the prohibition “in no way interferes with the rights of deputies” because “they can express any opinions”, according to the Rules.
The duties of the deputies will also be changed to consecrate the "Macau governed by patriots" policy, but also to oblige deputies to participate in meetings with voting and to be provided for conflicts of interests that prevent deputies from participating in voting in which their impartiality may be concerned.
Among the various changes, deputies also want to self-impeders to submit proposals for public debates on issues considered in the government area.</description><pubDate>2025-07-07 05:02:43</pubDate></item><item><title>BRICS | Seventh Cimeira ends today with focus on Trump's fares</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/07/brics-setima-cimeira-termina-hoje-com-foco-nas-tarifas-de-trump/</link><description>Since Saturday, leaders of the countries that are part of the BRICS Group have been gathered in Rio de Janeiro for another summit designed to think about the reform of institutions and inclusion of more emerging economies, as well as the fight against Trump's rates. Highlight for the absences of Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin
 
Since Saturday, Rio de Janeiro hosts the BRICS Group leaders, which ends today. The first day was based on the dialogue around the ambition of emerging economies to reform international institutions and the defense of multilateralism.
"I think the main message is this: at the time of so many international crises, conflicts, we are experiencing a succession of conflicts that only increase from year to year, having a set of countries reaffirming the power of diplomacy, cooperation, the need to act jointly, to solve the problems of the population and not to generate more destruction, such as conflicts, it is an opportunity that we always have to take advantage of," Lyrio, guide of discussions and agreements of heads of state at the conference, designated by the Brazilian presidency of the BRICS.
In all, about 30 countries and nine international organizations have been present, with the Brazilian head of state, Lula da Silva leading the meeting, which has Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, Angola President and African Union, the Secretary-General of United Nations, António Guterres, among others.
The main absences are Russian and Chinese heads of state, two BRICS founding countries. Vladimir Putin, the target of a warrant of detention issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC), on suspicion of illegal deportation of Ukrainian children to Russia, will only participate in video conferencing.
Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov will be the representatives of the two founding countries of the group, which represents more than 40 percent of the global population and more than 35 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) worldwide.
From China with Love
According to Chinese state agency Xinhua, Chinese prime minister promised to “expand cooperation with Brazil” in the areas of “digital and aerospace economy”. Li Qiang spoke on Saturday, as part of a meeting with Lula da Silva, noting that the country intends to “work with Brazil to take advantage of each other and expand cooperation in areas such as digital economy, green economy, scientific and technological and aerospace innovation”.
Xinhua quotes words from Li Qiang, who referred to the fact that “China is ready to work with Brazil to continue efforts to enrich the dimensions of bilateral relations and achieve more concrete results in cooperation in order to provide more benefits to both peoples”.
One of the points out of this meeting was the realization in 2026 of the year of China-Brazil culture, which provides for an intensification in cooperation in areas such as “education, youth and health”, in order to facilitate “more exchanges between peoples and strengthen public support to China-Brazil's friendship and cooperation”.
“China is willing to work with Brazil to further consolidate and deepen bilateral cooperation in trade, finance and infrastructure development within the high quality cooperation of Belt And Road [track and route]”, the Chinese prime minister, who did not forget the great flag of this BRICS Summit: multilateralism.
Thus, I read Qiang considered “the two countries as fierce defenders of multilateralism and free trade”, saying that “China is willing to improve communication and coordination with Brazil in multilateral structures such as the United Nations, BRICS and G20, work in union with developing countries to promote an equal and ordered multipolar world and universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization, and provide more certainty and stability to the world. ”
On the other hand, Lula da Silva said that "Brazil is willing to deepen communication and multilateral coordination with China, to oppose unilateralism and defend multilateralism and free trade in order to promote peace and world development." After the meeting between the two leaders, “cooperation documents in areas such as tax and financial matters, artificial intelligence, alignment of development strategies and aerospace” were signed.

Cuba's debut
Cuba President Miguel Díaz-Canel also participates in the 17th BRICS Summit, being the first time Cuba has associated with this geopolitical and economic cooperation group.
Under the motto “reinforcing cooperation in the global south for more inclusive and sustainable governance”, the BRICS Summit's agenda comprises two central axes: the consolidation of cooperation between the global southern countries and the promotion of reforms in international governance mechanisms.
Created in 2009 throughout Brazil, Russia, India and China, BRICS admitted South Africa two years later and, since last year, integrates six new effective members: Egypt, United Arab Emirates, Ethiopia, Iran, Indonesia and Saudi Arabia. Brazil invited to this summit leaders from various Latin American countries, including Mexico, Colombia, Uruguay and Chile.
The statute of associate, which takes Cuba to Rio de Janeiro, was approved in October 2024 during the summit of the group held in the Russian city of Kazan, which was made official in 2025, recalled the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Caribbean country.
In addition to geopolitical issues, BRICS have sought in Rio de Janeiro in the organization's economic weight, namely in the financial domain, in which they have been looking for a dollar for years for trade in the group.
The host president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, president of Brazil, stressed last Friday the importance of a mechanism with these characteristics, recognizing, however, that the current international political context is "complicated".
What is on the agenda
On the first day, the heads of state and government of the BRICS participated in two plenary sessions, particularly on "peace and safety and reform of global governance" and the second relative to the strengthening of multilateralism, economic and financial affairs and artificial intelligence. "
In the latter, the revision of the ACCIORARY participation in the World Bank, the realignment of IMF shares [International Monetary Fund] and the increase in the representation of developing countries in leadership positions in international financial institutions and the importance of reforming the UN Security Council.
In addition, as it has been happening during the BRICS ministerial meetings over the past few months, an increase in unilateral unilateral unilateral protectionist measures should be made in reference to the measures announced by the President of the United States, Donald Trump; as well as an appeal to reinforce the use of local currencies in trade between the bloc countries. Today the plenary session will be on “Environment, COP30 and Global Health”.
The term BRIC was created by a Goldman Sachs analyst to refer to emerging economies who began to stand out worldwide beyond the US, with the BRICS first gathered at the level of heads in 2009. This is the first meeting that brings together the new group configuration with 11 member countries.
Brazil has mobilized about 20,000 military personnel, as well as fighters with missiles, anti-drug systems and elite shooters to ensure the safety of the event.

Also noteworthy is for the holding of physical and visual theater workshops in connection with the community, in a Somos initiative! - Portuguese Language Communication Association
 
September marks the arrival of an important Portuguese group linked to the circus arts and has been developing community connection projects in Lisbon for many years, receiving students and all people interested in their cultural offer.
This group is the Chapitô Company, which thanks to Somos's initiative! - ACLP (Portuguese Language Communication Association), brings Macau, between September 20 and 23, the play “Júlio César” and the holding of physical and visual theater workshops, open to participants with or without experience in theater.
The play “Júlio César” takes the stage of the Black Box I of the Cultural Center of Macau, on September 20, at 20h. This is the 39th collective creation of the company, and Chapitô was inspired, according to a note from Somos! - ACLP, "in life and historical events around Julius Caesar, exploring comedy as a language to reinvent history."
Julius Caesar was a Roman general and a state man. Member of the first triumvirate, led the Roman armies in conquering Gaul before defeating his political rival Pompey in the context of civil war. Self-proceedings later, he is a perpetual dictator of Rome, a position he did not occupy for a long time, murdered by a group of senators who considered him a threat to the Republic.
“Inspired by the popular imagination of the representations of Rome and the remarkable figure that it was Julius Caesar, exploring historical inconsistencies and taking freedoms in the treatment of documented facts - with the disregard that already characterizes the company of Chapitô - this is the deconsion of another historical monster, Julius Caesar,” says Somos! - ACLP on the show.
“If he was a tyrant who deserved to die or a hero brutally murdered by conspirators, come the devil and choose. Here there are no heroes or villains, there are circumstances and cunning people who do for life. There are also less cunning people who do what they send them. And virtuous people who do what has to be done.
Physical theater
In Chapitô, a project led by Maria Teresa Ricou, they are “faithful to the physical theater style”, where “actors use the body, movement and gesture to create characters and transmit emotions universally, allowing an accessible experience to different audiences”.
In Macao, and at the end of “Júlio César”, Chapitô Company will provide conversation and debate sessions, “promoting direct cultural exchange between artists and the audience thus leading to an exchange of ideas and reflections on the present theatrical experience”.
The piece will be presented in Portuguese and subtitled in Chinese with approximately 90 minutes without break. Tickets have a value of 200 MOP and can already be purchased through Macauticket.
To learn
On September 21, 22 and 23, the Chapitô team presents, at Casa Garden, the physical and visual theater workshops, which aim to “explore improvisation techniques, character creation and nonverbal communication, using the body as a central tool for artistic and narrative expression”.
There are in these sessions a division into three themes - body, space and improvisation; Gestural characters and archetypes; and dramatic game and creative improvisation, being the sessions led by trainers Jorge Cruz, Pedro Diogo and Susana Nunes. The workshops are taught in English with translation to Chinese and with a maximum capacity of 20 participants.
Founded in 1996, the Chapitô Company is recognized for its multidisciplinary work, based on physical theater and communication through gesture and image.
Still according to Somos! -ACLP, the performance of the show “Júlio César” and the physical and visual theater workshops, in Macao, “participants have the opportunity to explore the possibilities of interaction and fusion between different forms of artistic expression”, revealing to the public of Macau “the methodologies and the artistic vision of the Chapitô Company”. Thus, the association understands, “this experience can inspire new approaches and ideas of cultural exchange”.</description><pubDate>2025-07-07 05:34:37</pubDate></item><item><title>Japan ready for all scenarios on tariffs</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/07/japao-pronto-para-todos-os-cenarios-em-materia-de-tarifas/</link><description>Japanese Prime Minister Shigero Ishiba said on Sunday that the country is ready to “stay firm” and is prepared for all possible tariff scenarios that may result from commercial negotiations with the United States.

A mode of representation that sought communication between the author's spirit and that of the invited observer to discern the purpose of creation through the exposure of the process.
A demanding discipline, recognized until centuries later by distinguished theoreticals such as Dong Qichang (1555-1635), which put the barrier from which this painting could be exercised very high: no less than in Wang Wei (701-61) mode, the recognized founder of literate painting: 'Only after someone is like Wang Wei can use the Wang Qia Pomo way'.
Examples from the brush of this creator are today hardly observable and the termination of it preserved, there is almost only the seductive echo of a name that refers the listener to the expression of the substance of the Spirit. However, there is another name that in the stories of painting is often associated with him, that of Gu Kuang (727-821), of whom the paintings today are also rare but from whom they have been stored poems that indicate an imponderable presence.
In a palace poem, it is noted the availability to feel the abundant but subtle torrent of beauty captured by the senses, like the one in the wind or in a sound: «In a tower of jade, halfway to the sky, a song blown to the flute begins,/ The wind delivers in the palace the harmonious sound of the Palreo and the laughter of the girls who dwell. Drinking in the clepsidra,/ the waters, redrillants as crystals, would say a curtain unfolded over the Rio do Autumn. » But the poet and painter, disillusioned with the intrigues that embarrassed his duties at the service of the palace, removes the public service and will use the name well daoist buweng, the "old reclusive".
Gu Kuang had obtained the Jinshi degree, which allowed him to be an imperial employee in 757, in the unstable time of Emperor Tang Suzong, whose reign (756-62) would be marked by the concern to calm the revolt of An Lushan who had spread like a forest fire. Revolt that had forced his father to abdicate, Emperor Xuanzong and the consequent condemnation of the death of his favorite concubine, a fact reported in Ba Juyi's plangent poem (722-846), corner of perpetual remorse.
Born in Yunyang (current Danyang, Jiangsu) after a life saddened by the death of a son, he moves with his family in 792 to the mountainous chain of Maoshan, south of Jurong, where he will receive the grace of a new son at the age of seventy. When he goes there, he writes a purpose: «Hidden in Maoshan; To make basic gold metals,/ to make the body light as a pity.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>ANA CRISTINA ALVES</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/autor/ana-cristina-alves/</link><description>Ana Cristina Alves - Assistant researcher and coordinator of the Educational Service of the Macao Scientific and Culture Center
They have been running ink rivers on the founding of Macao, as well as the foundation of Lisbon. The latter the academics consider it more prudent, after properly analyzed the etymologies, to be due to Phoenicians or Tartassi (Rocha, 2007), but that the legend is poetically reminiscent of Ulysses, from Luís Vaz Camões to Fernando Pessoa.  Thus it reads at the beginning of the eighth corner of Os Lusíadas, which the beginnings of Portugal find their mythical roots in Luso, son and companion of Bacchus, and those of Lisbon in Ulysses (Camões, 1997, VIII.5):
Ulisses is the one who makes the Santa Casa
To the goddess who gives her Facunda language;
That if there in Asia Trojan insigne abrasa,
Here in Europe Lisbon Imparty Funda.
Nothing more about the illustrious Lusitanians descended from gods, as well as their geographical spaces were founded by Greek heroes of unparalleled value such as Ulysses, whose ingenuity warrior and marear art exceeded. Hence, some centuries became Fernando Pessoa, in the second epic poem that the Portuguese value most, the message refer to Ulysses pointing to their mythological dimension and the unavoidable reality that it sustains, since “myth is nothing that is everything” (Pessoa, 1986, 24):
 Thus the legend
To come into reality
And fertilizing it takes place.
Below, life, half
Nothing, dies.
Myths and legends offer reality often the best it has, in its quality of projection reveal ideas and ideals, providing an important source where the unconscious manifests itself, but also the collective conscious of a people. Ulysses Warrior and Navigator is the patriarch found to the measure to found the capital of a country of indomitable warriors who faced powerful empires, such as Muslim, the Roman, and later the Spanish and who had to discover the sea path to India, beyond the Extrema Asia, without ever losing its Cavalheresque facet.
This would be masterfully praised in the corner VI of Os Lusíadas in the episode of the twelve of England, among which figured Magriço. They would know how to defend the honor of their ladies to the sword, revealing a huge bravery, narrated by Veloso (Camões, 1997, VI. 48):
This one, who helps him I didn't want to
 For not causing intestinal discord,
 Tells you: when the law intended
 From the kingdom there from the Iberian lands,
 In Lusitanians I saw so much boldness,
 Both prime and such divine parts,
 That they alone could, if not error,
 Support your part to fire and iron.
This chivalry had to be a constant in the Portuguese imagination, not just with ladies, but with all those who saw each other in trouble. This happened in England, so it would succeed in southern China, when the Portuguese helped the Chinese to clean the pirate seas and in reward were allowed a quiet existence in Macao.
In fact, even if only a myth or a legend, it would only have its reason for being, because it reveals a certain collective image that the Portuguese have of themselves and that greatly contributes, in terms of existential value, to guide the conduct of the population: they are where they are accurate, in helping the most unprotected, in one hand the heart, the heart. This is an image that once mitigated, it may be that "nothing that is everything."
Regarding the founding of Macao, the scholar, faces an interesting mix between myth and reality: first comes reality, then the legend comes, and the latter will have infinitely more weight, but be aware of the following information of unsuspected thinkers and historians.
Luís Gonzaga Gomes, in Macau - A Municipality with History (1997) in the chapter “Divergent Theses on the Origin of Macao”, argues that there are several theses on the foundation of Macao as a Chinese space governed by Portuguese from 1557, and this date does not exclude that the Portuguese had already walked through those stops since 1555, the height of Fernão Mendes Pinto, where the name of the name of the first time appears. Macao related to the Portuguese.
As for theses there are three most credible:
“1) Macao was donated to the Portuguese; 2) This donation was made in rewarding the services provided by Portuguese in the destruction of pirates; and 3) the occurrence took place in 1577” (GOMES, 1997, 26) later, after presenting several points of view, linked to remarkable liters, including Álvaro Semedo, as Chinese, argues that “Macau outside the Portuguese reason Exposed, what is to reward the valuable feat of the destruction of piracy in the seas of southern China ”(GOMES, 1997, 37). In this sense, it is mentioned by several authors, and as a misrepresented as expectable, the name of the fearsome chief of the pirates, which will have valid the famous imperial edict or plate, is called Tchang Si Lao, or Sam Chislao, or Charempum, Litauquiem, or Similao (Gomes, 1997, 37).
This finding does not exclude other more commercial readings from obtaining this platform, which was also commercial in China, and a price for the payment of the ground forum in Da Ming Shi (大明史 History of the Ming Dynasty) quoted by A.J. H. Chargignon, of 20,000 rights in Macau. (GOMES, 1997, 34).
The coexistence of both chronology versions of the history of Macao will be found. XVI-XVII centuries organized by historian Beatriz Basto da Silva (1992), who reassembles an important episode of annihilation of a certain and dangerous pirate Lam Chin at 1547, in a description of Chinese employee Lam Hei-Yuen, who shot the following way “and so the pirates who had acted comfortable for 20 years were won in one day. contrary they protect us against them, they did not do any harm to our people, but they even did the Chinese well ”(Yuen apud Silva, 1992, 33), being presented in the same chronology the year 1554 as the first verbal agreement by Leonel Sousa, which legalizes the situation of payment of commercial rights and“ Portuguese are allowed to be freely trade in the area that would become Macao ”. (SILVA, 1992, 39), dating from 1557 in this chronology the establishment of the first Portuguese in Macao, a date that agrees with the advanced by Luís Gonzaga Gomes, as well as in the suicide of the Chan-Si-Lau pirate and the defeat of the pirates of Rio das Pearls, as well as Leonel Sousa “obtain authorization to establish the previous settlement of the Portuguese in Macau (…) from Macau. ” (SILVA, 1992, 43).
In fact, there is the coexistence of the two most likely origins for the founding of Macau in the chronology of Beatriz Basto da Silva. It was asked: It would have been the verbal agreement and the subsequent settlement, with the payment of the floor of the ground, possible if the effective help of the Portuguese gentlemen and warriors had not been verified to the Chinese authorities, through concrete help to local traders who were constantly pressured by coans who then abounded in the seas of China and southern China?
The cleaning of maritime ground, provided by developed technology, at the best in the world, greatly contributed to helping if it had made it concrete and real, slowly deserving of a western people of the far east of Asia and only because it was really useful in combating pirates could make a legend, since from the beginning either readings was valid but partial. In order to obtain a correct and impartial reading of what has happened, it is believed that it is necessary to combine them, understanding how decisive it was in the good relationship of the two peoples to combat pirates, without them, there would not have been Macao, flushed by foreigners in Chinese territory.

In a statement about Dalai-Lama's succession plan, the Narendra Moder's Foreign Ministry of Government states that he will not take “any position” on issues of faith.
"The government of India does not take any position or pronouncement on issues related to beliefs and practices of faith and religion," said Ministry spokesman Randhir Jaiswal, in response to media questions about the recent announcement of the Tibetan spiritual leader.
The country "has always defended religious freedom to everyone in India and will continue to do so," he said. On Thursday, the Indian minister of minority affairs, Kiren Rijiju, told local media that the decision would be exclusively to the Buddhist leader.
"All those who follow Dalai-Lama believe that reincarnation must be decided according to the established conventions and Dalai-Lama's own wishes. No one else has the right to decide, except for him and the current conventions," said Rijiju.
China reiterated on Wednesday that Dalai-Lama's successor should be "approved by the central government."
"The reincarnation of great Buddhists, such as Dalai-Lama and Panchen Lama, should be determined by draw through the golden ballot box and later approved by the central government," said China's Ministry of Foreign Ministry spokesman Mao Ning.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>José Simões Morais</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/autor/jose-sm/</link><description>The northwest of Zhejiang Province we visited Huzhou, attracted by one of the treasures of Chinese painting, the brushes. After buying the map, we realize the green spots that this city is filled with gardens. From Tricycle we arrived at a two -star hotel, despite the offering of the four -star accommodation, with discounts, just for some more exchanges allow us to enjoy superior quality of comfort. With the bags already in the room, it is at the reception that we learn about the existence in the city of a brush museum.
Considered the capital of brushes, because according to a saying, the huzhou brushes, the role of Xuan de Xuanzhou rice (Anhui), the paint from China de Huizhou (also in Anhui) and the Duan Stone for the Zhaoqing (Guangdong) paint, are the four treasures of Chinese painting.
Right on the trip to the hotel I could see it is the small town because, from the bus terminal, in ten minutes we are in the center, traveling half the main avenue that longitudinally divides it. Now walking, we will have a channel with terrace on the banks. It looks like a good place to in the shadow, quietly refreshing from the noon. We are in the Hebin Garden. Still sitting and then wave us with a glass and a bottle. After an affirmative gesture, they bring a glass full of green tea leaves and hot water in a thermal container, which on the table is to serve.
Soon appearances appear that for a Reminbi they remove the dust in their shoes, giving them a small polydela. Glasses quickly tormented rest and an EHRU player experiences, with amplifier sounds, captivating us to enjoy a few songs. But his little introduction to the song of “Yue Liang Wo Di Chin” (the moon represents my heart) proves to be more annoying than cultural.
Studying a busy but narrow pedestrian street where, despite the surrounding buildings, they are unmistakable from the environment, a recent dragon door gives access to the part of the city where a long time is perpetuated. Another longmen, this old and made of wood, gives the smoke temple, which will be from the same period and where the floor is arranged. Abroad, a number of antique sellers spread the articles on the floor.
We went through clothing stores and between two of these stores, a cubicle with a counter where some people expect that from the coal grill on the ember to be ready for the skewers of different pieces of meat stuck in a long toothpick. We snack on Carneiro to deceive the stomach because they start to be hours of dinner. We are walking attentive to the restaurants, which in the distance are distinguished, as marked by red round lanterns.
Hotel Avenue
It is on Hongqi Lu Street, where most hotels are found, which due to the appearance we chose the restaurant, after going through many fast food, both Chinese and the two main foreign brands. At the entrance, a part of sales abroad with a lot of demand, we refer to being in a good place. Thoughts disguise the waiting time, when they tell us to be the pre-payment restaurant and there is no list to choose the dishes. Meats already cooked are mostly barbecue and are exposed in the sales sector, behind glass.
Five in the afternoon and already with the passwords bought for the meal, chosen by the dishes of the tables of customers there for dinner. We are served to tofu soaked in soy sauce and a halted hazeln ease with meat stuffing, floating in a soup. Cheap food to serve as dinner after the job.
Smoken in flavor, we are interrupted by a corcovered beggar of a certain age that seems to ask for money. Offering what we are eating, so all the food is emptied for the bowl and not even the sauce. Faced with such hunger, found later when we saw her in the stairs to eat, we still offer you money to another meal.
Mendicity is a recent phenomenon in China, although there have always been two types of people who walk through the streets and seem beggars. Those who vague live their fate, indifferent and whose people offer them food and those who in poorer places migrate to cities. Of course there are already beggars as well.
The sound of music comes out of stores and the foreign fast food restaurant uses a powerful column where a young maid dances to the sound of children for children, waiting for them to accompany her.
We tried to prove the specialties of the land and therefore, at the Huzhou Hotel restaurant, of two stars, tasted referenced dishes as local kitchen. We were served a fish flower, fish dish that, after baking in a bittersweet sauce, is twisted with his skin to serve as a flower-shaped chalice and thus presented. But it is at the four -star Hotel Zhebei that an exquisite kitchen gives us a tofu we miss.
The price is cheaper than the previous one. This restaurant had been recommended by two young women, who were waiting for their friends and whom a maid asks for help communicating with us, when we one day we climbed to the second floor of a cooked food restaurant at the table, the vulgar Hot-Pot. Realizing that they only serve vegetables, meat or seafood, to be cooked in the heated pan over a gas nozzle in the center of the table, we get up and prepare to leave.
Requestly ask us in English the reason we leave. Then comes the two young college students in Hangzhou, who lived at the family home. Explaining this is not the food that feels like us, we took the opportunity to ask for other regional food restaurants. Since apologizing to Huzhou for not having many restaurants, they present the best and cheap price the restaurant of the Zhebei Hotel.
After a harrowing and as it is early, as in China starts dinner at five in the afternoon, we returned to the avenue and then the hotel from where we saw another, also four stars, the International Huzhou. Continuing on the same ride, we found the Tian Yun silk store. Then a brush store, where there is for all sizes and prices, reaching porcelain or bamboo cable brushes, costing thousands of yuans.
Brushes Museum
Diving into Huzhou's past, entering one of the city's most picturesque streets. A Christian church dominates the street and around, stores occupy the part under the two -story houses. By the solidoes in the heads of some people, we realize that some of the business belong to Muslims. After refusing to be photographed, a tangerine salesman offers us a delicious fruit piece. Continuing, curiosity leads us to meet the stone bridge with three arches built in 1539, with some embedded ornamental stones.
Hence and to southwest, we go to the garden of the painter and calciple Zhao Mengfu (1254-1322) Painter Museum. This was native of Wuxing (today Huzhou), named after courtesy and pseudonyms Songxue, Oubo and Shuijinggong Daoren. He was a descendant prince of the Song Dynasty, but he served the Mongols Yuan Dynasty as an official at the Hanlin Academy.
As a painter, he specializes in the representation of horses and used recreating themes and styles of the old masters, with simple colors to make the landscapes. In addition to being a master of Tang Dynasty techniques, he was an excellent Caligraph, considered one of the main four in the history of Chinese calligraphy.
Already in the garden, the serenity with which the green of the vegetation is combined in the lake with the brown of the rest pavilions, or in the woods of the tea houses, makes us there a long time, recreating figures with the reflection in the waters of the ornamental stones. We have to leave the garden to visit the Brushes Museum which, despite being encompassed in the same room, has an autonomous entrance. Huzhou brushes are referenced as the best in the country and so you have to see how they are made.
In chronological terms, the brush was invented in the late 3rd century A.N.E. By Meng Tian, ​​a military commander of the Qin Dynasty. However, it is perceived by the painted vessels of different neolithic cultures, which must have existed for at least five thousand years. Therefore, Meng Tian will be linked, not to the invention, but to the improvement of brushes. Also the city of Huzhou is not the real place of production of the best brushes, but has won this title since in ancient times Shanlian, in the municipality of Wuxing, province of Zhejiang, was over his jurisdiction. The handwriting brushes made had their heyday during the Yuan Dynasty and are still considered among the best in all of China.
Four steps are required to manufacture the HU brush, and the coat of the rabbit, the fingernail and the goat hair is used. After the fat is removed with tire juice, the hair is cut into equal sizes and enter a solution to clean them. They are then united at the base with arabic gum and after drying, united with a tile that unites them to the bamboo.
With the brush made in its structure, the other phase of the process is passed. The hair is bumped to a porridge made of algae to put them together and with the wire wrapped a tip is created, the most important part of the brush. This wire that goes through the hair, on a lap gives the cone shape and also serves to remove the excess of the agglutinator papa.
With extreme patience and skill, the brushes are clean, rounded, creating a tip, with good elasticity. Then the brush, ready, passes to the hands of another employee, where in the bamboo cable are recorded the characters Tian Kuan Trade Mark, which replaced the old “double goat” brand.
The goat hair (HAO) brushes (HAO) are soft and serve to write small characters, rabbit hair are hard and those of the fingernail are between the two, with great elasticity for the handwriting of large characters. Sometimes a mixture of different hair is made, using those of other animals.
There are brushes of all kinds of sizes, serving some to paint and others to call. The best for Chinese handwriting are the rabbit and goat hair mix. HU brushes were widely used in the imperial court.
In the other part of the museum is the painter's room Zhao Mengfu with its utensils and some works, where the recorded stones are not lacking. Although the museum has a sales section, after leaving the museum and already on the street, a set of stores is dedicated to the sale of products for Chinese painting.
Leaving the brushes, we visited the market and crossing a wooden bridge in Zig-Zag, we traveled another old part of the city. Clothing extenders hide salespeople with bags full of tea leaves finished spoon that belong to the first harvest of the year, the best.

In a statement about Dalai-Lama's succession plan, the Narendra Moder's Foreign Ministry of Government states that he will not take “any position” on issues of faith.
"The government of India does not take any position or pronouncement on issues related to beliefs and practices of faith and religion," said Ministry spokesman Randhir Jaiswal, in response to media questions about the recent announcement of the Tibetan spiritual leader.
The country "has always defended religious freedom to everyone in India and will continue to do so," he said. On Thursday, the Indian minister of minority affairs, Kiren Rijiju, told local media that the decision would be exclusively to the Buddhist leader.
"All those who follow Dalai-Lama believe that reincarnation must be decided according to the established conventions and Dalai-Lama's own wishes. No one else has the right to decide, except for him and the current conventions," said Rijiju.
China reiterated on Wednesday that Dalai-Lama's successor should be "approved by the central government."
"The reincarnation of great Buddhists, such as Dalai-Lama and Panchen Lama, should be determined by draw through the golden ballot box and later approved by the central government," said China's Ministry of Foreign Ministry spokesman Mao Ning.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Cape Verde | Évora family, between Macau and the rest of the world</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/03/cabo-verde-familia-evora-entre-macau-e-o-resto-do-mundo/</link><description>Tomorrow are 50 years of Cape Verde's independence, the country from which the first levada of the Évora family came out in the 1940s, towards Macao, where he won roots. Nowadays, only one member of the family remains in the territory, the cardiologist Mário Évora
 
There were once a dozen Évoras in Macao, where they arrived in the 1940s, but only Mario Évora resists, with the family repeating the migrations that mark both Cape Verde and the Macanese.
"We have been between eight and ten Évoras in Macau," Sports Medicine expert Humberto Évora told Lusa from Lisbon, where he has lived since he renovated. The maternal grandparents of Humberto (the last of the family to be born in Cape Verde) and Mário (the first to be born in Macau) arrived in the east in the late 1940s, with five of the couple's six children.
A year later, the daughter who had stayed with her husband in Cape Verde came to Macau, already with baby Humberto. The initial plan was for two years, but the couple ended up three decades and have three more children: Mario, Rui and Maria Helena.
In 1971, it was the turn of Humberto and Mário to leave to study medicine in Lisbon, but not without a great fright linked to the colonial war that had lasted a decade ago.
"As we went to the university we could postpone military inspection, but the papers did not come from Macao and we risk being considered refractory," said Humberto. The situation resolved, but Mario admitted to Lusa the fear of the mobilization. "We had this persecution, we had to go through the year not to go with the sides in the war," he explained.
“The Shock” in Lisbon
Upon arrival in Lisbon, “we were soon welcomed and integrated into the Cape Verdean student community,” said Humberto, at a time of student agitation and politics. "There were periods when it was almost daily, manifestations of students against the regime, the shock police enter the canteen inside and give some suckling," said Mario.
Humberto admitted that "it was a shock, for those who came from Macau, where there was little political culture and the colonial war was seen as a struggle against terrorists." In a summer, the young man, who was integrated into a Cape Verdean group of intervention music, left with a friend "to the overseas ride out of guitar on his back."
“I always remember the first time in France, that I saw the colonial war described on the contrary on television, the struggle for the liberation of a colonial power of occupation,” said Humberto.
Independence
When the two brothers finished the medical course, the independence of Cape Verde, on July 5, 1975, led them to the root return. "There was a movement of many of our colleagues to contribute to a new country, which was beginning to take the first steps," said Mario, then a formed cardiologist.
Also because, recalled Humberto, some of the friends of Lisbon had, however, became members of the Government of Cape Verde. "There was this possibility, but the return to Macao, a place where it had spent so long, was natural," he explained. “I was born in Cape Verde, I spent part of my life in Portugal, I grew up in Macao, I am also Macaense. I am a citizen of the world,” said Humberto.
Macanese are a Euro-Asian community, most of which Lusodescendants, with roots in Macau, although many have emigrated, due to the economic situation or fear created by the transition from Portugal Administration to China in 1999.
From the Évora brothers, Rui, engineer, left before the transition to Cape Verde, where he even worked on the project of the Hotel-Casino that Macau's businessman David Chow built on the beach, but was inaugurated.
The younger sister, Maria Helena, a documentary science expert who has even worked in the Macao Historical Archive, is currently in the City Council of Oeiras. The children “are all out” between the United Kingdom, Cape Verde and Portugal, said Mario. "Now the world is smaller and it is going where there are opportunities," he said.
Humberto also faces migrations "as a natural process, not only for Cape Verdeans, but even to the Macanese."
Nothing that has prevented the two brothers from keeping their ties with the archipelago. Humberto divides the time between Portugal and Cape Verde, and has been the official doctor of Cape Verdean sports for decades to the main international competitions.
Mario was one of the founders-and president for ten years-of the Macau-Cabo Green Friendship Association. "We had here Ildo Lobo, Tito Paris, and my cousin," said the cardiologist, before taking a break and adds, with a smile: "Cesaria Évora."</description><pubDate>2025-07-03 23:18:00</pubDate></item><item><title>WHO | Study reveals that one in six people in the world feels</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/01/oms-estudo-revela-que-uma-em-cada-seis-pessoas-no-mundo-sente-se-so/</link><description>A World Health Organization report states that loneliness is a growing problem. Based on a study conducted between 2014 and 2023, the document concluded that one in six people in the world feel alone, with emphasis on young people from 13 to 29 years old. The Southeast Asian region has, however, less problematic values
 
More and more is spoken of the devastating impact of loneliness as a potentializing cause of diseases. This time, a report from the World Health Organization (WHO), released on Monday and carried out by the Social Connection Commission, brings data on the problem, concluding that one in six people say he feels alone, a state that is not synonymous with being alone.
Moreover, the problem is greater in younger ones, because one in five says it feels alone, which shows that one fifth of the world's population between 13 and 29 years old says it feels loneliness.
The study, entitled “From Solitude to Social Connection - tracing a path to healthier societies: WHO Commission on Social Connection Commission”, focuses on 2013 and 2024, thus encompassing the pandemic, a period when most of the world populations faced confinement periods, some of them alone in their dwellings. The study was sent to journalists from 194 WHO member countries, and the data were dealt with in line with other works already done on the subject and with the support of experts from around the world, including from China. Bin Yu, from the Medical College Tianjin University, was one of the project participants.
The report points out that between 2014 and 2023 "it is estimated that 16 percent of people around the world-one in six-felt loneliness," something that "affects all ages and regions." However, it is a “more common feeling among adolescents and young adults”, with a rate of 20.9 percent of young people between 13 and 17 years old, while the rate reduces slightly to 17.4 percent in the case of young adults from 18 to 29 years.
The feeling of loneliness "decreases with age", and is also "more common in low-income countries, where almost one in four people (24 percent) claimed to feel lonely."
The WHO study also points out that “the highest rates are in the WHO African region”, with 24 percent; Following the regions of the eastern Mediterranean (21 percent), and in Southeast Asia this feeling is less felt by respondents, registering only 18 percent.
"The European region has the lowest rate, with about ten percent," says WHO, which distinguishes loneliness of social isolation. In this field, “data is more limited”, but the isolation of the elderly stands out. "Estimates suggest that 25-34 percent of the elderly are socially isolated," it is data on the years between 1990 and 2022.
When it comes to adulthood, from 30 to 59 years, the percentage of people who feel only low to 15.1 percent, and in people 60 years or older, with 11.8 percent.
Regarding gender, “estimated rates of loneliness in women and men are similar (16.1 and 15.4 percent, respectively), with the highest estimated differences between adolescents (24.3 percent between women and 17.2 percent between men) and the elderly (13 percent between women and 9.9 percent among men)”.
Who else feels
The report states that nowadays “social disconnection is widespread in all regions and in all age groups”, with consequences that are “serious and underestimated, affecting mortality, physical and mental health, well-being, education, economy and society in general”. "Its widespread occurrence and its serious consequences make it a serious issue of global public health," it is mentioned.
And who feels more alone? The WHO highlights “marginalized groups”, namely “people with disabilities, lesbians, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex, queer (or sometimes in question) and other individuals (LGBTIQ+) and migrants”. These people “are more likely to feel loneliness and isolation than other groups”, making it the caveat that “previous data are too limited to determine whether social isolation and solitude rates have increased or decreased”.
In the case of disabled people, scenarios persist such as being unable to “access social facilities and take advantage of opportunities due to physical barriers in buildings, limited access to transportation and lack of affordable information and communication, while others face structural stigma that limits their job opportunities or other sociocultural barriers that lead to lower level of education, less stable relationships and more precarious housing conditions”.
"Many factors" are identified that lead people to feel alone, namely "modernization, industrialization and technological changes", and may be "responsible for what, often, it is presumed to be an increase in social isolation and loneliness, but most remain without proof."
"We know that certain factors increase the risk of individuals suffering from social disconnection. These include poor physical or mental health (especially depression), personality traits such as neuroticism, not having a partner or being single, living alone and characteristics of the built environment, such as poor access to public transport. The impact of digital technology is not yet clear, but experts recommend caution, especially to protect the mental health and well-being of young people." study.
The WHO highlights, throughout the text, how it is difficult to quantify feelings of loneliness, being relatively recent this type of definitions and, above all, differentiation between the feeling of feeling alone and being effectively only. The report includes testimonies from people from various countries and cultures that describe that, even though they are with a partner or friends, they feel alone in a scenario caused by many factors.
In the case of young people, "the realization of high loneliness rates between adolescents is consistent with the results of previous research, although the result may be subject to both developmental and methodological considerations."
“As loneliness results from a perceived discrepancy between real and desired or expected social connections, the highest rate in adolescence can be due to higher expectations of social connections during the development phase, which is marked by significant emotional and psychological changes. The elderly report comparatively greater satisfaction with their social relations. According to these estimates, the elderly have the lowest loneliness rates, which contradicts previous studies that enhanced the elderly as the age range with some of the highest rates. This may be due to the limited availability and quality of the previous data on the elderly, ”is explained.
The study highlights, however, that it is “possible that the prevalence of loneliness is greater among adults over 80 or older”, which is a “consistent conclusion with previous studies, in which there was a distribution in the form of 'U' of loneliness among older adults”.
More than 800 thousand deaths
We are in an era where so -called social health is at risk, being considered by WHO as "a vital but often neglected, health, as essential as physical and mental health."
"Social relations can reduce the risk of disease, increase life expectancy and strengthen the fabric of communities and society. Social relations improve life, giving us meaning and a feeling of belonging," it is also read, being mentioned that today loneliness affects one in six people worldwide and causes "about 871,000 deaths annually (2014-2019)".
"New estimates suggest that loneliness alone may be responsible for about 871,000 deaths a year. The economic cost of these comprehensive impacts on society is just starting to be understood. Estimates suggest substantial costs for employers, health systems and individuals. Stronger social connections provide important protection in health, social and economic domains," he reads.
The report points out that many of these issues only now begin to be perceived and analyzed. "This has probably been happening for years, but the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the growing concern for digital technology has brought more attention to the issue, including governments," he is explained.
The WHO also points to a correlation between poverty or low income and the feeling of loneliness.
"In general, the lower the performance group in a country, the higher the loneliness rate. It is estimated that low-yielding countries have the higher (24.3 percent), followed by the medium-low yield countries (19.3 percent), medium-high performance countries (12.1 percent) and high-performance countries (10.6 percent)," can be read.
Despite some worrying scenarios, WHO leaves some suggestions and even says that "there is hope" to get around the problem. "There are effective strategies for promoting social connection and these must be expanded," for example, by the "regular monitoring of the prevalence of social connection, social isolation and solitude at the global, regional and national level." This monitoring should be viewed as "a high priority", allowing "to track progress and measure the impact of strategies to deal with the issue."
It is also suggested the “international development and adoption of reliable measuring instruments, interculturally valid for social connection, social isolation and loneliness”, and as a priority ”should be viewed the creation“ of an instrument to measure social connection, as conceived in this report: in the three dimensions of structure, function and quality ”.
The study was based on reference documents on global and regional estimates of the prevalence of loneliness and mortality due to loneliness, “the first of this type”; a global review of political documents; Network mapping and analysis, the inclusion of 64 experiences experienced by people in relation to social connection, social isolation and loneliness, as well as “high quality evidence, prioritizing systematic revisions, meta-analysis and large-scale multinational studies”, without forgetting the experience of the WHO technical advisory group itself, “composed of 20 renowned global experts”.</description><pubDate>2025-07-01 23:24:44</pubDate></item><item><title>China-Portuguese | Chengdu Pavilion shows Portuguese products</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/26/china-portugal-pavilhao-em-chengdu-mostra-produtos-portugueses/</link><description>In the Euro-Asia National Commodity Pavillion venture in Chengdu, pavilions for foreign countries and entrepreneurs who want to establish business in China are installed. Portugal is also there, represented by the Portugal Pavilion, but according to manager Ângelo Sousa, there is a lack of support from the Portuguese government and strength to combat competition
 
“For us there are no barriers between Portugal and China. We are 365 days here and there.” This is the way the objectives of the team that is behind the Portugal Pavilion present at the Euro-Asia National Commodity Pavillion are presented in Chengdu and which is managed by two partners: Yinhui Tui and Ângelo Freitas de Sousa.
The two realized that the Shanghai zone had reached a saturation point in the trade of products and that it was necessary to go more to the interior of the country to try to sell things as Portuguese as wine, cod or olive oil.
HM talked to Yinhui Tui about this project on the fringes of a lunch in Lisbon by the Friends of the New Seda Route Association, chaired by Fernanda Ilhéu. The event served precisely for Yinhui Tui to present the objectives of the Portugal Pavilion and try to capture business interests.
“This is a very important market for Portuguese products. In China we have separated the country [in commercial terms] in four markets. We have the region of Beijing and Shanghai, which we call 'Yangtze River Economic Zone', and 'Pearl River Economic Zone'. The fourth zone is composed by the cities of Chengdu and Chongqing and which is a new economic area established in 2020. Portuguese have a lot of potential in these markets, ”he said.
The entrepreneur recalls that the marketing of Portuguese products is still below the one that is done by French, Spanish or other countries, but when the Chinese buyer discovers wine or olive oil, he is surprised.
"In Shanghai, for example, some customers already have their opinion on French or Australians. But many think that Portuguese products have more quality," said Yinhui Tui, noting that in the area where the Portugal Pavilion operates in Sichuan province, "people are a little more conservative and prefer to try, prove and feel before buying."
"Our pavilion is next to the French pavilion and we often see customers opt for French wine. But when they go through our pavilion, they see our brands and ask what we have. When they realize that we have cheaper wine compared to French, they are surprised and say it is better, and then buy."
This responsible explains that the population in the fourth economic zone is 130 million people, much more than the number of people living in the Iberian Peninsula. "Then I think it's a market with a lot of potential," he said.
The Role of Lusosino
Yinhui Tui and Ângelo Freitas de Sousa created Lusosino that it acts as the managing entity of the pavilion, which was born “with the intention of promoting Portuguese products in the Great Market of China”. Thus, there is a “showroom” of very Portuguese products, representing some brands known as is the case of Vieira crackers, Esporão wine, Sal Marnoto, the Prisca jams or Vista Alegre, among others. It is in this pavilion that "exhibitors display the best products, buyers discover trends and where they both find the conditions to realize business." Moreover, Lusosino, through this pavilion, helps Portuguese entrepreneurs in marketing campaigns and in the best way to contact potential Chinese customers.
Specifically, Lusosino promises to perform “producer and brands records, commercial representation, market analysis, market support and preparation, among other services”, reads on the website.
However, and according to Ângelo Freitas de Sousa to HM, there are many obstacles to putting Portuguese products in China. “[The Chengdu and Chongqing zone] has the advantage of being a growing market that is not overloaded with exporters and has no addictions as happens in the Shanghai zone. It is a very large market and where there are many producers.” By addictions, the entrepreneur refers to “competition” from other countries and buying habits of Chinese customers, who are faster looking for products from other nationalities than from Portugal. "There are habits of certain brands that are implemented and people don't even look at others or experience them."
The Portuguese Pavilion project began with an idea of ​​Ângelo Ferreira de Sousa, who has a Chinese wife who helps him in the business. “I met Yinhui Tui, he liked Portuguese products, we were friends and then we ended up joining energy,” he said, explaining that the interior of the country is still knowing foreign products, not just Portuguese.
"The Shanghai zone has nowhere to grow and this is a growing economic zone. There are many factories that are moving to Chengdu, so there will be more development," he said.
Absence of marketing
The Portuguese entrepreneur regrets that the Portuguese authorities have given little support to the project, except for any follow -up by AICEP - Agency for Investment and Foreign Trade of Portugal.
"All the investment was made by us and we have not had a lot of support. We had some help from AICEP, but nothing special. We do fairs, the showrooms, to prove and know our products in major cities," said Angelo Ferreira de Sousa.
The entrepreneur also regrets that, despite the list of hundreds of years between Portugal and China, there is still flaws in the commercial strategy for the export of Portuguese products in the country. "The Spaniards are much further ahead than us," he said.
Regarding the role of Macao as a platform, the entrepreneur says it is equally difficult to bring products from Portugal to China or Macau to China, due to lack of customs agreements and little flexibility.
"It is not because we call Macau that I can, for example, putting sausages, cod or preserves in China, or other Portuguese products. To pass from Portugal to Macau is easy, but it is no longer so easy to take after Portuguese products from Macau to China. We have not been able to do much through Macau, but we have not sought much," he said.
At the presentation in Lisbon, Yinhui Tui advanced some figures behind the construction of the Euro-Asia National Commodity Pavillion, and help to understand their size: about 70 billion euros of investment and a space of 300,000 cubic meters. The Portugal Pavilion does not only do contact sessions or fairs: if a businessman wants to leave tons of products there, he can do so. Then the pavilion is in charge of distribution through several areas of China. “In the southern market, closer to Macao, there is a lot of competition in some areas, so it should be betting inside China,” said Yinhui Tui, referring to the potential and factor novelty that exists in some areas of the country regarding commerce.</description><pubDate>2025-06-26 00:50:24</pubDate></item><item><title>BRICS | Seventh Cimeira ends today with focus on Trump's fares</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/07/brics-setima-cimeira-termina-hoje-com-foco-nas-tarifas-de-trump/</link><description>Since Saturday, leaders of the countries that are part of the BRICS Group have been gathered in Rio de Janeiro for another summit designed to think about the reform of institutions and inclusion of more emerging economies, as well as the fight against Trump's rates. Highlight for the absences of Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin
 
Since Saturday, Rio de Janeiro hosts the BRICS Group leaders, which ends today. The first day was based on the dialogue around the ambition of emerging economies to reform international institutions and the defense of multilateralism.
"I think the main message is this: at the time of so many international crises, conflicts, we are experiencing a succession of conflicts that only increase from year to year, having a set of countries reaffirming the power of diplomacy, cooperation, the need to act jointly, to solve the problems of the population and not to generate more destruction, such as conflicts, it is an opportunity that we always have to take advantage of," Lyrio, guide of discussions and agreements of heads of state at the conference, designated by the Brazilian presidency of the BRICS.
In all, about 30 countries and nine international organizations have been present, with the Brazilian head of state, Lula da Silva leading the meeting, which has Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, Angola President and African Union, the Secretary-General of United Nations, António Guterres, among others.
The main absences are Russian and Chinese heads of state, two BRICS founding countries. Vladimir Putin, the target of a warrant of detention issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC), on suspicion of illegal deportation of Ukrainian children to Russia, will only participate in video conferencing.
Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov will be the representatives of the two founding countries of the group, which represents more than 40 percent of the global population and more than 35 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) worldwide.
From China with Love
According to Chinese state agency Xinhua, Chinese prime minister promised to “expand cooperation with Brazil” in the areas of “digital and aerospace economy”. Li Qiang spoke on Saturday, as part of a meeting with Lula da Silva, noting that the country intends to “work with Brazil to take advantage of each other and expand cooperation in areas such as digital economy, green economy, scientific and technological and aerospace innovation”.
Xinhua quotes words from Li Qiang, who referred to the fact that “China is ready to work with Brazil to continue efforts to enrich the dimensions of bilateral relations and achieve more concrete results in cooperation in order to provide more benefits to both peoples”.
One of the points out of this meeting was the realization in 2026 of the year of China-Brazil culture, which provides for an intensification in cooperation in areas such as “education, youth and health”, in order to facilitate “more exchanges between peoples and strengthen public support to China-Brazil's friendship and cooperation”.
“China is willing to work with Brazil to further consolidate and deepen bilateral cooperation in trade, finance and infrastructure development within the high quality cooperation of Belt And Road [track and route]”, the Chinese prime minister, who did not forget the great flag of this BRICS Summit: multilateralism.
Thus, I read Qiang considered “the two countries as fierce defenders of multilateralism and free trade”, saying that “China is willing to improve communication and coordination with Brazil in multilateral structures such as the United Nations, BRICS and G20, work in union with developing countries to promote an equal and ordered multipolar world and universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization, and provide more certainty and stability to the world. ”
On the other hand, Lula da Silva said that "Brazil is willing to deepen communication and multilateral coordination with China, to oppose unilateralism and defend multilateralism and free trade in order to promote peace and world development." After the meeting between the two leaders, “cooperation documents in areas such as tax and financial matters, artificial intelligence, alignment of development strategies and aerospace” were signed.

Cuba's debut
Cuba President Miguel Díaz-Canel also participates in the 17th BRICS Summit, being the first time Cuba has associated with this geopolitical and economic cooperation group.
Under the motto “reinforcing cooperation in the global south for more inclusive and sustainable governance”, the BRICS Summit's agenda comprises two central axes: the consolidation of cooperation between the global southern countries and the promotion of reforms in international governance mechanisms.
Created in 2009 throughout Brazil, Russia, India and China, BRICS admitted South Africa two years later and, since last year, integrates six new effective members: Egypt, United Arab Emirates, Ethiopia, Iran, Indonesia and Saudi Arabia. Brazil invited to this summit leaders from various Latin American countries, including Mexico, Colombia, Uruguay and Chile.
The statute of associate, which takes Cuba to Rio de Janeiro, was approved in October 2024 during the summit of the group held in the Russian city of Kazan, which was made official in 2025, recalled the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Caribbean country.
In addition to geopolitical issues, BRICS have sought in Rio de Janeiro in the organization's economic weight, namely in the financial domain, in which they have been looking for a dollar for years for trade in the group.
The host president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, president of Brazil, stressed last Friday the importance of a mechanism with these characteristics, recognizing, however, that the current international political context is "complicated".
What is on the agenda
On the first day, the heads of state and government of the BRICS participated in two plenary sessions, particularly on "peace and safety and reform of global governance" and the second relative to the strengthening of multilateralism, economic and financial affairs and artificial intelligence. "
In the latter, the revision of the ACCIORARY participation in the World Bank, the realignment of IMF shares [International Monetary Fund] and the increase in the representation of developing countries in leadership positions in international financial institutions and the importance of reforming the UN Security Council.
In addition, as it has been happening during the BRICS ministerial meetings over the past few months, an increase in unilateral unilateral unilateral protectionist measures should be made in reference to the measures announced by the President of the United States, Donald Trump; as well as an appeal to reinforce the use of local currencies in trade between the bloc countries. Today the plenary session will be on “Environment, COP30 and Global Health”.
The term BRIC was created by a Goldman Sachs analyst to refer to emerging economies who began to stand out worldwide beyond the US, with the BRICS first gathered at the level of heads in 2009. This is the first meeting that brings together the new group configuration with 11 member countries.
Brazil has mobilized about 20,000 military personnel, as well as fighters with missiles, anti-drug systems and elite shooters to ensure the safety of the event. The safety operation, called Operational Command Redeemer Set, also provides for the use of 300 vehicles, 38 armored vehicles, 18 boats and eight helicopters.</description><pubDate>2025-07-07 04:58:58</pubDate></item><item><title>Coloane | Filipe Afonso launches work that highlights the importance of staff houses</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/24/coloane-filipe-afonso-lanca-obra-que-destaca-importancia-de-casas-de-palafitas/</link><description>The latest book by Filipe Afonso, coordinator of the Architecture course at the University of São José, looks at a housing model at risk of disappearing, but can be seen in Coloane, or in old fishing zones of Hong Kong. “Coloane Grammar” presents alternative solutions for the reuse of these houses and their classification as a heritage
 
Taking the idea of ​​grammar that names the book, what are the main terms or concepts around Coloane, its tradition and preservation that can enumerate?
The “grammar” of the book introduces the concept of vernacular architecture, which reflects the knowledge of the informal, local construction and the maritime identity of this Coloane community. It addresses the assets at risk, proposing a method of cataloging existing houses, this digital method, which establishes a dialogue between tradition and modernity to preserve this cultural landscape.
What concrete proposals are suggested in the book for the protection and preservation of Coloane's stilts?
The book proposes (indirectly) the classification of stilts as a heritage to give them legal protection. By cataloging existing stilts, the book contributes to preserving the memory of this type of architecture and a broader discussion about its possible protection.
How could we reuse the stilts taking into account these specific ways of life and the economic diversification that the government wants to achieve?
The stilts could be reused for experience tourism, or centers of cultural interpretation, valuing local history. They can be transformed into creative and artistic spaces or in fact propose new wood buildings along the water line, with various uses and that can generate value to the Coloane community, contributing to Macao's cultural and economic diversification.
Why approach Coloane and the stilts? How did this project come about?
Coloane and the stilts were approached by their architectural and cultural uniqueness, representing a threatened memory and identity of Macao. This assets at risk has a significant potential. The project also emerged from the gap of scientific knowledge about these structures and the urgent need for documentation, consolidating itself as an academic-scientific investigation.
In the Asian or Southeast Asian context, are the coloane stilts or not unique in architectural terms?
Water constructions are common in various Asian countries, Coloane's stilts are not a unique case in terms of existence. See the example, in Hong Kong, of the well-known Tai o village, but are unique in their specific context. Its architecture is the reflection of local regional influences and materials, adapted to the history of the evolution of Colona's fishing community and the development of Macao. Its value lies in its particular architectural language and its persistence in a rapidly transformed urban environment.
What is the story behind the emergence of stilts? Are you associated with Coloane piracy reports, for example, which refer to the early twentieth century?
The stilts emerged as a practical and functional solution to the sea -related way of life, allowing sea access, tidal protection and efficient use of space in coastal areas. Piracy reports in Coloane were not the direct cause of their emergence. Shapes are essentially the response of an informal architecture of local communities to adapt to the maritime environment.
Museum Idea on Coloane Stop Stand since 2017
The need for preservation of coloane stilts is not a recent idea. Between 2017 and 2018, the Directorate of Tourism Services proposed the creation of a museum entirely dedicated to the stories of these dwellings arranged in Rua dos Navegantes, but the project was being postponed for legal reasons.
In 2018, the Tribuna de Macao newspaper (JTM) published an article where it referred precisely the absence of “legal foundations” for the construction of new infrastructure in the Maritime area of ​​Macao, something that has changed, however, given that the MSAR passed, from 2018, to include in its jurisdiction the management of 85 square kilometers of maritime zones.
Last year alone, the executive's plans for the creation of a “functional maritime zoning”, “maritime areas” and other related laws, and a concrete decision on what will be made on what will be made on the stilts. Both zoning and plan will be defined for a temporal period by 2040.
One of the objectives of the executive is environmental and ecological preservation, as well as certain experiences of the population. One of the points of the public consultation report speaks of “optimizing ocean exploration modalities according to Macau's development needs; coordinating the use of sea in production, daily life of the population and ecology” and performing “intensive and economizers uses to realize the rational allocation of maritime resources”.
In 2018, according to the JTM, STD assured that it would be necessary to “wait for the publication of the maritime area and administrative regulation on the administration of the use of maritime zones” and only then could you think of the planning of the museum. HM questioned STD of this article, and until the closing of this edition, obtained new clarifications.
A gradual development
In a master's dissertation in architecture, defended in 2023 at the University of Coimbra, Ana Rita Rodrigues made the study of the “Evolution of Macao Territory-Aterros and Urban Design in the Taipa and Coloane islands”, and concluded that “Portuguese occupation in the islands of Taipa and Coloane brought improvements in infrastructure, safety and village organization”. In the late nineteenth century, "there were already, in the islands, schools, hospitals and basic infrastructure, promoting the economic growth of the region."
Referring to the existence of stilts “used for the construction of fishing and housing boats for fishermen, naturally facing the river”, in a coloane zone composed “by precarious housing of one or two floors, unlike the type of common housing found in mud or macao, which was more focused on high development”.
The author also points out that “development was slower” in Coloane, as well as the absence, on both islands, of “a unified general plan and the need for better urban planning to ensure a cohesive and sustainable environment”.</description><pubDate>2025-06-24 23:53:24</pubDate></item><item><title>Teaching | I was entering local schools, but resources are scarce</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/23/ensino-ia-entrou-nas-escolas-locais-mas-recursos-sao-escassos/</link><description>The government has been betting on the introduction of artificial intelligence in territory schools, but with a few hours in the curriculum. In addition, schools complain of few resources to meet government goals
 
Macao schools have integrated artificial intelligence tools (AI) in classrooms, such as smart paintings and linguistic models, but some teachers warn that most are not prepared to comply with outlined policy for the sector.
After classes, students at Pui Va Secondary School remain in the classroom, distracted to explore a smart condition. These staff - explains Ruan Zhan Teng, school teacher at the school - act as interactive projectors and are used as soon as the first year, to write, watch videos or participate in classes with digital media.
"In the third year, students begin to learn to identify artificial intelligence in everyday life, basic programming and photos and videos generated by AI," the computer teacher added to Lusa.
The change took place in 2024 and is stipulated in the law: AI should be included in primary education (with a workload of 17 hours and 20 minutes per year), from 7th to 9th grade (19 hours and 20 minutes) and from 10th to 12th (18 hours and 40 minutes).
Despite the requirement, Andy Chun Wai Fan, professor and director of the University of Macao Information and Communication Center in Education, Note that schools face two obstacles: lack of resources and faculty formation.
“Some schools have only one information technology teacher,” said Fan, also referring that institutions generally have computer classes only once a week.
Do not update
Pedro Lobo, a teacher in this area, with 30 years of experience in the territory, including at the Portuguese School of Macau, is concerned about the lack of training. "Most teachers are already a certain age, they have not grown with this new technology ... So the mindset is still short of all this evolution, and change is being so fast that it can hardly follow," explained the Portuguese.
Education authorities require teachers 30 hours of annual IA training, however, Pedro Lobo considers not sufficient. Although this year has already studied almost 40 hours, the teacher says he is "little prepared".
Regarding this government policy, Andy Chun Wai Fan also remembers that it is required to schools that address ethics, innovation and collaboration in the domain of AI, although it fits the institutions the creation of the manuals themselves. “We do not have a manual about what to teach (…), each school has its own ideas about what to do with its students,” wolf reacted, explaining that he teaches “transferring AI to school work”, either through image generation, small game development, AI ethics approach and copyright issues.
Since 2021 at PUI VA
In a different record, the Pui Va Secondary School, which introduced AI in 2021, assumes to be “well prepared” to “the change”. The institution spends about two million patacas a year on AI tools, employs seven information technology teachers (IT) and hired a university professor in Beijing to support. “We want students to be able to use artificial intelligence to identify problems and solve real -life problems,” noticed the IT Office Director of Chinese educational establishment, Chong Wai Yin.
Here, students work, for example, with programming languages ​​(Python, Tencent, Iflytek), and AI models such as Deepseek and ChatgPT, engaging in intelligent city projects, in the first cycle, and in the creation of applications, at a later stage, said Zhao Qihao, former professor at the University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, who taught in Puija VA.
“In the first cycle, we developed smart cities, automated houses and AI -powered parking systems (…). In the second cycle, students create mobile applications and sustainable technological projects,” he explained.
In April, the Secretary for Social Affairs and Culture, LAM, announced that Macao's educational reforms for 2025 will focus on AI and include plans for an intelligent classroom in all schools.
The Government of Macao attributed to the school network under the direction of the Directorate of Youth Education and Development Services (DSEDJ) 15 million PATACA for AI software for this academic year.
In an email sent to Lusa, DSEDJ stated that the government “attributes great importance” to the teaching of information technologies. "The medium and long term plan for non-higher education (2021-2030) identified 'reinforcement of creativity and technological education' as one of the main directions of development," he explains in the note.
However, Pedro Lobo questions the pressure on young students: "Are we seeing children 8, 9, 10 years old to develop applications? Maybe 1 percent is capable. The rest does the best they can. They have classes and homework that never end."
Concerned deputies
In the last debate of the Legislative Assembly, last Thursday, two deputies, Iau Teng Pio and Kou Kam Fai, linked to education, defended the need for “high quality development of education in Macao”, namely with the bet on AI.
One of the suggestions, referred to during the interventions before the order of day, was the reinforcement of the “coordinated development mechanism between education, scientific and technological innovation and talents”, with the increase of “Stem resources [science, technology, engineering and mathematics] and artificial intelligence on basic education, rooting the basis of scientific literacy”.
In the debate on the 11th of this month, it was up to Deputy Ma Io Fong to appeal to AI regulation to avoid scams, but also to increase the awareness of society in relation to this new reality.
“With the rapid development of technology these days, the use of AI functions is gradually becoming important help for society and residents in daily life and work. However, AI can give rise to illicit acts, especially the worsening cyber attacks and the diffusion of false information.”
Also during the period of interventions before the agenda, the deputy asked the executive to “reinforce sensitization and education on the prevention of AI fraud, to sensitize the elderly and young people, emphasizing that the dissemination of false videos generated by AI can be a legal offense with serious consequences”.
In this context, the systematic integration of “AI safety knowledge in school curricula and the realization of different awareness and education activities with community associations was requested to increase public knowledge about AI technology and the risk derived for its abuse”.
"It is also due, through cooperation between the government, society, schools and the family, to reinforce the ability to respond to information and the internet discourse, allowing to react, clarify and follow up on useful time, when the public faces information that can cause negative influences or be misleading," said Ma Io Fong in the 11th debate.</description><pubDate>2025-06-23 23:45:47</pubDate></item><item><title>History | The MA-chan escape to the colonial and macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/23/historia-a-fuga-dos-ma-chan-para-o-portugal-colonial-e-para-macau/</link><description>The MA-chan family is from Mozambique with Chinese roots, sought its new path in the then colonial Portugal and since 1976 that set roots in Macao. José Manuel Machon, resident in the territory since he was 13, told Lusa the very peculiar trajectory of his family, which reflects many of the family directions taken in the years of war and the end of the Portuguese colonial empire
 
The MA-chan, the Mozambican family with roots in China, fled twice to communism and twice resumed in colonial Portugal. In 1976, they landed in Macao, where Mozambique's memory had erased with the departure of the Landins, African troops that parked in the territory for decades since 1912.
According to a report by Luís Andrade de Sá published in Macau magazine in 1992, and quoted by the blog "Chronicles Macanese", the Landins were in Macao "for about five decades", and "the Chinese never used to their conviviality, suspiciously who had the huge blacks who played a horrible drumsticks while returning the ostensiva. ferocity ”. The term Landim became a reference “to identify all indigenous battalions that passed by Macau”, is described in the same report.
Massá Ma-chan went in 1963 to the Namphlam, northern Mozambique Conservatory to register the fifth son, but once again denied this Chinese, with roots in Guangzhou, the transmission of the nickname to descent. José Manuel was the same as his brothers: the nickname Machon, corruption of MA-chan.
The identity of José Manuel Machon, embryoly marked by this bureaucratic detail imposed by the then Portuguese Mozambique, is not only a reflection of the colonial past of Portugal, but from the beginnings of Sino-Mozambican relations.
“I don't have great confusion, I tried to adapt to life,” he tells Lusa in Macau, where he has lived since he was 13. The grandfather-also MA-chan-was the one who defined that this story began in Africa, leaving China looking for better life, in the starter of the twentieth century, and settling in Nampula, alongside Sharing, a Macua woman, Mozambican ethnic group.
Massá, the son -and father of José Manuel -was sent to Guangzhou at 14, to receive formal education there. When he returns to Mozambique, he is a married man with a bullet mark near his left shoulder.
In China, he faced the Japanese in World War II and married a Chinese, which he met on the day of marriage, until, on the threshold of the civil war, which would victory to Mao Zedong's communists, fled. He dedicated himself to Nampula to the cucumber of the cucumber-the 'Magojojo'-and the tubar bit, which he exported to Hong Kong.
The Great Return
However, unable to adapt, the woman returned to Macao with her four children, where she died. Massá returned to marry, this time with a Mozambican - José Manuel came first, Carla later.
When the Frelimo flag raised on the mast in Mozambique on June 25, 1975, the MA-chan-headed Macao, with a brief passage in Portugal, where they inhabited a pension paid by the then IARN.
“We are nothing returned, because we have not returned anywhere, we are refugees,” says Carla Machon, residing in Portugal.
“When my father heard again about communism, he fled,” says his brother, José Manuel. While speaking, bowling balls pack on the floor and travel the track to a new crash. The noise in the center of Bowling Future Bright does not seem to bother this big man, 61, fluent in Cantonese and Portuguese and president of Macao Bowling Club. “This is what keeps me stable. Instead of going to the glasses, I come here,” he notes.
For Joseph, independence "it was an open openness, an opening to the world." It doesn't even talk about political reasons, but how important it was to cross half a world until you arrived in Macau.
A new life
In this page turn, the MA-chan/maachon family came to find, in 1976, a city with little civil presence abroad. José and Carla do not remember other Mozambicans, who began to arrive after independence, many from Portugal.
Mong-Há's fortress is an old witness to Mozambique's presence in Macau. Then the Landins, Mozambican soldiers at the service of the Colonial Army were quartered, recalls journalist João Guedes, a scholar in the history of Macao. It is this historical circumstance that baptized the hill of Mong-há of “Mountain of Black Ghosts”.
These troops, with the “greatest warrior instinct”, in the expression of Emperor Gungunhana, remained in Macao half a century, until around the 1960s. They were responsible, for example, by the storage of the siege gates, border of the territory with China and recurring incident place.
“They passed by and faded as if they had never been,” resumes Guedes, indicating that there was no material heritage attesting this military presence. Not far from Mong-Há, but at the Riquexó restaurant, troops are still there, eternalized in photos hanging on the walls.
This serves African chicken, macanese dish, whose origin is still today the target of debate. Two theories: It was created by the Portuguese chief Américo Ângelo, inspired by a trip to Mozambique. Another version realizes that, seeing the African soldiers missing roasted chicken, Americo made the dish.
And the memory of macau-moca-mandamous relationships is not complete without evoking the trafficking in leaf. If, on the one hand, it is known that the Portuguese took slaves from the African colonies by settling in the doors of China, in reverse, were also sent via Macao, Chinese to work in Mozambique, often in slavery conditions.
The sons were part of a migratory movement from the late nineteenth century, “to develop the Mozambican colony,” explains the professor at Joaquim Chissano University in Maputo, Fatima Papelo, who investigates Sino-Mozambican cooperation. The first group, he says, was sent in 1858 and "consisted of 30 men."
More than a century later, in the struggle for Mozambican independence, Beijing supported the Liberation Front of Mozambique (Frelimo) and is one of the first countries to recognize the new sovereign state. In Macao, the reinforcement of the ties was later paid, with the transition from the territory of Portugal to China in 1999.
But for José Manuel, Mozambique was always present. The last time it went, tells, visited and cleaned the family campaign, "there at Machamba". "It's a Chinese custom," he explained.</description><pubDate>2025-06-23 02:46:38</pubDate></item><item><title>DSAT | Lam hin San liability is a test to the government</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/07/dsat-responsabilizacao-de-lam-hin-san-e-teste-ao-governo/</link><description>Following the disclosure of the audit Commissioner report highlighted the lack of inspection to Radio Taxi and the breach of the requirements set forth in the concession contract, criticism of the Director of Services for Traffic Affairs (DSAT) Lam Hin San was multiplied.
The president of the Macao Synergy Association, Johnson Ian, wrote an opinion article, published in the newspaper Sou Pou, to relate Lam Hin San's position in the context of the remodeling of management directors and departments recently announced.
The candidate for deputy for the list led by Ron Lam considers that the population is more focused on the need to hold the DSAT director responsible than the remodeling itself. To confirm the rumor that Lam Hin San could be transferred to the port administration company, Johnson Ian argues that the departure of DSAT without liability, to occupy another position with a high salary, will not be well regarded by the population. The candidate for deputy goes further and indicates that the situation of DSAT is a political test for the new government, even more at a time when changes to the statutes of management and leadership personnel is under analysis in the specialty in the Legislative Assembly.
As such, Johnson Ian considers that the population of Macao will soon know if the Sam Hou Fai executive takes seriously the holders of high management positions, or whether the theme is just a political slogan.
Rise in arrow
"For many years that the bureaucratic culture of Macao has not eliminated the bad and retains the good, does not reward the diligents and punishes the lazy, nor reward the most competent. Instead, it is more worth knowing people in high positions, than having professional knowledge, and liability is a mere formality," said the candidate of the deputy.
Johnson Ian also states that the only career mobility for a certain level is hierarchical climb, rise fostered by a professional bureaucratic protection environment and that the admission of failures is rare, which prevents corrections.
In addition, the associative leader regrets that social voices that dare criticize politicians are labeled as agitators who only cause problems.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Advertising | Government wants to change law and legislate “influencers”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/07/publicidade-governo-quer-mudar-lei-e-legislar-influencers/</link><description>Macau authorities proposed for the first time regulating the activity of digital influencers, including 'live marketing', which involves real -time interaction with the public, changing a law of time from Portuguese administration
 
About 36 years after the entry into force of the Advertising Acting Law, the government is preparing to update the legislation, which will regulate the activities of digital influencers and live marketing, in which content creators interact or sell first-time products, with real-time interaction with the public.
Plated last Friday, the 30-day public consultation, which will take place until August 2, on the amendments to the law. During this period, the government will organize five consultation sessions, where legal concepts and definitions will be discussed and clarified the terms on inspection regimes and administrative sanctions.
"It is suggested to clarify that participants in online promotion activities and 'live marketing', such as advertisers, advertising agencies, platform owners and presenters, are subject to the advertising activity law and must fulfill their provisions when their acts are advertising," said the director of Economics and Technological Development Services (DSEDT) at a press conference.
The current law of advertising activity has been in force since 1989, Yau Yun Wah indicated that, considering the changes in the economic activity of the various sectors and technological evolution, "the contents, forms of dissemination and means used in current advertising are significantly different from those of the past."
According to the proposal, influencers should first use the products they support, in order to ensure compliance with the “veracity” requirement of the law. They may also “have to provide proofs of their support under a 'obligation of cooperation',” said Yau Yun Wah.
Own characteristics
"We hope that in the future, 'advertising' [influencers] will be clearly identified in the announcements and that, in case of complaints or false allegations, legal measures may be taken," he added.
The official also clarified that if companies hire influencers from outside Macao to promote products, they must obtain a work permit for them.
The DSEDT director also claimed to expect the future law to allow the increase in advertising on the streets of Macau. "Through the prior authorization regime we hope that the advertising sector may have more relief and develop," said Yau Yun Wah, adding last year's advertising requests were more than 4,000.
Lack of scope
Deputy Ron Lam argued that changes to the advertising activity law, currently in public consultation, are not comprehensive enough, unable to cover some areas.
According to the citizen newspaper, Ron Lam pointed out that despite the government's proposal to change the law to include the simplification of procedures and bring new definitions to advertising online, there are no definitions or regulations on new types of advertising, such as advertising projected by lighting or real estate. The deputy says he does not understand why the executive's proposal does not include, in real estate advertising, the advertising that is made to the vehicle parking lot.
The legislator understands that there must be a transitional period and greater dissemination of information, given that the changes in the advertising regime cover several professional areas.

The order breaks came before the beginning of the trade war declared by Donald Trump against China, which entered into force on 2 April with the “Liberation Day”.
Data on the breach of exports were released on Friday as part of the “conjuncture survey to the industrial sector exporting for the first quarter of 2025”. These data began to be prepared by the Directorate of Statistics and Census Services (DSEC), when before was in the course of the Directorate of Economics and Technological Development Services (DSEDT).
This is the second consecutive break from the same period. Between the first quarter of 2023, and the first of 2024, US orders had shown a break of 16.5 percent. When the comparison is made between the last quarter of 2024 and the first quarter of this year, US orders show a 19.9 percent reduction.
In homologous terms, in the first quarter of the year, interior orders grew 5.6 percent, while from other regions of Asia Pacific, excluding Hong Kong and Japan, grew 25.6 percent. However, Hong Kong orders fell 0.2 percent, while orders from Japan, the European Union did not record unchanged changes.
Pessimistic expectations
Regarding export prospects for the coming months, the average among exporters shows that 52.3 percent expects a decrease in trade, and among them, 27.5 percent expects a slight decrease and 24.8 percent a strong decrease.
At the same time, 26.9 percent expects a “slight increase”, with no exporter that is confident in a “strong increase” in export growth. On the other hand, 20.8 percent of exporters expect stagnation.
The sector in which there is greater pessimism is the export of clothing and clothing, with 99.9 percent of respondents to expect “a strong decrease” of sales abroad. At the opposite pole, the sector of pharmaceutical products is the most optimistic, with 97.2 percent of respondents to wait for a “slight increase”.</description><pubDate>2025-07-07 05:10:01</pubDate></item><item><title>Women | Deputy wants old prison as a base of patriotism</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/07/mulheres-deputada-quer-prisao-antiga-como-base-do-patriotismo/</link><description>Deputy Wong Kit Cheng, linked to the Women's Association, intends to transform the old prison into a base of nationalism. Wong believes this would be a good way to promote Coloane's economy
 
Wong Kit Cheng defends the transformation of the facilities of the old Coloane prison into a "base" to promote patriotism among the local population. The idea was released through a written interpellation of the deputy linked to the Women's Association.
"Coloane's arrest is a witness to the history of correctional services, but it is also a land with an area of ​​18,000 square meters. It is a large building, which is not very common in Coloane, an area where there is lack of land, but also deserves to be revitalized," he began by indicating the deputy. "In fact, the revitalization of military, police or arrest facilities is common in other zones. For example, the old site of the Liugongdao Maritime Office and the Torpedo Factory in the city of Wehai, in Shandong Province, were turned into a broad national security exhibition center," said the deputy. Wong Kit Cheng also referred to the example of Hong Kong, where Victoria prison was transformed into a space with galleries and exposure zones open to the public.
Promote the economy
From the perspective of the deputy, the preservation of the historical site is still a way of promoting Coloane's economy: “In the future, if Colaane's arrest can be reused, the historical, cultural and correctional importance of the building can be used in the service of national security education, with the creation of immersive experiences, special games and commercial complexes,” he suggested. Wong also pointed out that reuse can “bring a new vitality to the community” by Coloane and promote the “development of cultural tourism and the protection of historical heritage”.
"Since the land of Coloane's prison belongs to the government, what are the plans for the use of space and what plans will be followed to meet residents' expectations, while betting on Coloane's long -term development," he asked. “When will there be conditions to announce the land development plan?” He added.
Assuming that the site should be transformed into a base of patriotism, and a “national security defense line”, Wong also questions the executive if the examples of various interior locations in the exposed materials level and will create permanent exhibitions on the subject.
In addition to these aspects, Wong asks the government to present a calendar for the transformation of the place to the base that it considers fundamental to the MSAR.</description><pubDate>2025-07-07 05:08:48</pubDate></item><item><title>Single Account | Information about pecuniary check available online</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/07/conta-unica-informacao-sobre-cheque-pecuniario-disponivel-online/</link><description>Qualified residents receiving the pecuniary check may, from today, consult the form of reception of the amount, the progress of the process, and other information listed through the mobile application, or the website of the pecuniary reimbursement plan.

The information was released by the Institute of Social Action (IAS), through a statement published on Friday.
This is a monthly subsidy of 1,500 patacas, created by the Executive of Sam Hou Fai, which can result in an annual support of 18 thousand patacas. The subsidy covers children who have not completed the three years of age and the request must be filed until June 30 next year. This aspect means that any child who turns three is no longer access to support, which means there may be cases where children's families are supported only for a month, as if they are 2 years and 11 months.
According to the accounts presented by IAS, about 15,000 babies and children may have access to the subsidy, as it will be distributed to those born since 2022 and have not yet completed their 3 years.
Parents holding the permanent resident identity ticket of the valid MGHER may submit the request through the Macao Single Account. If the baby or child is careful of someone other than parents, it is necessary to go to the headquarters of IAS.
The statement also points out that this subsidy has a “temporary nature, a term used by the government to prevent support from being considered“ an acquired right ”and cannot be legally eliminated in the future.

In a little over a month of the Legislative Assembly vacation, and two months from legislative elections, a group of deputies wants to change the rules of hemiciclo to ban the display of signs in meetings, regulate the clothing of deputies, change the rules of mandate losses, and create a suspension system for those who reveal the content of what is discussed in the commissions.
The amendments to review the statute of the deputies and the Legislative Assembly Regiment came from a group of nine deputies led by the President of the Legislative Assembly, Kou Hoi In, and the documents do not allow to identify the rest.
At the proposal of loss of mandate, it is intended to apply to deputies convicted of a crime with a 30 -day arrest. For the loss of the mandate, the crimes contain on or outside the MSAR, and Parliament wants to be able to make the decision based on any document that it considers relevant, even if it is not official. The new statute provides for the police call to remove the deputy to whom the mandate was suspended, in the case of not leaving the plenary room.
Regarding the suspension of the mandate of deputies, Kou wants the visited to become deprived of the monthly remuneration, contrary to what is currently happening. In addition, the suspension can be applied if there is “criminal proceedings” or “serious violation of the duties of deputies”. The president of AL will also be able to suspend any deputy suspected of revealing the content of the meetings at the closed door.
Controlled clothes
The group of deputies also aims to prohibit at meetings the use of "clothing" or "materials with offensive content or political provocation." Deputies who proposed the amendments consider that the prohibition “in no way interferes with the rights of deputies” because “they can express any opinions”, according to the Rules.
The duties of the deputies will also be changed to consecrate the "Macau governed by patriots" policy, but also to oblige deputies to participate in meetings with voting and to be provided for conflicts of interests that prevent deputies from participating in voting in which their impartiality may be concerned.
Among the various changes, deputies also want to self-impeders to submit proposals for public debates on issues considered in the government area.</description><pubDate>2025-07-07 05:02:43</pubDate></item><item><title>Socrates is a phenomenon</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/07/socrates-e-um-fenomeno/</link><description>The life of José Sócrates Pinto Sousa gave a movie. Socrates is a phenomenon of profitable ideas, lies, corruption, altruism and survival without financial problems.  Socrates began his activity in Covilhã as a technical agent. It presented the horrible projects of houses to build. Right then, he learned how they got a construction licenses on the road “faster. Earlier he joined the PSD by joining social democratic youth. Later, the political party with more representativeness in all that was going to have an elite position was the Socialist Party. And he joined as socialist militant. It was the secretary-general. He intended to treat him as an engineer, but it was quickly known that he had no engineering degree.
His party elected him secretary general and won elections. On the first day he entered São Bento as Prime Minister many of his friends interrogated how he had managed to go up to the third most important place in the Portuguese political hierarchy. During his government he had ideas of applauding, namely health reforms. He became one of the most popular politicians in the national political spectrum. But, there is always a "but". Socrates has always been an ambitious man and did not look at means to achieve the ends. And from the stage of chief executive began to be worth everything in what cambalachos played. The owner of this, Ricardo Salgado, immediately sent an employee of his, Manuel Pinho, to the government of Socrates. Manuel Pinho was Salgado's striker with the prime minister and it is known Ricardo Salgado “bought” Socrates about 30 million euros. As for the construction company Lena, whom no one knew, Prime Minister Socrates began directly awarded major works and, sources of the prosecutor, conveyed to us that in the process “Operation Marquis” it states that Lena made many million to Socrates. The Prime Minister traveled to Venezuela with the company Lena in the backpack and Hugo Chavez received very well the idea that Lena built thousands of social housing houses and a deep water port. Great contracts, large agreements, large counterparts. And once again, Socrates managed to reimburse large amounts, according to what is allegedly in the different processes.
One day Socrates left the country with his mouth open. Invited Muammar Gaddafi, president of Libya, to visit Portugal. Socrates intended libanese investments in Portugal and his guest, in exchange for very millions, managed to arm a giant tent inside the São Julião da Barra Fort, a national heritage that the Portuguese respects greatly. The people did not want to believe that there was a giant tent, with all the luxuries, so that Gaddafi would remain during the visit. What is known is that the Socrates-Gaddafi connection was immensely fruitful to the Portuguese politician. On the Socrates agenda could not miss Brazil and his friend Lula da Silva. A Brazilian journalist even wrote that the Portuguese Prime Minister was making a lot of money from Luso-Brazilian trade agreements. It was reached a height that the far-right leader Mario Machado announced that José Sócrates already had a fortune of US $ 330 million and that a cousin of his had gone to Macao depositing a local bank about 30 million euros.
The truth is that Socrates had a faustosa life with top of cars, better restaurants and funding to several women. He acquired a floor at one of the most valuable buildings of the Lisboeta Urbe with the Marquis of Pombal, hence the police and judicial intervention named “Operation Marquis” to the entire investigation to the life of Socrates. This one had also bought a lot of Alentejo for his ex-wife and to complete the signs of wealth traveled to Paris with his son and bought a house in the most expensive neighborhood of the French capital. The media of that time stressed that the presence of Socrates in Paris and the millions he spent was "a scandal." When he came to Portugal, he had the police at the airport waiting for him and was soon detained.
Judicial investigations already had evidence of their active and passive corruption, money laundering and intentional bank transfer by his friend Carlos Silva. Socrates entered the prison of Évora. He was known inside the prison as the 44. But, as Socrates knew a lot and had given a lot of money to earn his comrades, he watched a corruption of personalities on his way to Évora to embrace Socrates, including Mario Soares. He would later be released and began his judicial defense. He even responded several times to prosecutors. Which should not have suffered when the magistrates treated him for “Mr. Sousa”… The criminal accusations were many, however, Socrates surrounded themselves with good lawyers paid to the weight of gold and appeal, there are more than 10 years (it is unbelievable) without any judgment.
Socrates does not stop thinking a minute as it can all prescribe or leave as innocent. From there, last week gave a master blow. Viajou para Bruxelas e deu uma conferência de imprensa na qual anunciou que ia apresentar uma queixa contra o Estado português no Tribunal Europeu dos Direitos Humanos (TEDH). Sócrates justificou os motivos que o levaram a denunciar os tribunais que disse terem sido “manipulados” para persegui-lo na “Operação Marquês”.
He returns from Brussels and had the Campus of Justice in Lisbon, waiting for the first time to sit at the defendants' bank in a trial scheduled for last Thursday. A trial that will last months or years, where 15 defendants were present and Socrates defense lawyers require the annulment of the trial by alleged judicial irregularities. Well, Socrates either is Machiavellian or the smartest human on the planet. There are those who say they will be innocent and will still receive compensation from the state for the evil that has caused it to drag your case for over a decade. Now, say that the life of Socrates did not give a good movie…</description><pubDate>2025-07-07 05:38:00</pubDate></item><item><title>The rise of the waters</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/03/a-subida-das-aguas/</link><description>It is not only when the water retains that one realizes who was using a bath and who was not. When the level of the water rises, perhaps swimming is saved and who does not know drown.
In neighboring Hong Kong, there is news of the successive closing of many insurance companies, bakeries and theaters. It is a city that claims to be an international financial center and constantly seeks ways to “break the impasse” and improve the current situation. If the method adopted is correct, it will naturally find a way out, but if an incorrect or inappropriate method is adopted, the situation will get worse.
Since the beginning of the new mandate of the Government of Misrees, Macau has not faced less problems than he faced during the Covid-19 pandemic. Some difficulties have arisen due to the national and international scenario, others already have root in the past and some have recently appeared. Citibank has removed from Macau, ending its activity in the city, which, despite everything, involved a relatively small amount of assets, but the departure of an international financial institution cannot be ignored.
The chief executive of Macao, as well as many government officials, will rarely have had the opportunity to use public transport. Unfortunately, I recently caught a bus on Rua do Campo and, during the short trip, a passenger sitting near the driver continually expressed his dissatisfaction with the policies of the Government of MSAR, stating that it would participate in good will in protest demonstrations if there was someone who organized them. For safety reasons, the driver did not answer him and I was standing near the door and I also chose to be silent.
Given the current circumstances of Macao, it is difficult to find some group that organizes protests to demand “guarantees of employment and the quality of life of the population”. The RAE government is aware of the problems that exist. The Secretary for the Economics and Finance has just submitted in the Legislative Assembly the proposal of law entitled “Change to the Budget Law of 2025”, to recommend a budget increase of 650 million patacas to support small and medium enterprises and revitalize the landfill area (ZAPE) in response to the wave of stores and the increase in unemployment. However, there was no reference to the moment when the support and revitalization program would be started.
During the mandates of the former heads of executive Hau Hau Wah and Chui Sai On, Macau exceeded significant obstacles to achieving structural economic transformation, which allowed GDP to reach new maximums in Asia and stabilize the political and social scenario. The impact of Covid-19 pandemic in Macao represented an unforeseen disaster, but man's losses are preventable.
Confronted with the wave of closing business, unemployment and uncertainties caused by international commercial conflicts, then waves of shocks will appear behind each other. When water level rises, and to prevent us from driving ourselves, it is necessary to find the true way to survival. In the national development of the central government, Macau appears positioned as “a center, a platform and a base” defined by the country.
When it is mentioned that Macau is “a center” refers that it is the world center of tourism and leisure, and not just the Great Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Bay Tourism and Leisure Center. Attract more international tourists to Macao and encouraging them to consume while in the city is absolutely crucial. Turning the deepened cooperation zone between Guangdong and Macao into Hengqin into a commercial service platform between China and Portuguese -language countries can be more practical and beneficial for Macau than actively promoting the proper diversification strategy of the “1 + 4” economy.
Chinese culture emphasizes harmony and inclusion, and only adopting this guiding principle becomes possible coexistence and diversity, thus shaping a healthy society through the exchange between Chinese culture and western culture. Can Macau reach true harmony and inclusion? If we row toward the ends of the world, instead of being stopped on the beach, it doesn't matter if the water level rises or not.</description><pubDate>2025-07-03 23:46:33</pubDate></item><item><title>Climate change and contradictions of Lula da Silva</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/03/as-alteracoes-climaticas-e-as-contradicoes-de-lula-da-silva/</link><description>The fact that Brazil is the fifth largest country of the globe and the seventh in terms of the number of inhabitants justifies that its president, Lula da Silva, is a politician who arouses curiosity globally. It was partly thanks to its governments that Brazil's Human Development Index (HHP3) has significantly progressed, having reached a list of 193 countries, 89th in 2024, according to the Human Development Report 2023/2024, prepared by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP).
Elected three times, Lula da Silva held the presidency from 2003 to 2011 and 2023 until today. From its policy stand out the programs “Bolsa Familia” and “Hunger Zero”, recognized by the United Nations as having contributed to considerably alleviating hunger in Brazil.
In addition to the fight against hunger, they are also areas where there was greater development, health and longevity, due to investment in the Unified Health System and increased vaccination programs. In the field of education there were significant progress thanks to incentives for more children and adolescents to attend primary and high school. Initiatives such as the “University for All Program” (ProUni) and the “Student Financing Fund” (FIES) contributed to a larger number of college students from low -income population layers.
It is due to this large country that the Portuguese language is one of the most spoken in the world and the most used in the southern hemisphere. On the internet it occupies fifth place 4, far above the eighth place on the list, according to the translation company “Gama!”.
Brazil is also a cause for attention mainly because it has much of the Amazon, the largest rainforest in the globe5. This forest, which extends to 9 countries, has about 60% of its extension in Brazil, hence the great responsibility of the governments of this country to preserve it, not only in its own benefit, but also from the whole planet.
In the time of the government of Jair Bolsonaro (2019 - 2022), steps have taken back regarding the protection of the Amazon, namely the increase in clandestine mining exploitation and agribusiness, resulting in increased deforestation, pollution of numerous water courses with strong health repercussions of indigenous populations and biodiversity.
It was the time when the “land grabbers” 6 again had more freedom in their activity of falsifying documents that were intended to be proof of land ownership that were actually occupied illegally. After these four years of a far-right government, the country has been directed again by rulers who care about the primary role that Amazon has in the regulation of climate on the global scale and the well-being of indigenous populations.
The biosphere is one of the components of the climate system that the most influence has the regulation of climate on the global scale. Much of this component consists of the Amazon, given the most extensive tropical rainforest, with almost seven million square kilometers.
It is a vast carbon dioxide sink, contributing to the reduction of the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and a source of oxygen. The attacks that it has been targeted, motivated by human greed, in the form of deforestation for agricultural exploration make it possible to turn into an extensive savannah, the risk of reaching the point without return of regeneration, in which the forest would move from Co₂ sink to a source of this gas.
Lula da Silva, despite being recognized to him to be a fighter for the preservation of the Amazon and defender of the measures to alleviate climate change, is the subject of pressures to alleviate these characteristics, which has caused some government tergiversals in the application of environmental protection measures and fighting climate change. Take, for example, the case of Bill No. 2159 of 2021, nicknamed Lula's critics for “PL of devastation”.
In discussion since a few years ago, it was approved by the House of Representatives on May 13 this year, before the passivity of the president, who did not give due support to Marina Silva, her minister of the “environment and climate change”. After a few amendments likely to increase the environmental impact, it was recently approved by the Senate. There are even those who claim that the setbacks in environmental policy implicit in this decree-law would not embarrass the government of Jair Bolsonaro, explicitly considered antiamybientalist.
Given this situation, the path is open to oil exploration at sea, relatively close to the mouth of the Amazon River, which contradicts the recommendations expressed at the conference on the Cost287 climate, in which it was established, for the first time in this type of conferences, the explicit commitment regarding the need to transition from fossil fuels in energy systems in a “fair, ordered” way to achieve Carbonic neutrality until 2050.
This “decree of devastation” allows the existence of “special environmental licenses” (LAE) for projects classified as strategic. These would be subject to the assessment of the body responsible for licensing only for a year, after which they would be automatically approved. Chronic staff scarcity of this agency, the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Natural Resources (Ibama), would often allow their approval, paving the way to unpredictable environmental impacts.
Given this situation, the accusation of passivity by Lula da Silva is understandable regarding the procedures involving the approval of this decree. The position of the President of Brazil is very uncomfortable, especially more than the next parts of the parties to be promoted by UNFCCC8, COP30, will be held in Belém, Brazil, next November.
The approval of the infamous “PL of devastation” illustrates well the contradiction between theory and practice in politics led by the Brazilian government.

What if this boat had arrived in Goa, or Macao? However, the writer died only five years after his trip to the attached Atlantic archipelagos, and neither Angola even went, much less the Canton. It would be hard to imagine where we would read a travel diary of this soul contemplator south of China, that another contemporary, in the same born year, Camilo Pessanha, described as the land of evil. Especially in view of the others, the happy islands of Macaronesia. Jorge Arrimar (n. 1953), Angolan poet, who in the 1980s directed the Macao Central Library, after passing through the Azores, reflects on this duplication or island triangulation in “Travel to the Memory of the Islands” (2002). Deep down, Macau is also an island, unfolds peninsularity in insularity.
Now the Azores and Macau maintain old bonds, where the weight of moisture is not the only common denominator. There was a time when, it was said, only Azoreans and the transmontanos ventured to these stops, hence the large number of sword born to the straw or candle, St. George, who were off the Senate. This is the case of Father Teixeira and José Silveira Machado, who arrived here in the same wave. The latter, Azorean who became a citizen of Macau, is one of the examples of someone who contributed to the literature, journalism and education of this peninsula and two islands over about seventy years. For its part, Rodrigo Leal de Carvalho (n. 1932)-outsider of the Praia da Vitória, which performed high functions in the Macao judiciary for several decades-has also dedicated himself to writing, not even documenting the lives of these other archipelagic.
Already the Azorean tradition to provide the “Portuguese world” of ecclesiastical hierarchy had its pinnacles in two figures: D. João Paulino de Azevedo and Castro (1852-1918), born in the slabs of Pico, which was the 19th Bishop of Macao, between 1902 and 1918. She was pastored not only in Macau, but throughout the vast area of ​​the southeast Asia, some good sheep. D. José da Costa Nunes (1880-1976), born in Candelaria do Pico, accompanied D. João Paulino as secretary in 1903, being later Bishop of Macau (1920-1940), Archbishop of Goa and Patriarch of the Oriental Indies, even receiving Cardinal Barrete in 1962.
In this regard, I recently read the volume of the Azoreanophyl researcher Vasco Rosa (n. 1958), published in 2019, about the critical reception of the Brandonean work on the Azores, “Raul Brandão and the Azores” (from the Pico's Company), and I came across a book that although heuristically very competent (that is, by the survey of sources that promotes forgotten sources, this one vast morgue of ideas), however, proves to be analytically insufficient. Exhaustively presents the entire context of the reception of the unknown islands ”(1926) of Raul Brandão, both in the Azores and the continent. Identifies contemporary writers who also leaned over the Azores, distinguishing the supporters of the North Writer's detractors. However, it could have established further comparisons between Brandão and the other authors, even demonstrating how Brandão himself probably inspired by these other sources.
Rosa prefers to present the author as an absolute genius - I do not question him - devoid of influences, only generator of disciples. It would have been more enriching to situate his work in the context of a dialogue with other continental and island writers, abandoning the conception of an isolated book, an island. Paradoxically, despite all the evidence that Vasco Rosa presents, suggesting precisely that this is not a unique work in the literary landscape, this dimension remained by explore in his, despite everything, very useful book.
Macau has also been the subject of numerous travel reports, discovery with or without fascination, and everyone quotes, rewrite each other. This is how it works. The textual authorities are repeated, new appear, others disappear, but a lot is quote. Their names will be for the next chronic, but we may ask us why Brandão's beautiful volume would not work on the islands for knowing.</description><pubDate>2025-07-01 23:54:54</pubDate></item><item><title>“Art Macau” brings Picasso, Ia and History in exhibitions in the coming months</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/07/arte-macau-traz-picasso-ia-e-historia-em-exposicoes-nos-proximos-meses/</link><description>Picasso, digital and interactive art, or Bruno Moinard.

Also noteworthy is for the holding of physical and visual theater workshops in connection with the community, in a Somos initiative! - Portuguese Language Communication Association
 
September marks the arrival of an important Portuguese group linked to the circus arts and has been developing community connection projects in Lisbon for many years, receiving students and all people interested in their cultural offer.

This is the 39th collective creation of the company, and Chapitô was inspired, according to a note from Somos! - ACLP, "in life and historical events around Julius Caesar, exploring comedy as a language to reinvent history."
Julius Caesar was a Roman general and a state man. Member of the first triumvirate, led the Roman armies in conquering Gaul before defeating his political rival Pompey in the context of civil war. Self-proceedings later, he is a perpetual dictator of Rome, a position he did not occupy for a long time, murdered by a group of senators who considered him a threat to the Republic.
“Inspired by the popular imagination of the representations of Rome and the remarkable figure that it was Julius Caesar, exploring historical inconsistencies and taking freedoms in the treatment of documented facts - with the disregard that already characterizes the company of Chapitô - this is the deconsion of another historical monster, Julius Caesar,” says Somos! - ACLP on the show.
“If he was a tyrant who deserved to die or a hero brutally murdered by conspirators, come the devil and choose. Here there are no heroes or villains, there are circumstances and cunning people who do for life. There are also less cunning people who do what they send them. And virtuous people who do what has to be done.
Physical theater
In Chapitô, a project led by Maria Teresa Ricou, they are “faithful to the physical theater style”, where “actors use the body, movement and gesture to create characters and transmit emotions universally, allowing an accessible experience to different audiences”.

Horst patent at City of Dreams. “Horst: Style Photographer” is an “iconic fashion photography” exhibition held in conjunction with the prestigious Albert Museum London
 
It was born at the time when fashion was almost an art form, taking a long time to democratize and reach stores and people. This more classic side of fabrics and seams was certainly eternalized in the photograph by Horst P. Horst, which became one of the great fashion photographers and was born in 1906, named Horst Paul Albert Bohrmann. Horst, who died in 1999, left many full career images of a full career to photograph models, clothing and actresses, creating beauty imaginary that can now be seen closely in a display in the City of Dreams (COD), organized in conjunction with Albert Museum London.
The show is called “Horst: Style Photographer” [Horst: Photograph of Style] and was inaugurated this Wednesday, revealing the work of this photographer over 60 years.
Quoted by a COD statement, Duncan Forbes, director of photography of the London V&amp;A Museum, another of the partners in the organization of this exhibition, spoke on the eclectic side of the work of Horst P. Horst, and can be seen in this show.
“From the iconic covers of [magazine] Vogue to the impressive color impressions, Horst's work personifies timeless elegance - a celebration of beauty, posture and artistic accuracy. City of Dreams, with its rich fusion of fashion, design and contemporary art, perfectly reflects the spirit of Horst's work. Horst legacy with a new and demanding audience, ”he said.
The exhibition presents a selection of the most representative works of Horst's work, divided into five central themes: “High Couture”, “Surrealism”, “Color Fashion”, “Living with Style” and “Stage and Scree”. According to the same statement, it reveals the “serene elegance of the Parisian couture” and the “bold surrealist explorations”, not forgetting “the pioneering color photography to the vivid portraits of cinema icons”. All of this is up to an “exhibition that offers a rich and multidimensional view of the Horst artistic universe”.
Chinese photography
In addition, the public will be able to see a special section entitled “Tribute to Horst”, which features works by five influential Chinese photographers, namely Hai Feng, Nick Yang, Trunk Xu, Wu Zeng and Yuangui Mei.

The Cape Verde Internal Affairs Minister told Lusa that the government will give Macau Legend a "last opportunity", which promised "an alternative" for the beach-casino hotel on the beach.
"The entrepreneur has had several opportunities and has this last opportunity. He says he will have an alternative and the government is awaiting the presentation of this alternative, while the reversal process takes place" of the project, said Paulo Rocha in an interview with Lusa.
In November, the Cape Verde authorities began a reversal process of the Hotel Casino and other unfinished works of Macau Legend, at Santa Maria Island and Gamboa Sea Marítimo, in Praia City.
Paulo Rocha said that the Cape Verdean executive gave the company founded by David Chow Kam Fai 60 days to present a new proposal to conclude the project, but admitted not to know when this period "started to count".
"If it does not present, within the period that was given, the reversal process will be concluded and then the government will look for others, likely, any investors," said the minister, during a visit to Macao.
Stop everything
Currently, there are only guards at the venue, an area of ​​about 160,000 square meters, which includes the partially sparkled Santa Maria islet and, a paved bridge of a few meters that connects it to a building of about eight floors, empty and sealed with tails.
"The works have been stopped for a long time, have been halfway through there is no movement in that construction shipyard and the government intends to see it resolved. In one way or another," said Rocha.
The executive said in November that he gave Macao Legend "all opportunities to resume works or to negotiate the sale of actions or the assignment of his contractual position to a potential interested in continuing the project" but no alternatives were presented. "The project remains important, remains strategic for the city of Praia, for Cape Verde, and the government is interested in finding a solution," said the minister.
In 2015, David Chow signed an agreement for an investment of 250 million euros. After revisions, about six years ago, the conclusion of the first phase was scheduled for 2021. At the end of 2023, Macau Legend President Li Chu Kwan said the group intended to close the projects in Cape Verde and Cambodia by 2025.
On March 28, Macau Legend announced losses of $ 45.9 million from Hong Kong in 2024, in part due to the reversal of the beach hotel on the beach.
The operator reiterated that she was “taking the necessary measures to safeguard the group's interests (…), including exploring all available options to contest the decision” regarding the reversal process of the Cape Verdean Hotel Casino.
On the other hand, Macao Legend admitted to "significant doubts about the group's ability to continue in activity" due to total dollar $ 2.51 billion debts.</description><pubDate>2025-07-07 05:20:10</pubDate></item><item><title>Buses | More than 100 stops replaced by the end of the year</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/07/autocarros-mais-de-100-paragens-substituidas-ate-ao-fim-do-ano/</link><description>A replacement plan of 105 shelters in public bus stops in Macau is underway.

The body concerned is called the United Nations Committee for the peaceful uses of the outer space (Copuos) and held its 68th session in Vienna, Austria.
Xu Yi participated in the discussion of themes such as “Space and Water” and “Space and Sustainable Development”.
According to official information, “the participation of an academic of Macao in Copuos reflects the support of the central government to the scientific and technological development of mashes”, which demonstrates “the success” of the practice of “one country, two systems” in the territory. In turn, Xu Yi said that "the state laboratory will continue to contribute to Chinese spatial exploration, strengthening the role of Macao in the national scientific advance."
This State Laboratory was approved by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China, and was officially established in 2018. In turn, the State Lunar and Planetary Science Laboratory of the University of Science and Technology of Macau is the only Chinese national laboratory dedicated to astronomy and planetary sciences.
Its creation, according to the same official sources, "aligns with the spatial exploration strategy, promoting technological innovation in the great Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Bay and raising the scientific level of Macao." Currently, the laboratory has over 40 experts and a research team with over 200 members.
With history
Copuos was founded on the UN in 1959 and aims to “establish principles and regulations for the peaceful use of the outer space, to promote international cooperation in this area and study scientific and legal issues related to spatial exploration”, explains the same note, which also accounts for events held in the context of this meeting of Copuos.
It is "One Humanity, Infinite Frontiers" [a humanity, infinite borders], organized by China and that took place at the UN headquarters in Vienna, being an exhibition that celebrated the "20 years of the Chinese Lunar Exploration Program." Xu Yi participated in this event and shared “The Trajectory of the State Laboratory in supporting the Chinese National Space Agency”.</description><pubDate>2025-07-03 23:47:51</pubDate></item><item><title>Crime | Burlated woman in 113,000 dollars of hk</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/03/crime-mulher-burlada-em-113-mil-dolares-de-hk/</link><description>A woman was circumvented at 113,000 dollars of Hong Kong after being convinced to make an investment in a purchase application and sales sales. The case was revealed by the Chinese channel of Radio Macau, based on the information of the Judiciary Police (PJ).
According to the complaint filed, the victim joined an online conversation group about the purchase and sale of actions, so he decided to unload the application promoted in this group, by a person he met online. From May to complaining, the woman has transferred Hong Kong's $ 113,000 to the application and supposedly during this time she would make a profit of 30,000 Yuan.
However, a few days later, the application failed to show any records on previous investments. In addition, when he tried to contact her friend online who promoted the application, the victim realized that she had been blocked. Therefore, suspecting being deceived, the woman eventually filed a complaint.

In addition, about 153,000 people visited the facilities placed in four points of the city
 
The popularity of Pop Mart toys was used by the Macao government to stimulate tourism in the region. In the first phase of the “Pop Mart Macao Citywalk” project, which took place between June 6 and 28, “520,000 users of the six electronic wallets involved participated in 520,000 automatic draws, generated by commercial transactions in a total of 680 million Patacas,” said the Board of Tourism Services (STD). Among those drawn, about 59,000 Pop Mart -limited edition thematic awards were issued, the STD added.
The “large -scale cultural tourism project” results from a partnership between STD and the popular Chinese toy brand. Until September 21, places such as sidewalk of the São Lázaro church, Luís de Camões Square, Santo Agostinho Largo and Pai Kok da Taipa Street will be taken by facilities with the popular Baby Molly, Crybaby, Dimoo and Labubu characters.
According to the preliminary data advanced yesterday by STD, in the first three weeks of the initiative the facilities located in the four neighborhoods, and the base of the event installed in Largo do Senate, attracted about 153,000 visits, generating 620,000 consumer draws.
Gifts and social networks
As current times, vacation and leisure do not result in social networking publications is as if they do not exist. During the period under analysis, the authorities indicate that 11,500 shares were published on social networks “in exchange for limited edition thematic postcards at the points of the activity”. STD states even that due to the high look for the postcards frequently exhausted within the first hour of daily service.
The sharing of tourist photographs where pop Mart dolls are culminating the promotion work on social networks that STD has done before the project was opened, to which it was attended by “digital influencers” from the interior of China to create content, “including live broadcasts and publications with short images and videos”. In total, 190 publications were generated that helped “viralize” the theme “Pop Mart Macao Citywalk”, reaching more than 36 million online views.
To compete for the Chinese toy brand draw raffles, just make a purchase of more than 100 Patacas through Macau MPay, Alipay de Macao, Alipay from China, Alipay of Hong Kong, True Money from Thailand and Touch ‘N Go Ewallet Malaysia.</description><pubDate>2025-07-03 23:31:12</pubDate></item><item><title>Zelensky vs Zelensky</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/31/zelensky-vs-zelensky/</link><description>10/27/22
A renovated Ukrainian, with the same name of the president, guilty Zelensky about the extension of the conflict that destroyed his village. Zelensky, the village, who has never left his land, now lives mortified because his favorite gravedigger died in the bomber.
This Zelensky, the village, represents half the world that reproves the other Zelensky, the villain, for not wanting to negotiate with Putin.
Negotiate what? The invader enters us through the house, pies us the wife and daughter (cf. recent UN report on Ukraine violations in this “special operation”), an act that forced us to watch, and then we say: Alto there, we are for peace, but we have to negotiate: You have not said the name you want to give to children!
A peace that is not worthy is but a cessation of rights. As severe as Russophobia that Putin inflicts his people.

In a lunch with several guests I hear a friend, who declares himself a spiritist, explaining about the particularities of his belief, in a serene and balanced way, would even say, without "irrationalism". He discussed long and serenely, devoid of any fanatical proselytizing. “Here is someone to whom belief brought weighting!” I thought, a rare alliance.
However, at one point a phrase that horrify me. He says, “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!” And I enter the voracious fauces of holism. Because holismo has a pathological aspect like all good things, a side of shadow.
Two examples: In Hinduism there is less sensitivity to existential dramas, if that child suffers in this life this is only an expression of the strict karmic symmetry, an effect of the acts she committed in her previous life. In Africa it is not accepted that death may have been accidental, and many women are accused by the dead family of having caused her husband's death, in an act of manifest dementia, and, in the blatant majority of cases, in a huge injustice to his wife - madness that spreads and infiltrates the social fabric.
Buddhism has introduced compassion and Christianity to Caritas, trying to break with this logic, but in many other beliefs and religions the cage of causalities prevails over sensitivity to experience, the need to respond to the now.
It is a tremendous logic that transforms the world into a platonic stage, where we are just the shadows of something -an inextricable law -in a determinism that calcines all singularities, but strangely fascinates many.
The conquest of modernity has anchored in the conquest of chance and random, subtracting the incidences of a life to this fierce determinism that closed the world in a web. When the Renaissance freed the body from the influence of the stars, at this moment sexuality was relieved of guilt and individualism and their volition could emerge.
There is an unequivocal moral implication in the phrase “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!”, Which should work as a key to self-knowledge and self-judgment, but usually this phrase is managed to seek a reason for things abroad from us in the other. It is an alibi.
There is a holistic temptation in the world today, as in the Middle Ages there was a satanic temptation, without great reflection on its consequences. Because it is not enough we want to connect everything in a resonant chain of affection. Even the most unexpected: affection itself can kill.
I realize, thanks to this cultured, balanced, intelligent woman, that “the combat” moved at the beginning of this century. One of the great misconceptions of the twentieth century was the false dichotomy between "rationalism and irrationalism", a debate that extended to all fields, including art. First, rationality was confused (the positive side of reason) with rationalism (the pathological feature of reason), and articulated in this lack of discernment was confused irrationalism with freedom. Almost all the art of the twentieth century, with surrealism to the head, worked in this error. The fallacy still exists despite having consolidated the emergence of 'irrationalism' and the consequent relativist currents that followed it. Essentially much of what happened in the twentieth century, it turned around this shock between two paradigms: rationalism versus irrationalism.
Now, I see, the indetermination, chance, the random of the terrible temptation of the causal cage. Holism, in its pathological feature, can be the reductionism that is the way it puts the way as a new 'eschatological narrative'.
Is it "by chance" that the holism emerges at the moment when neo-liberalism and its cynical contempt for the human person besides all freedoms, all acquired rights?
Holistic consciousness has brought positively a greater ecological awareness but followed by scholastic rigor drifting reality under the blanket of a determinism that is much more than inconvenience: all great authoritarian ideologies are holistic.
My friend will know how to combine her holistic and transpersonal belief with the freedom and responsibility that every moment asks us - but how many will make the destruction, under a law that explains and encompasses everything?
How many will not be abandoned to what it is?
The awareness of the indeterminate brings tragic conscience, as the Greeks knew, but also brings the will and the courage of the decision. And of this we cannot abdicate.
In addition, as Drummond shows in Carlos Drummond de Andrade's poem “Quadrilha”:
"John loved Teresa who loved Raimundo/ who loved Maria who loved Joaquim who loved Lili/ who did not love anyone./ John went to the United States, Teresa to the convent,/ Raimundo died of disaster, Maria stayed to aunt,/ Joaquim suicide himself and Lili married J. Pinto Fernandes/ who had not entered the story."
Real always runs outside the track, in full exteriority to our concepts. This is what is worth a J. Pinto Fernandes at the exact moment we thought we had everything under control.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Nobel and others</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/17/do-nobel-e-outros/</link><description>9/10/22
Reading many people's reactions when the Nobel Prize in this year's literature was announced, I couldn't help but remind me of this repair of Jean-Pierre Siméon, in relation to another Nobel Prize: “An editor of a large national newspaper wrote five lines of indignation because the Nobel Prize for Literature, a complete stranger. But unknown to whom? How did not occur to this patented and paid literary columnist to do his work, that his apparent ignorance was a matter of incorrect professional conduct? Tranströmer was translated into many languages, it was available in French. »
There is always the choir of those who wait for the announcement of the prize to complain about not being invited to the jury of the prize, there is a subgroup of Irados that professes “never read and I will not bother to read”; It is an uncommon fauna, which inhabits social networks.
I don't always know all the winners-I was unaware of the existence of Louise Glück, who I find a great poet, or the Olga Tokarczuk, for example-but it only brings me the comfort of knowing that the world is not a soap opera where everyone knows each other and the joy of recognizing that the gauge of the world is not measured with my short measure and that on the contrary it gives me a new opportunity to face the unknown.
And perhaps the most cretin of reactions was the smart one who wrote, but there are still those who read French? Confirming only that today there is a new kind of ignorance that fires with a displeasure: the one who only read English.
I would also prefer that, in French, Pascal Quignard, Linda reads, or even Sollers, or, among the new ones, Mathias is awarded, but that does not take dignity to the work of Annie Ernaux (and it would be enough to have written the “Les Années”). There are books of her that I like less, like the vulgar "a simple passion," but this happens with almost every authors, they have a channel books and others that are like intervals in their itinerary. I advise reading a beautiful book of interviews with her, "L'Ecriture Comme un couteau".

Yesterday came an article in Maputo's morning “News”, realizing that the Pen Club narrative prize was assigned to my wife, Teresa Noronha, for her soap opera “Tornado”, which had already had the Maria Velho da Costa award.
The summary they made of the book does not even deserve comments, by pathetic, but what matters to highlight is the note of disqualification about their "Mozambicanity" by calling it Luso-Mozambican. It is not inaccurate, but for those who know the context, it is a dirty touch.
Because finally, following the same logic, Adelino Timóteo should be called Tsonga-Mozambican, to Álvaro Taruma-Mozambican, and Macua-Mozambican to the writers who are from the north, etc., etc. Which is not reported to happen.
At the beyond moment, in the soap opera, she writes:
«Our color has never been dominant. In colonial time we were not white, we were ripped from monories, gone mugs, the pejorative term to speak of a son of Goes and Portuguese. In the postcolonial period, I was not black and if, in Lisbon, they took me by Brazilian or Cape Verdean, already in France were lost in cogitations of where they would be and amazed when they found out it was African. There I had to explain my DNA's wanderings before relying on moorms. It took me a long time to accept that it was so because yes, and that it was no curse that were so; On the contrary, I could even discover intense patterns of fantasy and freedom in this shrewd cloak that is our genealogy… »
In the current Mozambique it is white… and this is overlapping it soon to what it does or what it is.
It is sad, but as Naipaul warned, through these stops the race is everything and is soaked in it as deeply as, elsewhere, in religion.

Bruno Latour, an anthropologist who studied the sciences and their procedures and legitimations, law, technique and religions died and entertained themselves to turn the guts to the dogmas of the “modern”. For him the place, the expert's function, was more defined by the perplexity he embodied than for the supposed truth he would support him.
He proposed, as an alternative to the kinds of multiculturalism and his mistaken password "all different all the same", the return to "diplomacy", given precisely, not from the presupposition that "we are unified because participants of the same nature" but simply reveal that we "do not yet share an ordinary world"; It is necessary to deal frontally with the "abyss of disagreement" that separates us, rather than wanting to delude it.
And about politics said, disassessedly:
«If transparency is required from the politician, we kill him; If one requires fidelity to what the other was or he says, kills him; If a mimetic relationship is required between what the crowd wants and what its representative says, the representation is killed. These must, therefore, by definition, betray, deceive, modify, distort the word. Without this ability to double the word and betray, political language would not exist. I put the perfectly plausible hypothesis that political vocabulary will become as inaccessible as the religious language of the last twenty, three or fifty years. (in “UN Monde Pluriel plus Commun”). I believe it will be missed to decipher this frantically complex world that fit us.</description><pubDate>2022-10-17 02:18:03</pubDate></item><item><title>The yo -yo</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/30/o-fuxi/</link><description>O my friends, companions of these funerals trips to countries as old as the stars and the moon, and as strange as the profound interior of our disgraceful souls, - that startle still awaits us, what secret spells we will have to overcome, what horrors will rise to our dilated pupils of amazement and terror?
Increasingly close to our precarious existences, howling the war monster, which threatens to merge humanity with the earth, incessantly traveled by the squalid spectrum of hunger and the invisible evil of ten thousand pests.
O human human, who cries superior to his own nature, but then reveals to you, once and again, unable to simply order your existence and do not understand that you are possessed by the fickle wrath and are slave to your own ambition! Do not be content with the white jade or the light gold, there is no treasure that gives you your inextinguishable thirst for other men, animals and things; for in you an eternal anguish in you; in you crawl the expelled snakes; For you grows, powerful and impossible, the very fertile ivy of evil!
This is perhaps why on the mound they call the white deer, where one of the eight immortals in sacred mount was evolved through the skies to Penglai, inhabits the fuxa, a bird whose form resembles that of the rooster, although topped by a human head. What strange copulas, what monstrous amplexes, what terrible procedures will have occurred to make the existence of this animal sinister possible? We do not know, but it is enough for our exhausted mind to dare to raise an answer, so we soon feel the skin traveled by horrendous goose bumps and the heart trigger in paraded, which wild horse beaten by the night whip of fear, oblivious to reins and containment.
May men refrain from going through the Mount of the deer, because although there are riches capable of calming the most misunderstanding ambitions, if they have the disgraced fortunate to glimpse a fuxa, it will be immediately triggered the cultivated fields, because it will be beheaded the soft animals, for it will be sacrificed the best young man and destroyed superb from countries.
Fuxi emits a sound that resembles its name.

«Every man morally is one and absolute; But you have to live with your personality to mitigate. (…) Coexistence is only possible among people reduced to a negative or hollow presence, which is constantly giving in. Hence, the emptiness of society, a huge ghost composed of numerous deceased. An upper man is antisocial or criminal. Its destination is jail and desert.
He is in thinking about whether she reflects here about the political-social conditioning that gagging, and worse, in a sad country as Portugal was in the middle of the Estado Novo (and the book is from 1931) where any possibilities of spontaneity and frankness in human relations were coarcet, or only lends the behavior of men (oppressed) a metaphysical frame, a “essence”, from a presumption of each one in the presumption of each one be in isolation “one and absolute”. Sometimes, to an excess of spirituality (or longing), it adds to Pascoaes to lack the world. He is a great poet, but he is a poet who takes gray-Jewish ampoules and is therefore written amiiude on a programmatic furor, ceasing to have pores; There is often a glass between him and the real, the same one who made him wring the Ballet, 1921: “Everything is ghost. There are only clouds, clouds of voices, clouds of souls, afflictions and tragedies! Clouds and more clouds, appearances and more appearances! It is a divine lightning that pierces them, the instant appearance that arises and throws us to the ground, dazzled! »
Sometimes I would like to remind him, as Antonio Sérgio did in the article “Regeneration and Tradition, Moral and Economy”, which dedicated to Easter: “Easter, Easter my dear friend: You are a pure, excellent and noble poet, but also a victim of this social environment, like us all: this horrible isolation that you praise and I”.
"As a child, he stole two melos," says Jacinto do Prado Coelho, stole him from a nest, and throb his lifetime remorse for it. The person, few more mischief is known to him. Only in Álvaro de Campos sprouts a twinge of evil and obscenity: “Oh, and ordinary and dirty people who always seem the same,/ who employs profanity as usual words,/ whose children steal at the grocery door/ and whose daughters at eight years-and I think this is beautiful and I love him! -/ masturbate decent -looking men on the stairs. » (Ode triumphal).
Both poets beaten by a certain idea of ​​holiness, they were identical to the inability of breaking the siege of the skin with the overflow of the dike, the same curse of sublimating Eros's concrete ferocity with the mansuity of the verses.
Of course, they are the two "Bigger Than Life", but sometimes unnerves to watch, from my hostor's post at the Procrastinators Club, to the tantrums between them, just to see who occupies, in the internal organization, the place of president and treasurer.
Although a person has guessed more, for example, this he wrote in the least known martial ode and that is declining in the situation we live today, differently, with the heart in his hands:
«Ode martial

In a statement about Dalai-Lama's succession plan, the Narendra Moder's Foreign Ministry of Government states that he will not take “any position” on issues of faith.
"The government of India does not take any position or pronouncement on issues related to beliefs and practices of faith and religion," said Ministry spokesman Randhir Jaiswal, in response to media questions about the recent announcement of the Tibetan spiritual leader.
The country "has always defended religious freedom to everyone in India and will continue to do so," he said. On Thursday, the Indian minister of minority affairs, Kiren Rijiju, told local media that the decision would be exclusively to the Buddhist leader.
"All those who follow Dalai-Lama believe that reincarnation must be decided according to the established conventions and Dalai-Lama's own wishes. No one else has the right to decide, except for him and the current conventions," said Rijiju.
China reiterated on Wednesday that Dalai-Lama's successor should be "approved by the central government."
"The reincarnation of great Buddhists, such as Dalai-Lama and Panchen Lama, should be determined by draw through the golden ballot box and later approved by the central government," said China's Ministry of Foreign Ministry spokesman Mao Ning.</description><pubDate>2025-07-07 05:42:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Japan ready for all scenarios on tariffs</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/07/japao-pronto-para-todos-os-cenarios-em-materia-de-tarifas/</link><description>Japanese Prime Minister Shigero Ishiba said on Sunday that the country is ready to “stay firm” and is prepared for all possible tariff scenarios that may result from commercial negotiations with the United States.
Speaking on the "Sunday News, The Prime" program of the Japanese television channel Fuji TV, the ruler stressed the determination of Tokyo in negotiating the application of null customs rights - Zero tariff - in the automotive industry sector. Shigeru Ishiba also recalled that Japan is the largest foreign direct investor in the United States and the largest job creator in the world's largest economy.
Japan's main commercial negotiator, Ryosi Akazawa, announced this Saturday that he maintained two telephone meetings with United States Secretary of Commerce, Howard Lutnick, to discuss customs rights, at a time of July 9 to impose the increase in rates by Washington.
Akazawa and Lutnick spoke for 45 minutes on Thursday and for about an hour on Saturday, reaffirmed their positions on United States customs rights and “proceeded to exchange in-depth points,” according to a statement from the Japanese government secretariat. The parties will continue to coordinate, it adds in the statement.
Written letters
The phone calls took place at a time when a 10 percent rate of Japan sales to the United States is expected to return to 24 percent on July 9, if the tariff agreement is not closed.
US President Donald Trump announced on Friday that he signed 12 letters, which will be sent this Monday to inform the commercial partners of the new customs of the United States about their exports to the US, which will begin to be applied next August 1st. Trump did not specify which countries will receive the letters.
In addition to the broader tariffs, as with other countries, Japan is also subject to a 25 percent rate on the importation of automobiles and automotive components by the US and a 50 percent rate on steel and aluminum.</description><pubDate>2025-07-07 05:40:59</pubDate></item><item><title>Brazil | Petrobras seeks Chinese investment</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/07/brasil-petrobras-procura-investimento-chines/</link><description>Petrobras' board of directors Magda Chambriard announced that Brazilian oil company is looking for Chinese investment to help improve her maritime transport and infrastructure.
A memorandum of understanding signed this Saturday together together the Chinese companies Cosco, Offshore Oil Engineering Co, China State Shipbuilding Co and China International Marine Containers Ltd., as well as Brazilian companies EBR, Rio Grande, Mauá, Enseada and Atlantic South.
The state -owned company Brazilian and its subsidiary of transpetro logistics will serve as anchors for potential technological and commercial partnerships.
"We would like the Chinese to be partners in shipyards here," Chambriard said at an event with Brazilian and Chinese executives held in Rio de Janeiro. "We expect the injection of Chinese capital."
In addition to the construction of five floating platforms of production, storage and discharge, which will be hired by 2030, Petrobras and Transpetro intend to order 52 new vessels by 2026.
The Brazilian Federal Government wants part of the fleet renewal program, worth 29 billion reais (4.54 billion euros), be invested in local shipyards, meeting the plans of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva to boost the transforming industry.
Brazil's naval construction industry has faced difficulties since the outbreak in 2014 of the corruption scandal known as Lava-Jato, which involved Petrobras.

The Cape Verde Internal Affairs Minister told Lusa Friday that Cape Verde wants to attract investment from China, who described as “one of the main partners” in the country's development since independence.
"We, right now, already have a Chinese community in Cape Verde, essentially of small and medium entrepreneurs," said Paulo Rocha in an interview with Lusa. The minister said the next target is “attracting more and better investment [Chinese] in different sectors” to diversify the economy of Cape Verde, much dependent on tourism.
The sea is a priority and the government “seeks partnerships” to implement the Special Maritime Economic Zone of São Vicente, whose study was done with the support of China, recalled Rocha during a passage through Macao.
Also in Macau, in March, the president of the Cape Verdean agency for foreign investment, José Almada Dias, challenged the Chinese state company Shaanxi Construction to take advantage of the 20,000 hectares that the country has put in the tourism service.
Paulo Rocha said it would be "perfectly realistic" Cape Verde want to attract tourists from China and other Asian countries, underlining the strong presence of Chinese visitors in Europe and "even further".
"We continue to foster investments in this domain, grow the number of hotels under construction, the number of resorts, particularly in the two most touristy islands, Sal and Boavista," said the minister.
Rocha argued that China is, “undoubtedly a reliable partner” from Cape Verde and that it has been “essential in the development process in different sectors” over the 50 years of independence.
Works and More Works
Cape Verde has benefited from multiple debt perhaps from China - namely about 1.18 million euros in 2007 and another euros in 2016. In recent decades, China has consolidated its presence in Cape Verde through investments in public works, including the National Stadium and the new headquarters of the National Assembly.
"In the coming months, we will inaugurate an important maternity hospital on the island of São Vicente, made with the support of the China government, structuring" for the entire region of the Well, "defended the minister.
Cooperation extends to the area of ​​education, with more than a dozen scholarships annually by the Chinese government. Since 2010, hundreds of Cape Verdean students have attended higher education institutions in China.
Some ended up being Chinese lands, including in Macao, and became “true diplomats of the (…) country, besides what is official diplomacy,” praised Rocha. The Cape Verdean diaspora is a huge reserve “in terms of human capital” and “contributes much more than with the remittances, [by] investing in the productive sector of the country,” the minister added.</description><pubDate>2025-07-07 05:30:27</pubDate></item><item><title>Tariffs | Beijing evaluates the USA-VIETNAME Pact and promises to protect your interests</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/03/tarifas-pequim-avalia-pacto-eua-vietname-e-promete-proteger-os-seus-interesses/</link><description>The China Ministry of Commerce yesterday expressed “firm opposition to any trade agreement achieved at the expense of China's interests,” reacting to the announced pact between the United States and Vietnam, and admitted to adopting contracted.

During a meeting held on Wednesday in Brussels, with the head of European Union diplomacy, Kaja Kallas, Wang Yi argued that China and the EU “should not be seen as opponents for their differences, nor seek confrontation due to their disagreements,” according to a statement released yesterday by his ministry.
The day before, Kallas argued that Beijing should no longer threaten European security, pointing out alleged cybers, interference in democratic processes and unfair business practices. "Europe faces several challenges," said Wang Yi, adding that none of them, "in the past, present or future," was caused by China.
Alternative via
Chinese diplomacy head sought to introduce his country as a counterweight to Donald Trump's administration, which threatened to impose widespread tariffs on European imports. “The path followed by the United States should not be used as a mirror of China,” said Wang. "China is not the United States," he said.
According to the statement of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, both sides also addressed international issues such as the War in Ukraine, the Israelo-Palestinian conflict and the Iran's nuclear program.
Beijing and Brussels should act based on “mutual respect,” defended Wang Yi, appealing to a more “active and pragmatic” European policy in relation to China. Wang also met on Wednesday with the President of the European Commission, Ursula Von Der Leyen, and Belgian Foreign Minister Maxime Prevot.
Wang told both parts that China and EU should “defend multilateralism and free trade” and cooperate over global challenges such as climate change. The Chinese diplomat now goes to Germany and then to France, where he will meet with French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot, who visited China in March.
These visits precede the China - EU Cimeira, which will bring together in Beijing Chinese President Xi Jinping and several senior European responsible.</description><pubDate>2025-07-03 23:40:11</pubDate></item><item><title>USA / China | Closed agreement that provides for rare land and chip design software</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/03/eua-china-fechado-acordo-que-preve-envio-de-terras-raras-e-de-software-de-design-de-chips/</link><description>The two nations resumed the path of understanding last month in Geneva
 
United States and China formalized a commercial understanding reached last month in Geneva, which includes Beijing's commitment to resume rare land exports, US Secretary of Trade, Howard Lutnick said.
According to Lutnick, the agreement was signed two days ago and consecrates the terms negotiated between Washington and Beijing throughout this year after successive mutual accusations of violation of previous agreements. "They will give us rare lands and, when they do, we will raise our contracted," he said in an interview with Bloomberg.
Siemens AG, one of the world's leading semiconductor design software suppliers, has been released by the United States Department of Commerce from the need to request licenses to operate in the Chinese market, according to the German company in a statement.
Export restrictions had been imposed in May, as part of a package of measures adopted by the United States in response to Chinese limitations on rare land exports.
Siemens has confirmed that it has restored full access to its software and technology for Chinese customers. The other two main world companies in the Electronic Design Automation Software sector (EDA) - Cadence Design Systems Inc. and Synopsys Inc. - They have not yet responded to commenting on whether they received similar communications, according to Bloomberg news agency. The United States Department of Trade has not commented either, the agency added.
The rare lands are crucial materials used in the production of wind turbines, aircraft, semiconductors and advanced technology. Under the commercial agreement last week, Washington has committed to authorizing the shipping to China's chip software, ethane and jet engines, as long as Beijing meets the promise of accelerating the approval of critical mineral exports.
An White House official confirmed that the two countries agreed with the terms necessary to apply the Geneva Agreement. The China Embassy in Washington refused to comment, while the Chinese Foreign Ministry did not respond immediately.
Markets applaud
The signing of the agreement generated optimism in the markets: Asian shareholders and future Europeans have advanced, and a global stock index has reached a new historical maximum.
Lutnick indicated that US President Donald Trump intends to conclude, until July 9, a series of ten commercial agreements with the main US partners. "We will close the ten main agreements, organize them by categories, and the other countries will align after that," he explained.
Although he did not specify which countries involved, Trump suggested yesterday that the US is close to an understanding with India. The main Japanese negotiator, Ryosi Akazawa, also has scheduled meetings in the US capital, and reiterated that Japan "cannot accept" 25 percent tariffs on cars.
Trump has already stated that, in the absence of agreements until July 9, he will send "letters" to each country with the proposed terms, applying unilateral tariffs - the so -called "reciprocal tariffs", which may reach up to 50 percent. Most of these measures were announced on April 2, but suspended for 90 days to allow negotiations.
The actual scope of the agreements remains uncertain, as commercial pacts usually require years of negotiations. An earlier agreement with the UK, for example, continues with pending issues, including tariffs on imported metals.
Out
The agreement now reached with China does not address more sensitive topics, such as fentanyl trafficking or full access to US companies to the Chinese market.
The first round of negotiations in Geneva resulted in a rate reduction by both parties, but was quickly followed by mutual accusations of non -compliance. After new talks in London this month, negotiators announced an understanding, subject to the approval of Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping.
According to Lutnick, the survey of US counterfeit depends on the effective arrival of the rare land. This week, the US Department of Commerce has already authorized ethane loading to China, although its landing remains conditioned on specific authorization.</description><pubDate>2025-07-03 23:39:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Timor-Leste | PR IMPACORA Ambassador of Portugal</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/03/timor-leste-pr-condecora-embaixadora-de-portugal/</link><description>The president of Timor-Leste, José Ramos-Horta, yesterday awarded the necklace of the Order of Timor-Leste the Portuguese Ambassador in Dili, Manuela Bairos, and the European Union ambassador, Marc Friedrich, who will cease duties in the country.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) said yesterday that it provides 3.9 percent economic growth for this year in Timor-Leste and insisted that the government should give priority to quality expenses in infrastructure, health and education sectors.
"Growth is expected to remain robust, being 3.9 percent by 2025, supported by tax expansion and strong credit growth, predicting a slowdown to 3.3 percent in 2026," Carrière-Swallow said, who led the IMF team, which ended a visit to the country yesterday.
The team arrived in the country on June 19 to make discussions under Article IV of 2025. "Inflation, which had fallen sharply last year due to the descent of global food and energy prices, should moderately increase by rising international food prices," said Carrière-Swallow. The IMF predicts that inflation is 0.9 percent this year and increases to 1.8 percent by 2026.
The financial organization, which held meetings with the Timorese authorities, private sector, development partners and civil society, also considers that the state budget for 2026 should give priority to “quality expenses in the areas of physical infrastructure and human capital, including health and education, while controlling recurring spending”.
"The government is rightly centered on the identification of measures to contain the public sector wage, which has grown sharply in recent years, and the implementation of an added value tax (VAT) from January 2027," says Carrière-Swallow.
Reform, it takes
The IMF recommends structural and budgetary reforms for 10 years to allow the Timorese government to support the development of the private sector through the gradual reduction of budgetary deficits to preserve debt sustainability.
"By 2026, the reforms we propose would be compatible with an expense envelope of about $ 1.85 billion to the central government," read the statement. In the statement, the IMF congratulates the government for “continuous progress in the reforms of the financial sector” at the level of legislation, “whose implementation will support the development of the private sector”.
"We also recommend accelerating the issuance of ownership securities and establishing a national digital identification system, crucial reforms to improve access to credit, diversify the private sector and increase the efficiency of public spending," adds the IMF.

Expense
The Timorese government set this week the expense for the state's general budget of 2026 by $ 1.85 billion, a significant reduction in 2025. At the end of last year, the Timorese Parliament approved the state's general budget proposal to 2025 worth $ 2.6 billion.
Predictions of the Timorese government point to an economic growth of 2.7 percent by 2026 and 4.3 percent for this year. Regarding inflation, the Ministry of Finance predictions indicate that the descending trajectory will continue in 2025, and it is expected to reach 1.8 percent, and to stabilize at 2 percent over the next five years.</description><pubDate>2025-07-03 01:41:30</pubDate></item><item><title>Anabela Santiago, Academic: “China is a reformist and moderate”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/30/anabela-santiago-academica-a-china-e-reformista-e-moderada/</link><description>Anabela Santiago has just defended at the University of Aveiro the doctoral thesis that analyzes how China has been positioned in recent decades as an important actor in the “global health governance”. Today, Beijing seeks “alternative mechanisms” of cooperation in the “global south” and tries to build an alternative model to the World Health Organization
 
 
Let's start with the concept of Global Health Governance (GGS). Is this a more contemporary concept or relating to the post-war period and the Foundation of the World Health Organization (WHO)? What have been the main actors of this governance until China's growth?
GGS is a concept whose prominence and relevance have grown significantly in the 21st century, largely driven by economic globalization and worldwide interconnection. Although global health has always transcended national borders, demanding multidisciplinary approaches and international cooperation, only from the 1990s it was made greater awareness of it. Historically, GGS has been predominantly influenced by western powers and neoliberal values. The main actors of this governance, until China's growth, were historically marked by interventions of entities such as WHO and non-governmental, predominantly American and European organizations.
One of the findings of its doctoral thesis is that China has been progressively positioning itself in this leadership. This position started specifically when and why?
Yes, China has been progressively positioned as a relief actor in the evolution of the GG system. Although it is not possible to point out an exact date of start, China has evolved from a relatively isolated country to a main actor in global political, economic and technological arenas. Its growing economic and political influence also represents a change in GGS's historical dynamics, and in the 1960s China tried to play a humanitarian health care role in neighboring countries and Africa. The thesis points out that China's experience can be seen as an example of what is achievable when a state chooses its own way rather than a pre-established model, aligning itself with the 21st century prediction as the "century of Asia."
Did the pandemic years influence this position? How?
Covid-19 pandemic highlighted the need for global health cooperation, as well as the potential consequences of the failure to prioritize global health. The thesis explores the evolution of the Health Silk Route before and after the pandemic, indicating that the pandemic years allowed greater awareness of the need for instruments such as the Health Silk Route as the most effective cooperation platforms among nations. Although not detailed in this specific section, it is implicit that the pandemic intensified China's performance in health diplomacy and health development assistance.
Looking at the internal reforms that China has carried out in the health area, which highlights as the most important?
I approach, in the thesis, the reforms of the China Health System and I point out that the Chinese governance model is a unique combination of state -oriented economic reforms and development by the state, incorporating elements of neoliberalism and authoritarianism into political issues in general, and the health sector is nothing different from the rest. One of China's mentioned contributions, recognized by WHO, is its primary health care model based on the recognized good practice of “barefoot doctors” (barefoot doctors). In addition, the thesis analyzes the main reform policies and their progress and challenges in the period 2009-2018, which comprise the reforms of primary health care, hospital and pharmaceutical reform. The “Healthy China 2030” program is also an important and ambitious reference of China's domestic reforms in health, also encompassing social determinants.
Is Beijing's intention to create an alternative entity to WHO, or simply create an alternative movement that can coexist with WHO, in the context of the relationship with the global south? How could this work?
The thesis suggests that China adopts a "dual approach": while integrating in existing global structures, forging simultaneously alternative paths, particularly through regional alliances such as BRICS and partnerships with Global South. This indicates an intention to create an alternative movement that can coexist and complement the role of WHO, rather than a direct alternative entity. China demonstrates a clear commitment to align the objectives of the “Belt and Road” initiative with the united nations sustainable development objectives, showing their willingness to present these initiatives as complements to the existing cooperation mechanisms in the international liberal order. President Xi Jinping's view of a “future community shared for humanity”, which includes the notion of a “global health community for all”, also points to a new perspective in international cooperation.
Traditional Chinese Masks, Vaccines and Medicine (MTC): What are China's products or instruments to position itself as an increasingly global actor in GGS?
The thesis points out that China is an indispensable provider of global public health, essential for the product supply chain, such as masks and vaccines. The MTC is also mentioned as one of China's great contributions to global health governance, with its chinese herbal treatments, some of which already recognized by WHO in 2017. In addition, Chinese medical assistance and medical teams sent to other regions of the globe are important instruments of Chinese health diplomacy.
In creating an alternative movement or reality to WHO, China may be taking advantage of the lack of full representativeness in the same WHO, or gaps in its operation?
The thesis does not address directly whether China is taking advantage of a lack of full representativeness in WHO or gaps in its operation. However, it emphasizes that the work aims to fill a gap in scientific knowledge in relation to the paradigm of health governance from a non-western and liberal perspective, emphasizing China as an actor of the global south. This suggests that China seeks to strengthen alternative models that can offer more personalized health challenges, different from those defended by Western countries, positioning itself as a moderate reformist actor.
How has the European Union (EU) foreign policy in relation to China affecting or influenced this position of the country in global health governance?
In the thesis, the fourth publication, entitled "Challenges on the European Union-China Cooperation in Higher Education from" People-To-People Dialogue ’Perspective: The Case of Health-Related Joint Projects," explores cooperation in higher education, in particular that includes health-related projects. Therefore, despite the strategic and economic dialogue, the deterioration of UE-china bilateral relations intensified, with the commission to assume a decline of enthusiasm due to “China's countermeasures to EU human rights sanctions, economic coercion and commercial measures against the single market, and the positioning of China in the war in Ukraine”. Although challenges and tensions are recognized, cooperation in higher education, including health projects, is seen as part of a broader picture of strategic partnership between EU and China. However, it is evident that there is no long tradition of health cooperation between EU and China in higher education, and that there are few joint projects compared to the general panorama. It is suggested that both EU and China should make more efforts to align medical study curricula and promote more joint research in areas related to health, infectious diseases, among others.
In the Trump 2.0 era, and without pandemic, what could be China's role in global health governance?
Although the thesis is published this year, it focuses on the preceding period and includes the pandemic, where it does not speculate directly on a future scenario of “Trump 2.0” without pandemic. However, the thesis argues that China is not just a participant, but a moderate reformist force in the formation of global health standards. Regardless of future political scenarios, their growing economic and political influence, strategic health diplomacy, internal reforms and initiatives such as the Health Silk Route will continue to shape their role in global health governance. The view of a “global health community for all” also remains a guiding principle for China's efforts.
Does this power of China in GGS verify more with bilateral or multilateral agreements?
The thesis suggests that China's power in global health governance manifests itself through both bilateral and multilateral agreements, but with a growing emphasis on certain forms of cooperation that strengthen their role in the global south and through alternative mechanisms. Although the thesis does not explicitly quantify the predominance between bilateral and multilateral, the focus on regional alliances (BRICS) and partnerships with the Global South (which often involve bilateral agreements and group cooperation initiatives) and the Health Silk Route indicate a hybrid approach.</description><pubDate>2025-06-30 23:46:26</pubDate></item><item><title>Macao Forum | Secretary-General says it has never discussed widening to Hispanic countries</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/30/forum-macau-secretario-geral-diz-que-nunca-se-discutiu-alargamento/</link><description>In an interview with Lusa agency, the secretary general of the Macau Forum, Ji Xianzheng, assured that “never discussed” the widening of action to Hispanic countries, but that the willingness already stated by the government of Sam Hou Fai will have to be the authorities to decide a new direction to the cooperation strategy
 
The Secretary-General of the Macau Forum stated that the institution “never discussed” the creation of an entity to extend to Hispanic countries to promote economic cooperation similar to those that provide the connection between China and Portuguese-speaking countries.
“Within the Macao Forum, we have never discussed this topic,” said the Forum Secretary-General for Economic and Commercial Cooperation between China and Portuguese-speaking countries Ji Xianzheng.
The official acknowledged that, "in society, there were some conversations to discuss or address the possibility of promoting more contact and cooperation with Spanish -language countries, but at the Forum level we have never addressed this theme."
The Macao executive announced in mid -April the intention of creating a center to promote economic services between China and the Portuguese and Spanish languages ​​in the neighboring special Economic Zone of Hengqin.
The idea is to provide companies in Hispanic countries services in the “linguistic, legal, fiscal, verification of compliance with norms, formation, arbitration and mediation”, according to the Secretary for Administration and Justice, André Cheong.
Days earlier, the chief executive, Sam Hou Fai, had also announced the intention of “promoting exchange and cooperation” through Macao between China and the universe of Spanish -speaking countries.
Although Macau wants to widen focus to Castilian -speaking countries, “the forum will remain the forum for China and Lusophony countries,” said Ji Xianzheng. The secretary general clarified that the institution that directs "can contribute contributions to the greater opening of Macao in international cooperation", as is the intention announced by the new government of MSAR.
Complementary forum
Personally, the secretary general has ensured that he had “pleasing to work with all parties,” but stressed that this is a “decision that is up to central governments to make” and that the forum was never contacted in this regard.
"Yes, I worked in Latin America, Spain, nine years in Madrid and Caracas. But this is not a decision of personal interest, it is up to politicians to make the decision," he said, explaining that the idea will be to promote the relationship between Macao and Brazil and then to other Latin American countries, as well as expanding the relationship with Portugal to Spain.
"There is no limit. The Macao Forum is complementary. It does not restrict any promotion of the cooperation of the other parts," he said.
According to the Macao Government Communication Office, Sam Hou Fai admitted on June 21 that he postponed a trip to Portugal, scheduled for July, and should also pass through Spain and the European Union headquarters in Brussels.
Bad interpretations
In the same interview with Lusa, the Secretary-General of the Macao Forum imputed to national governments the responsibility for conducting development and economic cooperation policies, stressing that the institution “has no investment projects”.
Ji Xianzheng attributes criticism to the Macao Forum to an wrong interpretation regarding the body's mission. "The forum is a mechanism of cooperation between central governments. Many people think it is to the secretariat that it is up to the execution of policies, but we have a limited number of people," added Ji.
"The secretariat has no investment projects, it is a mechanism for preparing the ministerial conference, connecting with governments, not a promotion agency. It has not been thought of, connects with the promotion agencies. We are four people sent by China and one delegate for each country," he said.
At the last ministerial conference, in April 2024, then Portuguese Economy Minister Pedro Reis argued that the Portuguese Language China-Parais Cooperation and Development Fund should bet more on small and medium enterprises (SMEs).
The Cooperation Fund was created in 2013 by the China Development Bank and the Macao Industrial and Commercial Development Fund, with a thousand million dollars, of which about 60 percent have already been invested, according to the secretary general.
Action plans
Ji Xianzheng has admitted that SMEs are "a difficult theme for any government" and that "international cooperation for the promotion of development and cooperation of small and medium enterprises is even more difficult. It is a topic that is being debated daily worldwide." But admitted, "here, little."
"But it is stipulated in the action plan [2024-2026]. It is up to central governments and commerce chambers, promotion agents, to work together to do this. The secretariat assumes responsibility as authorized by the central governments, specifically, in the activities program," he said.
Politicians from various countries, including Portugal, Angola and Mozambique, have appealed to a change in the rules of the fund's candidacy. Current rules require, for example, that candidate projects have a minimum investment of five million dollars, and the fund only covers 20 percent of total investment, referring the rest to governments or companies.
Ji Xianzheng said the new direction of the fund "is committed to promoting a broader investment, with better coverage for all forum countries, [relatively] to projects that have a strategic or significant impact on the socioeconomic development of participating countries."
According to the secretary general, "the terms of application [of the rules of access to the background] will be more flexible and the forms of application will also be more diverse." “Instead of being just direct investment, they are also studying ways to apply the fund, in cooperation with other funds or with other financial institutions,” he gave as an example.
"This fund has an operation according to market rules. It is not a humanitarian aid fund. Therefore, it has to guarantee the minimum return of benefit. But, on that, they are very open to study, in this case, the conditions of each project," added Ji Xianzheng, but to give examples of "flexibilization of the rules."
Regarding the approximation of the China universe and countries of the Iberian Peninsula, already cemented in official speeches, economist Maria Fernanda Ilhéu, president of the Seda's New Route Association, told HM, earlier this month, that this intention is “very objective and pragmatic and can be summarized to the Macao economy diversification project, for which companies and investors are not only in Macao, but also from Macao, but also from Macao, but also from countries, but countries Portuguese Language ”.
"But the fact is that companies and institutions from Portuguese-speaking countries are not being effective in responding to this need for Macao. Therefore, widening companies and Spanish-speaking institutions this invitation to cooperation seems logical to me," the economist said.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Isabel Rio Novo, author of the biography of Luís de Camões: “Time in Macau was of tranquility”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/26/isabel-rio-novo-autora-da-biografia-de-luis-de-camoes-tempo-em-macau-foi-de-tranquilidade/</link><description>It will be launched tomorrow, at the Consulate General of Portugal in Macau and Hong Kong, the biography of Luís de Camões, by Isabel Rio Novo.

Why did you decide to get in the writing of another biography of Camões?
It is true that Luis Vaz de Camões has been biographed many times over 500 years. However, 50 years ago there was no biography about him. From my point of view and the editor, Camões deserved a more current biography that revised all kinds of prejudices, seeking known sources, the uncovered information research and where the rereading of all previous works were rereading. This biography is not only a summary, but also the reinterpretation of what has been known, but which had rarely been related. The book also brings some new data with some documentation that was discovered.
How was your relationship with the writing of Camões born?
I fell in love and went to those young readers who was not tormented with Camões. On the contrary, I liked it soon and let myself be seduced by Camões Lyric. I am from the areas of comparative literature and history, and in this sense I always understood the dimension and importance of the work of Camões.
And what are they?
It is a work and an author of its time and its time, which was extraordinary, with the Renaissance, Humanism and the travels of navigation. But at the same time, it is a work that is the product of an outstanding literary genius, one that we can tell a handful in the history of universal literature.
What camões we find in this biography?
I tried to go to the bottom, remove layers of the meaning that these 500 years were adding to Camões, in the sense that each season read its Camões and produced its interpretation. I wanted to discover the substrate, the man of flesh and bone he lived and wrote 500 years ago.
He was a man suffered, with many financial difficulties.
He was a man with a complex and difficult relationship with reality, not only of his time, but also with reality [itself]. The theme of the time, the disconcerting of the world, how society seems to work instead of what should work, being a literary topic of the Renaissance, it was something Camões felt personal and genuinely.
How?
He lived a series of disagreements, of extreme experiences. Suffice it to say that you have been stuck several times and for various reasons. He made great trips at a time when these were absolutely risky, long, and complicated enterprises. Camões was involved in military expeditions, and almost all his life was soldered. But this set of experiences allowed him to be almost everything someone could be at the time he lived.
He was one of the most traveled authors of the time, having been in Brazil, Goa…
Yes. Even the connection to Macau, which is contested by some scholars, but not by me… I am persuaded, given the existing documentation and indirect testimonies, which Camões passed through China with the position of Dead and Missing Provider. When this happened, albeit very incipiently, the Portuguese establishment in China, which was already Macao. It is not known whether Camões held this position assigned to him by Viceroy D. Francisco Coutinho, if he was exactly assigned to be a provider during the trip, or a provider at Macao's establishment. But what he knew from China was surely this little warehouse that Portugal had achieved, at a lot of cost, with great difficulty and after many attempts to obtain in China.
What did a deceased provider?
Whenever a Portuguese died in the East, a soldier or merchant, it was necessary to ensure the rights of the heirs, the families who were normally in Portugal. The provider had to identify the deceased, his naturalness, origin and make the heirs known. He also had to keep the deceased's assets before they were stolen, auction them, keep the coins that would result in, and then take it all to Lisbon. It was a process that, if it went well, took many months, because it was necessary to send this money to the authorities of Goa who later sent him in the career from India to Lisbon.
Can we talk about a period of stability in Camões's life in Macau?
Yes. Until this appointment as a deceased provider, everything Camões knew from the East had been as a soldier. As soon as Goa [1553] arrives weeks later in a first military expedition. We know why: Not because I had some war appeal, but because only participating in expeditions earned your welding. Although everyone said that the soldiers lived very poorly, the welding was what Camões had to survive. The time lived in Macao, when he was free from soldier obligations, was a time of tranquility regarding subsistence, which was assured. He had some time and calm to continue the work with "the Lusíadas." More than that, as much as the sources allow to deduce, Camões met in Macau a phase of balance in terms of personal and loving life, as, on the return trip, he brought with him, according to the testimony of Diogo do Couto, a Chinese girl.
Dinamene.
This was the term used by the chronicler. We don't know if it would be a Chinese or Asian girl. This girl with whom Camões lived maritally was someone who liked it very much, according to the testimony of Diogo do Couto. But Dinamene would certainly not be her name, as it was a mythological name that, by the way, Camões used in her lyric, even before she boarded the East. Chinese girls with whom soldiers and merchants in Macao lived amanced were baptized and received a Christian name. Therefore, Dinamene would even have a Christian and Portuguese name. But as we do not know her name, and if we are aware that we use a kind of metaphor, we can call it Dinamene.
She dies later on a trip and makes Camões very shaken.
On Macao's return trip to Goa, probably at the end of his mandate as a provider, Camões suffers the celebrated wreck, in which he loses the personal assets he had ease, including the assets of the deceased that he was guardian, and this will bring him complications. It also suffers the loss of dynamine. The wreck went with some in the seas of China, probably by the mouth of the Mekong River.
Considers unlikely to have lost part of "the Lusíadas."
The first biographers say Camões was saved from this wreck with a board. It is not unreasonable that he managed to save the manuscript of the Lusíadas on this board. But it is also no excluding that Camões knew his poem by heart. The memory of people in the sixteenth century was different. They were very used to keeping things from memory. And we know, because the proof is obtained in the work of Camões, that it had an extraordinary memory. I have a way to prove it, of course, that Camões is one of the rare authors who knew his poem by heart.
Do you think Camões had a lower life to his true talent?
Undoubtedly. According to a too extensive set of concordant testimonies, he dies poor, even in miserable conditions, and according to an eyewitness, without having a blanket with which he covered himself. On the other hand, Camões was known to follow the publication of the Lusíadas, who were commented and read [in the poet's life time]. We have the testimony of Faria de Sousa, one of the first biographers of Camões, which says that when he passed the streets, people stop and pointed. Camões also had a figure that stood out, with a leaked eye and using a pale. By then, I would be quite sick, using crutches. But there is a set of poets, which is very unreliable that they did not know Camões, who never refer to them. There are, on the other hand, other humanists, such as Pedro Magalhães Gândavo, who from the outset praises him as the prince of Portuguese poets.
But the king gives him a tendency for deeds provided and the publication of "The Lusíadas."
This famous tendency, which should not be a big deal, because all ancient biographers say it was derisive, is attributed to him as a kind of military reform, because of the 17 years of service in the East, and not as a reward for the publication of "The Lusíadas." D. Sebastião's mercy letter, which attributes him the title of nobleman knight, had no repercussion in practice, but gave him 15 thousand reais. [The publication of “the Lusíadas”] was an additional argument [for the letter] and not the main argument. This leads us to believe that D. Sebastião will not even have read or heard “the Lusíadas”, will have received indirect information, favorable about the poem.
How did the process of editing “Os Lusíadas” occurred?
It was an event, because both the press and the books that were published a year were a very small amount. In the year in which “the Lusíadas” are published were the only work of non -religious caress [to be edited]. To fund the edition, it is more than likely that Camões had the support of a patron, probably D. Manuel de Portugal, from the Condes do Vimioso family. Getting the work was a press was a mere and complicated process, as it had to go through the prior examination of the civil authorities, the royal authority and the censorship of the Inquisition. The resident of the Holy Office does not only let the book pass, but to make an amount of almost unprecedented compliments in the license that authorizes the publication of the work. If we go to the opinions emitted by the same rear, there is no other work on which he is as compliments as it was with the epic of Camões.
In Indonesia, he befriended a slave on the island of Java.
Camões was, at least once, on the island of Ternate, Indonesia, in the archipelago of molucas, at a time when there were conflicts motivated by an extremely cruel Portuguese captain towards the king or sultan of Ternate, which originated a kind of war between the Portuguese and the places. Camões has a song that describes the island of Ternate. We do not know if it was at this time, or in another passage to the Far East, that Camões turned on to a Jaú, or Javanese, but could not be exactly from the Far East, but a freed slave who had been linked by friendship to Camões. And this is because in one of the first biographies of Camões it reads that Jaú, with the Christian name António, asked for alms at night. This freedom of movements of a slave indicates that he would probably be a freed slave. He asked for alms to Camões, for himself and the mother of Camões, with whom Camões will have lived in recent years of life.</description><pubDate>2025-06-26 23:30:50</pubDate></item><item><title>Filipe de Saavedra, Teacher: “A Camões Interpretative Center in Macau is missing”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/21/filipe-de-saavedra-docente-falta-um-centro-interpretativo-de-camoes-em-macau/</link><description>Professor at the University of Science and Technology of Macao and a scholar of the presence of Camões in Asia, Philip de Saavedra understands that Macau is missing an interpretative center about the poet's life and work. The academic spoke yesterday at the National Library in Lisbon, about the correspondence written by Luís de Camões in Asia
 
He participated yesterday at the “from Lisbon to Goa: What the Letters of Camões” participated. What path does the East arise portrayed in these letters, and who were directed?
The letters Camões wrote from Asia are in the order of the dozens. There is in them scholarship, philosophy, and also a lot of humor, sarcasm, and satire of humanist nature. Some were written from Ternate, others from Malaca, Macau, probably others from Cambodia, to recipients in India and Portugal. With the exception of the letters of Goa, where the identification of the writing site is generally present, maping those that were written during the rest of it would be a complex task. They are only given as written in Asia.
Can you give examples of written letters in this context?
I mention here two of the first he sent to the kingdom. The epistle whose first line is “The Poet Simony speaking” was written in January 1554, when Camões has just arrived in Goa, destined for his pupil, D. António de Noronha. It is a very emotional letter, giving it the storm that had plagued the Armada in the Cape of Good Hope, "seeing the death of the before me." Camões survived this limit experience aboard the São Bento ship, the only one to arrive that year to Goa, and which was lost in the turn of the Christmas lands, dying in this second bid the Captain Fernão de Álvares Cabral, and many of those who traveled with him. In addition to the news of his salvation, the poet was equally eager to tell his friend the expedition of D. Afonso de Noronha to Malabar, in which he had taken part in the previous month. In Irenal pages, Camões vehemently condemns the massacre of the few native troops by the “thick armed” of the disproportionate vice-king army. In his radical compliment of peace, the poet calls "true remedy" to the early death that cure the war crazes of those who want to live "by knights", for "who will walk by following the fero Mars always brings their eyes to their danger." Cruelly prophetic words: by irony of fate, at the moment the poet wrote these lines and sent them, that recipient diletus, for whose life he feared, already lay, lying during a military foray in Ceuta on April 29, 1553, only 17 years old.
And the second letter?
A year later, in January 1555, he wrote to a friend a different epistle in tone and in purpose, whose first line is "I wished so much", where he evoked the shock he suffered from the death of D. António, gathering a sonnet that had composed to his memory. It is clear that Camões also had great intimacy with this correspondent, who knew D. António and the poetry of Camões, Petrarch and Boscán. Interestingly, the letter includes some male lines, which Camões says they are mandatory in private letters, containing what can be called a resort conversation, so being worship or scholar did not prevent it if it were "bon vivant".
The presence of Camões in Macau is still wrapped in a certain myth. What are the concrete tests of your presence in the territory?
It is necessary to separate the waters. The landing of Camões in Patane's busty, then called “cave”, is surrounded by a beautiful legendary aura. But the presence of Camões in Macao, this is not involved in "myth", is a factual and historical reality, founded on a wide variety of testimonies, all independent of each other. Insisting on a chronology that contained in the sources, but which was flagrantly erroneous, it was deliberately sought to confuse the doubts that could have about his permanence in the sinned, although unjustified, with false doubts about the poet's stay in Macau, which are laughable and devoid of the minimum foundation. The joke ran a swimming, and little by little it was embedded in the collective imagination, to the point that some less informed people take it for a supposed “discovery” recent. However, nonsense was released in 1907, and soon dismantled in 1911 by Jordan de Freitas. Judge Eduardo Ribeiro put more “points in the iis” in this regard. In your time I will publish the full documentation about the presence of Camões in Macao, putting a definitive end to the mythical “myth”.
What life did Camões in Macau?
We can say that these two years were those of the greatest professional, economic and affective in his life. Is it written poetry? Constantly, as the dimension of the work attests. A significant part of “the Lusíadas” was composed here, although the poem had neither began nor ended in Macao. Not least in his life was that it was in Macao who publicly assumed a relationship with a young Chinese, most exactly the Tanka ethnicity of poor fishermen. This asymmetrical connection is not surprising and with a modest young woman: only disadvantaged families would not prevent daughters from relate to foreigners. This explains the fact that she left with Camões in 1565 to Goa, with concubine status. But the private vessel in which they followed, belonging to Chinese merchants, suffered a wreck by Cambodia, and Camões lost there the “kind lamp I loved so much”. It was only after his death that he would come to chrisma as Denamene, a Greek nymph of the waters, so that she could live forever in the ocean. The Chinese of Macao have a special relationship with Camões, such as the Portuguese and the Macanese.
How is this relationship?
It existed in the eighteenth century in Macao the first monument in honor of Camões, something that in Portugal only began to think about the following century. He even received an inscription on Chinese, and even a Chinese pavilion was built on his sanctuary. The Viscount of Juromenha says that in 1845 the Viceroy of Canton and Imperial Commissioner Ki-A there was worshiped Camões as the “Portuguese Confucius”. And rightly, Camões shares many aspects of the sages of Chinese tradition: he established a dialogue with the masters through the recreation of larger works, cultivated a millennial tradition (he gloss two thousand years prior to his own time), practiced itinerary as a source of "sagesse", said the primacy of poetry, conceived the rivers as mythical entities, even personifying them, even personifying them, even He showed a marked tendency to moralize, and epitomously his thinking in masterful sentences.
What connection did Camões have with Goa?
Unlike Macao, Goa raised in Camões mostly negative feelings. The first impressions he had, like a lawless land in which only the little turns were worse, could not have been worse, as read in the initial letter to which he alluded: "long land, from all the poor honorable grave." In the second letter, he goes on, "I can say that it is the mother of bad villains, and stepmother of honorable men." These impressions would not improve over time, as corroborated the satire that led to the expulsion to Ternate in 1556. Goa, where he became the deputy protected, to fall later in the greatest disfavor under D. Antão de Noronha, was in his texts the inverted mirror of the Kingdom, the corrupt and corrupt Babylon, theil of God, and the betrayal of God, King and the law. In what is not original, as there are other sources that reinforce this Jeremiac and apocalyptic portrait of the capital of the Portuguese East Empire. Remember Bocage: "From the land to worst you are, O goa." This said, obviously that he will also have lived there sweethearts, especially under the viceroyalty of his protectors, and in living with some companions of the poetic lines that then lived there, and which he evokes in the so-called “feast of trovas”. To one of these cultured spirits, the poet Luís Franco, even a copy of his almost complete works, including the 'self of filodemo' that had composed there, that they could be saved if another adversity survived in the kingdom to the kingdom.

Do you think Portugal should pay more attention to your writings, streamlining your work more? How?
In Lisbon it is necessary to build a great literary museum dedicated to Camões and its creations. The ideal place will be the Convent of St. Bento de Xabregas, where his friend Dom António had a grave at the Pantheon of the Line Chapel. Also in Goa the statue of Camões left for exile in the cruelly called “Archaeological Museum”, which is not the right place to end the poetry or image of a poet. Being the greatest intangible heritage of Macao, Camões has been poorly used in this region. multimedia.
What about Macau? Is Camões studied at higher education?
Two students from the Macao University of Sciences and Technology will now defend their master's theses. The first is an in -depth technical study of the translation of Zhang Weim of the Camões Odes. The second runs through the literary survival of the figure of Dinamene in contemporary Portuguese fiction, and are both excellent, bringing novelty.</description><pubDate>2025-05-21 22:42:45</pubDate></item><item><title>Piménio Ferreira: “Anti-igan rhetoric has always worked in Portugal”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2021/04/26/pimenio-ferreira-a-retorica-anti-cigana-sempre-funcionou-em-portugal/</link><description>Piménio Ferreira, better known as Gitelles Ferreira, anti-racist militant, 34, physical engineer, national Romani. He is a man with a provocative speech, a corrosive, kind mood and a smile that leaves no one indifferent
Gitelles, we live in an intercultural land and the Gypsies - in particular - have lived about five centuries in Portugal. What is going on for Gypsy communities to remain “on the fringes” of the so -called society? 
The model of society remains to be changed. This is extremely stratified by placing people in subordinate places to privilege a violent minority. The white social structure is patriarchal and racist. What is called the "margin" of society is actually an intrinsic place to it, which belongs to it. In other words, Gypsy people have been included in this model of society since they discovered Europe and its kingdoms. The problem is the model of society that is maintained and the place to which they were relegated and how they were relegated: with violence, in inferior status against whites, without the right to human dignity, to constitute a family, to choose one's own language and religion, expropriated from any and all cultural and material law. A place built and maintained to this day by violence and genocidal and ethnicidal persecution. In 1463, a Gitano Vasco was drowned to an estate. In 1521, Gitans, or Gypsies, were already used as a reference for all that is considered bad in the model of society. The "counter-exemple" in the face of the white that would stand out for the positive. The 'angel' and the 'devil'; the 'other', the enemy; That against whom any attack and persecution is legitimate. Including the prohibition of defending, having weapons, any kind of goods, and the right of permanence.
And is this right to permanence that we still have nomadic gypsy communities within the country is denied?
Yes, no doubt. There are many ways to force nomadism: directly, prohibiting permanence and expelling with police or military force; indirectly, refusing public or private housing to Gypsy people, as they are Gypsy; and even through the gentrification process.
I read the result of an inquiry from the European Union Fundamental Rights Agency, which is said to be approximately 80% of the Gypsies responded to the risk threshold of poverty in their country; One in three Gypsies lives in a housing without channeled water; One in three Gypsies belongs to a family where someone hungry at least once the previous month; and 50% of Gypsies aged 6 to 24 do not attend school. Why does this happen like this? 
It is the historical persecution, which continues. There is no impoverishment that has no external cause. In this case, a political system of total expropriation and imposed on the basis of violence. Already in 1648, D John IV, the restorer, prohibited ‘Giving or Rent houses to Gypsies’. The same D John IV who got the kingdom of Portugal thanks to D. Jerónimo da Costa and his 250 knights. The same D. Jerónimo da Costa who had died to defend Portugal's independence from Castile. Gypsy, like his wife and children. Between prohibitions of permanence, “that do not enter Gypsies in the Kingdom and leave those who are” (D John III, 1526), ​​with expulsions, degred to the galleys, expropriation of goods and properties, imposed with stripping, mutilation and death, systematically performed to this day (still in 2011 Faro City Council wanted to ban Gypsies in the municipality).
The prohibition of working on others (no one employs Gypsy workers, and those who accept they do it in total precariousness, for poorly paid positions and without decent rights and conditions). They cannot be dependent on their own work, they cannot get investment means due to extreme expropriation. Are dependent on precariousness. If you want to know what it is like to live in pure neoliberalism, know the lives of Gypsies. Their reality is paradigmatic of the aggression and depletion to which the "gentlemen" are willing to go to their benefit.
What do you talk about is economic and political power?
The group of political, social, cultural and economic power. The owner, the colonizer. This group that has been in power since it established the system of current domination. And that only makes sense within the hierarchically stratified sociopolitical model in which we live. Hence the need to end 'gentlemen' and institute a new model of society, healthy, free, without hierarchies or strata, whether of race, class or gender.
The model we live in leads to the Gypsy (and not only) community to economic exclusion, removing it from access to product consumption or excluding them from its production process; political exclusion associated with lack of access to information; To education and consequently the social exclusion that is seen in inequality of access to quality community areas such as restaurants, libraries, theater, cinema, concerts, health care, etc. How do you feel a gypsy child when you realize that it is not part of a whole? Children who are never represented, neither in movies, nor in books, nor in cartoons, not even in an announcement to eat cereals, for example? Is this a disaster for self-esteem, is a priori condemnation?
The question is that. Gypsy people are not “excluded from society”, by contrast, they are included in it. The problem is the existence of what is cynically called 'social exclusion', which term Orwellian, and there be under coercion, people. Which field of concentration and extermination. Incidentally, Nazi concentration camps are a more visual realization than called 'social exclusion' and, as here, were not a 'excluded' part of Nazi society, but rather its fundamental and characterizing structure. It is a place of violence, where people are maintained by violence, dedicated to their extermination, and designed so that few people can leave. And yet they resist. As in Nazi concentration camps.
And what you have listed as an example of 'consequence' of this 'exclusion', is actually the means by which this exclusion also happens and remains. Gypsy people are out of theaters, both as consumers and producers (but go to the cinema). They are out of school, education and the gym. Either as 'users' or as producers (but go to school and are on the basis of knowledge construction and academic and scientific debates).
Even in attacking Gypsy children's self -confidence, we talk about a maintenance mechanism of this situation. But Gypsy people respond very well: with Gypsy pride. Another resistance, another aggression. Gypsy people are thus included in society. In a place that belongs to this model of modern society. And they resist and contradict the power of domination and make a point of being in the city, in the cinema, in the theater, in the gym, in all spaces. With a lot of struggle and always resisting, but they are there. Social exclusion, more than a “place outside of society”, is part of its social structure.
Do you want to say that there is a collective resistance?
At work, already in a context of absolute precariousness, during the pandemic, Gypsy people rolled up sleeves and showed once again proactivity and creativity in adversity. They learned seeing and doing. And here, it is again the women who jump to the front line, face, learn to use digital tools with their daughters or children, and throw themselves into the network. And so they explore online sales as well as application by application (transportation or rehabs). In housing, in a context of pandemic in which the evictions were not locked - as they owed and dictated the law itself - residents did not fail to organize and fight unjust evictions and claim dignity in housing; associations of allied residents in their action with other housing and anti-racist struggle organizations.
It should also be noted how they reinvented and intensified to raise and distribute dietary goods and kits of masks/alcohol gel to the most expropriated people. Gypsies and non -Gypsies. In the anti-racist struggle, new movements emerged and their actions intensified by social networks. People who had never been organized or militated before began their first steps in activism, thickening this way of the organization and popular gypsy and anti-racist action. People forget, or do not want to value, but Gypsy action has helped determine results in the political dispute. Gypsy citizens mobilized in large and determined electoral results in the municipalities of 2017, both in Alentejo and in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area, even causing electoral earthquakes.
And even in the presidential, second place was resolved by a value equivalent to the estimated number of Gypsy voters. Apart from the non -Gypsy votes that were mobilized by the action of Gypsy voters. Gypsy people are even co-considering power in the spaces of opinion, local media, social networks and party and institutional political dispute. And most importantly, in the popular Ação and alliances with other social movements. We have never stopped fighting for all means and continuing to resist.
In contrast there are more and more hate speeches, from the far right in particular. What do you have to say about it?
To start these speeches are historical and European. Not even current and even less “of the far right”. These speeches have been adopted and rendered for a long time, even in 'democracy and freedom', by several representatives of the center right, conservatives, left center, liberal, liberal left, even representatives of the PCP. Anti-egana rhetoric has always worked in Portugal as it is the whiter rhetoric [white genesis]. That is, it allows you to create and give the "white" as the superior of all. And so please the white electorate who, when feeling well, pays off with his vote. Even if the policies implemented by their elected harm him even more.
Finally, did you like them to talk a little about your personal experience and how did you get to the activist?
I studied, fought for studies, made alliances, graduated, went in the labor market of the “formal precariousness”. I started my militant action and here I am today. We can transform this society a better. This certainty combined with the fact that the current one has so much suffering makes anyone want to have a transformist attitude. I wanted to be 'inventor' (physical engineer) and anti -racist militant. And through study (not necessarily schooling) and organization with others, in turn, with other studies, formations and visions, I learned how the world works and how it can be changed. But before transforming, we need to survive.
Hence two types of actions arise: transformative and survival. The struggle against hate discourse arises as survival, but his defeat will be a transformative victory. There is a lot that - like people who want a better world - we have to do, namely working to criminalize hatred speech; condemn and prohibit organizations with racist discourses and practices; denounce the racist institutional structure and logics that organize power and generate community resources. And in this sense, there have been various types of actions, of petitions, to manifestations. And we need more.
I, besides being a military man in the SOS Racism movement, participate in the “We came to stay” podcast, with Mamadou BA and Joseph da Silva. And if all goes well, we will soon start a new project. With friendly people, we also have the project “Gypsy Initiative”, dedicated to reflecting and promoting transformative movements. Essentially focused on educating against anti-agigarism, denouncing historical and continued genocide and working for a new society project. Also with new projects on the gutter. And finally, there are always voluntary actions without an organization, where I try to share what I found out about anti-egism and Roman history in schools and with interested people. In addition, there is still the struggle for housing, because the evictions did not stop during the pandemic. Due to housing and work precariousness, the subjects racialized especially the Roma nationals are the most vulnerable to COVID-19. There is essential to have actions in this area; Of all the struggles, this is the most structural, as it goes against one of the main enemies of a healthy society: the real estate speculation of this capitalist system, which places profit and goods above people and their humanization.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>FIA | Conference helped perceive future of motorsport</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/13/fia-conferencia-ajudou-a-perceber-futuro-do-automobilismo/</link><description>For the first time in its history, in 2025, Macau welcomed the Extraordinary General Assemblies and Conference of the International Automobile Federation (FIA).

Focused on obtaining information about the growth of motorsport and promoting safe, sustainable and accessible mobility to everyone in the Asia Pacific region, the FIA ​​conference opening session highlighted the importance of communication and collaboration, as well as the region's ability to innovate and create solutions that respond to specific questions it faces.
Roberto Carlos Osório, president of the Macau-China General Automotive Association (AAMC), said the association has a strong tradition in motor racing and that following FIA's guidelines is being able to grow rapidly competition at the base level in the region.
“We organized the first GT Macau Cup in 2008,” said the AAMC leader. "Currently, we also have the GT Cup - Great Bay Race for GT4 cars. In addition, in 2008, we created Road Sport Challenge," he explained. “And today, in 2025, we are proud to announce that we have 68 tourism cars in the region to compete in the qualification race to enter the 72nd Macao Grand Prix.”
In a year when AAMC celebrates 30 years of existence - was born as Macao Automobile Club - we also learned that the association's bet for the future will be in the basic disciplines of motor sport. Roberto Carlos Osorio also revealed a curious fact: Macau has 135 pilots with sports license from the territory.
“This growth was achieved following FIA's guidelines to promote grassroots motorsport and create accessible races for riders in the region,” added the manager of the territory. “With the interest of pilots, teams and promoters in developing state-of-the-art activities in Macau, we will focus even more on base competitions and affordable races, not only to support tourism, but also to make Macau in a Karting international center of international events, where champions can be selected for F4 and, later, for regional formula.”
Confirmed GP program
The Macao Grand Prix Organizing Committee (COGPM) held a press conference on June 8 at the Macao Grand Prix Museum to confirm the 72nd Macao Grand Program races, which will take place from November 13 to 16 this year.
As last year, there will be seven races in total, respectively, the Macao Grand Prix - FR da Fia World Cup, the GT Macau Cup - GT da Fia World Cup, the Macau Guide Race - Kumho Fia tcr World Tour Event of Macau, the Formula 4 Formula 4 World Cup, the 57th Macao Motor Motor Prize, GT Cup - Great Bay Race (GT4) and Macao Roadsport Challenge. For the first time, the guide circuit receives four different cups under the FIA ​​seal on the same weekend.
Other news
Between meetings and communications, other information was revealed about the November edition of the Macao Grand Prix. The FIA ​​World Council approved in Macao that the winner of the first Formula 4 World Cup of the FIA ​​will receive two points for the super license. We have also noticed that Pirelli will equip all the monologes that participate in both the FIA ​​Formula 4 World Cup and the FIA ​​regional formula World Formula Cup. In turn, the supply of tires and fuel to the FIA ​​GT World Cup remains in the contest phase.
Registration for the Formula 4 World Cup will be open until July 30. The final selection of 20 pilots will be confirmed by the FIA ​​through an official invitation letter, taking into account the current classification of the pilots in the respective championships.
In the case of the FIA ​​Regional Formula World Cup, registrations will also remain open until July 30, and the grill will be able to host a maximum of 27 Tatuus regional formula -equipped with alpha Romeo engines built by the autotechnic. As with Formula 4, participation will be by invitation, with priority assigned to pilots who have reached the best positions in the five regional formula championships of 2025.</description><pubDate>2025-06-13 18:43:57</pubDate></item><item><title>GP | Jaguar that won in Macau in 1984 returned to the tracks</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/06/gp-jaguar-que-venceu-em-macau-em-1984-regressou-as-pistas/</link><description>The more than seventy years of history of the Macau Grand Prix are people, machines and great moments. We were in 1984, when Tom Walkinshaw won Jaguar's only victory in the guide race. After years away from the audience, for the affected man, this same car returned to the tracks at the hands of an enthusiast of the MSAR MOTOR EVENT
 
Richard Meins, an English maritime transport entrepreneur who lived many years in Hong Kong, who participated on several occasions at the Macao Grand Prix, led this Jaguar XJs of Group A in the Historic Touring Car Challenge race, a competition for classics during the Donington Historic Festival. This “Big Cat”, Chassis No. 5 and one of the four original XJs still existing, is practically as it was in 1984, but given the limitations of tobacco advertising, today boasts the colors used in the European Tourism Championship, instead of the iconic black and gold decoration of John Player Special (JPS) that marked the ticket through the guide circuit.
Interestingly, this return to the clues, from a car that has been still in New Zealand and Japan, was scheduled for the Algarve International Race Track, but the Historic Touring Car Challenge canceled its race in early April in Portimão. So it was in lands of his majesty that Richard Meins made his first race with the British car.
“The car won in Macao in 1984, so I'm a big fan of this model,” Ricard Meins told the English magazine Motorsport News. “I still have the photographs I took this weekend in Macao,” said this avid classic competition car collector who, besides driving, supported several riders at the Macao Grand Prix.
In Donington Park, Richard Meins shared the imposing Jaguar XJS, equipped with a 5.3 -liter V12 engine with Jack Tetley, and ended in sixth place, winning in his class. Richard Meins had only guided the car once or twice, but plans to participate in more historic touring car challenge rounds with XJS 1984. “Let's try to put it on track more often now,” Ricard Meins said, who revealed that he was a stake in the Silverstone Festival in August with this very rare and striking copy of the 1980s tourism cars history.
Premiere of an iconic decoration
In the summer of 1984, Tom Walkinshaw accepted the challenge of the Portuguese organization of the Grand Prix to travel later this year to Macau. With the European title in his pocket, the English driver and team boss was accompanied by one of his usual riders, German Hans Heyer. The guide race was a BMW fiefdom and the controversial English wanted to put an end to the Bavarian domain in the race. To this end, it had the precious support of JPS, which was relaunching the brand, decorating its cars with the famous black and gold colors that would later be eternalized in Ayrton Senna's Lotus. At the time, the guide race took place three weeks before 1000 km from Bathurst, another important race on the worldwide calendar of tourist racing, and so TWR made a "two in one."
The 100 -mile race on the streets of Macau would not have much history, such as the cars built in the Kidlington workshops against the competition headed by the two BMW 635i Schnitzer officers, guided by Hans Stuck and Dieter Quester, and painted by rival Marlboro. Tom Walkinshaw ended first and Hans Heyer and m second.
At the end of the race, quoted by the Portuguese newspaper Autosport, Tom Walkinshaw said: “The circuit is fantastic. Tight, but with many curves, climbs and descents, which made the race become difficult. But I like difficult things and, for me, the race was great from beginning to end.
The Jaguar were again invited by the Macao Grand Prix committee to run in 1985, but Tom Walkinshaw had other plans for his cars. Fortunately, thanks to Richard Meins we will continue to see this beautiful car on the tracks.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>TCR China | André Couto participated in the Zhejiang race</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/01/tcr-china-andre-couto-participou-na-prova-de-zhejiang/</link><description>Over the weekend, André Couto had an unexpected return to the TCR China Championship, in what was his first race of this season. The rider of the sgas showed that "who knows, never forgets", despite having had a troubled passage through the Zhejiang International Circuit
The Portuguese pilot residing in Macao, who has not competed since November last year-when he played the World Lamborghini Super Trofeo World Finals, having won the title in the Lamborghini Super Trofeo Asia Pro-AM category-received a last-minute invitation from MacPro Racing Team to conduct one of the Honda Civic Fl5 TCR Team in the third race of the Chinese Championship. TCR.
Without any prior training, André Couto came back to sit in a car he already knew, also with a technical structure that was familiar to him. By 2023, the territory pilot had already played some TCR China events with this set, then at the service of the official team Dongfeng Honda Racing Team, showing a progress right from the beginning.
"Free training did not go wrong, but in qualification a less attentive pilot hit me on my first departure lap to the track. He hit me from behind and did not realize why. Damaged me the rear, dislocated the convergence and the car was crooked. Hm. "Still, I qualified myself in fourth in Q1, five tenths of the first, which, with the car in the conditions it was, was not bad. The car had potential."
In Q2, due to the damage, the Japanese car “became much harder to guide” and Couto ended in tenth. However, this ended up having a positive effect: “With the reversal of the starting grid, the tenth place of Q2 allowed me to start first to the second race.”
The first race, played on Saturday on the shaoxing track, did not go as well as the pilot wanted, not being able to follow the official links, nor the best Honda and Hyundai. "I ended up eighth. The car was not as good as I expected and we found that there was a damaged damper, still from the crash in the qualification, which was exchanged for the Sunday race."
Inglorius Sunday
In the 20 Sunday round race, André Couto had everything to shine as he departed from pole-position and Honda finally seemed in a position to fight for the first places. "On the way back, the car was good. I didn't feel strange anymore and I was optimistic."
The idea was to get well to distance themselves from the fastest competitors in the first laps and then manage the race with new tires. However, it all faded quickly when it was wrapped by Wu Yi Fan right in the brake for the first curve.
“That was my mission, but I couldn't,” acknowledged the winner of the 2000 Macao Grand Prix. “He hit me on the first curve and the car was damaged. Sports commissioners, but that does not change the fact that I have given up. ”
With Honda's damaged direction, André Couto had no choice but to leave. "I was a bit disappointed because I hope to get a good result for MacPro Racing Team that had given me a good car.</description><pubDate>2025-07-01 00:26:00</pubDate></item><item><title>GP | FIA AFINA REGIONAL Formula Rules</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/23/gp-fia-afina-regras-da-formula-regional/</link><description>The International Automobile Federation (FIA) took advantage of the holding of the Extraordinary General Assemblies and its annual conference to publish the Macao Grand Prix Regulation - FIA Regional Formula Cup of 2025. There are not many changes compared to 2024, but the changes introduced aim to browse gaps from the first edition of this competition in Macau
The twelve red flags during last year's qualification session called for the level of pilots at the Guide Circuit, which was the premiere of the FIA ​​regional formula in Macau regional formula. This happened after the controversial decision of the FIA ​​to consider that Formula 3 was no longer adequate to the Macao Citadino layout.
Unsurprisingly, the sports regulation is now clear that, to compete in the FIA ​​regional formula world, “all pilots must have participated at least 3 competitions with a monolugar that has been projected and/or built to achieve a weight/power ratio of more than 3.0 kg/hp.”
Emanuele Pirro, a former F1 pilot, winner of the Guide Race and president of the FIA ​​monoligai committee, said during the weekend of the 71st edition that, in the future, the FIA ​​will be more demanding about track discipline. Thus, from now on, “any pilot who, in the opinion of sports commissioners, is solely responsible for the display of a red flag during the qualification training session, will not be able to continue to participate in this session and its best time back can be annulled.” The new regulation also states that “if a qualification training session is interrupted with less than four minutes remaining, it will not be restarted.”
On the other hand, the FIA ​​maintains the limit in the participation of more experienced pilots, except only “pilots who participated in a maximum of 3 FI F2 Championship competitions of 2025.” This measure goes a little against the spirit and history of the Great Prize, which has always gathered pilots from higher categories in its main race. In fact, this was a fervent question between Macao and the International Federation on two previous occasions.
In 1985, Alfredo César Torres, then responsible for Portuguese motorsport, convinced Jean-Marie Balestre, against his will, to allow the participation of F1 pilots in the F3 Intercontinental Cup in the name of the economic viability of the race. In 2016, the controversy returned with the veto da FIA to the participation of Nelsinho Piquet, a decision badly received by the teams and then coordinator Barry Bland, which would eventually abandon the co-organization of the race a year later.
Bet on continuity
In sports terms, registrations for this second edition of the FIA ​​regional formula Cup will remain open until July 30. The grill may include a maximum of 27 Tatuus regional formula monologues, all equipped with Alfa Romeo engines built by the Italian Autotechnic. Pirelli will once again be the official tire supplier.
The identities of the invited teams have not yet been revealed, but some news is expected in this field compared to 2024. To avoid any behind -the -scenes disputes, it has already been defined that “the position on the boxes for the teams that participate in the Macao Grand Prix will be based on the ranking of the previous year” and, in turn, “the position on the roads to new teams will be attributed based on the order of the application.”
Equal awards and more restricted advertising
The values ​​of monetary awards remain unchanged this year, with a total of US $ 68,500 to distribute, the equivalent of just over 550,000 patacas at the current exchange rate. The race winner will receive $ 12,000, an amount that is still far from covering the costs of participation in this nature.
On the other hand, the sports regulation introduces two new prohibitions on advertising into the monoligales. In addition to the existing prohibition of advertising to fortune or bad luck, tobacco or pornography, also the promotion of electronic cigarettes and alcoholic beverages - a measure that follows the legislation in force in the territory.
The 72nd Macao Grand Prix, the largest international sports event of the MSA, will take place between November 13 and 16, 2025.</description><pubDate>2025-06-23 03:31:16</pubDate></item><item><title>MOTOR EMBALISM | Project for new track in Zhuhai emerges</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/30/automobilismo-surge-projecto-para-nova-pista-em-zhuhai/</link><description>With a very black cloud to turn to the future of the Zhuhai International Circuit, there is a potential good news for the great bay of motoring: a project for a new permanent circuit in the Chinese city adjacent to the MSAR.
According to Hong Kong's Ta Kung Pao newspaper, Guangdong's provincial government recently published the document “Measures to promote high quality tourism and accelerate the construction of a strong tourist province”, which proposes, for the first time, the creation of an “industrial circle of culture and tourism of the Great Bay”, offering political support to the integrated development of culture and tourism in the region. With this, the first industrial and tourist complex of motorized sports in the Great Bay may emerge.
The project of the Zhuhai Chaoyue international circuit was recently presented at the Zhuhai Ocean Spring Resort, located in Doumen, not far from the city's airport, with an initial investment of 250 million Renminbis.
According to the first information, the project of this circuit provides for welcoming evidence such as Formula 3 and foster collaborative development between motorized sports sectors, cultural events and exhibition industry. The plan includes the holding of several international tests per year and foresees collaboration with Hong Kong and Macau to connect cities such as Jiangmen and Zhongshan, promoting “Multiple stops” and boosting the innovative development of “Event Economics + Cultural Tourism”.
According to Zhou Jian, China Travel Service (Zhuhai) Executive Director General Ocean Spring Resort Co., the FIA ​​grade certification-will also include a karting track, drift track and an interior space of 2,400 m² for exhibitions and events related to the automobile sector. With more than 50 international events projected annually, the goal is to become a "super IP" that joins running, leisure and tourism under the same concept.
The first phase of the Zhuhai Chaoyue International Circuit project will include international certification professionals, as well as support facilities. This project aims not only to fill “a gap in the high -end motorized sports sector in Zhuhai, but will also promote the modernization of the Great Bay's cultural, sports and tourist industries by conducting international racing and themed cultural events linked to motorsport.”
Uncertainties in the air
Last summer, the company Malay LBS Bina Group BHD announced that it sold its participation in the Zhuhai International Circuit (ZIC) - the first permanent circuit built in the interior of China - by 124.7 million ringits (about 214.15 million patacas). In a statement to Bursa Malaysia Securities BHD, the group reported that their subsidiary, Dragon Hill Corporation Ltd, sold all his participation in Lamdeal Investments Ltd (Lil) to Huafa Urban Operation (HK) Ltd, a well -known real estate operator. Lil Detinha 60 percent of Zhuhai International Circuit Limited (ZICL), circuit operator.
Raised in 1996 in order to receive the first major award from China from Formula 1 - something that never materialized - ZIC was still the initial motor of motoring in the country and a reference in Asian motorsport. Since its opening, it has welcomed several international evidence, such as the FIA ​​GT, A1 GP or the Intercontinental Le Mans Series. In recent years, track administration has chosen to organize its own events, abdicating the most costly international evidence.
Despite having received, in the past, auto competitions from MSAR, ZIC has been losing protagonism in local motorized sport, due to high prices, limited availability and reducing sports activity in favor of the most profitable commercial activities. The future of the circuit remains uncertain: it is only known that lease agreements between resident teams and the circuit have been frozen and are not being renewed. The track approval will also be about to expire, requiring a new certification to continue to receive competitions in the future.
However, on the weekend of June 14 and 15, the still only circuit of Zhuhai will host the third race of the Formula 4 China Championship season.</description><pubDate>2025-05-30 01:53:33</pubDate></item><item><title>Macao's historicals get a GP clearance</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/20/historicos-de-macau-conseguem-apuramento-para-gp/</link><description>The Guangdong International Circuit welcomed, last weekend, the second and decisive double journey of Macao - Macau Road Sport Challenge cars, proof of finding for the most important motor racing of the season: the Macao Grand Prix. In a journey with few celebration reasons for the colors of the sinters, the veterans Jerónimo Badaraco and Rui Valente managed to ensure the qualification.
With a list of 68 subscribers, the grill was divided into two groups, A and B, with all the pilots competing with Toyota Gr86 (ZN8) or Subaru BRZ (ZD8) models. This year, with only one race scheduled for the Grand Prix Program - due to the inclusion of the FIA ​​Formula 4 World Cup - the number of riders was reduced to 36, which placed a supplementary pressure for both missing races. To complicate, the rain came, changing the turns to teams and riders.
In Group A, where Rui Valente faced a complicated weekend on the track around Zhaoqing, Célio Alves Dias and Maximiano Mannão failed to qualify, in a series dominated by Hong Kong pilots. In Saturday's race, the podium consisted of Wong Chuck Pan, Lo Pak Yu and Chan Ka Ping. On Sunday, these three repeated the feat, but with a new order: Lo Pak Yu, Chan Ka Ping and Wong Chuck Pan.
In difficult atmospheric conditions on Saturday, Rui Valente ended only 25th, due to an error in tuning, improving to 15th on Sunday, with the track dry. A penalty after the second race fired him to the 27th place. Still, the 7th place obtained on the first round was enough to secure a place in the Macao Grand Prix.
On the contrary, Maximiano Mannão, behind the wheel of a Toyota with the colors of the historic Macau Racing Team, ended on 26th and 14th, a result below the finding, but it turns out to be positive given that it was Jove Pilot's debut in these wanderings. Célio Alves Dias, with difficulties in his car since the first race, was 24th and 28th, far from the usual level of this experienced Macaense pilot.
Badaraco with final sprint '
On a weekend, where the lively races were broadcast on live streaming in Group B, Hong Kong riders stood out again. On Sunday, Adrian Chung won, with Leung Tsz Wa and Tsang Pak Yin completing the podium. In the second confrontation, Cheang Kin Sang reached a deserved victory, followed again by Leung Tsz Wa and Tsang Pak Yin.
Jerónimo Badaraco came to this challenging weekend without the assured clearance. A modest qualification and 11th Saturday place maintained the open outcome. However, a solid race on Sunday and an excellent 4th place assured veteran Macanese the much desired place on the grid of the Macao Grand Prix, along with countrymen Cheng Kin San, Leong Keng Hei, Lou Check In and Carson Tang.
Also outside the big prize was Dionísio Albino Pereira, who finished 23rd in Saturday's race, but closed the time more forcefully, by cutting the line of goal in 13th place in the second race.
At the end of the races, competitors provisionally calculated had an extra technical verification, being forced to open engines and gearbox, to verify the legality of these two decisive organs of their vehicles.</description><pubDate>2025-05-20 01:57:43</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
