Tokyo rules out that the invalidation of the rates will affect previously agreed investments, according to the economic newspaper Nikkei, while Taiwan and Hong Kong foresee a “limited” effect of the new global tariff. China has not yet commented.
In response to the resolution, which invalidates the so-called “reciprocal tariffs” and other generalized taxes applied by Trump, with a minimum rate of 10 percent, the President signed a global tariff of 10 percent on all countries. The law that supports this new executive order only allows tariffs to be increased by up to 15 percent and for periods of 150 days, so it is not clear how it will be articulated in the long term, writes the EFE news agency.
South Korea said the trade deal with Washington, which provides for commitments such as a $350 billion South Korean investment and 15 percent tariffs from Washington, remains intact.
According to Yonhap news agency, South Korean authorities called an emergency meeting to assess the impact of invalidating the tariffs.
The governments of Taiwan and Hong Kong consider that the 10 percent global tariff announced by Trump will have a “limited impact” on their economies. Indonesia, which on Thursday signed a trade agreement with the US, indicated that it will hold “new talks” with Washington in light of the “dynamics that are occurring”.
Malaysia assured that it “will continue to diversify its trade relations and strengthen regional and multilateral economic cooperation”, despite the decision that invalidates a large part of Trump's tariffs.</description><pubDate>2026-02-23 06:00:40</pubDate></item><item><title>STD | Portuguese market is a priority</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/23/dst-mercado-portugues-e-prioritario/</link><description>The director of the Tourism Services (DST), Maria Helena de Senna Fernandes, said that Portugal will be one of Macau's priorities when it comes to attracting more foreign visitors. In a message broadcast by public broadcaster TDM – Teledifusao de Macau, regarding the Lunar Year of the Fire Horse, Senna Fernandes pointed out among the targets for this year “European markets, such as Portugal and Spain”.
The director also mentioned Southeast Asia, Northeast Asia – a region that includes Japan, Mongolia and the Far East of Russia – and “the emerging tourist markets in the Middle East and Central Asia”. Senna Fernandes predicted that Macau will receive 41 million visitors in 2026, after reaching close to 40.1 million visitors last year, a new historic high. The majority (90.6 percent) of tourists came from Mainland China or Hong Kong.
Tourism | Flat orders to encourage consumption
Deputy Chan Lai Kei wants the Government to draw lessons from tourism statistics and visitor consumption patterns to implement measures that increase tourists' stay in Macau and commerce in residential neighborhoods off the tourist trail. In a written question, the deputy linked to the Fujian community indicated that during this Lunar New Year, the Government invested a lot of resources into organizing large events, which failed to benefit small and medium-sized companies in areas less popular with tourists.
Chan Lai Kei argues that the Government should improve the transport system during national holiday periods, in order to facilitate visits to residential neighborhoods, far from the most popular tourism centers. The deputy also asked the Sam Hou Fai Executive for practical measures to improve the experiences of international tourists and eliminate current obstacles, such as the lack of international electronic payments and language barriers.
Performance Venue | IC will launch new measures
The president of the Cultural Affairs Bureau (IC), Deland Leong, revealed that the IC will launch an online platform for companies to consult rental requests for the Macau Open-Air Performance Venue. The changes are part of the Government's objectives to “expand and reinforce the functions” of the concert venue and were revealed on the morning program Forum Macau on the Chinese channel Rádio Macau.
This objective had previously been revealed by the secretary for Social Affairs and Culture, O Lam, during the presentation of the Lines of Government Action, in the Legislative Assembly. At that time, the secretary pointed out that in the future the space could receive 3×3 basketball courts or other facilities for family sporting activities. Deland Leong also acknowledged that the Government will review some of the regulations and guidelines for the use of the space.</description><pubDate>2026-02-23 05:30:08</pubDate></item><item><title>Suicide | Cáritas Support Line received around 30 calls per day</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/23/suicidio-linha-de-apoio-da-caritas-recebeu-cerca-de-30-chamadas-por-dia/</link><description>Between the 16th and 19th of this month, the last three days of the last lunar year, the Caritas suicide prevention helpline entitled Caritas LifeHope received around 30 calls daily. The number was indicated by the person responsible for the telephone line, Ng Lai Ieng, cited by the newspaper Ou Mun.
The person in charge explained that the number of daily calls was similar to that on other business days. Ng Lai Ieng revealed that seven of these calls were requests for help related to suicide, but fortunately they were nothing more than thoughts, without any type of planning or associated action. Ng pointed out that in these cases the calls are classified as low-risk cases.
The other requests for help were motivated by marital conflicts or problems adapting to situations of divorce, stress, and other cases of mental and emotional instability.
Anyone who is emotionally distressed or considers themselves to be in a desperate situation should call the Caritas Hope for Life Hotline on 28525222 in order to obtain emotional counseling services.</description><pubDate>2026-02-23 05:41:50</pubDate></item><item><title>More Chinese New Year shows in the coming days</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/23/mais-espectaculos-de-ano-novo-chines-nos-proximos-dias/</link><description>The Directorate of Tourism Services (DST) continues to organize, in the coming days, shows to celebrate the arrival of the Year of the Horse with fireworks.
One of the initiatives is the holding of three editions of “2026 – Drone and Fireworks Shows”, where drones are introduced for the first time in this type of presentation, in a combination of “technology with art, increasing the sensation and appreciation of fireworks shows”, in order to “enrich festive experiences”. One of these presentations takes place today, the seventh day of Chinese New Year, and then on March 3, the fifteenth day of the first month of Chinese New Year. These shows take place in the bay next to the Macau Tower.
Also noteworthy is the holding of the “Second parade of floats with cultural performances” on Saturday, the 28th, the 12th day of the Lunar New Year. Between 8pm and 9:30pm, and starting at Rua Norte do Patane, the parade also includes a cultural show in the Iao Hon Municipal Market Garden. There will be 17 floats in this parade, eight of them representing Government departments and the remaining nine from local tourist entities.
The public will be able to watch this parade from its beginning, on Rua Norte do Patane, and along the pedestrian walkways on the parade route to the finishing point, in the Jardim do Mercado Municipal de Iao Hon.
Galloping on ZAPE
At ZAPE, the “Gala a gallop no ZAPE” initiative is taking place until the 1st of March, “in conjunction with Chinese New Year and Valentine's Day”, more specifically in the surrounding area between Rua de Cantão and Rua de Beijing.

After the MSAR established itself as a mandatory stop on the IAME Series Asia calendar and the Macau International Karting Grand Prix hosted the IAME Asia Final, the launch of the IAME Series Macau was confirmed, even before the New Lunar Year, comprising seven races to be held in Coloane. The calendar presented follows the already established AAMC Karting Championship.
According to the brief communication released on social media by IAME Asia Series, “Macau’s motorsport heritage is profound and its passion for racing is recognized worldwide”. For the IAME promoter on the Asian continent, based in Singapore, taking the competition to the Macao SAR constitutes “another decisive step in the growth of karting in Asia-Pacific, creating more routes, more opportunities and a stronger community for young talents”.
All the same
The IAME Series are karting championships organized under the aegis of the Italian IAME (Italian American Motor Engineering), one of the world's largest manufacturers of engines for the sport. The IAME Series Asia calendar will also be expanded next year: in addition to the rounds in Malaysia and Thailand, Macau will host the fourth of six races of the season, scheduled for the 23rd and 24th of May.
Regardless of country or region, all participants compete with IAME engines, under uniform technical regulations that ensure equal conditions on the track. The model prioritizes cost control and competition sustainability, placing emphasis on individual talent and sporting equity.
In addition to Macau and the Asian championship, IAME already promotes competitions in Mainland China, Japan, Malaysia, Thailand, Sri Lanka, India and the Philippines. In this context, the organization believes that “together, we continue to build an interconnected platform across the region”.
As previously announced, the IAME Asia Final, covering all categories, will return for the third consecutive year to the Macau International Karting Grand Prix program. This year's edition is scheduled to take place between December 11th and 14th.

After Cáritas Macau, the solidarity wave encompasses BNU, Misericórdia, Casa de Portugal, Council of Portuguese Communities, Lusophone Scout Group of Macau and Club Lusitano
After Cáritas Macau announced about two weeks ago that it was raising funds to help victims of the storms that affected Portugal and Spain in recent weeks, the solidarity campaign in Macau and Hong Kong was extended to six Portuguese-based entities.
Monetary donations can go to an account at Banco Nacional Ultramarino (BNU), which has joined the initiative, according to a joint statement.
The funds will then be redirected “to one or more Portuguese social solidarity institutions operating on the ground, ensuring transparency and traceability of the entire process”, they added in the same note. Recalling the “best tradition of fraternity and solidarity that unites Portuguese-speaking peoples”, the statement makes “a public appeal for the mobilization of the Portuguese-speaking community in Macau and the Greater Bay Area”.
In addition to having the institutional support of the consulate, the campaign was launched by the Casa de Portugal association in Macau, the China Circle of the Council of Portuguese Communities and the Lusophone Scout Group of Macau.
Long challenge
In Hong Kong, the initiative has the participation of Club Lusitano, the largest institution of the Portuguese-descendant community of the former British colony, with around 400 members, founded in 1866. It is worth remembering that on February 10, the Catholic organization Cáritas Macau launched a three-month fundraising campaign for those affected by the storms in the Iberian Peninsula.
In a note published on social media, the Catholic organization lamented the “devastating storms” that caused “catastrophic floods” and landslides in Portugal and Spain, destroying infrastructure and homes. "Thousands of people are homeless and urgently need water, food and medical care. Local teams work tirelessly, but the recovery will be long and challenging", warned Cáritas Macau.
On Wednesday, the União das Misericórdias Portuguesas said it had received a donation worth 300 thousand euros from Misericórdia de Macau to support its counterparts who suffered significant damage caused by the Kristin depression.
Nineteen people died in Portugal following the Kristin, Leonardo and Marta depressions, which also caused many hundreds of injuries and displacement. The total or partial destruction of homes, businesses and equipment, the fall of trees and structures, the closure of roads, schools and transport services, and the cut of energy, water and communications, floods and floods are the main material consequences of the storm.
The Centre, Lisbon and Vale do Tejo and Alentejo regions were the most affected. The calamity situation that covered the 68 most affected municipalities ended on February 15th.</description><pubDate>2026-02-23 05:40:47</pubDate></item><item><title>Birth rate | Expected rate increase of 4.5 percent</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/23/natalidade-prevista-subida-de-taxa-em-45-por-cento/</link><description>After visiting the first babies of the Year of the Horse, Tai Wa Hou indicated that the expected increase is due to the fact that the Government has launched “high quality services” to promote birth rates
The leader of the public hospital predicted that there should be more than three thousand births in 2026, an increase of at least 4.5 percent, in the region with the lowest birth rate in the world. According to the Chinese language channel of public broadcaster TDM Macau, the deputy director of Centro Hospitalar Conde de São Januário said he was confident that young couples in the territory would have more children.
After visiting the first babies born in the Lunar Year of the Fire Horse, which has now begun, Tai Wa Hou defended that the Government launched “high-quality services” to promote birth rates. In July, the local parliament approved a budget review to reinforce social support, including the creation of a subsidy, worth a total of MOP54,000, for children up to three years old.
The Government also launched a public consultation on the increase, in the private sector, of maternity leave, from 70 to 90 days, and annual leave, from six to 12 days to “obtain a better balance between work and family life”.
The mother of the first baby of the year, born at 00:11 in Conde de São Januário, surnamed Fung, told TDM that she plans to have more children and hopes that the newborn will grow up with “many siblings”. The estimate made by Tai Wa Hou still represents a drop compared to the forecast made almost a year ago, also on the first day of the Lunar New Year.
Black numbers
On January 29, 2025, the deputy director of Macau Health Services, Kuok Cheong U, predicted that the year would end with fewer than 3,500 births.
On January 1st, Tai Wa Hou revealed that Macau registered 2,871 newborns in 2025, the lowest number in almost 50 years, since 1978, when the city, then under Portuguese administration, registered 2,407 newborns.
However, while in 1978 Macau had less than 249 thousand inhabitants, at the end of September 2024 the region already had a population of almost 687 thousand. The number of births thus fell for the sixth consecutive year and is increasingly far from the historic maximum of 7,913, set in 1988.
Macau recorded just 0.58 births per woman in 2024, far from the value needed to replace generations (2.1), the lowest fertility rate ever in the region and the lowest in the world, according to official data.</description><pubDate>2026-02-23 05:31:33</pubDate></item><item><title>Borders | Secretary wants security against external forces</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/23/fronteiras-secretario-quer-seguranca-contra-forcas-externas/</link><description>The Secretary for Security promised that the region will strengthen border security in 2026, “to avoid interference from external forces”. Chan Tsz King highlighted the importance of collaboration with secret agencies in Mainland China and Hong Kong
The Secretary for Security, Chan Tsz King, committed to strengthening security at Macau's border posts throughout this year, “to avoid interference from external forces”, but without pointing out any threats.
“We will further enhance security surveillance at sea and land ports to prevent interference from external forces,” Chan told public broadcaster TDM – Teledifusao de Macau.
In a message regarding the Lunar Year of the Fire Horse, which began last week, the leader did not identify the threats coming from abroad, but promised to “fully safeguard national security”. “We will continue to strengthen our intelligence collection and analysis capabilities, especially through ongoing intelligence exchanges with mainland China and Hong Kong,” Chan Tsz King also said.
In November, the secretary promised to create, in 2026, a risk warning system against national security and warned against “acts of interference and destruction” by “external forces”.
Dangerous discord
On July 31, Macau police announced the arrest of former deputy Au Kam San, a Portuguese citizen, in the first case under the national security law.
On February 5, the director of the Judicial Police assured journalists that there was sufficient evidence to justify Au Kam San's arrest. “There is a lot of evidence and we are entering the trial process, so we cannot disclose the details,” said Sit Chong Meng.
Three days earlier, human rights organization Human Rights Watch said Au Kam San's case illustrates the “erosion of autonomy and fundamental freedoms” in Macau.
In November, the head of the European Union (EU) Delegation in Hong Kong and Macau wrote on social media that he had met with Macau's Secretary for Economy and Finance, Anton Tai Kin Ip. “I also expressed concern about political issues,” added Briton Harvey Rouse. But the EU representation declined to reveal to Lusa whether the case against Au Kam San was mentioned at the meeting.
In September, during a visit to Macau, Prime Minister Luís Montenegro admitted that he did not discuss the detention of the Portuguese citizen with the territory's leader, Sam Hou Fai. “There are some issues that also deserve some modesty in their treatment and this is one of them”, defended the prime minister.</description><pubDate>2026-02-23 05:28:44</pubDate></item><item><title>New Year | Sam makes “wishes of peace and prosperity to the great country”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/23/ano-novo-sam-faz-votos-de-paz-e-prosperidade-a-grande-patria/</link><description>The Chief Executive entered the Year of the Fire Horse with desires for national prosperity and pointed to “new horizons” for Macau, under the “firm” leadership of President Xi Jinping
In the traditional speech to enter the Lunar New Year, the Chief Executive left wishes for “peace and prosperity to the great Fatherland”. The message was conveyed in a recorded video, released on the eve of the Lunar New Year.
"The bell for the Year of the Horse will ring. At this moment, Spring is felt in all its splendor in Macau and this pearl shines incessantly in the palm of the motherland's hand", said Sam Hou Fai. “I wish peace and prosperity to the great country; to the MSAR, I wish stability and prosperous development; to all the residents of Macau, I wish you happiness and good health,” he added.
Regarding the entry into the new year, the ruler stated that the “horse symbolizes loyalty, courage, exploratory spirit and freedom” and that these qualities “must be promoted” to face “the future”. “Ahead of the Year of the Horse, we must, with a spirit of leadership, courage and perseverance, promote the development of Macau in all aspects in the best possible way; we must, with persistence and dedication, continue to adequately carry out work to improve the lives of the population for their well-being”, he highlighted.
Get stronger
In the message, the Chief Executive also highlighted the need for the Macao SAR and the country to continue to strengthen themselves to achieve new successes. “As the Chinese quote says: ‘The movement of heaven is vigorous; therefore, a noble person must strive tirelessly to strengthen himself’”, he stressed. "The success story of the 'One Country, Two Systems' principle in the Macao SAR has been written generation after generation by the people of Macau. I am convinced that, under the firm leadership of Mr. President Xi Jinping and the Central Government, counting on the great Motherland as unwavering support, as long as we have the courage to reform and innovate, better leveraging the institutional advantages of the 'One Country, Two Systems' principle, we will certainly be able to achieve success, opening up new horizons of development and creating new splendid successes”, pointed out the leader of the Macao SAR Government.</description><pubDate>2026-02-23 05:23:41</pubDate></item><item><title>Heritage | Stories of the stores on Rua Cinco de Outubro told in a book</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/23/patrimonio-historias-das-lojas-da-rua-cinco-de-outubro-contadas-em-livro/</link><description>Natalie Fu has just released a book about traditional commerce on Rua Cinco de Outubro, at the invitation of the Macau Cultural Heritage Reinvention Studies Association. “Macao’s Historical House Taxonomy – The Shophouses at the Rua Cinco de Outubro” tells the centuries-old story of shophouses that were the “heart of Macau’s Chinese community”
A book has just been published that reveals a little about the history of commerce carried out by the Chinese community on Rua Cinco de Outubro, located in Porto Interior, the scene of many commercial movements over the centuries. The work also explains how these stores, which are at the same time houses, reveal details about the history of Macau.
“Macao’s Historical House Taxonomy – The Shophouses at the Rua Cinco de Outubro”, written by Natalie Fu, a doctoral student at the University of São José, was invited by the Association for Studies on the Reinvention of Cultural Heritage of Macau, whose edition also depends on “the support and assistance of many other people”, the author told HM. One of the book's sales outlets, which does not have a Portuguese version, is Pin-to Livros.
“The investigation began with the love for Macau and its old buildings”, reveals the author, who began the research work around these buildings in 2022, in the middle of the pandemic.
"Rua de Cinco de Outubro has always been an important commercial area in Macau. Once, it was the heart of Macau's Chinese community. Even today, many old stores remain close to the local neighborhood. The stores are mixed-use buildings", explains the author.
This is the stage for commercial diversity, as Rua Cinco de Outubro “is home to several businesses, such as traditional Chinese bakeries, Chinese medicine stores, tea shops and fruit shops”.
According to the presentation of the work, made on social media by the association itself, this type of property constitutes “a common type of multifunctional residential building”, where the “plan of the buildings is generally rectangular, with two to three floors”. Typically, the ground floor is used for the store or as a warehouse, while the upper floors are reserved for housing.
"This type of construction can adapt to the local climate, presenting great flexibility in the construction methods and materials used. Due to the diversity of daily uses, shop houses were once the main type of building on the streets of Macau, having important historical, social, cultural, architectural and aesthetic value", it further reads.
Preservation Challenges
Still according to the same note, the book draws attention to the importance of preserving this type of construction and, consequently, a symbol of local heritage. “Unfortunately, because they are small-scale and scattered buildings, and because they are not fully protected by the Macau Heritage Protection Law, they have been gradually disappearing with the rapid development of society”, and, currently, “only a small number of these buildings have the classification of ‘monument’ and are protected”.
For Natalie Fu, “the preservation of Macau's stores faces many challenges, one of which is the fact that they are not included in the existing list of protected old buildings in Macau”, in addition to that, in her view, “changes in construction laws have also made it difficult to maintain these old buildings”.
Asked about the future of this iconic street in Porto Interior, the author recognizes that “the growth of a city inevitably involves the renovation and disappearance of buildings”, so “determining which buildings should be preserved and how to preserve them is a long-term challenge”.
Natalie Fu even talks about the need to extend the investigation to more streets in Macau that are also traditional shopping areas. "Research and documentation of the stores on Rua Cinco de Outubro and in Macau are urgent as their number is dwindling. Additionally, additional academic investigations and discussions with the local community are needed to inform the future direction of the Inner Harbor area."
In relation to the panorama on Rua Cinco de Outubro, the author describes that maintenance should be focused on, keeping commercial spaces open. "Stores that are kept in use better highlight their social value. Taking some stores on Rua Cinco de Outubro as an example, the existence of century-old stores further emphasizes the cultural and historical value of the area and the stores. Furthermore, 'keeping them in use' allows for more immediate monitoring and maintenance, which is the most direct way of protecting ancient architecture."
A certain influence
In a territory characterized by the coexistence of Portuguese and Chinese cultures, Natalie Fu's book shows how these houses were influenced by other cultures. “Chinese and Western architecture in Macau have always influenced each other throughout historical development, and this feature is particularly visible in the appearance of the shop houses.” In this way, this book helps to cement this characteristic, “establishing a classification system for Macau’s shop houses, consolidating their architectural definition”.
This book is, therefore, a “classifying study of the old shop houses in Macau”, constituting “the first step towards their safeguarding”, describes, in the same note, the association that supported the editorial and research project.
"The author carried out a detailed record and survey [of the stores], starting with visits and cartography surveys in the Porto Interior area. Maps were drawn up of the location of the shop houses on that street, analysis sheets based on fieldwork, photographic records and interviews with current traders and residents, in order to understand the history of the use of each building."
Furthermore, the work documents seven cases in particular, “providing information on their history, evolution and current use, as well as a preliminary discussion on possible preservation directions”. The book also records two examples of shop houses that have now disappeared. “It is hoped that this work will encourage more people to discover the ‘beauty of Macau.’ With the shop houses as a central theme, it is expected to promote exchange and discussion between academics from different areas”, the association also points out.
Natalie Fu invited “several experts and academics to share their ideas, experiences and suggestions on the protection and future of this type of buildings”, it is described.
Born and raised in Macau, Natalie Fu had the opportunity to visit all of Southeast Asia from a young age, trips that led her to “foster a deep appreciation and passion for architecture”. The author has a degree in Architecture, also describing herself as a person interested in the area of ​​heritage conservation and a “historical architecture scholar trained in Macau”.</description><pubDate>2026-02-23 05:20:58</pubDate></item><item><title>Fees | Asia responds to new US announcements</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/23/taxas-asia-responde-aos-novos-anuncios-dos-eua/</link><description>Several countries and regions in Asia reacted Saturday to the US Supreme Court's decision that annulled the tariffs imposed by the President, as well as the new 10 percent global tax that Donald Trump instituted after the court decision.

Anyone who is emotionally distressed or considers themselves to be in a desperate situation should call the Caritas Hope for Life Hotline on 28525222 in order to obtain emotional counseling services.</description><pubDate>2026-02-23 05:41:50</pubDate></item><item><title>More Chinese New Year shows in the coming days</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/23/mais-espectaculos-de-ano-novo-chines-nos-proximos-dias/</link><description>The Directorate of Tourism Services (DST) continues to organize, in the coming days, shows to celebrate the arrival of the Year of the Horse with fireworks.
One of the initiatives is the holding of three editions of “2026 – Drone and Fireworks Shows”, where drones are introduced for the first time in this type of presentation, in a combination of “technology with art, increasing the sensation and appreciation of fireworks shows”, in order to “enrich festive experiences”. One of these presentations takes place today, the seventh day of Chinese New Year, and then on March 3, the fifteenth day of the first month of Chinese New Year. These shows take place in the bay next to the Macau Tower.
Also noteworthy is the holding of the “Second parade of floats with cultural performances” on Saturday, the 28th, the 12th day of the Lunar New Year. Between 8pm and 9:30pm, and starting at Rua Norte do Patane, the parade also includes a cultural show in the Iao Hon Municipal Market Garden. There will be 17 floats in this parade, eight of them representing Government departments and the remaining nine from local tourist entities.
The public will be able to watch this parade from its beginning, on Rua Norte do Patane, and along the pedestrian walkways on the parade route to the finishing point, in the Jardim do Mercado Municipal de Iao Hon.
Galloping on ZAPE
At ZAPE, the “Gala a gallop no ZAPE” initiative is taking place until the 1st of March, “in conjunction with Chinese New Year and Valentine's Day”, more specifically in the surrounding area between Rua de Cantão and Rua de Beijing. According to a note from DST, the aim is, “through installations characteristic of the festive season, to increase the festive atmosphere of the neighborhoods and the tourist attraction, attracting people to the community neighborhoods”.
This “Gala galloping at ZAPE” has “the participation of ZAPE traders and several integrated tourism and leisure companies”, and includes the launch of promotional packages to attract more tourists.</description><pubDate>2026-02-23 05:53:35</pubDate></item><item><title>Concert | “Classics on Strings” in March at CCM</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/23/concerto-classicos-em-cordas-em-marco-no-ccm/</link><description>March will be the time to host the “Clássicos em Cordas” concert, led by the Macau Orchestra, and which brings two violinists to the territory: Julian Rachlin and Sarah McElravy. Here's the opportunity to hear interpretations of compositions by Beethoven and Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy
The Macau Orchestra (OM) will be the protagonist of another classical music concert scheduled for March, namely on the 14th, and which will be performed in the large auditorium of the Macau Cultural Center (CCM). The concert will be directed by Julian Rachlin, considered a “world-renowned violinist”, as described in a note from the Cultural Institute (IC), which supports the show. Violinist Sarah McElravy also joins the stage.
“String Classics” is the name of this show, which presents “a true feast of fascinating works for strings”, such as Beethoven’s “Coriolanus Overture”, Mozart’s “Symphony Concertante in E-flat Major” and “Symphony No. 3 in A Minor ‘Scottish'” by Feliz Mendelssohn Bartholdy, German composer and pianist.
This last composition dates from 1829 and 1841, having been premiered in the city of Leipzig on March 3, 1842. It is one of the last major works composed by this master of Romanticism, with its composition beginning on a trip to Scotland.
In the case of Beethoven's “Coriolanus Overture”, it lasts eight minutes and had its premiere in Vienna, in March 1807, and is known for having inaugurated two concert formats in the 19th century, namely the concert overture and the symphonic poem.
Distinguished names
In a note from the IC, the career of Julian Rachlin, born in Vienna, is described as an “internationally acclaimed Austrian violinist and violist”. Rachlin also collaborated “with numerous orchestras and several internationally renowned conductors for more than three decades”, and, in recent years, he was Principal Guest Conductor of the Royal Northern Sinfonia, in the United Kingdom.
He also directed several international orchestras, such as the Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra and the Munich Philharmonic.
Sarah McElravy, a Canadian violin and viola player, has performed on stage in Europe, America and Asia. She is “recognized for her exceptional technique, having collaborated with renowned orchestras and participated in several music festivals”.
McElravy is seen as someone with “profound performance experience”, also dedicating herself “to promoting musical education, having founded a chamber music association in Mexico to bring world-class concerts to local communities”.
The “Clássicos em Cordas” concert will last approximately one and a half hours, including an intermission. Tickets are now on sale, with prices ranging between 150 and 300 patacas.</description><pubDate>2026-02-23 05:51:47</pubDate></item><item><title>Thailand | Virus kills 72 tigers in wildlife park</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/23/tailandia-virus-mata-72-tigres-em-parque-de-vida-selvagem/</link><description>Authorities in northern Thailand said 72 tigers have died in recent weeks at a wildlife park due to a viral and bacterial infection.
The tests detected the presence of the highly contagious canine distemper virus, as well as bacteria that affect the respiratory system, the Chiang Mai Provincial Livestock Department said in a statement on Friday.
"When tigers get sick, it is more difficult to detect the disease than in animals like cats or dogs. By the time we realized they were sick, it was too late," said the director of Thailand's Department of Livestock, Somchuan Ratanamungklanon, to local media.
The cats belonged to the privately owned Tiger Kingdom wildlife park. Tourists can “hug, touch and take up-close photographs with the tigers” there, according to the park's website.
“These tigers died as they lived: in suffering, captivity and fear,” animal rights organization PETA Asia told France-Presse news agency. “If tourists avoided these places, they would quickly become unviable and tragedies like this would be much less likely to occur,” the organization added.</description><pubDate>2026-02-23 05:59:50</pubDate></item><item><title>Health | Registration open for training in clinical medicine</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/23/saude-abertas-inscricoes-para-formacao-em-medicina-clinica/</link><description>Registration for the “training course in basic clinical medicine skills” is open until March 4th”, the Health Services said on Friday.

When listening to the Lecture on the Year of the Horse by Professor Wang Suoying at the Macau Scientific and Cultural Center regarding Chinese astrology and, specifically, the Fire Horse, which will inaugurate a new zodiacal period from February 17, 2026, I was able to recall some of the essential characteristics of the horse, transmitted by Chinese folk wisdom.
Thus the horse begins to mythologically combine with the dragon in Dragon-Horse (龙马Lóngmǎ). This is an ideal combination, both on a mental and aesthetic level. From a spiritual point of view, the pair allows access to the organization of the world guided by intuitive wisdom, since it was on the back of this animal that the first legendary Chinese emperor Fuxi (伏羲) discovered the eight trigrams, fundamental for understanding the world. Let us remember them: the Creative Heaven (乾 Qián), the Receptive Earth (坤 Kūn), the abyssal Water (坎Kǎn), the clinging Fire (离 Lí), the awakening Thunder or Lightning (震 Zhèn), the gentle and penetrating Wind (巽 Xùn), the Joyful Lake (兑Duì) and the tranquil Mountain (艮 Gě) . These eight trigrams, with the qualities already mentioned, gave rise to the 64 hexagrams that make up the Classic of Changes, as I have already had the opportunity to mention, for example, in the text A Mulher na China (2007) or in the poetic work Visitações (2022). Through the composition of the trigrams into hexagrams, a world is exposed that poetically unfolds, depending on the intuitive and imaginative capabilities of each person, with precepts open to past, but also present and future existential experiences. Each person will be able to find what they are looking for at the same time as they create and recreate themselves with the help of the real elements of Heaven, Earth, Fire, Water and all others that they consider useful for their existential path, also traced with the help of the mind and, above all, the imagination.
Still in its connection with the dragon in the proverbial expression “the Spirit of the Dragon-Horse” (龙马精神Lóngmǎ jīngshén) it represents the realization of an aesthetic ideal full of energy, beauty and power of transformation, just as these animals are for the Chinese.
It starts, however, from a concrete floor and then flies. The land of popular wisdom tells us that the horse is a noble and loyal animal, which knows the path (老马识途Lǎomǎ-shítú), since experience is the mother of wisdom in it, but it is not just any experience: it is energetic, a good friend and loyal.  This loyalty and energy could not be more noble, especially since since Chinese antiquity, equids have been the faithful companions of nobles. Therefore, the horse (马mǎ) also appears associated in language with nobility (侯hòu) and, through a game of homophonies, with the monkey (猴hóu), hence if in a painting the monkey appears on top of the horse, it means the possibility of receiving an honorific title, that is, of elevating the status.
 A horse can develop a lot of energy, with the most capable being those who travel a thousand miles (千里马Qiānlǐmǎ), whether equine or human, because there are also people overflowing with capacity and energy, like these animals, with those who had the blessing of being born under the good auspices of the Horse being in a more favorable position to cultivate enthusiasm and dynamism. This year of Fire.
 The suggestion is to return to the Classic of Changes (易经Yì jīng), to try to understand what the Fire hexagram has to offer, which is adherent and brilliant, composed of two trigrams of Fire (离下、离上 Lí Xià, Li Shàng), therefore the representation of the element in a pure state, thus enabling the understanding of the fundamental characteristics of the Fire Horse that enters in the middle of February. In Richard Wilhelm's interpretation, translated into English by Cary F. Baynes (1989, 118-121), we read that fire is dependent, it is always conditioned to something or someone else, for example to the combustion of Wood, only in this way can it be so alive and bright, and the more it burns, the more it rises from the earth towards the sky. In the judgment of the lines it is informed that if you adhere with perseverance like a cow, you will be guaranteed success (離，利貞，亨。畜牝牛，吉。2) (Zhang, 1995,131). Regarding his image, he appears to illuminate and doubly so, since when he shines he does so for himself and for others (《象》明兩作，離；大人以繼明，照於四方) (Zhang, 1995,135)., just as the sun shines and warms the earth throughout the day.  Being a conditioned element, like all others, in a world of interdependence, everything that does not burn positively and for good must be abandoned, just like the ancient Chinese leaders at the end of the dynasties who stopped being model and became capricious and destructive.
 The positive energy of the Fire Horse is like a beneficent sun that inspires everyone.
 If you ask the greatest of all Chinese poets, Li Bai (701-762), here in the translation by António Graça de Abreu, in One Hundred Poems of Li Bai 李白诗一百首 what virtues he associates with the horse, we read in response, for example, in “Your bay horse 君马黄” which is friendship and life experience, with its highs and low, but always worthy of being lived in the company of good friends:
君马黄，我马白。
马色虽不同，人心本无隔。
共作游治盘，双行洛阳陌。
长剑既照曜，高冠何赤3赫。
各有千金裘，俱为五侯客。
猛虎落陷阱，壮士时屈厄。
Article
Your horse is bay
my horse is white.
Different color of horses,
similar to the hearts of friends.
Through the streets of Luoyang
we know happy days,
sword at waist, tall hats,
valuable fur coats.
guests of five marquises.
Even tigers fall into the trap.
Today strong and brave,
Tomorrow subject to the misadventures of luck.
If such a day happens,
Help from a friend.
(Abreu, 2021, 174)
 In a leap forward to contemporary times, we will find in the poet Yao Feng (1958-), in Palavras Cansadas da Gramática (2014), the same traditional reading and an interesting identification with the horse, in “Cavalo Velho”, preserving the idea of friendship that extends throughout the Chinese centuries, but in an inverted presentation of the free condition of the animal, which appears, as happens mutatis mutandis to so many people, sad and imprisoned, unnaturally, in a cart, that is, a social condition, translated into the provision of services to others:
  Accustomed to the coachman, to passers-by, to cars
  Forgotten what it's like to gallop
  Dirty, sagging skin, gloomy as the end of the day
  Ironed hulls make the trail on the flat
  Even longer
  Sitting in a noisy village tavern
  I saw a horse bent under the weight of the cart
  Pull up and I would like
  To tell him in his language:
  Come in here, old friend, I'll buy you a drink!
  (Yao, 2014, 122)
It is certainly against the essential nature of equids to allow themselves to be imprisoned. They, who love to run freely across the prairies and steppes, through the mountains and valleys, can be domesticated by friendship, suffering and participating in the place of the social order that humans have destined for them. And like people, they also age, losing much of the vigor and energy they were born with, which is reflected in skin that loses its shine and sags. But while they are in the strength of life, and if they are lucky enough to remain free, there is no greater dynamism than theirs.
To conclude, my poetic tribute to the Year of the Horse that gallops towards us brimming with strength, enthusiasm and joy:
Fire Horse
Beautiful, fast, dreamy,
Run against the pain,
Growing in wind or breeze
in the wake of flowers,
They dancing in the passage,
paws loaded with earth and heat.
Beautiful, fast, dreamy,
carry the monkey,
And on the back the dragon,
they call it the Spirit
of the Dragon Horse.
龙马精神
Horse-Dragon Spirit,
In a year that brings shine
and the light like heralds,
sounding strong and loud.

Carlos Piteira, president of Casa de Macau, highlights the importance of creating bridges with Casa de Goa through the “parallel representation of Portuguese descendants”
What role can Casa de Macau and Casa de Goa, in Lisbon, have, taking into account the passage of time and the developments brought by the new generations of the Macanese and Goan communities? It is true that Macau and Goa have long ceased to be part of the former Portuguese empire, but sociocultural ties remain. With this in mind, the lecture “Casa de Goa and Casa de Macau: fundamental agents of an indispensable dialogue” took place yesterday at the Lisbon Geography Society, which sought to outline answers to the challenges of the future.
To HM, Carlos Piteira, president of the Casa de Macau in Lisbon, declared that “it would be interesting if the bridges between the Casa de Macau and the Casa de Goa could also be considered in parallel with their representation of Portuguese descendants and mixed cultures”, taking into account that the two entities “are fundamental pillars for the representation of these communities”.
The person responsible, himself Macanese, highlights “the similarities of their gastronomy, Creole and festivities” between the two communities. It would therefore be “interesting to combine the small representations of the giants of the Asian world, represented by the symbolism of the Dragon and the Elephant, as structuring elements for a dialogue between Portugal and Asia, political and institutional wills permit”.
In Carlos Piteira's view, the two houses “reinforce the legitimized heritage of the dialogue between the West and the East, and Portugal's centuries-old relations with these countries, often ignored and forgotten by official and institutional powers”.
Pedro Colaço, from the management of Casa de Goa, highlights the importance of preserving the memory of the Portuguese presence both in Goa and in the remaining territories of Daman and Diu. "There have been 450 years of history, in the case of Macau it was a few more decades, and we try to keep up with current Goan culture. One of the most important parts of our work is to build a bridge between Goa and Lisbon, and on a daily basis we contact artists, musicians and members of the community, that is our role", he described to HM. Pedro Colaço gave the example of the concert that will take place on March 8th at Fundação Oriente, in Lisbon, entitled “Oscar Castellino – Voz de Ópera de Goa and Piano with Rodrigo Ayala”.
De resto, a Casa de Goa, actualmente sem sede própria, procura, tal como a Casa de Macau, atrair novos sócios, sobretudo das novas gerações, a fim de dar continuidade ao projecto, para que a Casa se mantenha “como um polo de união dos goeses e, cada vez mais, dos amigos de Goa”. 
Acompanhar a história 
A Casa de Macau foi fundada em Lisboa em 1966 e tem acompanhado diversas fases não só da história de Portugal como do relacionamento do país com Macau e a China. 
"The existence of the House of Macau undoubtedly marks a parallel with the history of Portugal itself for more than 70 years. Macau was the 'pearl of the East' for the Estado Novo and lived through the turmoil of the revolutionary period of April 1974, adapting and establishing itself as the 'bridge between the West and East'". Finally, after the transition to the People's Republic of China, we have seen the reorganization [of Macau] as a central territory in the connection, from China, with Portuguese-speaking countries.”
Carlos Piteira also described that the House of Macau has followed “the history of the times, expanding the vision of the Portuguese presence in this territory”. Furthermore, he had a “no less important” task, having “crystallized, protected and perpetuated the Macanese community in Portugal and the world”.
Currently, Casa de Macau has developed several activities that bring more members to Avenida Gago Coutinho, where it is located, and whose building has recently undergone restoration work. Every Wednesday there are Macanese food lunches with Chef Tina, originally from Macau, as well as film sessions and lectures.
The Casa's mission is currently “to carry out activities to promote Macau and Macanese culture”, providing “support and promotion of studies and works of scientific content about Macau, Macau people” and also providing “institutional interconnection with other entities linked to Macau, Portugal and Casas de Macau in the diaspora”.
Who is from Goa and who is not
Pedro Colaço explained that the Goan community in Lisbon “has an easier time talking to the remaining Indian diaspora” in Portugal, taking into account that, for example, “the connection is very old” with the Hindu community.
“We are sorry that sometimes [the community] is not talked about more in the media, because it is an important part of Portuguese history”, laments the person in charge, remembering prominent figures in the country, such as António Costa, who was Portuguese prime minister, or Narana Coissoró, former president of Casa de Goa and former deputy of the CDS-PP. “There are more notorious figures, but in general the Goan community has integrated itself very well and is known for being a very educated community”, he also recalled, regretting that in Portugal it is not possible to make a distinction between communities of Indian origin.
"One thing that is worrying is the lack of knowledge that exists in relation to the communities. Nowadays there is a lot of pressure due to immigration and then everything gets mixed up", highlights Pedro Colaço, remembering that there is a strong feeling in being Goan, particularly in connection with Catholicism and a very unique culture as opposed to Hindustani communities that are currently very present in Portugal.
"The Goan community is so mixed that half of my family, or more, do not appear to be Goan, but I, by chance, do. There is a feeling of being Goan, something that unites us. The other communities of the Indian diaspora are often confessional, they have an associated religion, while the Goan community is, for the most part, Catholic, but everyone goes to their own church, it is very spread out", he pointed out.
The future is a challenge
Pedro Colaço speaks of a “challenging future” for Casa de Goa. "I'm now in my second term, the leadership has changed president, and one of the things we've been trying to do is to bring young people into the governing bodies. We now have three or four younger members, under the age of 40. We've also been trying to expand the House to non-Goans."
In this point, there are similarities with the Casa de Macau, which has also sought to expand the range of members to Chinese or Portuguese people who do not belong to the community. Pedro Colaço adds that, over the years, things have changed.
"30 years ago the community was very large, but at this moment, and like all institutions, we have to expand. There are many people who really like Goa and who know a lot about the territory, perhaps even more than me, and they are the ones who have to be pulled", he assumed.
Currently, Casa de Goa has 500 members and, even without a headquarters, it seeks to carry out activities, particularly in partnership with Fundação Oriente. A monthly bulletin is published. They no longer have headquarters due to the metro works in Lisbon, which has made the House's agenda difficult.
“We are in the process of finding a new headquarters, and it is something that has been a constraint, but we try to carry out as many activities as possible and, every month, we always have activities”, concluded Pedro Colaço.</description><pubDate>2026-02-13 01:37:41</pubDate></item><item><title>Macau Lawyers Association declares support for the State Security Defense Commission law</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/12/associacao-dos-advogados-de-macau-declara-apoio-a-lei-de-comissao-de-defesa-da-seguranca-do-estado/</link><description>The Macau Lawyers Association, chaired by former deputy Vong Hin Fai, considers the requirements required by the proposed law that will regulate the State Security Defense Commission to be reasonable and necessary. In an opinion article signed by the association, published in the newspaper Ou Mun, the veto on the participation of lawyers in any process considered in any way related to national security is defended.
In the text, the association argues that many countries and regions have similar laws, pointing to the examples of the Special Advocate Statute in the United Kingdom and Canada, the classified information procedures law in the United States of America and the regulation of legal practitioners in Hong Kong.
All the regimes mentioned by AAM are based on legal systems of the Common Law style, the British tradition, which contrasts with the reality of Macau, which adopts a legal system of the so-called continental tradition, with roots in Germany and France and which also applies to Portugal.
Full support
The association also said that it agrees and supports the proposed law, as it considers that it advances and improves the commission's duties and competencies while “fully applying the general perspective of national security”.
The association also cites the justification note to emphasize that “the defense of State security constitutes a constitutional responsibility of the Macao SAR”.
The Macau Lawyers Association also highlighted that Macau must “implement the decisions and instructions of the Central Government within the scope of national security” and that this proposed law, by strengthening the powers of the commission, will maintain “coherence with the norms of the Hong Kong national security law” and “coordinate with the Electoral Law for the Chief Executive and the Electoral Law for the Legislative Assembly”.</description><pubDate>2026-02-12 19:25:40</pubDate></item><item><title>Security | Macao SAR rulers applaud White Paper on Hong Kong</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/12/seguranca-governantes-da-raem-aplaudem-livro-branco-sobre-hong-kong/</link><description>China has released a new White Paper on national security, on Hong Kong, which is entitled “Practice of Safeguarding National Security in Hong Kong under ‘One Country, Two Systems.’ In the Macao SAR, secretaries and political leaders reacted positively, saying that the document provides guarantees of stability and is a reference for Macau
Days after the conviction in Hong Kong of Jimmy Lai, a media entrepreneur who founded the now-defunct Apple Daily newspaper, China launches a new White Paper focused on the need to safeguard national security in neighboring territory. The “Practice of Safeguarding National Security in Hong Kong under ‘One Country, Two Systems'” was published by the Communication Department of China's State Council on Tuesday.
According to the Xinhua news agency, this White Paper consists of five parts, detailing “the persistent struggle to safeguard national security in Hong Kong and the fundamental responsibility of the Central Government in national security matters related to Hong Kong”.
In the same note, it is explained that the White Paper “exposes the achievements of the HKSAR in fulfilling its constitutional responsibility to safeguard national security” and also “Hong Kong’s transition from chaos to stability and prosperity”.
“Efforts to create [a security landscape] of high standard are not forgotten in order to promote the high-quality development of the ‘One Country, Two Systems' policy”, in addition to being explained that “the Central Government applied a holistic approach to national security”.
In this context, “it effectively exercised general jurisdiction over the HKSAR, in accordance with the country's Constitution and the Basic Law of the HKSAR”, and the Law on Safeguarding National Security “has been applied in the region” and has ensured “that Hong Kong is administered by patriots”.
On the Macao SAR side, the government apparatus reacted positively to this White Paper, after the bill that presents a new format and composition of the Macao SAR State Security Defense Commission, created in 2018, was generally approved in the Legislative Assembly.
Chan Tsz King, Secretary for Security, was one of the political figures who reacted to the document, which considers “ensuring the stable and lasting implementation” of the “One Country, Two Systems” principle.
Quoted in an official note, the secretary understands that the White Paper comes to “clarify the intrinsic unity between political principles and institutional logic, causing Hong Kong society to return to normality and order to be restored”.
The document, in the secretary's view, “serves as an important reference for the Macao SAR to review and improve the construction of its legal system in the context of defending the security of the State and the respective execution mechanism”.
Chan Tsz King highlights that his leadership will give “great importance to ensuring security in non-traditional areas under the new situation, establishing the long-term stability of the Macao SAR as a strategic objective”.
Firm as a rock
Also according to Xinhua, the White Paper describes how Beijing “supports the HKSAR in fulfilling its constitutional responsibility to safeguard national security by effectively preventing, interrupting and punishing any activities that put national security at risk”.
“The efforts” of the neighboring region to safeguard national security aim, according to the same document, to “sustain and develop” the principle created by Beijing to support Taiwan and the two special administrative regions, without forgetting the protection of “fundamental human rights, dignity and well-being of the 7.5 million residents of Hong Kong”.
The White Paper released by the State Council also states that “in today's world, and with unprecedented global transformations that have occurred in a century, they are accelerating, with the development environment facing China undergoing profound and complex changes”. In this way, “safeguarding national security is a long-term and permanent task”, it is said.
The White Paper states that Hong Kong “enjoys a high standard of security”, with the region “fated to overcome all risks and challenges in the future journey, remaining as stable as a rock in a turbulent world”.
Another political figure from the Macao SAR who reacted was Adriano Marques Ho, director-general of the Customs Service, saying that the White Paper “has an important guiding significance and a profound impact for the complete and accurate implementation of ‘One Country, Two Systems’ in the Hong Kong and Macau regions, for the realization of long-term prosperity and stability, and for their stable and sustainable progression”.
Adriano Marques Ho added that “both Hong Kong and Macau are inalienable and sacred parts of China”, and Beijing “has firmly and consistently maintained national sovereignty, security and development interests”.
In the view of the top Customs official, “the external hostile forces and anti-China elements disturbing Hong Kong incited and created the ‘legislative review riots’, which ended up evolving into a ‘color revolution’ version of Hong Kong, seriously damaging the constitutional order and the rule of law in Hong Kong, and putting national sovereignty, security and development interests at risk”.
End of the “chaotic situation”
Lam, Secretary for Social Affairs and Culture, said the White Paper “comprehensively analyzes and outlines Hong Kong's journey in defending national security, major achievements and experience gained”.
In the governor's view, “Hong Kong went from a chaotic situation to stability and prosperity”. In the case of Macau, the principles contained in the White Paper apply, with the secretary promising to “continue to intensify education, giving priority to the formation of a social base that supports the values ​​of love for the country and for Macau”.
In this context, the aim is to “develop a comprehensive educational system to increase the patriotic feeling of young people and consolidate the ideological foundation of national security through multidimensional educational activities and exchanges”.
It is promised that the Social Affairs and Culture department “will continue to promote national security using culture as a driving force, reinforcing the exploration and dissemination of Macau’s historical and cultural resources and organizing different types of exhibitions and cultural shows with unique characteristics”.
The idea is to “spread the excellent Chinese cultural heritage in order to resist the erosion of harmful cultures, reinforce the cultural and national identity of the population and unite the forces of different sectors of society through culture”.
Wong Sio Chak, Secretary for Administration and Justice, who for years held the Security portfolio, considers that the White Paper has “extreme relevance for Macao SAR issues relating to the defense of national security”, particularly with regard to “defending sovereignty, security and the development interests of the State”.
The promises are that the area of ​​Administration and Justice “will boost legislative production in the priority areas related to the defense of State security, continuing to improve the respective legal regime”, with “training courses on the Constitution, the Basic Law and legislation relating to the defense of State security aimed at public service workers at different levels”.
In turn, Tai Kin Ip, Secretary for Economy and Finance, described that “economic and financial security constitute non-traditional key domains among the twenty priority areas of the global vision of national security, and are also crucial factors in ensuring the stable development and long-term security of Macau and the country”.
Tai Kin Ip aims to “pragmatically promote the development of adequate diversification of the economy, strengthening Macau’s global economic resilience and maintaining a high level of attention to various risks and challenges in the economic and financial domain”.
Raymond Tam, Secretary for Transport and Public Works, said Macau must “cultivate an awareness of vigilance in times of peace, in order to consolidate the foundations of lasting stability and security”.
In this sense, the government official understands that “Macau must always put the safeguarding of the sovereignty, security and development interests of the State first”, and in terms of Transport and Public Works he promises to “persist in the predominance of Executive power, firmly integrating the safeguarding of national security in all tasks”.
Ao Ieong Seong, Commissioner against Corruption, believes that “the security and stability of the political environment and the good functioning of the system, with the predominance of the Executive branch, [guarantees that] the level of governance in the Macao SAR is increasingly higher”.
The commissioner highlighted “last year’s successful holding of the elections for the 8th Legislative Assembly, reinforcing the implementation of the principle of ‘Macau governed by patriots’ and effectively ensuring the lasting stability of the Macao SAR”.</description><pubDate>2026-02-12 02:37:06</pubDate></item><item><title>Heritage | Stories of the stores on Rua Cinco de Outubro told in a book</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/23/patrimonio-historias-das-lojas-da-rua-cinco-de-outubro-contadas-em-livro/</link><description>Natalie Fu has just released a book about traditional commerce on Rua Cinco de Outubro, at the invitation of the Macau Cultural Heritage Reinvention Studies Association. “Macao’s Historical House Taxonomy – The Shophouses at the Rua Cinco de Outubro” tells the centuries-old story of shophouses that were the “heart of Macau’s Chinese community”
A book has just been published that reveals a little about the history of commerce carried out by the Chinese community on Rua Cinco de Outubro, located in Porto Interior, the scene of many commercial movements over the centuries. The work also explains how these stores, which are at the same time houses, reveal details about the history of Macau.
“Macao’s Historical House Taxonomy – The Shophouses at the Rua Cinco de Outubro”, written by Natalie Fu, a doctoral student at the University of São José, was invited by the Association for Studies on the Reinvention of Cultural Heritage of Macau, whose edition also depends on “the support and assistance of many other people”, the author told HM. One of the book's sales outlets, which does not have a Portuguese version, is Pin-to Livros.
“The investigation began with the love for Macau and its old buildings”, reveals the author, who began the research work around these buildings in 2022, in the middle of the pandemic.
"Rua de Cinco de Outubro has always been an important commercial area in Macau. Once, it was the heart of Macau's Chinese community. Even today, many old stores remain close to the local neighborhood. The stores are mixed-use buildings", explains the author.
This is the stage for commercial diversity, as Rua Cinco de Outubro “is home to several businesses, such as traditional Chinese bakeries, Chinese medicine stores, tea shops and fruit shops”.
According to the presentation of the work, made on social media by the association itself, this type of property constitutes “a common type of multifunctional residential building”, where the “plan of the buildings is generally rectangular, with two to three floors”. Typically, the ground floor is used for the store or as a warehouse, while the upper floors are reserved for housing.
"This type of construction can adapt to the local climate, presenting great flexibility in the construction methods and materials used. Due to the diversity of daily uses, shop houses were once the main type of building on the streets of Macau, having important historical, social, cultural, architectural and aesthetic value", it further reads.
Preservation Challenges
Still according to the same note, the book draws attention to the importance of preserving this type of construction and, consequently, a symbol of local heritage. “Unfortunately, because they are small-scale and scattered buildings, and because they are not fully protected by the Macau Heritage Protection Law, they have been gradually disappearing with the rapid development of society”, and, currently, “only a small number of these buildings have the classification of ‘monument’ and are protected”.
For Natalie Fu, “the preservation of Macau's stores faces many challenges, one of which is the fact that they are not included in the existing list of protected old buildings in Macau”, in addition to that, in her view, “changes in construction laws have also made it difficult to maintain these old buildings”.
Asked about the future of this iconic street in Porto Interior, the author recognizes that “the growth of a city inevitably involves the renovation and disappearance of buildings”, so “determining which buildings should be preserved and how to preserve them is a long-term challenge”.
Natalie Fu even talks about the need to extend the investigation to more streets in Macau that are also traditional shopping areas. "Research and documentation of the stores on Rua Cinco de Outubro and in Macau are urgent as their number is dwindling. Additionally, additional academic investigations and discussions with the local community are needed to inform the future direction of the Inner Harbor area."
In relation to the panorama on Rua Cinco de Outubro, the author describes that maintenance should be focused on, keeping commercial spaces open. "Stores that are kept in use better highlight their social value. Taking some stores on Rua Cinco de Outubro as an example, the existence of century-old stores further emphasizes the cultural and historical value of the area and the stores. Furthermore, 'keeping them in use' allows for more immediate monitoring and maintenance, which is the most direct way of protecting ancient architecture."
A certain influence
In a territory characterized by the coexistence of Portuguese and Chinese cultures, Natalie Fu's book shows how these houses were influenced by other cultures. “Chinese and Western architecture in Macau have always influenced each other throughout historical development, and this feature is particularly visible in the appearance of the shop houses.” In this way, this book helps to cement this characteristic, “establishing a classification system for Macau’s shop houses, consolidating their architectural definition”.
This book is, therefore, a “classifying study of the old shop houses in Macau”, constituting “the first step towards their safeguarding”, describes, in the same note, the association that supported the editorial and research project.
"The author carried out a detailed record and survey [of the stores], starting with visits and cartography surveys in the Porto Interior area. Maps were drawn up of the location of the shop houses on that street, analysis sheets based on fieldwork, photographic records and interviews with current traders and residents, in order to understand the history of the use of each building."
Furthermore, the work documents seven cases in particular, “providing information on their history, evolution and current use, as well as a preliminary discussion on possible preservation directions”. The book also records two examples of shop houses that have now disappeared. “It is hoped that this work will encourage more people to discover the ‘beauty of Macau.’ With the shop houses as a central theme, it is expected to promote exchange and discussion between academics from different areas”, the association also points out.
Natalie Fu invited “several experts and academics to share their ideas, experiences and suggestions on the protection and future of this type of buildings”, it is described.
Born and raised in Macau, Natalie Fu had the opportunity to visit all of Southeast Asia from a young age, trips that led her to “foster a deep appreciation and passion for architecture”. The author has a degree in Architecture, also describing herself as a person interested in the area of ​​heritage conservation and a “historical architecture scholar trained in Macau”.</description><pubDate>2026-02-23 05:20:58</pubDate></item><item><title>Security Committee | Jurists warn of contradiction to the Basic Law</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/11/comissao-de-seguranca-juristas-alertam-para-contrariedade-a-lei-basica/</link><description>Despite support for national security issues, the requirements of the State Security Defense Commission's proposed law are considered contrary and incomprehensible in light of Macau's legal framework
Analysts interviewed by Lusa consider the proposed law for the Commission for the Defense of State Security, voted yesterday in the Legislative Assembly, to be unconstitutional, highlighting “disturbing aspects”, such as restrictions on the appointment of lawyers in national security cases.
The proposed law that will frame the State Security Defense Commission (CDSE) was discussed and voted on in general by deputies to the Legislative Assembly yesterday.
The document, according to Macau-based lawyer Luís Almeida Pinto, “contains disturbing aspects of the constitutional functioning of various powers, and also in some matters of rights, freedoms and guarantees enshrined in the Macau ‘Constitution’: the Basic Law”.
Anticipating changes to the Basic Law of the Judicial Organization, the proposal determines that the choice of a lawyer for national security cases is subject to the approval of a judge, who forwards the request to the CDSE, so that it can issue a binding and non-appealable opinion.
Special authorization, the Government proposes, can occur in criminal or other proceedings, when “there are well-founded reasons to believe that there is a need to protect the interests of State security”.
Almeida Pinto evokes the Basic Law, which guarantees “access to the Law, the courts, and assistance from a lawyer in the defense of their legitimate rights and interests”, to point out that it is up to the defendant “to freely choose the lawyer who best serves him”. “It seems like a rule that will be unconstitutional when approved, and when applied in practice”, he explains.
Collision with Lawyer's Statute
In addition to being “a violation of the Basic Law”, with constitutional force in Macau, Pedro Leal, who has practiced law in the territory for several decades, points out “clearly, a collision” between what is proposed and “the decree that regulates the Lawyers Association and the Statute” of the Lawyer, with regard to the free choice of a defender.
This is the “most debatable issue” of the proposal, assumes Leal, who says he agrees with the legislative initiative. "China pays special attention to security issues, it is a world power, as such it does not want interference in any way. I understand the position and I understand that it does not want changes to the 'status quo'. (…) Now, they want to do things, do them well", he adds.
Speaking to Lusa, Almeida Pinto also considers the regime envisaged to be “unacceptable” for “inquiries to be made to lawyers” who wish to legally represent a defendant in national security cases. Attached to the request made by the agents to the judge, there must be, among other elements, information regarding the members of the lawyer's household, nationality and connection with organizations or individuals abroad.
This is a “real investigation into personal life”, when “what is only at stake is the exercise of the profession for which he is duly registered and authorized by the Macau Lawyers Association”, he says.
The requirement, “in addition to being extremely vague, is perfectly impossible” to implement, assesses Leal, who suggests “it is implicit” that a non-Chinese lawyer will not be authorized representation in these cases – it should be noted that in cases of national security, only the intervention of Chinese judges is now permitted.
Question of times
Another doubt, raised to Lusa by jurist António Katchi, concerns the time it will take for the CDSE to issue the opinion. The proposal does not clarify this aspect, so the Code of Administrative Procedure “should” be applied, which sets the deadline for acts to be carried out by administrative bodies at 15 days.
But, says Katchi, “will the CDSE follow this same understanding or will it consider (without the possibility of this being denied by any court) that it can simply leave the issue to its next semi-annual ordinary meeting?”.
If the opinion is negative and it is necessary to repeat the process, with a new legal representative, “how many months or years will the defendant remain deprived of his liberty, without a lawyer”?
Alluding to the principle of judicial independence, which he recalls is guaranteed by the Basic Law, António Katchi deduces “with complete certainty, the inadmissibility of subjecting a judicial decision to a binding opinion from an administrative body, namely the CDSE”.
The professor also talks about the importance of a relationship of trust between constituent and lawyer and “how vital it is, for a person at risk of a prison sentence, to be defended by a lawyer who is sincerely motivated by the cause and well versed in the matter involved”.
In addition to the Basic Law and the Joint Declaration, signed by Lisbon and Beijing in 1987, and which defined rules for Macau after the transition of administration, Katchi highlights another legal provision that the proposal contradicts: the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), according to which, he quotes, “every person accused of a crime shall have the right, in full equality, (…) to present himself at trial and to defend himself in person or to be assisted by a defender of your choice.”
The ICCPR is one of the instruments that constitute the UN International Bill of Human Rights. In 1992, when Macau was still a territory administered by Portugal, Lisbon extended this convention to the region. Although China signed the treaty in 1998, it never ratified it, and is not bound by its rules.
The Basic Law, explains António Katchi, points out that restrictions on fundamental rights, including the right to be assisted by a lawyer, “cannot contradict the provisions of the ICCPR”.</description><pubDate>2026-02-11 02:16:02</pubDate></item><item><title>Cooperation | Relations between China and Timor-Leste guided by caution, study indicates</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/10/cooperacao-relacoes-entre-china-e-timor-leste-pautadas-por-cautela-indica-estudo/</link><description>It is certain that, by being part of the “One Belt, One Road” initiative, Timor-Leste can become a strategic point in commercial relations on this side of the globe, despite the “cautious pragmatism” in relations with China. The conclusion is from a study on Timorese foreign policy within the scope of the Chinese initiative, authored by three Portuguese academics
Timor-Leste, a young country, has been cementing its relations with China, namely through the “One Belt, One Road” initiative, but there is still some caution surrounding this relationship. This is one of the conclusions of the study “Timor-Leste's foreign policy options within the scope of China's Belt and Road 2.0 Initiative: a small state perspective”, authored by academics Tiago Botelho dos Santos, Diogo Borges and Paulo Afonso Duarte. The work was published in The Pacific Review, an academic journal edited by Taylor &amp; Francis.
The research work starts with Timor-Leste's adherence to the Chinese initiative, something that happened in 2017, to analyze how the relationship with China has been going, taking into account the fact that Timor-Leste has “the status of a small state”.
It is concluded, therefore, that “Timor-Leste's involvement with China's Belt and Road Initiative, particularly in the post-2023 period, can be understood as a strategic and calculated attempt to maximize its status as a small state in a complex regional and global environment”. It is described that, in this period, Timorese foreign policy has been characterized “by a multi-vector approach, strategically anchored in multilateralism”, seeking to “diversify international partnerships to reinforce national security, promote economic development and expand its voice in the international system”.
The study points out that relations between Timor-Leste and China, in the context of the Belt and Road initiative, are a “deliberate movement to leverage development opportunities” in the country, being a strategy aligned with the Timor-Leste Strategic Development Plan 2011-2030.
The plan aims to “promote economic diversification and the development of critical infrastructure, in a context in which the Belt and Road 2.0 Initiative emphasizes digital infrastructure, green energy and cooperation in the area of ​​health”.
Timorese potential
The three academics also highlight that Timor-Leste, as part of the Chinese geopolitical initiative, has the potential to stand out economically, and also in commercial terms, in the region. The country has “the potential to assert itself as a logistical center on a route that connects the South Indian Ocean to the South Pacific”, so the Chinese initiative “offers a relevant opportunity to significantly increase its regional prominence and decisively facilitate” integration into ASEAN [Association of Southeast Asian Nations], to which Timor-Leste recently joined.
Despite all these positive signs, the study concludes that “although Timor-Leste's relationship with China has deepened, culminating in a comprehensive strategic partnership in 2024, its engagement continues to be marked by cautious pragmatism”.
In this context, “the benefits of greater connectivity and investment are carefully weighed against concerns regarding debt sustainability, transparency and possible strategic dependencies”. This caution on the part of Timor-Leste demonstrates its “capacity for action by selectively engaging in projects aligned with its national interests”, navigating the “complexities of competition between great powers in the Indo-Pacific, while maintaining its commitment to a balanced and diversified foreign policy”.
Timorese pragmatism is also evident, according to the study, in the fact that the country “not only optimizes development opportunities, but also reinforces its regional position by meticulously analyzing economic benefits in the face of potential risks”. What is strengthened, “ultimately”, is the “capacity for action as a small State”, highlight the authors.
A “remarkable” ability
The study in question highlights how Timor-Leste has had “a remarkable capacity for action” in the context of the “One Belt, One Road” initiative, using other small States, such as Sri Lanka, as a point of comparison.
Citing other studies, the three academics highlight how “Timor-Leste has demonstrated a more cautious approach than countries like Sri Lanka, which have faced significant concerns about debt sustainability associated with BRI [Belt and Road Initiative] projects, or landlocked states like Laos and coastal nations like Cambodia.”
In the case of these Southeast Asian countries, “Chinese loans for emblematic projects, such as railways and highways, have drastically increased external debt and dependence on Beijing”.
What we sought to do in this investigation was “to examine the unique position of Timor-Leste, not as a financier, but also not as a victim of a ‘debt trap'”, highlighting “the distinct and valuable form of action capacity of a small State within the scope of the BRI”.
The authors highlight that, in the last decade, China “significantly expanded its presence in Southeast Asia” through the “One Belt, One Road” initiative, thereby “expanding its regional influence in the economic, security and political spheres”. In this relationship, Timor-Leste has been “far from being a passive observer”, seeking to “actively engage with China to ensure development benefits”.
Timor-Leste sought to “identify an opportunity to align with the long-term objectives” of its 2011-2030 Strategic Development Plan, analysts indicate.
“Strategically, the country also intends to capitalize on its geographic position in emerging commercial maritime routes, particularly through the establishment of a logistics hub in the South Indian Ocean and the South Pacific, potentially reinforcing its regional role as a new integrated member state of ASEAN”, point out the authors.
Timor-Leste seeks to “balance economic gains and potential dependencies”, in a geopolitical context that “includes competition between great powers in the Indo-Pacific, where United States policies, under successive administrations, aim to contain China's regional influence”.
In methodological terms, the authors carried out this investigation based on reading official reports, documents that serve as the basis for signed bilateral agreements and government documentation. In addition, interviews were carried out with “experts based in both Europe and Asia”.
The authors state that they sought to interview academics and diplomats “due to the fact that ordinary citizens are generally unfamiliar with China's global multilateral initiatives, while diplomats tend to be excessively cautious in their statements, as they represent the official position of their state, and not necessarily their personal opinions”.
It is therefore understood that academics “tend to offer more balanced and rigorous analyses”. The questions focused on how Timor-Leste, as a small State, has benefited from the Chinese initiative, whether this initiative is compatible with the Timor-Leste Strategic Development Plan 2011-2030, or whether “there are visible dangers of creating dependency” between the two countries, among other issues.</description><pubDate>2026-02-10 01:54:12</pubDate></item><item><title>USJ | Book highlights panorama of philanthropy in Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/09/usj-livro-destaca-panorama-da-filantropia-em-macau/</link><description>The book “Media, Art &amp; Technology in the Nine Portuguese Speaking Cultures” has just been published by the University of São José. One of the chapters deals with philanthropy in Macau, the discreet profile of philanthropists and the work of entities such as Fundação Rui Cunha, Banco Nacional Ultramarino and Fundação Oriente
The University of São José (USJ) has just published the book “Media, Art &amp; Technology in the Nine Portuguese Speaking Cultures”, edited by professor José Manuel Simões. As the name indicates, the work aims to outline the panorama of arts, media and culture in the nine Portuguese-speaking countries and regions, which includes Macau.
Macao SAR is represented with a chapter dedicated to philanthropy, written by Carmen Zita Monereo, post-doctoral student at USJ, entitled “The Impact of Corporate Philanthropy on Media, Art, and Technology in Macao / What do we know about Philanthropy in Macao? What is the relationship between Confucianism, Philanthropy, Media, and strategic communication?”.
“Carmen has been developing a study on philanthropy in Macau, which is a slightly different work than the rest”, she began by telling HM José Manuel Simões. "This is a work that contributes to the analysis of the spectrum of philanthropists in Macau, then outlining a study on the Rui Cunha Foundation, Banco Nacional Ultramarino, Fundação Oriente. It looks at what corporate philanthropy is and the impacts it has on society through an analysis of the media, but also art and technology in Macau. In other words, it questions what we know about philanthropy in Macau and what is the relationship between Confucianism, philanthropy, the media and strategic communication.”
José Manuel Simões adds that one of the innovative points in this chapter is the discreet profile of philanthropists. “A curious aspect is that, unlike philanthropists from Europe and the United States, who really like to appear in rankings, in Macau there is greater discretion and a low profile of these people linked to philanthropy, and this has to do with the culture itself.”
The editor of the work adds that “in the field of communication sciences [in Macau] philanthropy has gained great importance as a communication instrument”, and that Carmen Zita Monereo’s work “identifies the values ​​of an organizational culture that is capable of generating communication flows conducive to innovation through this philanthropic activity”.
The book, which is available for free in digital version, “seeks to draw links between various vectors, and one of them is the nine Portuguese-speaking cultures”, without forgetting Macau “as a connection platform between China and Portuguese-speaking countries”.
According to José Manuel Simões, it is a book “whose research was developed seeking to adopt a multidisciplinary approach”, having “an academic nature, but, at the same time, it aims to have a simple and accessible language”.
Cape Verde’s good example
With a bilingual edition, the book presents “a very broad spectrum” of themes, containing an article by José Manuel Simões on São Tomé and Príncipe, entitled “Digital Media Contribution to Entrepreneurship and Development in São Tomé and Príncipe”. Below is an article on the educational panorama in Angola and the use of artificial intelligence (AI), written by Wilson Gomes Caldeira, entitled “Angola’s higher education system: An analysis of the opportunities and challenges presented by Artificial Intelligence”.
In the case of Cape Verde, Silvino Lopes Évora explores the ideas of social communication in conjunction with AI, in “Artificial Intelligence, newsroom culture, and journalism: From international spectrum to experiences in Cape Verde”.
“Cape Verde is a good example of media development in Africa and Silvino Évora's text works on the AI ​​component in the media and how it is being inserted. [The text also analyzes] what are the possibilities for using AI and how ethics can monitor and support AI and, at the same time, journalism”, adds José Manuel Simões.
The book published by USJ also explores, in the chapter “The media system as a leverage for democratic development in East Timor”, by Paulo Faustino and Rui Alexandre Novais, the links between journalism and the historical memories of the independence process.
The book's editor explains the “more historical component regarding the role of remission that journalists still have today to almost preserve the memory of those who died in favor of the country's independence”.
"Journalism is of enormous importance in Timor, there were people and journalists who died. This is very little talked about and in this study there is an interesting conclusion, that these people, when they died in the name of freedom of expression, left a very important place in Timor-Leste that is still in force today, seeking to preserve their memory through surveillance over other powers."
In this way, “Timor-Leste is almost an example of how journalism should act as a watchdog of other powers, which does not happen in other sectors”.
José Manuel Simões highlights the case of Guinea-Bissau, “where journalists are called hired mouths”. "They don't know the difference between advertising, public relations, marketing and journalism, because they are conditioned by a very low salary. They write what they ask for in exchange for an envelope with some money inside, and this makes the profession [of journalism] very fragile in Guinea Bissau", he stressed.
A language of unity
According to José Manuel Simões, the book aims to unite “these quadrants of Portuguese cultures”, and the English edition aims to reach Anglo-Saxon communities, “so that they know about the existence of these cultures”.
"There are those who do not agree with me regarding the idea that the Portuguese language is a language of unity, not only among Portuguese-speaking peoples, but even within each country. We have the case of Timor-Leste, which on the island of Ataúro alone, which is very small, with 500 thousand inhabitants, has 40 dialects, one in each village. There, what does the Portuguese language do? It unites these people, because despite there being a difference between the who speak and those who learned Portuguese, in Timor-Leste, today, the elderly speak Portuguese and young people too, but there is the age group that goes from 25 to 50, who do not speak it. But, because it is a language of learning, because it is official, because it has books, a memory, Portuguese unites all these ethnicities and dialects, and has a common value, because the Portuguese language is everyone's mother tongue”, he explains.
José Manuel Simões does not forget the work that CPLP – Community of Portuguese Speaking Countries, has done in this regard. "The CPLP had a wonderful idea of ​​uniting us through language, but the CPLP has done vague, limited and barely visible work. In fact, very few people have done a worthy job of creating links between new Portuguese-speaking cultures. In this sense, this book fills a gap and brings new data about these new cultures, with this technological and innovative dynamic", this in relation to the QR codes for all chapters of the book. Each code gives access to a video that summarizes the author's work in each chapter.
In global terms, “Media, Art &amp; Technology in the Nine Portuguese Speaking Cultures” aims to be comprehensive in areas such as technology, art, culture and social communication. There is, however, “a common denominator, creating, curiously, a certain harmony, even with different focuses, and ends up covering, directly and indirectly, the spectrum of social communication”, he concludes.</description><pubDate>2026-02-09 02:56:18</pubDate></item><item><title>STD | Portuguese market is a priority</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/23/dst-mercado-portugues-e-prioritario/</link><description>The director of the Tourism Services (DST), Maria Helena de Senna Fernandes, said that Portugal will be one of Macau's priorities when it comes to attracting more foreign visitors. In a message broadcast by public broadcaster TDM – Teledifusao de Macau, regarding the Lunar Year of the Fire Horse, Senna Fernandes pointed out among the targets for this year “European markets, such as Portugal and Spain”.
The director also mentioned Southeast Asia, Northeast Asia – a region that includes Japan, Mongolia and the Far East of Russia – and “the emerging tourist markets in the Middle East and Central Asia”. Senna Fernandes predicted that Macau will receive 41 million visitors in 2026, after reaching close to 40.1 million visitors last year, a new historic high. The majority (90.6 percent) of tourists came from Mainland China or Hong Kong.
Tourism | Flat orders to encourage consumption
Deputy Chan Lai Kei wants the Government to draw lessons from tourism statistics and visitor consumption patterns to implement measures that increase tourists' stay in Macau and commerce in residential neighborhoods off the tourist trail. In a written question, the deputy linked to the Fujian community indicated that during this Lunar New Year, the Government invested a lot of resources into organizing large events, which failed to benefit small and medium-sized companies in areas less popular with tourists.
Chan Lai Kei argues that the Government should improve the transport system during national holiday periods, in order to facilitate visits to residential neighborhoods, far from the most popular tourism centers. The deputy also asked the Sam Hou Fai Executive for practical measures to improve the experiences of international tourists and eliminate current obstacles, such as the lack of international electronic payments and language barriers.
Performance Venue | IC will launch new measures
The president of the Cultural Affairs Bureau (IC), Deland Leong, revealed that the IC will launch an online platform for companies to consult rental requests for the Macau Open-Air Performance Venue. The changes are part of the Government's objectives to “expand and reinforce the functions” of the concert venue and were revealed on the morning program Forum Macau on the Chinese channel Rádio Macau.
This objective had previously been revealed by the secretary for Social Affairs and Culture, O Lam, during the presentation of the Lines of Government Action, in the Legislative Assembly. At that time, the secretary pointed out that in the future the space could receive 3×3 basketball courts or other facilities for family sporting activities. Deland Leong also acknowledged that the Government will review some of the regulations and guidelines for the use of the space.</description><pubDate>2026-02-23 05:30:08</pubDate></item><item><title>Borders | Secretary wants security against external forces</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/23/fronteiras-secretario-quer-seguranca-contra-forcas-externas/</link><description>The Secretary for Security promised that the region will strengthen border security in 2026, “to avoid interference from external forces”. Chan Tsz King highlighted the importance of collaboration with secret agencies in Mainland China and Hong Kong
The Secretary for Security, Chan Tsz King, committed to strengthening security at Macau's border posts throughout this year, “to avoid interference from external forces”, but without pointing out any threats.
“We will further enhance security surveillance at sea and land ports to prevent interference from external forces,” Chan told public broadcaster TDM – Teledifusao de Macau.
In a message regarding the Lunar Year of the Fire Horse, which began last week, the leader did not identify the threats coming from abroad, but promised to “fully safeguard national security”. “We will continue to strengthen our intelligence collection and analysis capabilities, especially through ongoing intelligence exchanges with mainland China and Hong Kong,” Chan Tsz King also said.
In November, the secretary promised to create, in 2026, a risk warning system against national security and warned against “acts of interference and destruction” by “external forces”.
Dangerous discord
On July 31, Macau police announced the arrest of former deputy Au Kam San, a Portuguese citizen, in the first case under the national security law.
On February 5, the director of the Judicial Police assured journalists that there was sufficient evidence to justify Au Kam San's arrest. “There is a lot of evidence and we are entering the trial process, so we cannot disclose the details,” said Sit Chong Meng.
Three days earlier, human rights organization Human Rights Watch said Au Kam San's case illustrates the “erosion of autonomy and fundamental freedoms” in Macau.
In November, the head of the European Union (EU) Delegation in Hong Kong and Macau wrote on social media that he had met with Macau's Secretary for Economy and Finance, Anton Tai Kin Ip. “I also expressed concern about political issues,” added Briton Harvey Rouse. But the EU representation declined to reveal to Lusa whether the case against Au Kam San was mentioned at the meeting.
In September, during a visit to Macau, Prime Minister Luís Montenegro admitted that he did not discuss the detention of the Portuguese citizen with the territory's leader, Sam Hou Fai. “There are some issues that also deserve some modesty in their treatment and this is one of them”, defended the prime minister.</description><pubDate>2026-02-23 05:28:44</pubDate></item><item><title>Taxis | Women want the Government to control applications</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/23/taxis-mulheres-querem-que-governo-controle-aplicacoes/</link><description>The Women's Association argues that the use of online platforms to hail taxis should be subject to a permanent control mechanism by the Government.

In an article cited by public broadcaster TDM – Teledifusao de Macau, Iau argued that “the principle of exclusion of publicity” does not amount to “an absolute secret” of the trial.
In the article, published on Friday, the deputy argued that the proposal “is in accordance with the spirit” of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), applicable in Macau through the Basic Law.
Iau argued that a closed-door trial remains “a fair process” because lawyers maintain “different procedural rights”, which prevent “secret negotiations”. The jurist highlighted that countries such as France and Germany – with civil law, similar to that used in Portugal, which served as the basis for Macau's legal system – also provide for the exclusion of advertising in cases involving “state secrets”.
In the article, Iau does not make any comment on the restrictions on the appointment of a lawyer in national security cases, something that analysts interviewed by Lusa consider unconstitutional.</description><pubDate>2026-02-23 05:26:13</pubDate></item><item><title>New Year | Sam makes “wishes of peace and prosperity to the great country”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/23/ano-novo-sam-faz-votos-de-paz-e-prosperidade-a-grande-patria/</link><description>The Chief Executive entered the Year of the Fire Horse with desires for national prosperity and pointed to “new horizons” for Macau, under the “firm” leadership of President Xi Jinping
In the traditional speech to enter the Lunar New Year, the Chief Executive left wishes for “peace and prosperity to the great Fatherland”. The message was conveyed in a recorded video, released on the eve of the Lunar New Year.
"The bell for the Year of the Horse will ring. At this moment, Spring is felt in all its splendor in Macau and this pearl shines incessantly in the palm of the motherland's hand", said Sam Hou Fai. “I wish peace and prosperity to the great country; to the MSAR, I wish stability and prosperous development; to all the residents of Macau, I wish you happiness and good health,” he added.
Regarding the entry into the new year, the ruler stated that the “horse symbolizes loyalty, courage, exploratory spirit and freedom” and that these qualities “must be promoted” to face “the future”. “Ahead of the Year of the Horse, we must, with a spirit of leadership, courage and perseverance, promote the development of Macau in all aspects in the best possible way; we must, with persistence and dedication, continue to adequately carry out work to improve the lives of the population for their well-being”, he highlighted.
Get stronger
In the message, the Chief Executive also highlighted the need for the Macao SAR and the country to continue to strengthen themselves to achieve new successes. “As the Chinese quote says: ‘The movement of heaven is vigorous; therefore, a noble person must strive tirelessly to strengthen himself’”, he stressed. "The success story of the 'One Country, Two Systems' principle in the Macao SAR has been written generation after generation by the people of Macau. I am convinced that, under the firm leadership of Mr. President Xi Jinping and the Central Government, counting on the great Motherland as unwavering support, as long as we have the courage to reform and innovate, better leveraging the institutional advantages of the 'One Country, Two Systems' principle, we will certainly be able to achieve success, opening up new horizons of development and creating new splendid successes”, pointed out the leader of the Macao SAR Government.</description><pubDate>2026-02-23 05:23:41</pubDate></item><item><title>Economic Housing | Requested dates for exchange arrangements</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/16/habitacao-economica-pedidas-datas-para-regime-de-troca/</link><description>Deputy Nick Lei wants to know when the Government will present the economic housing exchange scheme.

It's true, unfortunately there were two more deaths due to total unconsciousness last week. On the second day of Storm Kristin, the waters of the Mondego River began to rise and the worst was expected. The river's flow began to flood several lands and invade several roads. Mr. Venâncio and Ms. Fátima, residents near Soure, in the municipality of Montemor-o-Velho, decided to take their Citroen and go to Coimbra for a medical appointment, when the municipal authorities were already starting to warn people not to leave their homes.
It was a Tuesday and in the afternoon Civil Protection announced that several regional roads were closed to traffic because of the floods that were progressing due to the increase in the flow of the Mondego River. Mr. Venâncio, aged 68, and his wife, aged 65, finished their hospital appointment in Coimbra and decided to return home. They still had dinner in the student city at a family member's house, but they didn't want to stay the night in the house where they were staying or spend 70 or 80 euros on a hotel room.
They even decided to return home, despite having finished watching on television during dinner that the roads around Montemor-o-Velho were dangerous. There they went. At one point, Mr. Venâncio called a friend saying that he wasn't orienting himself very well on which route to take and that the road he was on was unfamiliar to him. The friend understood that Mr. Venâncio would be lost, because he shouldn't even be behind the wheel due to having recently had some mental disorders that could indicate some type of dementia.
Mr. Venâncio's total unconsciousness caused him to enter a road that was already covered in water and the car slid into a rice field that was already completely flooded. Hours passed and the couple's daughter began to get worried, her parents' cell phones were not responding and she decided to alert the police authorities. From then on, for almost a week, the television channels only reported that a couple was missing.
The searches were incessant. A huge effort by divers and maritime patrols, firefighters and GNR soldiers. Days later and after the water level began to drop, some hikers saw the roof of a car immersed in the rice field and alerted the authorities. The confirmation deeply saddened the population of Varride, where Mr. Venâncio and Ms. Fátima lived. Their bodies were inside the Citroen and the number of flood victims was 19.
Now, it is time for reconstruction in several affected areas, especially in Leiria and Marinha Grande. In the debate in the Assembly of the Republic with the presence of the Government, the Prime Minister announced his full support for the victims of the calamity, despite there still being many people who did not receive government support and who were left with nothing in the latest fires. An important note: the exemplary work of the president of Coimbra City Council. Ana Abrunhosa received the greatest praise from all quarters, except from the Chega party, because Abrunhosa was not a populist and a demagogue.
The district of Leiria was the area most affected by the storms and where there was the greatest destruction, where between five and eight million trees fell, but we can announce first-hand that the city council of Leiria has already invited a personality who left behind vast and commendable work in the afforestation of Macau while he lived in the former Portuguese colony.
Engineer António Paula Saraiva was invited to study the reconstruction of the main garden in front of the City Hall and where almost all the trees fell due to strong gusts of wind. António Saraiva has already visited the site and was immediately ready to study the arboreal reconstruction of the Leiriense garden. A round of applause for this exceptional technician, who, despite being retired, was immediately ready to cooperate for the well-being of Leirienses who enjoy visiting his main garden.
Reconstruction of the destroyed areas will be hard and expensive work. It could exceed 10 billion euros, but as Luís Montenegro said in Parliament, it will have to be a reconstruction carried out by all Portuguese. The country continues, life does not stop, but we hope that promises do not fail, as has been recorded in other cases.
Portugal was in the news for the worst reasons contemplated by natural phenomena, but Portugal will be in the news again when it can announce to the world that the Portuguese people affected by a calamity have returned to their normal lives.</description><pubDate>2026-02-23 05:58:12</pubDate></item><item><title>You need to know how to govern</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/16/e-preciso-saber-governar/</link><description>On the day the Minister of Internal Administration took office, we spoke to a commander of the National Republican Guard (GNR) who told us “Oh, my dear, this minister Maria Lúcia Amaral is going to be a disaster... you are a very good jurist, but you don't have the slightest ability to deal with men with wiry beards, nor do you have the slightest idea of ​​what the security forces are and what needs to change in such a disturbed and obscure panorama”. The commander was right. The minister was a black page of the current Government and ended up resigning in times of calamity. He had to resign forcibly. He was already a “jester” within the PSP, GNR and Civil Protection.
You left the country astonished when it was only three days after Storm Kristin hit Leiria and Marinha Grande that you came out to say… nothing! Several politicians and television commentators had long called for the Prime Minister to replace the Minister of Internal Affairs. Luís Montenegro turned a deaf ear and the result was the same as the catastrophe that has hit the national territory. Montenegro looked around at his friends and did not immediately find a new minister for such an important portfolio. Montenegro does not have a vision of reality. By the way, Portugal has a personality who should immediately be invited, if he were willing, to occupy the position of Minister of Internal Administration. Only Admiral Gouveia e Melo knows how to coordinate the Armed Forces with the GNR, PSP, Fire Department and Civil Protection. And it was seen in the Covid-19 pandemic.
We did not vote for presidential candidate Gouveia e Melo, but we recognize his stance as an organizer, coordinator and with seriousness in taking the position of Minister of Internal Administration in difficult times for the country, which finds itself from North to South in a situation of tragedy. Last week, the unimaginable happened. No one, much less an infrastructure official, ever thought that the country's main highway, the A1 that connects Lisbon to Porto, could collapse due to the rupture of a dike on the Mondego River. In the Coimbra area, motorists will be unable to use the highway for months. We always come back to the same thing: we need to know how to govern. And the Government, at the beginning of the storms that have ravaged the country, was not up to the tragic events. It did not even include the storage of a substantial amount of generators in the planning for a new blackout or other type of catastrophe. It would be the least. More than 20,000 Portuguese people are still without electricity, two weeks after the first storm that knocked down power poles and flooded gas stations.
The truth is that thousands of Portuguese people have been displaced from their homes and evacuated from villages surrounded by water. In the Coimbra area, the marines never stop transporting people, food and other goods in their amphibious vehicles for a day.
There are people who are left with nothing. A life to build a house and from one day to the next they found themselves completely without what they had gathered for years. The lands in various parts of the country are saturated with water and in the near future, according to experts, these lands will collapse and the houses that are in their path will be destroyed. Even in Porto Brandão, next to Trafaria, and in Costa de Caparica, the cliff collapses left hundreds of people homeless. And for years, the Almada City Council did not foresee that the tragedy could happen? We have many competent mayors in Portugal, but we also have incompetent and corrupt ones who only care about building roundabouts and other megalomaniac works for the Spanish to see.
The reconstruction of this calamity that hit Portugal will take years and one of the most important works, the installation of underground electrical lines, has already received the “solidarity” verdict from the European Union: it does not grant support for this. And this is how the Portuguese are witnessing a flooded country, with agriculture destroyed, with houses and factories that have disappeared and with an endless line of trucks that transport much of what feeds the population, due to a highway viaduct that collapsed, and who knows how it was built... we just hope that in the future they will know how to govern with the aim of providing the Portuguese with a better and more peaceful life.</description><pubDate>2026-02-16 01:36:28</pubDate></item><item><title>Camões, the maricón</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/13/camoes-el-maricon/</link><description>He was a Christian, baptized António and was born on the island of Java, hence the gentile name Jau, who gives his name to a street in Lisbon, at the intersection of that of the Lusíadas. Luís Vaz would have met this new friend of his following a shipwreck in Cambodia – perhaps when he passed through the land of “loving Malays, brave Jaus” (X.44.4,7) coming from Macau, where he had never been. Ou enquanto esperava por uma nau que o levasse a Cochim e depois a Goa, cerca de 1565. Ou conheceu-o mesmo em Goa, a Sodoma do Oriente. A partir desse momento, António não mais o ia largar até à morte de Luís. Expirou nos braços do seu escravo. This is the myth, of course.
The only historical sources we have are the first Camonian biographers, Pedro Mariz, Severim de Faria and Manuel de Faria e Sousa, who rarely refer to him. Those who are more attentive (and also those who are in the know) realize that what existed between Luís and António was a loving relationship. Not a loving relationship as we would understand it today, but a connection with hierarchies, perhaps fixed places. Camões was much older, a washed-up man in his late forties; Jau was a newly racialized young Christian in Lisbon. It was certainly forbidden for him to walk wherever he wanted. On the street, I should go shopping and little else, or ask for him on the streets of Lisbon, as some say. At home, he acted as a nurse, perhaps a servant, perhaps a lover.
In Camões literature, or literature that has recovered this theme, Jau plays several roles: faithful friend, canine, Camões's alter ego, confidant, soulmate or even subliminally a boyfriend, which comes to the surface in some less naive, more knowledgeable texts. After all, the smartest people understand what was encrypted so as not to be understood. In the biographies and literature produced on this topic (which even enchanted Portuguese, German and French romanticism: we have paintings, plays, poems – even operas, on the subject!), he usually accompanies the Poet in the ambiguity of friendship until the end of his life. But a slave friend. Tradition began, however, to identify him as a slave only after a saying by Manuel de Faria e Sousa. A commentator who they call fanciful, but who perhaps knew what he was doing. After all, isn't slavery a metaphor for love, which Camões himself uses? Whoever says Bárbara, says jau. It is an obvious literary metaphor about the chains of affection, a code shared between his closest friends and some later ones who understood the allusions, probably a humanist homosocial circle and their descendants.
It has already been suggested that Jau had been bought and rescued in Goa by the Poet, who had gone into debt because of the servant; that this same Jau, who would be an interpreter, was shipwrecked with his master at the mouth of the Mecong and went with him to Mozambique and from there to Lisbon. Poignant legends, but unlikely, says Storck. In fact, António died before the poet, and the latter only managed to survive him for a few months. This is the little information we have. As the German biographer recalls, all slaves had to pay freight to come to the Kingdom and then, in Portugal, entry rights, owed to the King. Who would pay them, if not poor Luís? This shows that he was not a slave at all. Camões did not have the resources to make a blind man sing, let alone own a slave. Storck again: a Jau slave who spoke three languages ​​fluently (his Javanese, plus Chinese and Portuguese) would certainly not be cheap. There were even Jau slaves in Lisbon. There was no need for Luís to bring one from so far away. João de Barros bought one, apparently Chinese. But the historian had a broad purse, and the Poet not so much.
Now, this memory also comes with regard to the recent film El cautivo (2025), by Amenábar, which tells how Miguel de Cervantes was captured by privateers and locked up for five years in an Algiers prison. There was some controversy when the film suggested the possible homosexuality of the national author. This issue is not new, and there are disputes in Spanish criticism about his sexuality. Were you accused of sodomy or not? At least here there is a discussion, while in Portugal the suggestions about the same in Camões are light, distant, flying. Fernando Arrabal, author of Un esclavo llamado Cervantes, explained that his biography, published in 1995, is based on a document, dated 1569, according to which Miguel de Cervantes was accused of homosexuality when he was 21 years old and condemned by the King of Spain to the amputation of his right hand and exile. Was that why Cervantes had no use of his arm?
And there are Cervantists who in fact speak not only of their homosexuality but also recognize their Jewish origins. The latter also came forward for our Luís, through Fiama's pity. They are metaphors for each other, if we look closely. Things seen as other, prohibited, that must be kept secret, and for which only small, closed groups hold the hermeneutic key. But after all, these are things that are within so many. They are also metaphors for each other: being Jewish is a metaphor for homosexual, and vice versa. In addition to being, or having been, concrete possibilities of life, they are also signs for some life that is behind the sign, the verb or the image, and that we do not achieve.
Amenábar takes sides, of course, and does it well, in a beautiful film that transforms Miguel into Scheherazade who, together with her lover, the Bey of Algiers, postpones his death with stories.  I think it's an excellent film, as entertainment, even if it's too focused on Cervantes as a storyteller, when Cervantes is far from being just that. Our Spanish brothers, on the other hand, even found the film mild and not very sexualized. In Portugal it would perhaps be a scandal if they did something like that for Camões. Many would think that they wanted to muddy the water. A good film would be one that gave a face to his abandonment, in which only with Jau did he find refreshment. Mário Cláudio, Eugénio de Andrade and Alfredo Margarido were among the few who dared to go there. The point I want to reach is the following: it would not be so much to present a gay Camões, but rather to show how his life and work open up to other landscapes, also sexual, as Frederico Lourenço says in the entry on Love in the Camões Dictionary, by Aguiar e Silva.  It's for the next centenary.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>The Dispute over Greenland (II)</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/12/a-disputa-pela-gronelandia-ii/</link><description>“Nations do not compete for land; they compete for the power that land unlocks.”
Halford J. Mackinder
The position of the European Union (EU) in the face of the United States' growing attention to Greenland, intensified during Donald Trump's presidency, generated concern and strategic reflection. Although Greenland has not been part of the EU since 1985, the island remains part of the Kingdom of Denmark, a Member State of the Union, which gives the issue an unavoidable political and institutional dimension. The European position thus results from the need to protect the territorial integrity of one of its members, to safeguard strategic interests in the Arctic and to preserve the stability of transatlantic relations.
The EU views Greenland as part of the broader European political space, not because of its formal membership, but because of its constitutional connection to Denmark. Any external attempt to acquire or exercise control over territory is interpreted as a direct interference with the sovereignty of a Member State. The American proposal to purchase the island was received in Brussels as a disruptive diplomatic gesture, which went beyond the traditional limits of cooperation between allies. The defense of Danish sovereignty constitutes the first pillar of the European position. The EU has reiterated that the territorial integrity of its Member States is non-negotiable and that any change to the status of a European territory requires full and voluntary consent from national and local authorities. The idea of ​​a territorial transaction, reminiscent of 19th century practices, contradicts contemporary principles of international law and European governance.
The EU recognizes the Arctic as a region of growing importance, both for its environmental relevance and its geopolitical value. The accelerated melting of ice, the opening of new maritime routes and access to strategic mineral resources transformed the region into a space for competition between great powers. The EU, which defines itself as a “global actor”, seeks to ensure that the Arctic remains a zone of peaceful cooperation, governed by multilateral norms and shared management mechanisms. American interest in Greenland is interpreted in Brussels as part of a broader strategy of military and economic assertion in the Arctic. Although the United States is a fundamental ally within NATO, the EU maintains reservations about unilateral initiatives that could alter the regional balance. The excessive militarization of Greenland, particularly through the possible installation of nuclear weapons, would be seen as a factor of instability, with a direct impact on European security.
Greenland has vast reserves of critical minerals, including rare earths, essential for the energy transition and the European technology industry. The EU has sought to reduce dependence on external suppliers, especially China, and sees cooperation with Greenland as an opportunity to strengthen its strategic autonomy. The American interest in controlling these resources raises concerns in Brussels, which fears an excessive concentration of power over vital supply chains. The EU argues that mining exploration in Greenland must be carried out in a sustainable, transparent manner and in partnership with European actors, guaranteeing benefits for the local population and avoiding predatory exploration practices.
The EU deeply values ​​the transatlantic relationship, but considers that strong alliances require mutual respect and predictability. The American proposal to acquire Greenland was interpreted as a gesture that disregarded European political sensitivity and put trust between partners at risk. Brussels sought, however, to avoid a diplomatic escalation. The European response combined firmness in defending Danish sovereignty with discursive moderation, in order to preserve strategic cooperation with Washington in areas such as defense, trade and international security. The EU stressed that dialogue on the Arctic should take place in multilateral forums and within the framework of NATO, and not through unilateral initiatives.
Trump's statements at the 2026 Davos Forum further intensified these tensions. Before global leaders, Trump stated that the United States “will not use force” to acquire Greenland, although he stressed that the country would be “frankly unstoppable” if it decided to do so. He added that “no other nation can defend Greenland” and that Washington intended to begin “immediate negotiations” to take control of the territory. In one of the most controversial passages, he declared: "We want a piece of ice to protect the world, and they won't give it. You can say yes and we will be very grateful, or you can say no and we will remember."
Trump also reinforced the historical narrative according to which the United States “saved Greenland” during World War II and insinuated that returning the territory to Denmark would have been a mistake. He repeated criticism of NATO, accusing European allies of contributing little to common security, and threatened to impose tariffs of 10% on several European countries, increasing to 25% if the sale of Greenland did not go ahead.  European reactions were immediate and firm. Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen considered it “positive” that Trump had taken the military option off the table, but stressed that “the president’s ambition remains intact” and that American pressure continued to be unacceptable.
In Brussels, the statements were interpreted as a rhetorical escalation that undermined trust between allies and sought to transform Greenland into an instrument of economic and strategic blackmail. European diplomats called the speech “bellicose” and “out of line with the spirit of cooperation” expected at the Davos Forum, noting that the threat of tariffs on EU Member States constituted a form of coercion incompatible with stable transatlantic relations. Denmark, although responsible for Greenland's foreign and defense policy, faces specific challenges in managing the territory. The island's growing autonomy, combined with interest from external powers, places Copenhagen in a delicate position. The EU has sought to support Denmark, strengthening its negotiating capacity and offering instruments for economic and scientific cooperation with Greenland. Brussels understands that the region's stability depends on a balanced relationship between Denmark's interests, the aspirations of the Greenlandic population and the need to avoid external interference that could compromise European security.
Therefore, the EU's position regarding the American interest in Greenland is based on three fundamental principles; the uncompromising defense of the sovereignty of a Member State; the preservation of stability and cooperation in the Arctic; and the protection of European strategic interests in critical resources and regional security.
Trump's statements in Davos reinforced the European perception that the issue goes beyond a mere territorial dispute, revealing an assertive American strategy that combines economic pressure, historical narrative and geopolitical ambition. Although it recognizes the importance of the transatlantic partnership, the EU rejects unilateral approaches that could weaken the European political balance or transform the Arctic into a stage for confrontation between great powers.
Greenland, located between continents and between logics of power, has become a test of the EU's ability to assert its strategic autonomy and protect its members in an increasingly competitive international context.</description><pubDate>2026-02-12 03:21:55</pubDate></item><item><title>More Chinese New Year shows in the coming days</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/23/mais-espectaculos-de-ano-novo-chines-nos-proximos-dias/</link><description>The Directorate of Tourism Services (DST) continues to organize, in the coming days, shows to celebrate the arrival of the Year of the Horse with fireworks.
One of the initiatives is the holding of three editions of “2026 – Drone and Fireworks Shows”, where drones are introduced for the first time in this type of presentation, in a combination of “technology with art, increasing the sensation and appreciation of fireworks shows”, in order to “enrich festive experiences”. One of these presentations takes place today, the seventh day of Chinese New Year, and then on March 3, the fifteenth day of the first month of Chinese New Year. These shows take place in the bay next to the Macau Tower.
Also noteworthy is the holding of the “Second parade of floats with cultural performances” on Saturday, the 28th, the 12th day of the Lunar New Year. Between 8pm and 9:30pm, and starting at Rua Norte do Patane, the parade also includes a cultural show in the Iao Hon Municipal Market Garden. There will be 17 floats in this parade, eight of them representing Government departments and the remaining nine from local tourist entities.

Galloping on ZAPE
At ZAPE, the “Gala a gallop no ZAPE” initiative is taking place until the 1st of March, “in conjunction with Chinese New Year and Valentine's Day”, more specifically in the surrounding area between Rua de Cantão and Rua de Beijing. According to a note from DST, the aim is, “through installations characteristic of the festive season, to increase the festive atmosphere of the neighborhoods and the tourist attraction, attracting people to the community neighborhoods”.
This “Gala galloping at ZAPE” has “the participation of ZAPE traders and several integrated tourism and leisure companies”, and includes the launch of promotional packages to attract more tourists.</description><pubDate>2026-02-23 05:53:35</pubDate></item><item><title>Concert | “Classics on Strings” in March at CCM</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/23/concerto-classicos-em-cordas-em-marco-no-ccm/</link><description>March will be the time to host the “Clássicos em Cordas” concert, led by the Macau Orchestra, and which brings two violinists to the territory: Julian Rachlin and Sarah McElravy. Here's the opportunity to hear interpretations of compositions by Beethoven and Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy
The Macau Orchestra (OM) will be the protagonist of another classical music concert scheduled for March, namely on the 14th, and which will be performed in the large auditorium of the Macau Cultural Center (CCM). The concert will be directed by Julian Rachlin, considered a “world-renowned violinist”, as described in a note from the Cultural Institute (IC), which supports the show. Violinist Sarah McElravy also joins the stage.
“String Classics” is the name of this show, which presents “a true feast of fascinating works for strings”, such as Beethoven’s “Coriolanus Overture”, Mozart’s “Symphony Concertante in E-flat Major” and “Symphony No. 3 in A Minor ‘Scottish'” by Feliz Mendelssohn Bartholdy, German composer and pianist.
This last composition dates from 1829 and 1841, having been premiered in the city of Leipzig on March 3, 1842. It is one of the last major works composed by this master of Romanticism, with its composition beginning on a trip to Scotland.
In the case of Beethoven's “Coriolanus Overture”, it lasts eight minutes and had its premiere in Vienna, in March 1807, and is known for having inaugurated two concert formats in the 19th century, namely the concert overture and the symphonic poem.
Distinguished names
In a note from the IC, the career of Julian Rachlin, born in Vienna, is described as an “internationally acclaimed Austrian violinist and violist”. Rachlin also collaborated “with numerous orchestras and several internationally renowned conductors for more than three decades”, and, in recent years, he was Principal Guest Conductor of the Royal Northern Sinfonia, in the United Kingdom.
He also directed several international orchestras, such as the Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra and the Munich Philharmonic.
Sarah McElravy, a Canadian violin and viola player, has performed on stage in Europe, America and Asia. She is “recognized for her exceptional technique, having collaborated with renowned orchestras and participated in several music festivals”.
McElravy is seen as someone with “profound performance experience”, also dedicating herself “to promoting musical education, having founded a chamber music association in Mexico to bring world-class concerts to local communities”.
The “Clássicos em Cordas” concert will last approximately one and a half hours, including an intermission. Tickets are now on sale, with prices ranging between 150 and 300 patacas.</description><pubDate>2026-02-23 05:51:47</pubDate></item><item><title>Timorese Maria do Céu Lopes protects heritage of ‘tais’, traditional fabrics</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/16/timorense-maria-do-ceu-lopes-protege-patrimonio-de-tais-tecidos-tradicionais/</link><description>East Timorese Maria do Céu Lopes discovered the cultural importance of ‘tais’, cloths woven by women, in Timor-Leste during the war and cooperation with the resistance and today protects almost 400 examples, while waiting for a museum.
Although he used 'tais' in some ceremonies during his childhood, it was only later, with his cooperation with the resistance and his curiosity, that he discovered its profound cultural value.
Then comes the challenge of a childhood friend, António Coelho, specialized in fabrics, to preserve the ‘tais’. It was with his colleague that he began studies to collect information about those aspects associated with all the important moments in the life of a Timorese, but along the way he created, in 1999, Timor Aid, a non-governmental organization to protect the Timorese cultural heritage.
“Timor Aid managed to do it, we have a collection of almost 400 pieces, some old, some copies of the old ones that we saw in the book that António gave us”, Maria do Céu Lopes told Lusa.
In addition to collecting oral information, Timor Aid also documented in audiovisual the entire traditional process of producing a 'tais', including how cotton is dyed from natural plants, established a network of weavers to protect the tradition of confection and also a store in Dili.
UNESCO recognition
Their effort, out of “faith and conviction”, was recognized when the ‘tais’ was inscribed in 2021 on the List of Intangible Cultural Heritage in Need of Urgent Safeguarding of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). “The recognition, the merit, is not ours, it belongs to the weavers and our ancestors”, he stated.
Maria do Céu Lopes explained that that textile has a “very important role in Timorese domestic life”, in addition to identifying the linguistic group of those who use it and the community to which they belong.
“The ‘tais’ is used from life to death, when a child is born the first thing to do is wrap it in a ‘tais’ and then so on: ‘barlaques’ [a type of dowry], funerals, the ritual ceremonies of ‘uma lulik’ [sacred houses]”, he said.
“A woman, in ancient times, her dignity, her social position, was due to the ‘tais’ that she wove, because nowadays the ‘tais’ has value in money, but in the past it was in buffaloes, ‘morten’, traditional necklaces, ‘belak’ [used in necklaces] and gold”, he highlighted.
Asked by Lusa about whether ‘tais’ could be lost, Maria do Céu Lopes considered that it could not. “But, the quality of modern ‘such’, few are good”, he lamented, highlighting that it is necessary to certify the product due to prices and for people to have the guarantee of what they are buying.
Maria do Céu Lopes also lamented the lack of a museum to showcase Timorese heritage, which is seen in museums abroad, giving the Louvre as an example. “You want a museum, I want a museum because I have the material to put it in, it’s not for me it’s for Timor-Leste, we don’t have a decent cultural center, not even in Dili”, he lamented.
"We don't do anything here. I can't build a museum, I don't have money," he added. While waiting for the museum, the Timor Aid collection will continue to be protected and waiting for dignity to be seen by the tourists, which Timor-Leste intends to attract.</description><pubDate>2026-02-16 01:33:18</pubDate></item><item><title>K-Pop | Mark Tuan performs at Studio City in March</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/16/k-pop-mark-tuan-actua-no-studio-city-em-marco/</link><description>Mark Tuan, singer of the K-Pop group GOT7, performs in Macau on March 28th at the concert “Silhouette: The Shape of You FANCON ENCORE”, presenting songs from the new album with the same name.

The person in charge explained that the number of daily calls was similar to that on other business days. Ng Lai Ieng revealed that seven of these calls were requests for help related to suicide, but fortunately they were nothing more than thoughts, without any type of planning or associated action. Ng pointed out that in these cases the calls are classified as low-risk cases.
The other requests for help were motivated by marital conflicts or problems adapting to situations of divorce, stress, and other cases of mental and emotional instability.

After Cáritas Macau, the solidarity wave encompasses BNU, Misericórdia, Casa de Portugal, Council of Portuguese Communities, Lusophone Scout Group of Macau and Club Lusitano
After Cáritas Macau announced about two weeks ago that it was raising funds to help victims of the storms that affected Portugal and Spain in recent weeks, the solidarity campaign in Macau and Hong Kong was extended to six Portuguese-based entities.
Monetary donations can go to an account at Banco Nacional Ultramarino (BNU), which has joined the initiative, according to a joint statement.
The funds will then be redirected “to one or more Portuguese social solidarity institutions operating on the ground, ensuring transparency and traceability of the entire process”, they added in the same note. Recalling the “best tradition of fraternity and solidarity that unites Portuguese-speaking peoples”, the statement makes “a public appeal for the mobilization of the Portuguese-speaking community in Macau and the Greater Bay Area”.
In addition to having the institutional support of the consulate, the campaign was launched by the Casa de Portugal association in Macau, the China Circle of the Council of Portuguese Communities and the Lusophone Scout Group of Macau.
Long challenge
In Hong Kong, the initiative has the participation of Club Lusitano, the largest institution of the Portuguese-descendant community of the former British colony, with around 400 members, founded in 1866. It is worth remembering that on February 10, the Catholic organization Cáritas Macau launched a three-month fundraising campaign for those affected by the storms in the Iberian Peninsula.
In a note published on social media, the Catholic organization lamented the “devastating storms” that caused “catastrophic floods” and landslides in Portugal and Spain, destroying infrastructure and homes. "Thousands of people are homeless and urgently need water, food and medical care. Local teams work tirelessly, but the recovery will be long and challenging", warned Cáritas Macau.
On Wednesday, the União das Misericórdias Portuguesas said it had received a donation worth 300 thousand euros from Misericórdia de Macau to support its counterparts who suffered significant damage caused by the Kristin depression.
Nineteen people died in Portugal following the Kristin, Leonardo and Marta depressions, which also caused many hundreds of injuries and displacement. The total or partial destruction of homes, businesses and equipment, the fall of trees and structures, the closure of roads, schools and transport services, and the cut of energy, water and communications, floods and floods are the main material consequences of the storm.
The Centre, Lisbon and Vale do Tejo and Alentejo regions were the most affected. The calamity situation that covered the 68 most affected municipalities ended on February 15th.</description><pubDate>2026-02-23 05:40:47</pubDate></item><item><title>Health | Registration open for training in clinical medicine</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/23/saude-abertas-inscricoes-para-formacao-em-medicina-clinica/</link><description>Registration for the “training course in basic clinical medicine skills” is open until March 4th”, the Health Services said on Friday.

The leader of the public hospital predicted that there should be more than three thousand births in 2026, an increase of at least 4.5 percent, in the region with the lowest birth rate in the world. According to the Chinese language channel of public broadcaster TDM Macau, the deputy director of Centro Hospitalar Conde de São Januário said he was confident that young couples in the territory would have more children.
After visiting the first babies born in the Lunar Year of the Fire Horse, which has now begun, Tai Wa Hou defended that the Government launched “high-quality services” to promote birth rates. In July, the local parliament approved a budget review to reinforce social support, including the creation of a subsidy, worth a total of MOP54,000, for children up to three years old.
The Government also launched a public consultation on the increase, in the private sector, of maternity leave, from 70 to 90 days, and annual leave, from six to 12 days to “obtain a better balance between work and family life”.
The mother of the first baby of the year, born at 00:11 in Conde de São Januário, surnamed Fung, told TDM that she plans to have more children and hopes that the newborn will grow up with “many siblings”. The estimate made by Tai Wa Hou still represents a drop compared to the forecast made almost a year ago, also on the first day of the Lunar New Year.
Black numbers
On January 29, 2025, the deputy director of Macau Health Services, Kuok Cheong U, predicted that the year would end with fewer than 3,500 births.
On January 1st, Tai Wa Hou revealed that Macau registered 2,871 newborns in 2025, the lowest number in almost 50 years, since 1978, when the city, then under Portuguese administration, registered 2,407 newborns.
However, while in 1978 Macau had less than 249 thousand inhabitants, at the end of September 2024 the region already had a population of almost 687 thousand. The number of births thus fell for the sixth consecutive year and is increasingly far from the historic maximum of 7,913, set in 1988.
Macau recorded just 0.58 births per woman in 2024, far from the value needed to replace generations (2.1), the lowest fertility rate ever in the region and the lowest in the world, according to official data.</description><pubDate>2026-02-23 05:31:33</pubDate></item><item><title>Study warns of cognitive impact of short videos on children</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/16/estudo-alerta-para-impacto-cognitivo-de-videos-curtos-nas-criancas/</link><description>Two researchers from the University of Macau concluded that short-form videos used on social media and viewed on “scrolling” on cell phones negatively impact children's cognitive development, potentially causing social anxiety and insecurity.
“Compulsive consumption of short videos has a negative impact on cognitive development, which can cause lack of concentration, social anxiety and self-doubt”, he explained to Lusa Wang Wei, academic in the field of Educational Psychology at the University of Macau (UM), author of the study “Addiction to short videos, school involvement and social inclusion among Chinese rural students”.
“This short video design can be particularly dangerous for children”, warned the researcher. “Our research indicates a direct correlation: the more students consume short videos, the less they engage with school,” Wang continued.
Wang argues that, although children's fundamental psychological needs must be met offline, the architecture of short video platforms, with personalized algorithms and social interaction features, directly and subtly meets these same needs.
This parallel satisfaction, Wang's research suggests, “potentially leads to overuse and addiction.” “The stimulating and fast-paced nature of short videos makes them highly entertaining for students,” the researcher added.
Attention required
Anise Wu Man Sze, professor of Psychology at UM's Faculty of Social Sciences and author of the study “The relationship of affective and cognitive components in the problematic use of short videos”, adds to Wang's conclusions the issues related to the overstimulation of children, which further harm healthy cognitive development.
The short videos capture everyone's attention precisely because “they are right there at hand and they are free”, highlights Wu, speaking to Lusa. People can access vast amounts of short videos “anytime, anywhere”. Now, these addictive behaviors often originate from a “functional purpose”, he explained.
“We have to raise awareness, especially if use starts to affect daily life, leading to the sacrifice of family time, neglect of sleep, or people surfing at inappropriate times, such as during classes or driving, putting themselves or others at risk,” he told Lusa.
As for interventions with children, according to Wang Wei, “it is very important” to satisfy their emotional needs, while cultivating digital literacy and self-regulation skills, “instead of limiting ourselves to taking away their cell phone”.
By December 2024, the number of people with access to this type of videos in China reached close to 1.1 billion individuals, with 98.4 percent being active users of this format, according to the Annual Report on the Development of Audiovisual Services on the Internet, published by the Chinese authorities.</description><pubDate>2026-02-16 01:41:04</pubDate></item><item><title>Restoration | After Macau, Manteigaria moves to Hong Kong</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/16/restauracao-apos-macau-manteigaria-salta-para-hong-kong/</link><description>Manteigaria is linked to the Portugália Restauração Group and aims to open at least three stores in the HKSAR within a year. However, the future could lead to expansion into more markets, such as Mainland China, South Korea or Japan
The Portugália Restauração Group will open the first store in Hong Kong of Manteigaria – Fábrica de Pastéis de Nata in April, the group's managing partner in Macau told Lusa. "It's a real and ongoing project. It's been a little delayed, but we already have the space identified [and] it will go into construction right after Chinese New Year", in the Central area of ​​Hong Kong Island, said Diogo Vieira.
The Lunar New Year holiday period, the scene of the largest annual migration in the world, takes place this year between February 15th and 23rd in mainland China. “We are very excited and very happy to be able to enter that market, which has a different dynamic”, said the managing partner of Grupo Portugália Restauração in Macau.
Vieira highlighted that Manteigaria has bigger plans for Hong Kong, “a city with at least seven million inhabitants, with a very large area, with many tourists, with very populated areas, where it is possible to expand quickly”.
“It is the brand's objective, within a year, after opening the first one, to be able to open at least three stores in different locations in Hong Kong”, revealed the executive.
Show Portugal
“We want to show locals and tourists who visit Hong Kong that it is possible to have a product that comes from Portugal (…) and show the manufacturing, the Portuguese tradition”, said Vieira. After Hong Kong, the executive revealed, Manteigaria's “expansion project” will look at “other surrounding markets”, including mainland China, South Korea, Singapore and Thailand.
The brand opened its first store in downtown Macau in January 2025, followed by a second store on the island of Taipa in November, and, said Vieira, currently employs “between 25 and 30 people”, selling an average of 2,500 pastries per day.
The Manteigaria operation in Macau “is profitable and growing, therefore, the investment is expected to be recovered in a very short time”, added the group’s managing partner.
Macau had local custard tarts on the market, inspired by the Portuguese pastry, recreated by a British man living in the city, Andrew Stow (1955-2006).
Although this is “an advantage”, Vieira says that “the necessary adjustments were made (…) to market needs, desires and local culture”, with a reduction by half of the sugar used in the pastel de nata recipe.
In October, the Macau Government inscribed 12 events, including local custard tarts and Portuguese folk dance, on the territory's Intangible Cultural Heritage List.
A decision that will also benefit the Portuguese pastry, defended Vieira. “We with the original Portuguese version, the other local producers with the Macau version, but we all compete a little in the same environment and in a very similar product and we all end up benefiting”, said the executive.</description><pubDate>2026-02-16 01:26:22</pubDate></item><item><title>Operator Melco's profits quadruple in 2025</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/16/lucros-da-operadora-melco-quadruplicam-em-2025/</link><description>Macau casino operator Melco Resorts and Entertainment announced profits of US$185 million in 2025, four times more than the previous year. In a statement sent to the stock exchange in New York, the president of Melco, Lawrence Ho Yau Lung, says that “2025 was a year of growth and recovery, driven by disciplined cost management and the expansion of margins”.
The company's revenues increased 11.2 percent, to $5.16 billion, despite closing the Grand Dragon Casino, a 'satellite casino', and three of the six gaming machine rooms it owned in 2025.
The 'satellite casinos', under the responsibility of the concessionaires, are managed by other companies, being a legacy of the past that already existed before the liberalization of gambling in the territory, in 2002. When the legislation regulating casinos was changed, in 2022, the end of 2025 was established as the deadline for ending the activity of these gambling spaces.
Ten of the 11 'satellite casinos' closed their doors. The only survivor was Royal Arc, which was acquired by operator SJM, founded by the late gaming mogul Stanley Ho Hung Sun, who took over direct management of the space.
High pace
Melco's revenues rose faster than the sector in general. Macau casino revenues grew 9.1 percent in 2025, reaching 247.4 billion patacas.
Lawrence Ho, son of Stanley Ho, highlighted that the company's operating profit in Macau rose 25 percent last year, to US$1.23 billion, “driven by more robust gaming revenues and margins”.
Melco operates in Macau, as well as in Cyprus and the Philippines, having opened a casino in Sri Lanka in August. Melco expects to spend around 10 billion patacas in the non-casino segment within a decade, including on “the only water park in Macau with indoor facilities open all year round”.
The company highlighted the relaunch, in May, at the City of Dreams hotel-casino, of the largest permanent show in the territory, The House of Dancing Water, which had been suspended since June 2020, due to the covid-19 pandemic.</description><pubDate>2026-02-16 01:23:57</pubDate></item><item><title>ZELENSKY VS ZELENSKY</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/31/zelensky-vs-zelensky/</link><description>10/27/22
A Ukrainian pensioner, with the same name as the president, blames Zelensky for the prolongation of the conflict that destroyed his village. Zelensky, the villager, who never left his land, is now mortified because his favorite gravedigger died in the bomber.
This Zelensky, a villager, represents half the world that recriminates the other Zelensky, the villain, for not wanting to negotiate with Putin.
Negotiate what? The invader enters our house, covers his wife and daughter (cf. recent UN report on the rapes in Ukraine, in this “special operation”), an act that forced us to watch, and then we say to him: hi there, we are for peace, but we have to negotiate: you still haven't said what name you want to give the children!
A peace that is not dignified is nothing more than a cessation of rights. As serious as the Russophobia that Putin inflicts on his people.
 
10/28/22
At a lunch with several guests, I heard a friend, who declared herself a spiritualist, explaining the particularities of her belief, in a calm and balanced way, I would even say, without a hint of “irrationalism”. He spoke long and serenely, devoid of any fanatical proselytism. “Here is someone whose belief has brought thoughtfulness!” I thought, a rare alliance.
However, at a certain moment a sentence comes out that horrifies me. It says, “there is no chance, nothing happens by chance!”, and I glimpse the voracious maws of holism. Because holism has a pathological aspect, like all good things, a shadow side.
Two examples: in Hinduism there is less sensitivity to existential dramas, if that child suffers in this life this is just an expression of rigorous karmic symmetry, an effect of the acts he committed in his previous life. In Africa, it is not accepted that death could have been accidental, and many women are accused by the family of the deceased of having caused the death of their husband, in an act of manifest dementia, and, in the blatant majority of cases, a huge injustice for the wife — madness that spreads and infiltrates the social fabric.
Buddhism introduced Compassion and Christianity introduced Caritas, trying to break with this logic, but in many other beliefs and religions the cage of causalities prevails over sensitivity to experience, the need to respond to the now.
It is a tremendous logic that transforms the world into a Platonic stage, where we are nothing more than the shadows of something — an inextricable law -, in a determinism that calcifies all singularities, but that strangely fascinates many.
The conquest of modernity was anchored in the conquest of chance and randomness, removing the incidences of a life from this fierce determinism that enclosed the world in a web. When the Renaissance freed the body from the influence of the stars, at that moment sexuality was relieved of guilt and individualism and its volition were able to emerge.
There is an unequivocal moral implication in the phrase “there is no such thing as chance, nothing happens by chance!”, which should function as a key to self-knowledge and self-judgment, however, this phrase is usually used to seek a reason for things outside of us, in others. It's an alibi.
Today there is a holistic temptation in the world, just as there was a satanic temptation in the Middle Ages, without much reflection on its consequences. Because it's not enough to want to connect everything in a resonant chain of affection. Even for the most unexpected: affection itself can kill.
I realize, thanks to that cultured, balanced, intelligent woman, that “the fight” took place at the beginning of this century. One of the great mistakes of the 20th century was the false dichotomy between “rationalism and irrationalism”, a debate that extended to all fields, including art. First, rationality (the positive side of reason) was confused with rationalism (the pathological aspect of reason), and articulated in this lack of discernment, irrationalism was confused with freedom. Almost all 20th century art, with Surrealism at its head, made this error. The fallacy still exists despite the emergence of “irrationalism” and the consequent relativist currents that followed it having been consolidated everywhere. Essentially, much of what happened in the 20th century revolved around this clash between two paradigms: Rationalism versus Irationalism.
Now, I see, we must save indeterminacy, chance, randomness from the terrible temptation of the cage of causalities. Holism, in its pathological form, may be reductionism that sets itself up as a new “eschatological narrative”.
Is it “by chance” that holism emerges at a time when neo-liberalism and its cynical contempt for the human person is besieging everything, all freedoms, all acquired rights?
Holistic awareness has brought a positive impact to greater ecological awareness, but followed with scholastic rigor, it stifles reality under the blanket of a determinism that is much more than uncomfortable: all great authoritarian ideologies are holistic.
My friend will know how to combine her holistic and transpersonal belief with the freedom and responsibility that each moment asks of us — but how many will make the distinction, under a Law that explains and encompasses everything?
How many will abandon themselves to what is?
The awareness of the indeterminate brings tragic awareness, as the Greeks knew, but it also brings agency and the courage of decision. And we cannot give up on this.
Furthermore, as Drummond shows in the poem “Quadrilha”, by Carlos Drummond de Andrade:
«João loved Teresa who loved Raimundo/ who loved Maria who loved Joaquim who loved Lili/ who didn't love anyone./ João went to the United States, Teresa to the convent,/ Raimundo died of a disaster, Maria stayed with her aunt,/ Joaquim committed suicide and Lili married J. Pinto Fernandes/ who had not entered the story.»
Real always runs outside the track, completely outside our concepts. That's what matters to us — a J. Pinto Fernandes emerges at the exact moment when we thought we had everything under control.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>From Nobel and others</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/17/do-nobel-e-outros/</link><description>9/10/22
When reading many people's reactions when this year's Nobel Prize for Literature was announced, I couldn't help but remember this comment from Jean-Pierre Siméon, in relation to another Nobel Prize: «An editor of a large national daily newspaper wrote five lines of indignation at the fact that the Nobel Prize for Literature had been awarded to Thomas Traströmer, a complete stranger. But unknown to whom? How did it not occur to this literary columnist, patented and paid to do his job, that his apparent ignorance was a matter of professional misconduct? Tranströmer had been translated into many languages, it was available in French.»
There is always the chorus of those who wait for the Prize to be announced to complain about not having been invited to be on the jury, there is a subgroup of angry people who profess “I have never read it and I won’t even bother to read it”; It is a less than humble fauna, the one that inhabits social networks.
I don't always know all the winners – I didn't know about the existence of Louise Glück, who I think is a great poet, or Olga Tokarczuk, for example – but this only brings me the comfort of knowing that the world is not a soap opera where everyone knows everyone else and the joy of recognizing that the yardstick of the world is not measured with my short measure and that, on the contrary, it gives me a new opportunity to face the unknown and learn from it.
And perhaps the most stupid reaction was that of the intelligent man who wrote, But are there still people who read French?; simply confirming that today there is a new type of ignorance that is being raised with abandon: that of those who only read English.
I would also prefer that, in French, Pascal Quignard, Linda Lê or even Sollers were awarded, or, among the new ones, Mathias Énard, but that does not detract from the dignity of Annie Ernaux's work (and it would have been enough to have written “Les Années”). There are books of hers that I like less, like the vulgar “Uma Paixão Simples”, but that happens with almost all authors, they have pivotal books and others that are like breaks in their itinerary. I recommend reading a beautiful book of interviews with her, “L’écriture comme un couteau”.

Yesterday an article appeared in the morning newspaper “Notícias”, in Maputo, reporting that the Pen Club Narrative Prize had been awarded to my wife, Teresa Noronha, for her soap opera “Tornado”, which had already won the Maria Velho da Costa Prize.
The summary they made of the book does not even deserve comments, as it is pathetic, but what is important to highlight is the note of disqualification regarding its “Mozambicanness” when they call it Luso-Mozambican. It's not that it's inaccurate, but, for those who know the context, it's a touch naughty.
Because finally, following the same logic, Adelino Timóteo should be called Tsonga-Mozambican, Álvaro Taruma Ronga-Mozambican, and Macua-Mozambican for writers from the north, etc., etc. Which doesn't appear to happen.
At one point, in the novel, she writes:
«Our color was never the dominant one. In colonial times we were not white, we were dressed in monhés, mugs of washed asses, the pejorative term to speak of a son of Goan and Portuguese. In the post-colonial period, I was not black and if, in Lisbon, they took me for Brazilian or Cape Verdean, in France they were lost in thought about where I was from and were surprised when they discovered that I was African. There I had to explain the wanderings of my DNA before settling in Mozambique. It took me a long time to accept that it was like that because yes, and that it was no curse that that was the case; on the contrary, I could even discover intense patterns of fantasy and freedom in this harlequin cloak that is our genealogy…”
In modern-day Mozambique, it means being white… and that immediately takes precedence over what you do or what you are.
It's sad, but as Naipaul warned, in these parts race is everything and people live as deeply immersed in it as, in other places, in religion.

Bruno Latour, an anthropologist who studied the sciences and their procedures and legitimations, law, technique and religions and who entertained himself by turning his back on the dogmas of the “moderns”, has died. For him, the place, the role of the specialist, was defined more by the perplexity he embodied than by the supposed truth that would sustain him.
He proposed, as an alternative to the goodness of multiculturalism and its equivocal cliché “all different, all equal”, a return to “diplomacy”, given that this, precisely, does not start from the assumption that “we are unified because we share the same nature” but simply highlights that we “still do not share a common world”; It is necessary that we deal head-on with the “abyss of disagreement” that separates us, instead of trying to deceive it.
And about politics he said, boldly:
«If transparency is demanded from politicians, we kill them; if anyone demands fidelity to what the other was or what he says, kill him; If a mimetic relationship is required between what the crowd wants and what its representative says, representation is killed. These must therefore, by definition, betray, deceive, modify, distort the word. Without this ability to bend the word and betray, political language would not exist. I put forward the perfectly plausible hypothesis that political vocabulary will become as inaccessible as the religious language of the last twenty, three or fifty years.» (in “Un Monde Pluriel mais Commun”). I believe we will be needed to decipher this frantically complex world that has fallen to us.</description><pubDate>2022-10-17 02:18:03</pubDate></item><item><title>Fuxi</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/30/o-fuxi/</link><description>O my friends, companions of these disastrous journeys through countries as old as the stars and the Moon, and as strange as the deepest interior of our wretched souls, what surprises still await us, what secret magics will we still have to overcome, what horrors will arise before our pupils dilated with astonishment and terror?
Increasingly closer to our precarious existences, howls the monster of war, which threatens to merge humanity once and for all with the earth, incessantly traversed by the squalid specter of hunger and the invisible evil of ten thousand pestilences.
Oh damned human, who believes you are superior to Nature itself, but then you reveal yourself, time and time again, incapable of simply ordering your existence and do not understand that you are possessed by fickle anger and are a slave to your own ambition! You are not satisfied with white jade or resplendent gold, there is no treasure that quenches your inextinguishable thirst for command over other men, animals and things; for eternal anguish dwells in you; in you the expelled serpents crawl; for you grows, powerful and impressive, the most fertile ivy of Evil!
This is perhaps why on the Mount they call the White Deer, where one of the eight immortals on a sacred mount soared through the heavens towards Penglai, lives the fuxi, a bird whose shape resembles that of a rooster, although topped by a human head. What strange copulations, what monstrous embraces, what terrible procedures must have occurred to make the existence of this sinister animal possible? We don't know, but all it takes is for our exhausted mind to dare to come up with an answer, and then we feel our skin covered in horrendous goosebumps and our heart races in parade, like a wild horse whipped by the night whip of fear, unresponsive to reins and containment.
Let men refrain from visiting Monte do Veado, because although there are riches capable of calming the wildest ambitions, if they have the unfortunate luck of catching a glimpse of a fuxi, it is certain that a war will soon break out and the cultivated fields will perish, because of it the tame animals will be beheaded, because of it the best young men of two generations will be sacrificed and the pride of the countries will be destroyed.
The fuxi makes a sound reminiscent of its name. If you hear it, dark night or clear day, be on your way, because the path you are on is the surest path to misfortune!</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Procrastinators Club</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/29/clube-dos-procrastinadores/</link><description>While rereading Easter, because of an article I'm preparing, I come across this excerpt, taken from “The Universal Man”:
«Each man, morally, is one and absolute; but he has to live with attenuating his personality. (…) Coexistence is only possible between people reduced to a negative or hollow presence, which constantly gives way. Hence, the emptiness of society, an immense ghost made up of countless dead people. A superior man is antisocial or criminal. His destiny is prison and the desert”.
I hesitate to think whether Pascoaes reflects here on the political-social conditions that muzzle, and, worse, in a sad country like Portugal in the middle of the Estado Novo (and the book is from 1931) where any possibilities of spontaneity and frankness in human relationships were restricted, or if it merely lends to the behavior of (oppressed) men a metaphysical framework, an “essence”, declared in the presumption of each being, in isolation, “one and absolute”. Sometimes, in addition to an excess of Spirituality (or Saudade), Pascoaes lacks the world. He is a great poet, but he is a poet who takes Ampoules-of-Great-Ideas and who therefore writes often trapped by a programmatic furor, ceasing to have pores; It is not uncommon for a glass to be erected between him and reality, the same glass that made him write in O Bailado, from 1921: «Everything is a ghost. There are only clouds, clouds of voices, clouds of souls, of afflictions and tragedies! Clouds and more clouds, appearances and more appearances! And a divine lightning that pierces them, the instantaneous Apparition that appears and throws us to the ground, dazzled!»
Sometimes I felt like reminding him, as António Sérgio did, in the article “Regeneration and Tradition, Moral and Economy”, which he dedicated to Pascoaes: «Pascoais, Pascoais my dear friend: you are a pure, excellent and noble poet, but also a victim of this social environment, like us all: of this horrible isolation that you praise and I curse».
«As a child, he stole two blackbirds», says Jacinto do Prado Coelho, he stole them from a nest, and he felt remorse for that all his life. The Person, few more mischiefs are known to him. Only in Álvaro de Campos does a hint of wickedness and obscenity emerge: «Ah, and the ordinary and dirty people, who always look the same,/ Who use swear words as usual words,/ Whose sons steal from grocery store doors/ And whose daughters at the age of eight – and I think this is beautiful and I love it! –/ Decent-looking men masturbate in stairwells.” (Triumphal ode).
Both poets, driven by a certain idea of ​​sanctity, had the same inability to break the siege of their skin with the overflow of someone else's dam, the same curse of sublimating the concrete ferocity of eros with the gentleness of the verses.
Obviously, they are both “bigger than life”, but sometimes it makes me unnerved to watch, from my position as a hatter at the Procrastinators Club, the tantrums between them, just to see who occupies, in the internal organization, the position of President and Treasurer.
Although Pessoa guessed more things, for example, what he wrote in the lesser-known Ode Martial and which is reflected in the situation we live in today, in a different way, with his heart in his hands:
«MARTIAL ODE
(…)
Helahoho! helahoho!
The poor widow's sewing machine who was bayoneted...
She sewed indefinitely in the afternoon…
The table where the old people played,
Everything mixed, everything mixed with bodies, with blood,
All one river, one wave, one dragging horror.
Helahoho! helahoho!
I unearthed the child's tin train pressed into the middle of the
[road,
And I cried like all the mothers in the world about the horror of life.
My pantheistic feet tripped over the sewing machine
[widow who was killed with a bayonet
And that poor instrument of peace stuck a spear in my heart.
Yes, I was the one to blame for everything, I was the soldier for them all
Who killed, raped, burned and broke,
It was me and my shame and my remorse like a shadow
[misshapen
They travel around the world like Ashavero,
But behind my steps there are footsteps the size of infinity
And a physical fear of being accountable to God makes me close my eyes.
[eyes suddenly.

I ordered, captain, to shoot the trembling peasants,
I let the daughters of all fathers tied to trees be raped,
Now I saw that it was inside my heart that all this happened,
And everything scalds and suffocates and I can't move without it
[everything be the same.
God have mercy on me, I didn't have it from anyone!
LÀ-BAS, JE NE SAIS OÙ…”

Tokyo rules out that the invalidation of the rates will affect previously agreed investments, according to the economic newspaper Nikkei, while Taiwan and Hong Kong foresee a “limited” effect of the new global tariff. China has not yet commented.
In response to the resolution, which invalidates the so-called “reciprocal tariffs” and other generalized taxes applied by Trump, with a minimum rate of 10 percent, the President signed a global tariff of 10 percent on all countries. The law that supports this new executive order only allows tariffs to be increased by up to 15 percent and for periods of 150 days, so it is not clear how it will be articulated in the long term, writes the EFE news agency.
South Korea said the trade deal with Washington, which provides for commitments such as a $350 billion South Korean investment and 15 percent tariffs from Washington, remains intact.
According to Yonhap news agency, South Korean authorities called an emergency meeting to assess the impact of invalidating the tariffs.
The governments of Taiwan and Hong Kong consider that the 10 percent global tariff announced by Trump will have a “limited impact” on their economies. Indonesia, which on Thursday signed a trade agreement with the US, indicated that it will hold “new talks” with Washington in light of the “dynamics that are occurring”.
Malaysia assured that it “will continue to diversify its trade relations and strengthen regional and multilateral economic cooperation”, despite the decision that invalidates a large part of Trump's tariffs.</description><pubDate>2026-02-23 06:00:40</pubDate></item><item><title>Thailand | Virus kills 72 tigers in wildlife park</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/23/tailandia-virus-mata-72-tigres-em-parque-de-vida-selvagem/</link><description>Authorities in northern Thailand said 72 tigers have died in recent weeks at a wildlife park due to a viral and bacterial infection.
The tests detected the presence of the highly contagious canine distemper virus, as well as bacteria that affect the respiratory system, the Chiang Mai Provincial Livestock Department said in a statement on Friday.
"When tigers get sick, it is more difficult to detect the disease than in animals like cats or dogs. By the time we realized they were sick, it was too late," said the director of Thailand's Department of Livestock, Somchuan Ratanamungklanon, to local media.
The cats belonged to the privately owned Tiger Kingdom wildlife park. Tourists can “hug, touch and take up-close photographs with the tigers” there, according to the park's website.
“These tigers died as they lived: in suffering, captivity and fear,” animal rights organization PETA Asia told France-Presse news agency. “If tourists avoided these places, they would quickly become unviable and tragedies like this would be much less likely to occur,” the organization added.</description><pubDate>2026-02-23 05:59:50</pubDate></item><item><title>Hong Kong | Hong Kong government demands Japan protect residents after Sapporo attack</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/23/hong-kong-governo-de-hong-kong-exige-que-japao-proteja-residentes-apos-ataque-em-sapporo/</link><description>The Hong Kong government said it has demanded Tokyo protect residents of the Chinese region who visit Japan, after a resident was targeted in an attack in Sapporo. The Hong Kong executive “expressed concern” to the Japanese consul general in the territory, Jun Miura, and urged Japanese authorities to “guarantee the personal safety” of Hong Kong travelers in Japan.
In a statement released on Thursday night, the territory's authorities said they are collaborating with Beijing's diplomatic representation in Hong Kong and the Chinese consulate in Sapporo, in northern Japan.
The objective, explained the Hong Kong Government, is to “understand the situation, follow up on the case and provide practical assistance in accordance with the wishes” of the resident targeted by the attack. The Chinese consulate in Sapporo said the man was hit in the head with a beer bottle at a restaurant in the early hours of Wednesday, and that Japanese police had already detained a suspect.
China's diplomatic representation once again recommended that tourists not travel to Japan, because “the trend of attacks in Japan against Chinese citizens has been increasing”. However, Hong Kong tour operators told the South China Morning Post that the attack was likely an isolated incident that would not affect residents' interest in visiting Japan.</description><pubDate>2026-02-23 05:48:33</pubDate></item><item><title>Lunar New Year | Consumer spending to grow</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/23/ano-novo-lunar-gastos-dos-consumidores-a-crescer/</link><description>Chinese consumers welcomed the Spring Festival holiday with an explosion of spending, crowding restaurants and shopping malls and traveling across the country, which provided a boost at the beginning of the year for the consumer sector, according to Xinhua.

The spending spree mixed tradition with new habits, with online platforms reporting strong demand for smart devices.
Spending on services contributed to the boost. Domestic tourism consumption on major platforms rose 4.5 percent year on year in the first three days of the holiday, including a 26 percent jump in car rental bookings.

The German Chancellor, Friedrich Merz, will carry out a state visit to the People's Republic of China this week and until February 26th, the Government announced Friday.
Merz leaves Berlin on Tuesday and arrives in Beijing on Wednesday, being received by the Chinese Prime Minister, Li Qiang, and is also scheduled to meet the President, Xi Jinping, said a spokesperson for the German Government. The visit will take place at a time when Beijing authorities present themselves as more of a trustworthy partner for Europeans, especially in contrast to the United States.
This is the first visit to the People's Republic of China since Friedrich Merz took office as chancellor in May 2025, and takes place just a few days after the end of the Lunar New Year celebrations.
The German Government spokesperson added that discussions will focus on bilateral relations, as well as issues of economic and security policy, highlighting Berlin's desire to maintain “fair relations” with Beijing in commercial terms.
On Thursday, the German Chancellor will visit the Forbidden City, in Beijing, before a meeting with a delegation from the German automobile group Mercedes-Benz, where new vehicles are expected to be presented.
Full schedule
The official agenda includes a visit to Hangzhou, a city on the east coast of China, as well as two business trips: one to the company Unity, a robotics group, and to the German energy company Siemens Energy.
The two countries have strong commercial ties, which are currently strained due to accusations of unfair competition and protectionism directed at Beijing. Even so, Berlin and Beijing have demonstrated a willingness to overcome differences, particularly in the context of the world order imposed by the current United States Administration.
In mid-February, on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told Merz that he viewed Berlin as a “driving force” in cooperation between the EU and China.
Economically, the relationship between Berlin and Beijing has changed drastically in the last decade, with China going from the best customer of German export industries to the main competitor. The German economy is experiencing difficulties and Chinese competition is causing concern for some German companies, particularly in the automotive sector.</description><pubDate>2026-02-23 05:44:41</pubDate></item><item><title>China asks US to make 2026 a year of “peaceful coexistence”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/16/china-pede-a-eua-que-2026-seja-um-ano-de-coexistencia-pacifica/</link><description>China and the US must make 2026 a year of convergence for “mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and mutually beneficial cooperation”, said the head of Chinese diplomacy, Wang Yi, to his US counterpart, Marco Rubio.
Wang and Rubio met on Friday on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, according to a statement published Saturday on the official website of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. “Dialogue is better than confrontation, cooperation is better than conflict, and mutual gain is better than the zero-sum (mentality) in relations between China and the US,” said the Chinese foreign minister.
Wang assured that, as long as Washington and Beijing “respect the principles of equality, respect and mutual benefit”, they will be able to “find ways” to resolve tensions and manage differences “appropriately”.
“Both sides should work together to continuously expand the list of areas of cooperation and reduce the list of problems, so that China-US relations are on a stable, healthy and sustainable path of development, sending a positive message to the world,” added the head of Chinese diplomacy.
Positive signs
According to the statement, Wang and Rubio concluded that the meeting was “positive and constructive” and agreed to “facilitate high-level interactions” and “strengthen dialogue and cooperation in various areas.”
The United States Department of State has not yet released any information about the meeting, nor has Rubio done so on social media.
The meeting precedes the expected trip by North American President Donald Trump to China next April — the exact dates have not yet been confirmed — during which, according to the local press, an extension of the one-year trade truce that the Republican President sealed in October with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, could be signed, after months of confrontation over tariffs.
Furthermore, Trump recently stated that Xi will also visit the United States “later this year”, although this visit has not been officially confirmed either.
The statement makes no reference to the issues addressed by the two presidents in a phone call last week, such as Taiwan, described by Xi as the “first red line” in relations with the United States, a subject he suggested Trump address “with the utmost caution” after the latest arms sale to the self-governed island.
This Friday's meeting was the second in person between Wang and Rubio — sanctioned by China in 2020, when he was a senator from Florida, due to protests in Hong Kong and sanctions for Xinjiang —, after the meeting last July, on the sidelines of a summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).</description><pubDate>2026-02-16 01:29:31</pubDate></item><item><title>Kim Jong-un prepares to name daughter heir, writes Seoul</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/13/kim-jong-un-prepara-se-para-nomear-filha-como-herdeira-escreve-seul/</link><description>North Korean leader Kim Jong-un is preparing to name his daughter Ju-ae as successor, a deputy said after a meeting with the secret services, as he prepares for the grand power ceremony in Pyongyang this month. The Kim dynasty has ruled the country with an 'iron fist' since its founding in 1948, with Kim Jong-un succeeding his father and grandfather.
The current leader, who maintains secrecy about his descendants, increasingly appears with his teenage daughter, Kim Ju-ae, at important official events, leading us to believe that she is the favorite for the succession. “South Korea's National Intelligence Service (NIS) estimates that Kim Ju-ae is about to be named successor,” Rep. Lee Seong-kweun said yesterday after a meeting with the NIS.
The information is based, in particular, on a visit in January to the Kumsusan Sun Palace – where the founder Kim Il-sung and his son and second supreme leader, Kim Jong-il, rest -, during which Ju-ae paid homage to his ancestors alongside his father.
Love Stories
At the ruling party congress in Pyongyang at the end of the month, the Government is expected to reveal national guidelines, from foreign policy to the economy, including defense and advances in nuclear weapons.
The meeting also often serves as a platform to announce changes in the leadership of the Workers' Party of Korea. Analysts believe that Ju-ae could be appointed first secretary of the central committee, that is, number two in the PTC.
The existence of Kim Jong-un's daughter was revealed in 2022, when she watched with her father the launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile.
Official North Korean media refer to Ju-ae as the country's “beloved daughter”, or even “great guide”, qualifications normally reserved for North Korea's supreme leaders and their heirs.</description><pubDate>2026-02-13 06:15:56</pubDate></item><item><title>Public competitions | New plan to integrate AI into hiring</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/13/concursos-publicos-novo-plano-para-integrar-ia-nas-contratacoes/</link><description>Chinese authorities yesterday released a strategy to accelerate the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in public tenders, with the aim of increasing efficiency, strengthening supervision and ensuring a “fair and efficient” distribution of public resources.
The document, issued by the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC, China's main economic planning body) together with other state institutions, defines that, by the end of 2026, some provinces must fully implement features such as irregularity detection, AI-assisted evaluation and identification of collusion in tenders. The plan foresees the extension of these practices to the entire country by 2028.
Among the planned applications, the following stand out: analysis of sectoral trends, balance between supply and demand and regulatory background checks to help define technical and commercial requirements during the preparatory phase of competitions.
During the preparation of specifications, technology must allow the early detection of illegal clauses or clauses that restrict competition.
Have sense
On the competitors' side, AI will be able to support the preparation of proposals, the analysis of risks of contractual non-compliance and the verification of the documentation presented.
The plan emphasizes, however, that conclusions generated by artificial intelligence systems do not replace the independent judgment of the parties involved nor do they exempt their respective legal responsibilities. Strict compliance with registration, review and security requirements for the algorithms used is also expected, to mitigate risks such as lack of transparency, errors or biases.
The announcement comes amid the rapid expansion of the Chinese AI ecosystem, driven by the launch of advanced language models by companies such as Bytedance, DeepSeek, Alibaba and Baidu and growing political support for technological self-sufficiency.
China seeks to consolidate its own capabilities in models, data and computational infrastructure, in a scenario of growing rivalry with the United States in the field of artificial intelligence.</description><pubDate>2026-02-13 06:14:32</pubDate></item><item><title>Marcelo Loureiro, author and teacher: “The indigenato was a continuation of slavery”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/04/marcelo-loureiro-autor-e-docente-o-indigenato-foi-uma-continuacao-da-escravidao/</link><description>He was recently in Macau to present the book “Colonial Citizenship: law, race and rights through the Portuguese empire”.

How did this investigation begin and how did the themes of colonialism and citizenship emerge?
Everything was born from a personal and family experience. I grew up in Rio de Janeiro, in a family marked by the Portuguese diaspora on the one hand, and colonial silence on the other. A minha avó paterna, portuguesa, guardava no fundo de um armário os documentos que me permitiram, aos treze anos, reclamar a cidadania portuguesa. My other grandmother, mestizo, cafuza, had no papers, no stories to tell; From her to me, there was only silence. This division, between those who have the right to documents and a voice and those who are forced to be erased, was the starting point for questioning the legal construction of citizenship and nationality. Quando cheguei a Portugal para estudar Direito em Coimbra, comecei a perceber que a lei que me reconhecia como português era a mesma que historicamente negou esse reconhecimento a milhões de pessoas com base na raça, na ‘civilização’ e na cor da pele. O livro é, em parte, uma tentativa de compreender essa estrutura jurídica de inclusão e exclusão, é uma denúncia da injustiça por detrás dos direitos. It is a denunciation of citizenship as a method of exclusion.
In the context of the Portuguese empire, when did the first notions of citizenship emerge and what criteria were used?
The first formal notions of national belonging in Portugal appear in the Philippine Ordinances of 1603, which establish who should be considered 'natural' of the kingdom. It is interesting to note that the inclusion of the notion of nationality was only included in Portuguese law during the Iberian Union, during the Philippine dynasty, when Spain controlled Portugal through the Habsburgs. It was in this context that Spanish law was transposed to Portugal to separate Portuguese from Spanish. However, the practical construction of Portuguese citizenship begins much earlier, in opposition: through slavery. Since the 15th century, with papal bulls (such as Dum Diversas of 1452 and Romanus Pontifex of 1454), Portugal obtained canonical legitimacy to enslave Africans and conquer their territories. Portuguese citizenship was thus constructed, in opposition to the figure of the ‘other’ – the Moor, the black, the pagan, the ‘savage’, and finally, the ‘indigenous’.
Quais eram os critérios de diferenciação? 
The criteria were essentially civilizational and racial: being Christian and, progressively, being white or recognized as ‘civilized’ according to European standards. Conversion to Christianity functioned, at times, as a kind of 'spiritual whitening', but even converts rarely achieved full legal equality, which continued to be imposed for centuries. The law called indigenous to all those who existed outside the standard of civilization expected of citizens, which were the non-white populations of Angola, Mozambique, Guinea and Timor.
Macau will always have occupied a “privileged position” in the context of this empire. Specifically, how?
In terms of citizenship, Macau has never been subject to the Indigenous Statute, which was in force in Angola, Mozambique, Guinea and Timor. This exclusion was not accidental. The Indigenous Statute applied to populations considered 'uncivilized' according to European racial and cultural criteria, being, in practical terms, essentially black populations from continental Africa and Timor. In Macau, the Chinese population, often called ‘Macau Chins’, although not European, were treated differently. There were laws that regulated the rights and customs of the Macanese population, with a complete law coming into force in 1909 and only abolished in 1949, for example. The Portuguese presence in Macau has always been accompanied by several other factors, such as British influence through contact with Hong Kong, the progressive political presence of Beijing, Portuguese political instability and the questioning of the existence of the Portuguese empire itself internationally. This meant that Portugal was unable to impose in Macau a sovereignty as powerful as that imposed in Africa and Timor.
Were there cases of discrimination against the Chinese and Macanese communities before the 20th century?
Discrimination existed, although of a different nature than that imposed in Africa. We can even see in literature, in the works of Senna Fernandes, for example, how the existence of walls, sides and parts of Macau, sometimes even ideological, for different populations, from Chinese villages to Christian cities. The same division occurred in the world of rights, only in an indirect way, and not through the direct imposition of indigeneity and the status of second-class national. Segregation and difference occurred socially, with difficulty accessing certain careers, the lack of invitations to birthdays because they were not ‘white’. This discrimination did not take the systematic legal form of indigeneity, as stated. The Macanese occupied an intermediate position, often functioning as intermediaries between the Portuguese and Chinese. Their ‘Portugueseness’ was recognized in an ambiguous way: they were Portuguese, but of a different type.
We can mention that skin color was decisive in not placing Macau under the Indigenous Statute.
Yes, skin color was absolutely decisive. The Indigenous Statute was applied in Angola, Mozambique, Guinea and Timor, territories with populations that are mostly black or ‘non-white’ in the colonial sense. Portuguese law even created the term 'oceanic race' to identify Timorese during the imposition of indigenato so that they could bring this population racially closer to African populations. Macau, Portuguese India, Cape Verde, and, to a certain extent, São Tomé and Príncipe, were excluded from this classification. The official criteria established 'uses and customs' and 'civilization' as the parameters to identify these people, but in reality these categories only functioned as a substitute for race: they were race, but by another name.  The populations of Portuguese India and Macau, although not European, have always been spared the application of openly racist laws, despite local practices and policies imposing, most often indirectly, restrictions on the full citizenship of these populations, as I have described.
Taking into account the Indigenous Statute, what evolution can you trace in terms of the concept of Portuguese citizenship?
The Indigenous Statute, consolidated in the early 1930s, represented the maximum legal codification of racial exclusion. Indigenato was a legal form of racial segregation that created two categories of being Portuguese, namely being a Portuguese citizen (white and assimilated) and being indigenous Portuguese (the majority black). The indigenous people were legally Portuguese, but they were not citizens; they did not live with access to rights, but to restrictions, they lived, as I call it in the book, in a status of ‘negatory nationality’. Indigenous people could not vote, could not move freely, did not have the right to lawyers, were subject to forced labor, paid special taxes based on race, and could not attend the same schools or hospitals as whites. The evolution of the concept of Portuguese citizenship in this context is paradoxical: formally, everyone was ‘Portuguese’, but materially, citizenship was reserved for those who demonstrated ‘civilization’ through skin color or by proving themselves to be sufficiently assimilated despite being black. Assimilation was the only legal path to leaving indigeneity, but it required proving mastery of the Portuguese language, abandonment of African ‘uses and customs’, stable employment, ‘good moral conduct’, and military service.  Very few could.
What are the most flagrant cases of denial of rights that you can point to?
One of the most flagrant is the system of forced labor, which functioned as a continuation of slavery under another name. Indigenous people were forced to work on plantations, mines and public works, often far from their families, in inhumane conditions. Another case is spatial and social segregation: separate hospitals for whites and indigenous people, segregated neighborhoods, different schools. In Guinea, indigenous people were forced to wear necklaces with metal plates. In Mozambique they were forced to pay radio taxes if they had a device. In Timor they were required to pay taxes if they moved from one local authority to another, or when they divorced according to local customs. The archives also show cases of indigenous people who, despite having moved to Lisbon, still continued to be treated as indigenous people. All thanks to a 1955 law that imposed indigenato status on any indigenous person in any part of the Portuguese empire – which was previously only applied in indigenato colonies. This was the case of the so-called ‘Lisbon Requests’, a group of assimilation applications that I found in the Lisbon Ultramarine Archive, where indigenous people who, having emigrated to the metropolis, tried to obtain recognition as citizens.
The Indigenous Statute would be abolished years later, but the effects seem to have remained.
I absolutely agree. And I say more: indigenato was a continuation of slavery itself, a reflection that is still felt today by so many communities touched by the Portuguese empire. O Estatuto foi abolido em 1961, mas décadas de exclusão jurídica, educacional e económica não se apagam por decreto. African populations have been systematically denied access to education, property, mobility and political participation for generations. This explains, to a certain extent, the difference between the different parts of the Portuguese empire, where Brazil, Angola, Macau and India occupy completely different spectrums in relation to levels of protection and access to rights. When the Statute was abolished, a context of restriction and necessity was already consolidated where the black majority survived without formal education and without access to basic rights. The post-colonial effects are equally profound: indigenato taught generations of Africans that their culture, language and way of life were inferior, and that to formally be someone, to be recognized as fully human before the law, they had to become white, they had to resemble, as much as possible, the colonizer. Mas mesmo essa assimilação formal raramente se traduzia em protecção real: o reconhecimento legal não garantia acesso efectivo a direitos. A assimilação marca não só um período histórico, mas uma forma de ver, sentir e sobreviver à história colonial. This violence left marks that persist in Portuguese-speaking post-colonial societies and that can only be resolved when there is a process of acceptance, truth and reconstruction — something that the Portuguese State has not yet been able to do.</description><pubDate>2026-02-04 03:57:28</pubDate></item><item><title>Exhibition | Eric Fok shows “Dreaming of the Occident” in Taiwan: “In Portugal, I see traces of my city”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/15/exposicao-eric-fok-mostra-dreaming-of-the-occident-em-taiwan-em-portugal-vejo-vestigios-da-minha-cidade/</link><description>The year began with a new project by Eric Fok, who despite living in Portugal did not leave Macau and the East. “Dreaming of the Occident” is on display at the Helios gallery, in Taipei, and can be seen until January 24th. To HM, the local artist reveals that he wants to artistically explore the universe of Vendas Novas bifana, through its connection to Macau pork chop
How is the West represented in this exhibition?
I've always been fascinated by the intersection between Eastern and Western cultures, and I've explored how Macau was a territory shaped by Western missionaries and navigators who brought new sciences and ideas to the East. Regarding a previous exhibition, and during the research process, I realized how rare it was for the Chinese to travel to Europe at the time of the Discoveries. I read with enthusiasm the reports of the few who did so. There are diaries that vividly recreate the dangerous sea voyages and what life was like in ancient European cities. This allowed me to project myself into their stories, bridging the gap between past and present, between East and East. These cultural differences are not just history to me, but have become a rich source of imagination for my new work.
As an artist from Macau, how has the history of the territory, marked by exchange between East and West, shaped your way of thinking about this exhibition?
It all started with mapping Macau for the “Paraíso” series [2014 exhibition], a project that was born out of my curiosity about the city's past in a context of rapid expansion of the tourism and gaming industries. Through this dialogue with local history, I began to truly understand the city. I went from focusing on the small details of urban life to having a macro perspective of the world, highlighting Macau's significant role in global history. This includes its status as a gateway to China during the Discoveries, its contribution to the beginning of globalization, or even being a space for the spread of Catholicism to the East. [We cannot forget] the profound influence of maritime culture. All of these themes constitute an extension of my exploration of the historical and unique experience of Macau.
Can you describe in more detail the creative process for “Dreaming of the Occident”?
In addition to maps of Macau, this exhibition also presents maps of Eurasia and several Asian colonies, where I explore themes such as navigation, trade and empire. My research also extends to experimenting with materials. In addition to using paper and wood, I incorporated unconventional supports, such as ostrich eggs. These objects function as canvases to narrate stories about endemic species and the history of migration, establishing a bridge between a biological and historical side.
Does the exhibition intend to criticize the Western influence in Macau, reflect on it or simply observe it?
In my exploration of these themes I am mainly interested in the cultural dimensions of history. When Europeans first arrived in Asia, they viewed the world from a Eurocentric perspective. The term “Far East” was not just a geographical designation, but a symbol of power and a specific vision of the world. But, on the other hand, the term “Far West” represents an initial global imagination, in the sense of being a space of mutual understanding, albeit incomplete. Today, as we live in an era of a lot of information, where connectivity is instantaneous, we have lost that sense of mystery, and my work seeks to recover a little of what is the fantasy of distance.
Do you expect different readings of the exhibition or a deeper knowledge of what Macau is, in cultural and historical terms?
In the creative process, I privilege personal expression as responses to society and the world in which we live. Although exhibiting in a commercial gallery inevitably brings a market dimension to my work, my focus is always on the integrity of the work. In recent years, my desire for the public to “correctly decode” my art has changed, in the sense that, although I feel deep satisfaction when someone connects with my inner world, I have come to accept this “emptiness” in the narrative of my work. These gaps are meant to be filled by the experiences and emotions of the viewer, or perhaps by time and history itself. In a time of rapid and ephemeral changes, I use the brush to document and preserve. My work consists of sharing the urban experience that invites the public to create an emotional connection with cities, promoting a deep reflection on identity and belonging.
He has lived between Macau and Portugal. How does this influence your work and your view of Macau’s history and culture?
At the moment I respond to this interview I find myself in Vendas Novas, a town in Portugal that is famous for bifana. I am currently exploring whether there is any direct connection between this local specialty and Macau pork chop bread. Centuries ago, the Portuguese sought to build a “home” in Macau, leaving behind Portuguese structures that defined the skyline of my city. Currently, being in Portugal, I see traces of my city everywhere. Being Asian, and being surrounded by different races and languages, I find a certain sense of belonging that can be both alienating and deeply familiar. The enormous geographical distance is shortened by culture and history, which are shared. This exchange of identities and the movement between places constitute deep inspirations for my work.
Searching for an unknown place
On the Helios gallery's internet portal, Eric Fok's new exhibition is described as a search for a Europe that, on the eastern side, was known to exist, but which was far from being known, especially from the middle of the 16th century, when the term “Taixi” appeared as a reference to the “Great West”. The Chinese expression was used by the Jesuit missionary Matteo Ricci and is one of the focuses of the Macau artist's work in “Dreaming of the Occident”.
According to Helios' presentation, “Taixi” was a term attributed to “an extremely distant land in the West that was, once, a blank space on maps, yet to be explored”. In this way, Eric Fok's imagined maps explore the ideas of an absent and unknown place, also analyzing “the identity of the self, the transport of memories, power and ideology”. Using historical research, the Macau artist “rediscovers ‘Taixi’ from the perspective of the Far East, through writing and cartographic representation”. Eric Fok also investigated “the views of the world that existed in the past, formed by the interconnection between power and belief”, it is described.</description><pubDate>2026-01-15 01:53:54</pubDate></item><item><title>Iranian Ambassador in Lisbon condemned “institutionalization of the improper use of force”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/14/embaixador-do-irao-em-lisboa-condenou-institucionalizacao-do-uso-indevido-da-forca/</link><description>Iran's ambassador in Lisbon, Majid Tafreshi, condemned the “institutionalization of a new policy”, implemented with the instrument of “improper use of force”, alluding to the United States and Israel. In an interview with the Lusa agency, Tafreshi warned that this process will “spread” if countries, especially Western ones, “do not take serious measures” against the United States and Israel, “which have incited public unrest”.
“There are no guarantees that such practices will not be repeated, especially when disturbing discussions are already being heard, such as those regarding the possession of Greenland”, highlighted Tafreshi, remembering the North American actions in Venezuela, and the insinuations against Colombia and Cuba.
The interview took place before the diplomat was called by the Portuguese Government because of the violent repression of demonstrations against the Iranian Government, an announcement made yesterday by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The Iranian diplomat recalled having already asked his “academic colleagues” and diplomats to create in Portugal a new forum entitled “Dialogue between Enemies”, in the search for “universal peace and a world free from war and tension”, as well as the creation of new mechanisms – such as an East Asian Union – “could constitute a meaningful initiative”.
“I believe that politics and politicians should follow more closely the will of their own people, who, in reality, do not seem to have major conflicts between themselves – as can be clearly seen in tourism, in football stadiums, in concerts and in hundreds of other human interactions”, argued the Iranian diplomat.
Regarding recent developments in Iran, in which, he said, peaceful demonstrations focused on economic challenges, over time, “some elements present in these concentrations escalated to violent incidents”, including armed actions that, according to reports, “involved individuals with prior training”.
“Regrettably, these events resulted in casualties among security forces, public order forces and ordinary citizens,” said Tafreshi, after the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Türk, condemned and demanded an end to the “repression of protests in Iran, which have resulted in more than 600 deaths since December 28, according to a non-governmental organization.
Iran's ambassador in Lisbon referred to the “millions of Iranian citizens” who participated in public demonstrations on Monday, “reflecting a change in the general picture and expressing support for their Islamic country”, which, as in the past, the news received limited attention from the Western media.
Outside incentives
Asked about what is strangling the Iranian economy, Tafreshi highlights the interventions of Israel, “to a lesser extent”, and the United States, “which have encouraged public unrest”, as well as Iran's economic challenges, which are significantly influenced by extensive sanctions imposed” by Washington.
“These measures, which Iran considers illegal, have also been supported by European countries that defend human rights, despite there being concerns that such policies have negatively affected fundamental rights of the Iranian population, including access to healthcare”, he denounced.
“Respect for the Charter of the United Nations, the bitter lessons of the First and Second World Wars and the devastating experiences and costs of events in Afghanistan, Syria, Palestine, Lebanon, Libya, Iraq, Ukraine and elsewhere should be enough to remind us of the urgent need to prioritize, more than ever, peaceful coexistence”, he added.
Regarding the high number of fatalities, Tafreshi denied that Iranian security is using a disproportionate use of force, exemplifying, alongside the high number of deaths among civilians, the significant number of deaths and injuries among police officers”.
People power
Asked about the words of Reza Pahlavi – son of the former shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, deposed after the 1979 Islamic Revolution – in which he stated that he intends to return to Iran soon, Tafreshi considered that, with the “support of some Western and Zionist media”, he appears to be trying to play the role of a “Robin of the Woods”.
"However, Robin Hood never called on ordinary people to resort to violence or violate international norms and principles, such as attacking embassies and diplomatic facilities. During his father's reign, despite Iran having the support of the United States and the West, the country lost its 14th province, Bahrain. Based on experience, the United States supports and exploits anyone capable of harming Iran's independence and security," he responded.
Tafreshi denied, on the other hand, that the regime – “the term “regime is an illegitimate and biased expression” – is at risk, highlighting again “the millions” of Iranians who demonstrated on Monday in favor of Iran's sovereignty.
“The Islamic Republic belongs to the people of Iran. Ayatollah [Ali] Khamenei is the leader of Iran and one of those citizens”, highlighted the diplomat, for whom China and Russia maintain “good relations” with Tehran, meaning it is not necessary to count on Beijing or Moscow to defend the country, which counts on its own people to protect its security and sovereignty.</description><pubDate>2026-01-14 02:52:14</pubDate></item><item><title>Sofia Ferreira da Silva, author of a study on opera in the Mao years: “Silk Road was the biggest influence”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/07/sofia-ferreira-da-silva-autora-de-um-estudo-sobre-opera-nos-anos-de-mao-rota-da-seda-foi-a-maior-influencia/</link><description>In “Singing the Revolution: The Role of Songs and Opera in the Spread of Communism in Mao Zedong's China”, Sofia Ferreira da Silva analyzes the way in which songs and opera spread political ideals, leaving marks on the country's cultural panorama. The analysis came from the doctoral thesis in Artistic Studies, defended by the author at Universidade Nova de Lisboa
What was the musical environment like in the country before Mao Zedong came to power?
China was, and continues to be, a territory with a huge variety of practices at regional, local and ethnic levels. We can speak of four main types: music of a more erudite nature, symbolized by court music (yayue) and guqin music, more centered on Confucian ideals and with ritual functions and self-cultivation of individual morals; folk music, with vocal and instrumental genres varying according to region and ethnicity; Taoist, Buddhist and other religious music; and traditional opera, such as Kunqu and Peking, Sichuan and Canton operas, combining singing, declamation, stylized movements and martial arts. The biggest influence on Chinese music was, perhaps, the Silk Road, as a good part of the musical instruments that are now considered “Chinese”, such as the erhu, the pipa, the suona and the sanxian, have their origins in foreign instruments brought to Chinese territory, and which were gradually adapted and incorporated into their music. On the other hand, some narrative and operatic genres evolved from the adaptation and combination of counterparts from the territories crossed by this route. If it weren't for the Silk Road, traditional Chinese music would be radically different.
What other influences are there?
The other big influence is Western music. This, despite having entered the country in the 16th and 17th centuries, was felt with greater intensity from the middle of the 19th century and throughout the 20th century. The growing foreign presence and influence led to the systematic introduction of Western notation, academic training along European lines and Western classical and popular music genres, which would be assimilated in varying ways by Chinese composers, such as Ma Sicong, Li Jinhui or Xian Xinghai, combining them or not with traditional music motifs.
In the thesis, he talks about two major changes in the Mao years, with the creation of the so-called “model shows (yangbanxi)” and the revolutionary Peking operas. How did these formats help to reshape the music scene at the time?
The model shows, which include Peking operas and revolutionary songs, played an important role in reforming the Maoist musical landscape, implying changes not only in musical styles, but also in the social function of music. Production became entirely subordinated to the political project of the Chinese Communist Party (PCC), resulting in the mandatory membership of artists and designated artistic associations, and the suppression, through criticism in the media, of musical elements or genres considered “feudal”, “bourgeois” or “superstitious”. In opposition, and following successive political movements and campaigns, other formats were promoted, more in line with the regime's ideals.
How, in concrete terms?
In the case of the “yangbanxi”, from the Cultural Revolution, the fact that they were called “model” implied that all new creations must strictly follow the aesthetic precepts established through them, especially the rules of the “basic task”, with the construction of revolutionary heroic figures as the ultimate aim of artistic creation. There were also the “Three Prominences”, with the attribution of greater or lesser prominence to a certain character depending on their degree of positivity or negativity, their function in the plot. These rules guided not only the narrative structure and the role of the characters, but also aspects such as the integration between music and gestures, the construction of costumes and sets, and the harmony between traditional and Western musical elements. This codification would aim, to this extent, to guarantee the ideological and aesthetic uniformity essential to the creation of a controlled, functional and politically effective musical culture within the framework of the objectives of the revolution.
What are the main political messages conveyed through these two types of shows?
The first big idea is the almost religious loyalty to Mao Zedong and the unconditional observance of his ideas. It is his thought that inspires and guides the actions of the heroes and heroic characters, the second most important category of characters in revolutionary operas, and leads them to the successful completion of the mission assigned to them or to heroic sacrifice in favor of the communist cause. The second is the class struggle as the driving force of history. We have, on the one hand, the oppressive, capitalist, imperialist and feudal class as the villain, and on the other the working people, exploited and oppressed by the former, suffering the greatest storms at their hands. The conflicts and difficult situations faced by the heroes or other positive characters, such as the death of family members, imprisonment or slavery, were always the direct expression of this struggle, and their resolution would only come from the revolutionary stance and the assumption of an active role in the construction of socialism.
And the third idea present in the shows?
This is collectivism, as a true revolutionary places the interests of the Party and the People above any individual dream or desire. No matter how prominent his role, the hero needs popular support to complete his mission: his aspirations are the aspirations of the people, and it is in solidarity between all that difficulties are overcome and the much-desired socialist harmony is achieved. Personal achievement only has value if it serves the collective cause, and individual sacrifice is glorified when it contributes to common progress. Operas promote, to this extent, a worldview where individual identity dissolves into the identity of the revolutionary collective, and where the active participation of the masses is not only desirable, but necessary.
These were years of so-called cultural Maoism, as mentioned in the thesis. How is it characterized?
Cultural Maoism presents points of contact regarding the subordination of art to politics, the valorization of the daily lives of the masses as the raw material for creation and the defense of its widespread popularization. However, it is distinguished by its emphasis on the proletarianization of the artist himself, who should abandon his position as a distant intellectual and become an active member of the working people, learning through practice and inserting himself in their daily struggles.
What are the main influences of this movement?
In addition to the Marxist-Leninist matrix, cultural Maoism would be marked by Confucian influences, giving art an ethical and formative function, as in Confucius, Mencius or Xunzi, art shaped character. However, in the Maoist context, this molding was channeled towards the construction of socialist consciousness and the eradication of traces of the bourgeois mentality. One of the central principles of this policy was the “mass line”, a kind of circular cultural dynamic in which popular ideas and expressions were collected and systematized by the Party, before being returned to the people in a clearer and more politically oriented way. Another aspect to consider is the appreciation of native and foreign cultural heritage, condensed in the maxim “use the past to serve the present, use the foreign to serve China”.
In what way?
To create new artistic works, Mao recommended the initial study of Western works, considered “scientific” and technically superior, before selectively incorporating elements of Chinese tradition. In both cases, the value of artistic forms lay in their social and political function, not in their preservation as heritage. In this context, the PCC leader proposed two criteria for artistic evaluation: the political, which required the promotion of national unity and the rejection of ideas contrary to the Party; and the artistic, which presupposed technical and aesthetic rigor following an abstract notion of “scientific criteria of art” at the service of the masses. This double requirement replaced, in Maoism, the Confucian distinction between moral quality and aesthetic quality.
In these years, what were the biggest influences on songwriting?
The composition of songs was greatly influenced by two great musical traditions: the native, with the use of regional melodies and motifs and those of the various ethnic minorities that make up the territory; and the Western, in which I include the Soviet musical tradition, most visible in marches and so-called “art songs”, which could be understood as a type of revolutionary ‘lieder’ or with highly politicized content. The influence of each of them was more or less visible depending on the political situation of the territory.
How did the years of “cultural Maoism” change the country’s musical landscape?
Some aspects of the production of Cultural Revolution operas, such as the introduction of the Western orchestra and the use of techniques from Western music, the incorporation of more realistic scenarios and the melodramatic nature of the stories influenced and continue to influence the production of new Beijing operas, especially those with contemporary or historical themes relating to the 20th century. XX. Over the last 30 years, operas with historical themes have also been produced with some of these elements, especially in terms of music and settings, such as “Cao Cao and Yang Xiu”. Some remnants of this period can also be seen in the interpretation of traditional operas, especially in the presentation of arias or excerpts on television programs. I see countless performances that combine, just like in the revolutionary repertoire, arrangements with a Western orchestra and realistic scenarios, with extensive use of new technologies. However, what I consider to be the greatest remnant of revolutionary operas will, perhaps, be a greater artistic audacity on the part of the creators of new operas. It is an issue that deserves further study by the academy, but, from my observations as a spectator, I notice a greater openness to the incorporation of elements from other arts, such as dance and theater, and a greater complexity in the characters, especially those considered negative, less antagonistic, with more nuances when it comes to motivations for acting in a certain way. It is obvious that the psychological suffering inflicted by these operas on an entire generation of Chinese people is undeniable and cannot, under any circumstances, be forgotten; however, model operas boosted the creative impetus of composers and librettists, in line with the evolutionary process, of fusion with other arts, of Peking Opera over the centuries.</description><pubDate>2026-01-07 01:10:41</pubDate></item><item><title>Piménio Ferreira: “Anti-gypsy rhetoric has always worked in Portugal”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2021/04/26/pimenio-ferreira-a-retorica-anti-cigana-sempre-funcionou-em-portugal/</link><description>Piménio Ferreira, better known as Gitelles Ferreira, anti-racist activist, 34 years old, physical engineer, Romani national. He is a man with a provocative speech, a corrosive, gentle humor and a smile that leaves no one indifferent.
Gitelles, we live in an intercultural land and gypsies – in particular – have lived in Portugal for around five centuries. What happens so that gypsy communities continue to be “on the margins” of so-called society? 
We need to change the model of society. This is extremely stratified, placing people in subordinate positions to privilege a violent minority. The white social structure is patriarchal and racist. What is called the ‘margin’ of society is in fact an intrinsic place within it, which belongs to it. In other words, gypsy people have been included in this model of society since they discovered Europe and its kingdoms. The problem is the model of society that is maintained and the place to which they were relegated and how they were relegated: with violence, in a status of inferiority compared to white people, without the right to human dignity, to found a family, to choose their own language and religion, expropriated of any and all cultural and material rights. A place built and maintained to this day by genocidal and ethnocidal violence and persecution. In 1463, Vasco Gitano was granted an estate. In 1521, the gitanos, or gypsies, were already used as a reference for everything that is considered bad in the model of society. The “counter-example” compared to white that would stand out in a positive way. The ‘angel’ and the ‘demon’; the ‘other’, the enemy; the one against whom any attack and persecution is legitimate. Including the prohibition of defending oneself, having weapons, any type of property, and the right to stay.
And is it because they are denied this right to stay that we still have nomadic gypsy communities within the country today?
Yes, without a doubt. There are many ways to force nomadism: directly, by prohibiting permanence and expelling with police or military force; indirectly, refusing public or private housing to Roma people, because they are Roma; and also through the gentrification process.
I read the results of a survey by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, where it is said that approximately 80% of Roma respondents live below the risk of poverty threshold in their country; one in three gypsies lives in a house without running water; one in three Roma belongs to a family in which someone went to bed hungry at least once in the previous month; and 50% of Roma aged between 6 and 24 do not attend school. Why does this happen like this? 
It is the historic persecution that continues. There is no impoverishment that does not have an external cause. In this case, a political system of total expropriation is imposed on the basis of violence. As early as 1648, D João IV, the Restorer, prohibited ‘giving or renting houses to gypsies’. The same D João IV who achieved the kingdom of Portugal thanks to D. Jerónimo da Costa and his 250 Knights. The same D. Jerónimo da Costa who died defending Portugal's independence from Castile. Gypsy, like his wife and children. Among prohibitions on permanence, “that gypsies do not enter the kingdom and those who are in it leave” (D João III, 1526), ​​with expulsions, banishment to the galleys, expropriation of goods and properties, imposed with penalties of flogging, mutilation and death, systematically carried out to this day (even in 2011 the Municipal Council of Faro wanted to ban gypsies in the municipality).
The prohibition of working for others (no one employs gypsy workers, and those who do do so in complete precariousness, for poorly paid positions and without rights and dignified conditions). They are unable to remain dependent on self-employment, they are unable to invest, due to extreme expropriation. They become dependent on precariousness. If you want to know what it's like to live in pure neoliberalism, get to know the lives of gypsies. The reality of these is paradigmatic of the aggression and lack of protection that the “lords” are willing to go to, for their own benefit.
What are you talking about, is it economic and political power?
The group of political, social, cultural and economic power. The owner, the colonizer. This group has been in power since it instituted the current system of domination. And that only makes sense within the hierarchically stratified sociopolitical model in which we live. Hence the need to put an end to ‘lords’ and establish a new model of society, healthy, free, without hierarchies or strata, whether of race, class or gender.
The model in which we live leads the gypsy community (and beyond) to economic exclusion, removing them from access to the consumption of products or excluding them from their production process; political exclusion associated with lack of access to information; to education and consequently the social exclusion seen in the inequality of access to quality community areas such as restaurants, libraries, theater, cinema, concerts, healthcare, etc. How does a gypsy child feel when they realize they are not part of the whole? Children who never see themselves represented, not in films, not in books, not in cartoons, not even in an advertisement eating cereal, for example? Is this a disaster for self-esteem, is it a priori condemnation?
That's really the question. Gypsy people are not “excluded from society”, on the contrary, they are included in it. The problem is the existence of what is cynically called 'social exclusion', an Orwellian term, and people are under duress. Which concentration and extermination camp. In fact, the Nazi concentration camps are a more visual embodiment of what is called 'social exclusion' and, as here, they were not an 'excluded' part of Nazi society, but rather its fundamental and characterizing structure. It is a place of violence, where people are kept by violence, dedicated to their extermination, and designed so that few people can leave. And yet they resist. Just like in the Nazi concentration camps.
And what you listed as an example of the ‘consequence’ of this ‘exclusion’, is in fact the means by which this exclusion also happens and is maintained. Gypsy people are outside the cinemas, either as consumers or producers (but they go to the cinema). They are outside of school, education and the Academy. Either as ‘users’ or as producers (but they go to school and are at the basis of the construction of knowledge and academic and scientific debates).
Even in the attack on the gypsy child's self-confidence, we speak of a mechanism for maintaining this situation. But gypsy people respond very well: with gypsy pride. Another resistance, another aggression. Gypsy people are thus included in society. In a place that belongs to this modern model of society. And they resist and counter the power of domination and insist on being in the city, in the cinema, in the theater, in the Academy, in all spaces. With a lot of struggle and always resisting, but they are there. Social exclusion, more than a “place outside of society”, is part of its social structure.
Do you mean to say there is collective resistance?
At work, already in a context of absolute precariousness, during the pandemic, gypsy people rolled up their sleeves and once again showed proactivity and creativity in adversity. They learned by watching and doing. And here, it is again women who jump to the front line, show their face, learn to use digital tools with their daughters or sons, and launch themselves into the network. And so they explore online sales as well as app-based work (transport or couriers). In housing, in a pandemic context in which evictions were not stopped – as the law itself should and dictates – residents did not stop organizing and fighting against unfair evictions and demanding dignity in housing; residents associations allied in their action with other housing and anti-racist organizations.
It is also worth noting how they reinvented themselves and intensified to collect and distribute food items and mask/alcohol gel kits to the most expropriated people. Gypsies and non-gypsies. In the anti-racist fight, new movements emerged and their actions intensified through social media. People who had never organized or become active before began their first steps in activism, joining this path of gypsy and anti-racist organization and popular action. People forget, or don't want to appreciate, but gypsy action has helped to determine results in the political dispute. Gypsy citizens mobilized in large numbers and determined electoral results in the 2017 local councils, both in Alentejo and in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area, even causing electoral earthquakes.
And even in the Presidential elections, second place was decided by an amount equivalent to the estimated number of gypsy voters. Apart from the non-gypsy votes that were mobilized by the action of gypsy voters. Gypsy people are even co-building power in opinion spaces, in local media, on social networks and in party and institutional political disputes. And most importantly, in popular action and in alliances with other social movements. We never stopped fighting by all means and we continued to resist.
On the other hand, there is more and more hate speech, from the far right in particular. What do you have to say about that?
To begin with, these speeches are historical and European. They are neither current nor “extreme right-wing”. These speeches have been adopted and delivered for a long time, even in 'democracy and freedom', by various representatives of the center-right, conservatives, center-left, liberals, liberal left, even representatives of the PCP. Anti-gypsy rhetoric has always worked in Portugal, as it is the most white-natured rhetoric. That is, it allows the creation and recognition of “white” as the superior of all. And thus please the white electorate who, when they feel good, compensate with their vote. Even if the policies implemented by your elected officials harm you even more.
Finally, I would like you to talk a little about your personal experience and how you became an activist?
I studied, fought for my studies, made alliances, graduated, and entered the “formal precarious” job market. I started my militant action and here I am today. We can transform this society into a better one. This certainty, combined with the fact that the current one has so much suffering, makes anyone want to have a transformative attitude. I wanted to be an ‘inventor’ (physical engineer) and an anti-racist activist. And through study (not necessarily schooling) and organization with other people, in turn, with other studies, training and visions, I learned how the world works and how it can be changed. But before transforming, we need to survive.
This gives rise to two types of actions: transformative and survival. The fight against hate speech appears as survival, but its defeat will be a transformative victory. There is a lot that – as people who want a better world – we have to do, namely work to criminalize hate speech; condemn and ban organizations with racist speeches and practices; denounce the racist institutional structure and logic that organizes Power and manages community resources. And in this sense, there have been various types of actions, from petitions to demonstrations. And we need more.
In addition to being a member of the SOS RACISMO movement, I participate in the Podcast “Viemos Para Ficar”, with Mamadou Ba and Joseph da Silva. And if everything goes well, we will soon start a new project. With friendly people, we also have the “Cigana Initiative” project, dedicated to reflecting and promoting transformative movements. Essentially focused on educating against anti-gypsyism, denouncing historical and ongoing genocide and working towards a new societal project. Also with new projects in the pipeline. And finally, there are always voluntary actions, without an organization, where I try to share what I discovered about Anti-Gypsyism and Romani history in schools and with interested people. In addition, there is still the struggle for housing, because evictions did not stop during the pandemic. Due to housing and employment precariousness, racialized individuals, especially Roma nationals, are the most vulnerable to Covid-19. It is essential to have actions in this area; Of all the struggles, this is the most structural, as it goes against one of the main enemies of a healthy society: the real estate speculation of this capitalist system, which puts profit and goods above people and their humanization.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Japanese Toshikazu Yamanishi breaks world record for walking half marathon</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/16/japones-toshikazu-yamanishi-bate-recorde-mundial-da-meia-maratona-de-marcha/</link><description>Japanese Toshikazu Yamanishi today set a new world record for the half marathon walking, completing the race, which took place in Kobe, with a time of 01:20.30 hours.
Yamanishi's mark achieved today is the first to surpass the inaugural world record of 01:21.30 hours, approved by the World Athletics Council in December following the announcement that the half marathon and marathon would become the official road distances for walking events.
Thus, since January 1st of this year, the distances of 20 kilometers and 35 kilometers in walking have been replaced by the half marathon (21.1 kilometers) and marathon (42.2 kilometers)
Toshikazu Yamanishi, 30 years old, broke away from the lead group a little after 17 kilometers and ended up passing 20 kilometers with a time of 01:16.26 hours, just 16 seconds more than the world record for this distance that he himself set in 2025 on the same circuit.
With another lap added, the two-time world champion accelerated again to win by a clear margin, in 01:20.34, with the time that constitutes the new record now awaiting the usual ratification process.</description><pubDate>2026-02-16 01:43:29</pubDate></item><item><title>GP | Qualification races return to Zhuhai</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/16/gp-corridas-de-apuramento-regressam-a-zhuhai/</link><description>Before the Lunar New Year, the General Automobile Association of Macau-China (AAMC) announced the calendar for the next season of its speed competitions, Macau Roadsport Challenge and GT4, which once again serve as the qualification process for the support races of the 73rd Macau Grand Prix.
As in previous seasons, the mini-championship will be played over two double rounds. The Zhuhai International Circuit thus returns to the program, hosting these races for the first time since 2018. It will also be the absolute debut, on this route, of the models used in the Macau Roadsport Challenge, Toyota GR86 (ZN8) and Subaru BRZ (ZD8), which will compete for the first time outside the usual competitive context.
The 2026 season also features a relevant novelty: the holding of a non-championship test race at the Zhuzhou International Circuit. The permanent route in Hunan province, which last year hosted the qualifying races organized by the AAMC, will be the stage for an optional preparation race. It should be remembered that, in 2025, the association promoted a non-championship competition after the qualification was defined, then at the Lake Ruyi City International Circuit, in Pingtan.
The two scoring days will take place in the neighboring city of Zhuhai, both in May. The first is scheduled for the weekend of May 8th to 10th, while the second will take place between May 28th and 31st, 2026. The Macau Roadsport Challenge races will determine the qualifiers for the Macau Grand Prix of the same name, while the competitions reserved for GT4 vehicles will define the participants of the GT Cup – Great Bay Race.
The competition will maintain an exclusive tire supplier, continuing to rely on Pirelli, which will ensure direct and centralized sales of the compounds. During the test race, the use of tires purchased in 2025 will be permitted, but in the qualifying races it will be mandatory to use new tires purchased in 2026.
Subscriptions with significant increase
The registration fee increased significantly, from 15,000 to 55,000 yuan. This value now includes not only the two qualifying races, but also the test race, representing a substantial increase compared to previous seasons.
In return, the organization ensures the unified transport of participating vehicles and eight tire/rim sets between the Guangdong International Circuit, where a significant part of the Macau teams are based, and the Zhuzhou International Circuit, in both directions. During the preparation event, each registered competitor will also be entitled to three nights' accommodation in Zhuzhou, in a three or four star hotel.
Additionally, each competitor will benefit from support for official Pirelli tires, corresponding to an approximate value of 10,000 yuan.</description><pubDate>2026-02-16 01:39:34</pubDate></item><item><title>Superbikes | Miguel Oliveira from last to seventh in the second race in Australia</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/23/superbikes-miguel-oliveira-de-ultimo-a-setimo-na-segunda-corrida-na-australia/</link><description>Portuguese rider Miguel Oliveira (BMW) finished the second race of this opening weekend of the Superbike World Championship in seventh place, after starting from 21st and last place and from eighth place on Saturday.
In a race held under rain, Miguel Oliveira finished 32.135 seconds behind the winner, the Italian Niccolo Bulega (Ducati), who beat his compatriot Axel Bassani (Bimota) by 11.336 seconds, with the Spaniard Alvaro Bautista (Ducati) in third, at 17.790.
The Portuguese driver started at the back of the field after having mechanical problems in the last laps of the superpole race, held three hours earlier, which relegated him from the ninth place he occupied on the penultimate lap to 18th place.
The second race was marked by rain, which fell heavily and caused six falls. The driver from Cascais, who usually does well on wet tracks, was already 10th in the middle of the race.
Miguel Oliveira, who made his debut this weekend in the Superbike World Championship, after 14 years in MotoGP, still recovered to seventh place on the last lap, after overtaking Spaniard Iker Lecuona (Ducati) just a few meters from crossing the finish line.
Italian Nicollo Bulega, favorite to start this 12-round championship, completed the perfect weekend, adding victory in the main race this Sunday, the 23rd of his career, to victories in the superpole and in the first race, on Saturday. It was the Italian driver's sixth consecutive victory in Australia.
The 31-year-old Portuguese driver is eighth in the World Championship after this first of the 12 scheduled rounds, 45 behind the commander, Bulega, who has the maximum score (62) after this first round. The next race of the championship will be in Portugal, at the Autódromo Internacional do Algarve (AIA), in Portimão, on March 29th.</description><pubDate>2026-02-23 05:50:40</pubDate></item><item><title>Kart: new INHAME competition is born in Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/23/karting-nova-competicao-iame-nasce-em-macau/</link><description>It is next weekend that the Coloane Kartdrome will host the first of seven rounds of the most recent championship integrated into the IAME international family of karting competitions, the IAME Series Macau
After the MSAR established itself as a mandatory stop on the IAME Series Asia calendar and the Macau International Karting Grand Prix hosted the IAME Asia Final, the launch of the IAME Series Macau was confirmed, even before the New Lunar Year, comprising seven races to be held in Coloane. The calendar presented follows the already established AAMC Karting Championship.
According to the brief communication released on social media by IAME Asia Series, “Macau’s motorsport heritage is profound and its passion for racing is recognized worldwide”. For the IAME promoter on the Asian continent, based in Singapore, taking the competition to the Macao SAR constitutes “another decisive step in the growth of karting in Asia-Pacific, creating more routes, more opportunities and a stronger community for young talents”.
All the same
The IAME Series are karting championships organized under the aegis of the Italian IAME (Italian American Motor Engineering), one of the world's largest manufacturers of engines for the sport. The IAME Series Asia calendar will also be expanded next year: in addition to the rounds in Malaysia and Thailand, Macau will host the fourth of six races of the season, scheduled for the 23rd and 24th of May.
Regardless of country or region, all participants compete with IAME engines, under uniform technical regulations that ensure equal conditions on the track. The model prioritizes cost control and competition sustainability, placing emphasis on individual talent and sporting equity.
In addition to Macau and the Asian championship, IAME already promotes competitions in Mainland China, Japan, Malaysia, Thailand, Sri Lanka, India and the Philippines. In this context, the organization believes that “together, we continue to build an interconnected platform across the region”.
As previously announced, the IAME Asia Final, covering all categories, will return for the third consecutive year to the Macau International Karting Grand Prix program. This year's edition is scheduled to take place between December 11th and 14th.

The ninth edition of the FIA ​​GT World Cup, scheduled for the 19th to 22nd of November at the Guia Circuit, appears as the likely stage for the debut on the Asian continent of the latest competition car from the Sant’Agata Bolognese brand, in a season in which the new twin-turbo V8 engine model will mainly be in a phase of competitive consolidation in Europe and the United States of America.
Due to the limitations inherent in the production and delivery of new cars, Lamborghini Squadra Corse never seriously considered the introduction of the Temerario GT3 in the Asia-Pacific market in its launch year, despite the interest expressed by several teams, including JLOC, the formation of the Japanese Super GT championship that local driver André Couto represented. Even so, there is a clear desire on the part of Automobili Lamborghini's competition department to put its new GT3 on the track in Asia this year, precisely in the context of the Macau Grand Prix.
“I can confirm that no Temerario will be entered in the GT World Challenge Asia or other regional championships,” explained a spokesperson for the Italian brand to the Portuguese portal SportMotores.com. "However, we are working on the FIA ​​GT World Cup in Macau, a race of enormous importance for us, where we intend to be present in the best possible way. At this stage, we cannot provide any further details."
The possibility of Lamborghini competing this year in the Macao SAR race with the old Huracán GT3 is ruled out. The model faced difficulties in 2024 related to the introduction of the mandatory and controversial torque sensors. Edoardo Mortara had a particularly ungrateful weekend, seeing his third best time in Super Pole canceled for exceeding the maximum power limit, later ending up abandoning the main race when his car shut down.
Production limitations
Unlike other competition departments of major manufacturers, the Lamborghini Squadra Corse is a relatively small structure. The main limiting factor in the implementation of the Temerario GT3 this season, especially outside Europe, is related not only to the availability of units, but above all to the priority given to adequate technical support from the factory.
The United States of America, where the car will make its competition debut at the 12 Hours of Sebring in March, continues to assume a strategic role for Lamborghini, hence the brand's full-time presence in the IMSA SportsCar Championship through the Pfaff Motorsports team. For the current season, Lamborghini Squadra Corse has allocated seven examples of the Temerario GT3 to competition in Europe, divided between the GT World Challenge Europe and the DTM. The Italian manufacturer plans to field three cars in the GT World Challenge Europe and four in the DTM.
Mercedes-AMG evaluates return
A ausência da Mercedes-AMG na edição do ano passado foi um dos temas mais comentados no paddock. This decision was justified by the lack of opportunities for Asian client teams to test the complex torque sensors, at a stage in which the Stuttgart brand is going through a demanding process of transitioning its sporting activities from HWA to the new subsidiary Affalterbach Racing.
“At this stage, it is not possible to say whether a Mercedes-AMG GT3 will compete in the FIA ​​GT World Cup in Macau in 2026,” an official source from the German manufacturer, who maintains high interest in the MSAR event, told Hoje Macau. "The race is extremely appealing, both from a sporting and strategic point of view. We will carefully analyze the conditions at the appropriate time and evaluate them together with the interested teams."
It should also be noted that the Macau Grand Prix could symbolize the definitive goodbye of the current Mercedes-AMG GT3, as the star brand is already developing the next generation of its car for the category, whose debut in competition could take place in 2027.</description><pubDate>2026-02-09 03:50:25</pubDate></item><item><title>GP | The driver with the most victories in the history of the race has passed away</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/02/gp-faleceu-o-piloto-com-mais-vitorias-da-historia-da-prova/</link><description>British John Macdonald passed away last week, aged 89, after a prolonged illness. He was the most successful driver in the history of the Macau Grand Prix and the only one to triumph on the Guia Circuit in both car and motorcycle races.
The news was released on social media by his friend Eli Solomon, a historian and writer based in Singapore, who in recent years worked, together with Angus Lamont, on the production of the book “King of Macau”. The work portrays the life and career of Macdonald, who lived for decades in Hong Kong and was one of the central figures of motorsport in Southeast Asia in the 1960s and 1970s.
"It is with deep sadness that I announce the passing of John Macdonald, which occurred on Sunday, January 25th, at the age of 89, after a prolonged illness. His mind remained as clear as ever, and he and Angus Lamont continued to work on King of Macau until the end of last year", wrote Eli Solomon, adding that "the final text was presented to him for approval at the end of last year, with the book expected to be ready for distribution this quarter, possibly in time for the deliveries in the UK for the Goodwood Members’ Meeting in April”.
John Macdonald remains the only competitor to have won all the main races held on the Guia Circuit: four victories in the Macau Grand Prix (1965, 1972, 1973 and 1975), the triumph in the 1969 Macau Motorcycle Grand Prix and victory in the inaugural edition of the Macau Guia Race in 1972. However, his passion for motor sport was not limited to racing in circuit. After starting out on motorcycles in the United Kingdom, he participated in the 1962 Central African Rally, driving a Lancia B20, and in 1963 in the Scottish International Rally, in a Land Rover. That same year he moved to Hong Kong, where he joined the local police. Throughout his career he won three international rallies, two in Hong Kong and one in the Philippines, the country where he became National Champion in 1974.
During his stay in Hong Kong, he was the owner of Camlex Garage, in Kowloon, after leaving Hutchinson, where he held the position of Group Service Director of Far East Motors, at the end of 1967. After retiring from business activity, he sold Camlex Garage, in 1981, to German Motors, owned by businessman and also pilot Herbert Adamczyk.
Eternalized with the wax statue in the Macau Grand Prix Museum, Macdonald was also associated with the famous phrase: “Motor sport is the only truly exciting sport that can be practiced sitting down”.
Sum of successes in Macau
His debut at the Macau Grand Prix took place in 1964, with a sixth place at the wheel of a Lotus Elan, in what was his first experience in speed racing in cars. The following year he returned with a Lotus 18, a formula purchased for 7,000 patacas from the renowned Team Harper, and his performance at the wheel of an already aged single-seater was widely praised. After a race marked by incidents and some confusion, he took the checkered flag in first place and achieved the first of his six victories on the Guia Circuit.
With the introduction of the Macau Motorcycle Grand Prix into the program in 1967, Macdonald could not resist taking part, also benefiting from the experience gained in the two-wheeled races he had competed in the United Kingdom at the end of the 1950s. In that debut year, marked by Japanese dominance, he did not stand out, but went on to win the race in 1969.
His second victory at the Macau Grand Prix came in 1972, driving a Brabham BT36 ex-Graham Hill, after an absolutely dominating performance, crossing the finish line with a 30-second advantage over second place. On the same weekend he also won the first edition of the Macau Guia Race, in an Austin Mini Cooper S, a replica of which is now on display at the Macau Grand Prix Museum.
With sponsorship and equipment to match his talent, he returned in 1973 to defend the Macau Grand Prix title, this time in a Brabham BT40, with which he had won in the Philippines and at the Malaysian city circuit of Penang, in addition to achieving third place in Singapore. After taking pole position, he became the first driver to win the race three times, also setting a new lap record.
His fourth and final victory at the Macau Grand Prix came in 1975, nine years before the race adopted Formula 3 regulations, at the wheel of a Ralt RT1. Faced with the strongest opposition yet, Macdonald prevailed again, recording his final triumph in the competition. His last participation in the Macau Grand Prix occurred in 1976. His farewell to Grand Prix racing as a driver took place in May 1977, at the Penang Grand Prix, although in that same year he continued to be linked to Macau as a sponsor, giving his Ralt RT1 to Vern Schuppan. He left Hong Kong in 1983 and moved with his wife to Andorra. His last years of life were spent in Mauritius.</description><pubDate /></item></channel></rss>
